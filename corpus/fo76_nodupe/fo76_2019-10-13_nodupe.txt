Thing is to make that amount of bullets per day i need 4000 aprox steel . Then i sell bullets i make for .8 caps each. 
---

---
So for 30k bullets i just spend 4k caps aprox on steel. Selling it for .8 per bullets nets me 24 k caps. Leaving me with 20k caps mark up every time and saves me the farming time of steel
---
---
---
Could revamp one of the fair ground areas so many stalls not used for much would be pretty good place to use as location for the idea of central area for players vendors just a thought for location I see so many for top the world but Tyler county fair grounds I think could work very well and of corse even Camden park. But Tyler county fair grounds has tons of stalls and maybe just little work could be turned into a amazing spot for this.
---
if I could make a suggestion.  drop down either per\end\cha\int and get some more agility.  good hunting
---
I hope it will do alright, I just need to get a Nuclear Key Card And Then Get Through Silo Bravo, I chose it Because i just Discovered It, Im on Xbox By the way
---
Oh that‚Äôs interesting. Well what do they think of it? The whole theme of china vs America and the nukes etc
---
&gt; . I have spent about $200 in real money in the atom shop and have no regrets.
---
Ow. That's a lot of money.
---
&gt; Ok, well maybe the glass windowed camper thing
---
Would it annoy you to say I got the for free?
---
&gt; every time I try to place something inside it ends up on the roof!

There are well known workarounds for that
---
I love taking screenshots, record all my sessions with shadowplay, then chop out a screenshot every 60sec of the games.

---
Even if they gave us a small area the size of WS where endgame players could duke it out with no restrictions, it would be pretty cool
---
&gt; It's better now but at launch it deserved all of the bad talk it got.
---
It deserved some bad talk.  It didn't deserve the lies.
---
The mutations last forever. If you mean different mutations then you can have all of them toy if you like. I run about 6 or so all the time.
---
I have an explosive one, good against scorchbeasts and assaultrons at least
---
It wasn't "fine" from the start, (it still isn't "fine"), but for many people it was playable since the start.
---
But some of the online criticisms are legitimate. The harshest critics are people who actually play the game. The front page is usually full of people requesting even basic features (why can't we cook with purified water?) or bug reports. What do we get instead? Atom shop items. Hell, everytime the new inside the vault gets posted, someone posts a huge list of all the bugs.
---
The experience shouldn't "outweigh" the bugs; there shouldn't be terrible bugs in the first place. You can only handle enough disappearing power armor parts or disappearing 3* enemies or building a camp just to have it say "can't build, needs support" for the last piece after dumping all your resources, to be thrown out of the experience. Also don't forget about claiming and building a workshop just to have the server crash.
---
Sure, a lot of the hate is undeserved bandwagon. But to say the critics are "full of crap" when there's legitimate reasons as to why the game isn't amazing is just ignorance. Don't get me wrong, I do like the game and I'm glad Bethesda is sticking with it, but it's far from perfect.
---
Seems like you'd have to run around to multiple vendors to find that much steel.  I just run down to Watoga and beat the crap out of all the robots.
---
I didn't want to dox them. If the builder contacts me, I'll edit their name in for credit.
---
I was about to say the same thing. My zealot handmade with prime auto receiver actually does more damage to scorched and SBQ than my AAE Handmade. Granted SBQ is all that weapon is good for, at least you get like 144 ultracite ammo per craft compared to just the 32 or so regular 556 gives you. So you don't have to use up as much ammo. 
---
If there were any prime mutant slayers or prime ghoul slayers along with a ghoul or mutant kind of boss as tough as SBQ I'd consider using those weapons. For now I'd just keep them if their 2nd and 3rd effects are worth; even then I'd probably use them just to screw around.
---
Exactly. Left and right on dpad for single increments, right and left on the joystick for single increments at speed, and bumpers for increments of five or ten.
---
Sorry this happened. Idk. But if you are on Xbox I can give you some free stuff.
---
I know this is a few months old, but I'm seeing that Legendary Armor effects work for the Berserker build. (I run broken lifesaver armor which has saved me a few times) Couple that with Revenant and you're good to go.
---
Thats a tax that goes to the well being of the scorched and ghoul community you bigot
---
I mean the game can be good but those YouTube videos had and still have a good reason to exist. The game runs REALLY bad on console and is still very buggy, there are still huge flaws in the fundamental design of the game, and I agree the art design is good but most of the time the actual graphics kinda look like hot dookie. (at least on PS4) I say this because I love the idea of the game and if everybody just let Bethesda get away with stuff like this they'd just do it again.
---
No you‚Äôre all sheep paying for a game that if it were an animal would have been put out if it‚Äôs misery a long time ago
---
Excellent. Fuck Bethesda Im tired of trying to go all in sequential order just to be randomly disconnected multiple times. I probably did it like 5 times
---
Your cake day was yesterday, you missed it sorry
---
Dumbfuck, I payed for this game one time, when it was released, and I've gotten far more than my money back in enjoyment, and there's plenty more to come. You're a moron downing a game for no fucking reason. Why the fuck are you even on this sub?
---
Same question, bro.
---
Ash heap is no place for a level 10. You were being killed by either mole miners or mutants.
---
I been always posting here on reddit that i buy steel and did have trouble findind from time to time. One day one guy offered me 25 k and still one of my characters is round 1000 punds over encumbered. I started making 5.56 sense is less steel intensive
---
Break your legendary armor, and it'll provide zero DR and you'll still have the legendary benefits.
---
F
---
different rebuttal chief
---
If they increased the damage bonus of slayer weapons to be stronger vs their enemy types than the general AA and TS weapons, I'd use them more often. I often go to only super mutant locations to farm legendaries or steel (and they give good XP), so I'd use a slayer weapon for that if it were any good. Especially if a troubleshooters weapon did more damage vs robots than an AA or TS. Fuck lvl 52 Gutsys

can I have your scrap?

Yea, I didn't intend for this to happen but he got salty when I killed him yesterday in pvp
---
nice
---
I've had random stuff disappear as well but that was back in Feb/Mar timeframe. I started to keep a list on my computer of stuff I had on my mule but that was just too much work. Like you said, they won't restore lost items anyway so what's the point.
---
So you lost everything an didnt open a ticket?
---
I'm sure there are some pvp groups on PS4.  before survival was a thing they used to have fight nights and such
---
Cool minigun though
---
i got more than my moneys worth out of this game.  duped and sold every item in the game during the first few weeks to a month.  overall made the average snowlfakes salary from this turd of a game.
---
and i'm still here to trigger morons like you and to monitor if there's a market to come back and sell the remaining best items and caps that i never got around to unloading.  go get some soy, retreat to your safe space, and play this turd of a game. it'll make you feel better snowflake.
---
Thanks m8
---
Wait you can place junk items in your camp now?? How??
---
I'm on PC but thank you for the offer, I don't need any free stuff though.
---
I'm talking about before the 110 damage cap.
---
4 was meh. Maybe he's losing it
---
How? Hundreds of slaves or 1 kid? Easy for me.
---
Did you mean ghetto?not a gn, just not sure if I wooshed.
---
Hahahahahahaha wow you check nearly every box in Internet Moron Bingo. And you are a cheating scammer piece of trash. I'm sure Bethesda will love to hear all about how your account should be banned.
---
Sorry, buttnugget, you didn't raise even a single hackle of my ire. You're too fucking stupid. Buhbye now.
---
If you paid 6300 caps for the X-01 Jet Pack from a vendor inside the Whitespring Bunker, that means you purchased the *plan* for the X-01 Jet Pack, not the mod item. You'll need to use the plan to learn it, then gather the materials required to craft the jet pack onto your torso.
---
The *mod item* (which is single-use, and doesn't require materials to craft) can *very rarely* be found for sale from the vendor in the "Armory" section further inside the Whitespring Bunker, but costs much less than 6300 caps.
---
Nope didn't bother wasting my time. The last time I sent a ticket was asking a question about a quest and got a auto-response that had nothing to do with my question. Plus they won't restore anything, plus I had all my currencies, so it's just strange altogether.
---
It's beautiful, too bad it doesn't glow or something so other players can see how special it is.
---
Thank you so much for that info. Seems odd that mirelurk hunter and king are tied to rank 2, considering they're higher level than the deathclaw.
---
With animal friend rank 3 equipped, I have found 2 attack dogs in the mire region and a few of everything except a regular mirelurk in both the mire and the cranberry bog, but mega sloths were by far the most common find for me there, followed by deathclaws (makes sense with your info). I rarely find low levels in those regions, but overall tamable spawns there occurred often for me. However, the forest region seemed to rarely spawn any tamables at all. Do the quests play into that? In the forest, I've only seen level 1-10 spawns (including the radtoad). Are some of those scene events region specific, like the Wavy Willard and general steakhouse bots, or level restricted? Would that affect the percentage chance of a tamable spawn? And if so, would the chance for a tamable creature to spawn at all (any lvl) be affected by what rank is equipped? I'm thinking 'equipping rank 1 animal friend in the mire might decrease the chance for any tamable to spawn there'.
---
And I guess I'll also ask you to answer the age old question of 'do tamed pets respawn?' Or did they ever?
---
Thanks so much for putting effort into figuring out this system!
---
If you don‚Äôt want to get clapped in PvP - don‚Äôt run bloodied.
---
In PVE it is still the meta, but Junkies also takes it‚Äôs half of the pie.
---
Now that would be cool, have each town have its own special questline that in the end allows you to get a home there
---
that hood is everything I wish my wrapped cap could be.
---
Post some proof an you never know until you try. They have restored stuff for people. Why should they help you if you wont help yourself?
---
Hilariously, assholes like this moron don't understand why there's so much toxicity around gaming, when they literally are the root cause.
---
I‚Äôll be nuking the Queen a couple times later tonight
---
I found the biggest challenge was staying under weight in excavator.
---
A lot of hate came from external stuff, like the canvas bags, dupers and atom shop prices...
---
I thought it was yellow. Then again  I don't remember if the first one you get is different.
---
Anything in your character's inventory should be taggable....
---
All killed by the same player?
---
What's your gt. I'll fight the sbq alongside you soldier!
---
But how would super duper work with that
---
they were probably streaming their Xbox to their PC.
---
You can run around in excavator PA and instigating melee and be fine, even if you‚Äôre not specced for it and do well with 90% of content. Lots of energy weapons hits, SBQ, and mirelurk queens with lots of adds are the only real challenge.
---
This made me think that Bethesda had a great opportunity for Wastelanders although I doubt they used it. Hear me out:
---
76 is set way before the other games, and our players are the first out of their vaults, at least in this area. We are essentially the ground breakers of nuclear West Virginia. So wouldn't it make sense lore wise that our characters would be the ones to start settlements? 
---
Bethesda could have taken data on where large groups of players placed their camps since launch and used that as settlement sites. Not just where one camp was placed over and over. Instead where large numbers of players congregated . For example, the lawn of Whitesprings, around Top of the World, the bridge by the overseer's camp, etc. I actually dont know many more places that are universally used by multiple players as high traffic trade sites. But that doesn't mean Bethesda couldnt have recorded the data. 
---
Now I know many people would be mad that the high traffic areas would be lost to building but sections of the map are going to be lost regardless. I think this would have been a good lore move and really neat. Neat based on the fact that our game activity would shape the future of the game we enjoy.
---
I don't have any proof. I don't know what I'd post mate. I don't keep pictures or anything of all my gear. Guess I should now? lol
---
Tbh it is shit op
---
Last night tried to do my first queen on my melee character. She landed for a total of  about 45 seconds. I was in a group with 2 other people. And 2 more showed up but they were under lvl 50. Good times.
---
On Xbox its ‚ÄúMasterGalaxyXx‚Äù
---
Yeah this actually makes a lot of sense, it's sort of ridiculous that other factions are starting settlements but that we, the vault dwellers, still live in camps, seperated. We come from the same place and it's like we don't even know each other.
---
There's something with the lighting in the Ash Heap that always makes for proper thematic snaps, a lot of the best ones I've seen have been from there.
---
My discord username is alpharaz, add me. I'm with you on fallout 76 right now. The guy in the excavator armor!
---
Dying instantly feels like getting one shot. Doesnt matter if its actually one shot or not. People with high rof weapons kill so fast that to everyone else it seems like one shot, because of latency. 
---
This latency makes it impossible to fight back, they will kill you on the server side of things before it even tells you they are contesting, you just die instantly with no chance of even hitting them. 
---
Workshop mechanics are not fun. If you wanna PvP then great, lets engage in battle simultaneously or give a countdown or something. But being shot in the back with zero time to react is really not balanced, the mechanic is heavily favoring the contestor and it makes it feel like a griefing experience. They have a very unfair advantage at the start, and it feels terrible to get ganked by some dude who doesnt even want the workshop, they just wanna abuse game mechanics to "one shot" you in the back.
---
Thats why all these people complain about workshops, I always see groups of people saying its fine how it is, but the sheer number of people complaining about it is an indication of how much it feels like griefing. 
---
If you leave any unfair advantages in a game, people will abuse it, then those same people will claim its balanced and not a problem.

Who uses energy weapons? Lol
---
I‚Äôve only had usual trade bug issues.
---
That is why I am mentioning this. I have no idea why I would be missing anything either, but I am. Specifically emotes for the emote wheel and leather armor crafting  mods and a couple cooking plans I usually use. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
 Indeed, A Bethesda game. ;) I have been playing video games since Doom came out, and really these days, things are pretty good.
---
I don't see why Bethesda would undo and change major existing aspects of the game for Wastelanders. I think they will add new content without doing radical changes like killing all enemies in Whitesprings or making a new town at the Overseer's camp. There are plenty of unused and underused places in Appalachia to use for the new content.
---
 I have no idea what those mean. I am lucky to have an Instigating Lever Action and its accurate way out there. I only use short scopes because that's all you need. ;)  Headshots from Sneak with an Instigating anything is gonna be impressive.
---
if you dont use energy weapons there is no downside..
---
if you use energy weapons.. lol
---
Farm a place that isn‚Äôt a challenge and move to another place that also isn‚Äôt challenging. In lower levels I spent a lot of time at the prison, lumber mill to the NW and Morgantown.  Once you have materials, craft all your own gear and make new ones when they break.
---
Yep, its happened a few different times in different matches. Though each match its just one player, one shot each with somehow perfect aim from a great distance. I mean even if they were 100 feet away hitting 4 people running around with one shot each would take a damn good shot
---
Ultracite Gatlin laser melts everything
---
I believe that their logic is that they come from other vaults that are opening later than ours. I have 2 problems with that.
---
1. We have explored all over the map given to us. If they implement a few random vaults, wouldn't we have at least known the location? Even if they were sealed. 
---
2. New dwellers wouldn't know to not trust the world. Most likely they would flock to areas that have many camps (ours) or mini settlements created by us. Thus becoming the major settlements.
---
It's way bigger than that though. Werner was one of the raiders and is clearly in it for himself, and Ashur clearly has plans for the city but his methods suffer from the means to an end dilemma. His wife is the only one with the knowledge and tech to create a cure from the baby. 
---
It's less about the baby vs the slaves, and more about will the slaves survive on their own against the trogs and the accompanying disease, or are the raiders better suited out of the two to control the area? And Ashur is written in a way that it's believable he wants to get past the current situation, but right now it's the only way. Every great civilisation has been built on the backs of slaves, after all.

A mix of bloodied weapons and unyielding armour, along with high rads and all related perks, and you can one shot anything, especially with melee as your strength will go up around 30+ and a bloodied Tamborine will do 400+ per hit lol
---
crossbow/thrown weapons
---
So do I.
---
Gatling guns are great -- each bullet is deadly and the fire rate is low. Plus, 5 mm ammo is easy to find/make.
---
F my guys
---
What level r u?
---
This has been bothering me throughout the fallout series lol
---
Also god help you if someone buys something while you‚Äôre on a loading screen, then the only clue you get is the faint ending of the caps jingle sound effect
---
What system?
---
hmmm maybe. I loved melee/throwing weapons in NV, but they never felt quite right for me in fo4/76.
---
Sense post does not yours make.
---
Best make I will post from your the.
---
As range, you don't really need any damage resist perks. Just make due with the best armor you can get.
---
Xbox OneX
---
I guess it wouldn't work if you chose to do the "cook all" option. You would probably have to continue to do a single item at a time. But it would be nice to at least have the option to choose
---
FT cost is so negligible that even server hopping and checking every stocked player vendor 3 times will be *maybe* 35% of the vendor cap limit.  There really isn‚Äôt the need in normal game play to run around the map that way. 
---
If you‚Äôre FT is to events, quests, or to places with humanoid type enemies they usually drop enough caps to cover the trip.
---
Tanagra town has around 5 crickets about 50 acid per server hop
---
Not for legendary effects but basic mods yes
---
Aside from the power armor bug, nothing at launch bothered me enough to feel that it detracted from the game.  Let's not act like anybody saying it had a horrible release isn't just being a melodramatic baby.
---
I understand my post would have been a bit confusing but there was no need to mock me for that
---
please be aware that you can pop pvp with those.  I don't want to see this turn sour for you.
---
You ever use the ultracite gatling laser? That thing deals crazy damage.
---
Put all your points in Strength, use all three Slugger perk cards and wield a super sledge like a mofo. Wear power armor for defense.
---
Hmm, I thought the game is uncapped now. I mostly run with 100ish fps according to Nvidia.
---
What level are you?
---
13-15 idk
---
What do you mean? Mine has a lamp.
---
What they said.
---
Duuuuude... stock up on scrip and blow it ALL on 3\* ranged once the 50% sale hits (assuming it does)
---
I've gotten 2 Fixers out of maybe 20 purchases since it was added to the purveyor, and both are SOLID... furious explosive (not sure about the third) and AA with faster reload and fire rate. The latter is just bonkers when in stealth!
---
My apologies. Kinda hard to understand what you're really after here.
---
Which bit of scrap are you having a hard time getting to make bullets?
---
&gt; The harshest critics are people who actually play the game.¬†
---
You know that's bullshit.
---
True that.
---
I would like a quest line to earn a business license and the vendor plans, with graduated steps to earn the ability to get a stall into said market.
---
But otherwise, I think its a fantastic plan.  In the WhiteSprings unenterable area or beneath Top of the World in a Vendor Vault.
---
Then good news! He stated many of the reasons in the post you quoted from.  Just gotta get beyond the second sentence.
---
I would love this.  I'd buy a 1,000 worth of atoms if necessary LOL.  I'm tired of returning to my CAMP after wandering the wastes for an hour or so to find some broken front yard stuff and all 7 of my missile turrets broken. Those things aren't cheap to repair.  
---
Pretty annoying to know that a simple notification could've tipped me off to return home and wreck those froggin' mole miners that occasionally stop by to borrow sugar.
---
I am on my eight build and I disagree. Collecting all sorts of ammo and using multiple weapons is a good strategy to level up. I literally leveled with a furious level 5 pipe pistol and next to my level pipe revolver.
---
I‚Äôve reworded it,
---
 basically what handmade effects are desirable right now, a good automatic secondary gun that is not a handmade (I.e lever action if it can be automatic, pipe rifle)
---
What armor is best to use for a commando sneak build (armor type and legendary effects)
---
And chems / alcohol if I should use any
---
Well that's shitty.
---
what the hell is ws
---
I really like that idea very cool very smart do u mind if i add that to main post as an edit?
---
U sir ckearly dont sell bullets
---
Nuclear Winter is an Afterthought for PvP Battle Royale players.
---
This game is trying to be everything for everyone.  I like the game being about vending.  Its about whatever you want it to be about ..... It's open World RPG.
---
Cant you mod atom shop items with casual lining mods?
---
50 cal partly cuz it doesnt have to spin and doesnt have thaT glitch where it spins and wont fire
---
PC or console?
---
Handmade effects would be bloodied, Instigating, possibly Junkie's (I see heavy weapons more sought after with Junkie's tho), and Anti-armor. Secondary would be explosive or faster fire rate, with faster fire rate slightly in the lead in terms of dps. 
---
A non automatic handmade would be an assault rifle or a combat rifle. I used assault rifles before I got my handmade. 
---
Armor for the build would be Unyeilding if a bloodied build, as that raises dex to high 20s and you will not need the sneak perk at all ( I have a 26 agility and I can be right up to most creatures and they won't see me). Chameleon and Weightless are good ones. I felt like type of armor doesn't matter too much, but a wooden armor set with shrouded and then harder to detect legendary effect would be even better. I personally use trapper armor, with 2 mismatches till I get them, but I use it for the higher natural rad resist to help keep radiation levels stable.
---
Oh, and chems anything that helps boost damage. So you got a range of them to choose from
---
That‚Äôs a rough period, I remember. 
---
I suggest going melee for now. No ammo to worry about and weapons are cheap to repair. 
---
Put points into strength, endurance, and intelligence. This will help you early on till your toon matures. Then you can focus on the type of build you want to pursue.
---
Xbox, it just started happening like 2 weeks ago

I have 2 to 3 friends who always loved the Fallout franchise, but for the life of me I can't get them to try it. Sadly I know they would love it if they gave it a shot D;

Good idea but id rather they just fix turrets to begin with. Iv watched a few times while my turrets literally do nothing as a super mutant walks up to them. Even the rocket turrets are slow to react.

They‚Äôre cool pieces to display, but unfortunately look too tiny in one of the museum sized display cases.

I have only seen them at Level 35 before and not legendary.
---
^ Greatest Idea Ever. ^
---
Hey, it's my pleasure!  I'm glad you asked, because I never noticed the perk rank thing until looked back into it.
---
&gt;the forest region seemed to rarely spawn any tamables at all. Do the quests play into that?
---
I'm not sure, but maybe equipping a lower rank Animal Friend in lower level regions would help. I need to do more testing in lower level regions. I'm suspecting that if you're running rank 3, the game is trying to roll for higher-rank creatures, but they're being blocked by some kind of region lock that I haven't been able to find.
---
&gt;Are some of those scene events region specific, like the Wavy Willard and general steakhouse bots, or level restricted? 
---
Some random encounters, like Trick-or-Treaters and Civil War Reenactors, do have region-based conditions. Others, like the The bots you mentioned and the Fujiniya Intelligence Base scientist corpse, have to be within a certain radius of proximity to a location.
---
&gt;Would that affect the percentage chance of a tamable spawn?
---
You're right, it looks like 11 of the Scene encounters do have region or radius conditions, so tamables would be slightly more likely to spawn where none of those conditions apply. It would be something like 8% instead of 6%.
---
&gt;And if so, would the chance for a tamable creature to spawn at all (any lvl) be affected by what rank is equipped? I'm thinking 'equipping rank 1 animal friend in the mire might decrease the chance for any tamable to spawn there'.
---
The spawns appear to be affected by perk rank regardless, and the spawn rate actually seemed to be **more** frequent in Cranberry Bog with rank 1 equipped.   My sample size wasn't large enough to say for sure. It may have just been good luck.
---
&gt;Do tamed pets respawn?' Or did they ever?
---
I've tamed around 15 creatures, and not a single one has ever respawned.  Rumors say they have a limited number of lives, but that hasn't been my experience.
---
I totally read that in his voice...lol
---
Yes we have a lot of space, I was mostly just wondering because of those cabins, they seem ideal for having an instanced player house. But if enemies are barred from entering this could still happen I suppose
---
Yes, there are many players on Xbox who hoard way more things than they could possibly ever need, I could spit names but I‚Äôm not trying to get in trouble üòÇ
---
Thanks much appreciated
---
I fucked it up though. I meant to type "outside it's natural habitat". Gotta fix that it seems. Otherwise, it's both naturally meant to be there AND an invasive species.
---
That‚Äôs tough man. Wish you luck and hopefully the devs will find out the issue. The other guy get his stuff/characters back?
---
I think so, the last update in his post was a message from the ‚Äúescalations team‚Äù saying that they would fix everything. So they DO have the capability, at least in some instances. I was furious earlier, now I‚Äôm just grieving.
---
Heck yeah!
---
Are your atomic shop items still in your fallout 76 account?
---
The players on xbox hurt my soul. It seems like so many peoples sole intention is to just get other players to quit playing the game. Making it as hard as possible for others. Ive resorted to paying high levels just for protection. Helpful generous people are few and far between.
---
so far ive only encountered very toxic and rude players or people who think they are better than everyone else and want you to give them specific things or else they will keep hunting you down until you log off completely
---
When? During the 190 damage cap? If you were unable to kill full assassin's sentinel players with a The Dragon when damage was uncapped, then I don't know what to tell you. Maybe it splits the critical damage between all four shots and some shots missed. I was able to kill them with a black powder pistol, +.85 critical multiplier, and a headshot which does effect criticals. There is no way to go back in time to prove each other wrong, so no point in trying to argue further.
---
I have my 3* Furious Fixer, plus 3* explosive two shot hunting rifle and shotgun.  I run stealth with Vanguard armor with stabilized arms.  Bloody mess, long shot, sneak, covert operative, lone wanderer, tank killer, and demolition expert perks at all times
---
Same to all of the above
---
‚ÄòCuz I rarely spend my Atoms.    Pains me to do so.   Get your point though.

---
You can find 3-4 crickets outside of lucky hole mine, And that means they also spawned inside too.
---
Can probably get like 80 acid from one run and like 300+ Lead ore, even better you can leave and join a new server and farm everything all over again.
---
If you leave and you dont have crickets outside it's either A. Someone cleared the cave already, Or two something else like ants or mole rats spawned so there wont be crickets at all.
---
Some unique Legendaries from quests can be upgraded to a higher lvl versio
---
I have no way to tell, without starting a completely new character. I can‚Äôt access the atomic shop at all, it won‚Äôt appear on the menu. The atoms I had are displayed in the lower right corner of the main menu and the number is correct
---
I would say nah, it always seemed like, or was just for show. The only enemies it was even effective on was rad roaches and mirelurk spawn. People use it as a way to initiate PVP as well, keep that in mind. All the passive damage mutations really aren't worth it.
---
Spotlights help them focus faster, but they dont work all the time. Sometimes you need to disconnected the wire an reconnect upon entering new servers.
---
It's still not acceptable.
---
How do you upgrade the level of a weapon?
---
Spend a day at lucky hole mine. If crickets spawn outside it means there will be a shit ton of them inside too.
---
And rinse and repeat the process by joining a new server.
---
If crickets dont spawn outside, quit and join a new server until they do, Unless you need the lead ore too.
---
You don't even need the rug glitch, just build the object, blueprint it, store it and then use your blueprint to place it where you want it to go. Shouldn't have to be this way, but it works :-)
---

---
Visual representation of mutations would be amazing and having more different stages of enemies would be super cool as well. Hope this makes it into the game!
---
That‚Äôs why I stopped playing ages ago.  It was work, not fun.
---
Casual is the key word, I use Brotherhood of Steel. I just don't want to loose 2 Endurance &amp; Strenght points, it's almost like a Vodka buff, and I use a lot of Vodka.
---
Also unless they fixed it recently protective/shielded lining for casual is unobtainable since launch. But yeah at least you can add some specials to it.
---
Dang. That sucks.  I haven‚Äôt had that problem in a long while. Been running really smooth for me. I probably just caused it to happen soon. Damn you Bethseda.
---
Please Do.
---
Sounds like rifle.
---
Stealth commando can use the same build, too, so you can just swap cards when you want more variety.
---
Well I only have one BE handmade so why would I try to sell it. If anything I would try and trade up not down. If you offered the right item, I could let it go but not for something less superior. So I wouldn't say we are hording but just not gonna let stuff go for caps.
---
I did dont think i said it as well as u but think i got the idea down...thanks again and reallly great idea
---
hmmm, didn't think of that. being able to swap between them would be nice. Thanks.
---
Unyeilding x5.
---
That's really dumb. Why would you need protection? Players literally cannot hurt you unless you attack them back.
---
No the game was filled with game breaking bugs and glitches. You can be a fan and still call Bethesda on their shit. It‚Äôs ok for you to turn a blind eye if you want but the rest of us living in reality know that how the game launched was unacceptable. Has it gotten better? Fuck yes it has but that doesn‚Äôt magically make its release acceptable.
---
I decided to look this up I haven't been able to find anything on it.
---
Massive derp on my behalf! Thanks for correcting that. 
---
I personally use energy weapons myself. At level 260, I've run through most of the ballistic options to be had, so far. I use a Vampire's explosive laser rifle, AA FFR plasma rifle with the flamer barrel, snd a TS FFR laser. The explosive laser is massively OP, so losing 12% on that doesn't make much of a difference. The regular lasers do leave just a tad to be desired on the damage front. But the TS FFR makes up for it. 
---
I would say if you did a fair amount of PVP, at the point the meta is now, it would be useful to fend off the Tesla offenders. But I really can't think of a benefit other than that. Does the SBQ sonic attack count as energy damage? Mirelurk king attacks?
---
Still better than the millionth screenshot Scorchbeast corpse in a mildly lewd position with the same ol' caption 'Paint me like your French girls'
---
I can definitely agree there.
---
Heavy is a lot of fun and if you are already high strength for melee then it is an easy transition.
---
I disagree, and i havent seen any post like that?
---
They are on sale O:
---
"Weapons:
---
 
---
- "Mutant's" , damage increases for every mutation aquired
---
    
---
   - 2% increased damage per mutation
---
Armor
---
 - "Mutant's" , increased special stats if mutated
---
    - +1 to ALL special if you are mutated
---
My theory/reasoning;
---
 Weapons:
---
The effect would be much like junkies, but with a lower possible total. There are 19 mutations so you could potential get 38% increased damage. However you could only take 18 mutations because carnivore and herbivore can't be taken together ,if you want to  be able eat and not die of starvation. So a 36% increase would be maximum. I for one usually run 12-14 mutations and would say that is average, so that's a 24-28% damage buff, which falls right between two shot and anti armor. But it works perfectly because two shot has extra benefits when paired with explosive , but is less accurate in vats. While anti armor is less effective with high damage weapons or against low DR opponent's but more effective against high DR opponent's or with a high rate of fire low damage weapon. This making mutants a happy medium and totally viable without being OP.
---
Armor:
---
With the +1 to all special if mutated you can have a grand total of +5 to all special, if you had 5 pieces of armor with the "Mutant's" effect.  The +1 to all special is like the full life builds version of unyielding, but not nearly as many special points added. It would be way to OP if it mirrored unyielding.  It also provides further offset for the negative effects you suffer from mutations ,even with class freak you have a debuff to strength if you take bird bones, egg headed and eagle eyes. The plus one to each special offers a nice boost across the board and provides an alternative to stacking DR from vangaurds. If you have a good amount of DR already (like 300+), vangaurds kind of becomes redundant . Here's a link to some digging I did on DR and vangaurds:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dcf8cc/discussion_of_vangaurds_vs_15_damage_legendary/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
In its current state mutant's is an "ehhhhhh" effect. It has a little gain but is usually passed over because there are much more beneficial effects you can currently choose. I think these tweaks would make for another viable effect that won't be OP and fit in nicely with the current META."
---
I think it comes down to personal preference. If you‚Äôre concerned with dealing max damage then it‚Äôs not a good idea. If you‚Äôre taking a lot of energy damage then it might be worth it. I‚Äôd think about your armor choices and Underarmor as well. Maybe increase resistance without the mutation.
---
Oh ok. That makes sense. I thought there was a way to upgrade existing weapons that I was missing out on.
---
They already take my 10 percent from vending, and I don't even know what that goes towards still!
---
I didn't think that were were any unique legendaries, just unique weapons. If it doesn't have stars after the name it isn't legendary. Any unique weapon in the game should have plans to make it, they are just sometimes crazy rare (like plans for the fixer)
---
Greifers, workshops.
---
I have a explosive Tesla and have all the mod plans unlocked for the Tesla...and yet my former roommate has a basic tesla with a lobbing barrel....errrr
---
Gatling has slower response but better damage. 50 cal better accurracy. Mini gun... tear everything apart
---
Theres item such as the armor stand fast you get from a quest or the black diamond those are marked as legendarys
---
People still gather around the train Station. Enemies being removed, however, would be a game changer. 
---
I wonder if wastelanders will do something about those machines nobody uses.
---
Awesome! I just did the same. I killed the SBQ solo in around 15 minutes. I died 4 times. It was pretty fun all in all
---
The key to enjoying the game is to see the faults and accept them. Move past them (if you can, sometimes the bugs are really bad) and just try to have fun.
---
Mostly
---
I am partial to the coal dust skin.
---
It is easy to see you using Microsoft Word and not saving often. 
---
I feel your pain, though. Only Beth games crash this often.
---
Shame I'm constantly looking down for plastic cups to pick up lol
---
Yeah honestly I think you're right
---
Turrets should work, that's all. It is easier to defend your vault at Fallout 76.
---
Altruistic punisher
---
 \+10 per mutation (up to 5) - very good solution!
---
I'm a new player. Got any tips for me building my base?
---
As U.S. already had Korea war, 81192 event, and Chinese embassy in Belgrade event, nobody is really surprised about what happened in Fallout universe. Instead, as Chinese in the Fallout series do have relatively positive image and China is a strong China in the series, we are really interested in how China looks after the nuclear war. In the recent trade war, we also joke that we are glad that we play Fallout.
---
But in the most of time, we just enjoy the game and curse bugs.
---
I hope you are right, still have so much to explore and do.
---
You can have 2h melee and a fantastic gunslinger at the same Time. A bit of a glass cannon, but revolvers are cool as fuck and they can one-shoot most enemies. You keep your strength points where they are and move the rest to agility and luck. Three points of perception are enough
---
Technically not new currency, been used as currency for ages
---
I've been desperate enough to pay 2 for 5.56, but generally won't go more than 1. However, I will always buy it.
---
The problem with crossbows (my favourite weapon) Is that they don't do the damage they should. Damage resistances, armor and DISTANCE hurt them really bad, and they are slow as fuck.
---
Not me, I have no idea on how to keep a healthy supply of missiles and mininukes, that's why I resort to melee and autogrenade launcher most of the time.
---
Even with ammosmith and super super on.
---
No I dont. I probably could, have several thousand between .44, .45 and 10mm.
---
Why? It's the best post apocalyptic recycling sim on the market!
---
Not saying they don‚Äôt need to work on this, but if you know it happens all the time, why are you carrying 3 hours of junk around with you? Every train station has a stash box and bench to scrap at. There‚Äôs no reason for it.
---
And I add: I use an instigating crossbow with every stealth and rifleman perk. It says 129 damage on Pipboy (and it can hit for 1500 on good critical headshots), but a high level supermutant running towards you Will be hit for just 20 points on the chest. Twenty. 
---
Fucking twenty.
---
I usually do several things at once.  I'll set up those three extractors to get the acid then go around do something else for 10, 15 minutes before I come back and collect.
---
Yeah I noticed that too. Some people have multiple accounts with all characters being close to max weight with each armour set and weapon variation. Idk if it's any better on the other consoles or not
---
I could agree, what I need is the vendor bots to replenish their cap supply every 4 hours instead of 20.
---
Did you all run it? I am looking to try it out for the first time too. Would be interested and on now. Gt is same as here
---
Yes please
---
Yeah, if I put 5.56 ammo in my vending machine, it gets snatched up pretty quickly, I sell all ammo for 1c a piece, except for mini nukes and missiles. 
---
I'm about to abandon all other ammo sales for 5.56 though, maybe .50 black powder ammo.
---
50 cal. Ammo is cheaper, looks cooler, sounds cooler, more damage per shot, more damage per second, more armour penetration, it can get a gold skin, it doesnt have to spool up to be used.
---
I'm not sure why y'all are having problems, I've found 4 on deathclaws, maybe they changed it? Of course, haven't gotten number 5 yet but I'm server hopping right now, that's how I got the first 4.
---
I keep all ammo at 1 cap except cores, and I it does not sell as I expected it to sell. In fact, my characters all use dif. Ammo because I collect too muy of it and using it pays better than selling it. 
---
My commando does everything with a Fixer automatic in .38 caliber. Two or three headshots kill most enemies, a full magazine kills a mirelurk king or hunter, even a yaoguai with criticals.
---
God that'd be great. lol
---
I don't get people who lurk and shittalk the game but don't play it.
---
Reading this suddenly makes me feel like this is the Metro series now.
---
Ok like...I feel your pain. I do. But you don't get much sympathy for me because  if you're not scrapping and storing every fifteen-twenty minutes...you're doing things wrong.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
This is 5 months old. When this was written death claws did not drop their hides. They were found in random containers throughout the world.
---
I understand the legendary and vendor caps for the sake of preventing dupers from getting unlimited caps and script as quickly. Max caps limit being so low is just bullshit though. People still offer trades of over max caps it just becomes more inconvenient. It anything they could add some more cap sinks and raise the limit on them if getting rid of caps is the goal
---
Yes
---
And server hopping isn't a silly way to enjoy the game?
---
I always have the worst luck doing that.  It's almost like the game knows exactly what I'm looking for so every time I go hunting, there is nothing there.  I've just left it to the extractors while I go grab other stuff.
---
All of them still good. Handmade is the most useful one. The meta now is commando auto rifles. The TSE stuff for lasers is unique and extremely expensive. Oh and the double barrel is probably the worst out of all of then since the shotgun nerf
---
You bought the plan. You need to learn it from your inventory and craft it at a power armour station
---
I'd say that was speculative on their point. 
---
However it will change the map aesthically, not physically or by size. 
---
Bethesda has said more areas will be restricted from nuking and building. We've seen new settlements in existing areas
---
Which is why I said, "maybe they change it?"
---
Weapon cycling. Have 3 guns with 3 different types of ammo, cycle which weapon you use each day. You will find you never run out.
---
More steel though
---
I think its a bit late. Fallout 4 and 76 are already heading towards a looter shooter mechanic.
---
I can give you a full set of excavator power armor but you won't be able to use it until level 25
---
Have your lead and gunpowder ready beforehand, but don't use guns with lead ammo to do gun runs (it's counterproductive,) then go to best location for gun runs, Harpers Ferry, do Uranium fever quest, and finish at Welch.
---
Rinse, repeat. Before scrapping put perk card scrapper on, but don't scrap weapons until you're somewhere safe or you could get rolled by the griefer. Use scrap kits if you're overencumbered and make sure your stash box has enough room and you've got at least one piece of scrap in your inventory along with the steel you just scrapped and then the scrap kit will send it all back to your stashbox. 
---
Happy gaming
---
Yes, they patched it to where they would drop them the patch after this thread was created. Was specifically mentioned in patch notes. 
---
Thanks for the laugh though. Pretty entertaining seeing all the people comment about how it's not hard to find them on a 5mo old thread. 
---
No I wont close it. Cant make me!
---
We‚Äôre waiting for the fire in the dumpster to go out. Easier to load an app while taking a piss than to load into the game and see for yourself that it‚Äôs still broken.
---
I mean...grind up a few levels. Seriously, leader of the pack can get you 9-15 scrip when it pops but that's not much...you're level 14. Anything you get out of the vendor at the moment will be useless trash for you by the time you hit 50. The discount's...nice, but it's peanuts, 99% of what you get out of the purveyor is trash anyway.   
---
So best advice? Don't do your plan, do hit leader of the pack to equip yourself with some random stuff, but just...get up to 50.  Make that your goal.
---
Same. I don‚Äôt know either. Just an observation.
---
No I know, the way you spelt "guise" should have made that clear to everyone. It would still mean that in the case of PA users only those who pay would be qualified to win the "exclusive" rewards for players who dress up during the events. It would be at least "pay for inclusion" specifically for PA users.
---
5.56 is the most used ammo type. It's worth about 2-3 caps each at a vendor. It can also be used to trade like caps, where its worth about 1c each. Caps are easy to make and have no value after you buy all plans, realistically. 5.56 at least is useful so its worth a bit more
---
Sounds like he had it coming.
---
Upvoted for people to see. On Xbox, you can press the Xbox button and either record or take a snapshot so you can show that your atom shop and character selection isnt there at all.
---
Sorry, I don't keep up with patch notes on all the games I play. Good to know they fixed it, glad I could give you a chuckle.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I ended up doing and sent it to Bethesda, they had emailed me and told me to do all the shit I‚Äôd ALREADY done, power cycle and uninstalling- so I did it all again and it didn‚Äôt work.
---
Unless their stash is full and they plan on crafting/repairing with that junk.  Sure they can item manage better, but now they are playing around a broken game to avoid frustration. 
---
If anyone is finding the game frustrating the best bet is to put it aside and check the forums once or twice a month. Maybe it gets better, maybe it doesn‚Äôt. If the game does get better and you‚Äôre still interested yayyyy, if it doesn‚Äôt get better at least you didn‚Äôt waste hours trying to force yourself to ignore the plethora of bugs.
---
No problem üëç it's been a while so youd have to search to see where it got changed.
---
Out of curiosity how did you find this old thread?
---
/u/hannah__5 I‚Äôm starting a nuke run now if you feel like joining.
---
I would say the mistress of mysteries weapons are the only ones that can be upgraded. 
---
Yeah first play through I was eager for my first legendary but of course was stuck with a level 10 perfect storm. Ever since then I've tried to level up before tackling the main story if only just to craft a single excavator.
---
More like a nuke walk.
---
I don't agree with you and if this limitations are hurting your enjoyment of the game, you should make some changes. Spend those caps, spend that scrip, start a new character, lower your prices, give ammo for free, roleplay a character, etc.
---
Did they remove survival? Why? :O
---
Was asking the same question. I wanted to see if there was a more consistent place to get them. I'm 2 away from buying the capacity mod for the backpack and haven't found the last hide yet.
---
Can you please try to remember what you did last before logging in this time? Were you at your home base? Somewhere else? Near by what? Anything interesting about your stats or chems used before logging out?
---
I do role play a character. I do spend caps. I almost always have less than 15K. I do spend script but spending doesn‚Äôt matter when you can‚Äôt generate
---
Nothing whatsoever out of the ordinary. Like I said it was less than 20 hours ago, I logged off standing in Watoga station I believe. Not over encumbered or under the influence of chems or anything. Now Bethesda has sent a second email telling me to check my internet connection (first email told me to power cycle console) they have ignored the fact that my brothers profile is also on this Xbox and everything is working fine for him. I told them this in the first email üòí
---
The goal of the limits is to:
---
* Keep cap inflation in check (e.g. if everyone has a million caps, stuff is going to cost a lot more)
---
* Keep legendary deflation in check (e.g. if everyone can spend all day at the purveyor, everyone will wind up with all god rolls and will lose interest in playing)
---
* Keep players logging in every day to keep the "daily active user" statistic up (which is also a goal of keeping the in-game economy healthy)
---
They never do, I think they are just griefing and claiming caps.
---
My commando started using an auto l√°ser rifle because I wanted to use the ammo and save 556. It has become his main weapon. It melts enemies, great range, fire bonus, lightweight, etc.
---
I wouldn't pour too much into it, your base is temporary if you log off it's gone, so keep it cheap and simple
---
Another "dis gaem is teh best!!11!1!" post eh? It's got a little bit of "Bethesda can do no wrong", it's got some "X level player gave me Y" (which definitely didn't actually happen), and a smidge of "this community is great!" even though there dozens of posts daily bitching about the shitty community. 
---
Time to roll the roulette wheel be see if it lands on! 
---
1: Legitimate new player that is still in the honeymoon phase and hasn't run into any of the major problems yet
---
2: Shill. Lots of those around here
---
3: A unicorn that has somehow managed to avoid the *literally fucking hundreds of bugs* and doesn't understand why the game is hated by so many.
---
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3.. 1.. 2.. 3.. 1.. 2.. 3.... 1.... 2.... 3........ 1........... 2.
---
Congratulations OP, you're a shill! Nothing from your post actually happened. Thanks for playing!
---
did you do a vault 94 raid, though? or are you saying this happened despite you never having entered vault 94?
---
usually I'd say this is a case of mishandled credentials, as in Bethesda's servers erroneously logged someone else into your account. and then that person proceed to deleted your characters. kinda like the credit card fiasco shortly after release. reports of entire rosters getting wiped date back to november, same as mismatching logins. and last time this happened the rep heavily implied the user had just manually deleted their characters.
---
I'm still holding onto the hope they actually fixed this issue despite your report. that's because you're saying the atom shop isn't loading, that's definitely new. plus beta characters/accounts have always been buggy for some nefarious reason.
---
Pretty sure (idk about scrip tho) is to help prices from becoming super inflated. Imagine unlimited vender caps and like a 1 mil player caps limit. A basic unyielding piece would be unobtainable
---
Got ya. Yea man just go farm death claw island, the skull cave, the power station by watoga, abandoned waste dump, and Emmet mountain disposal site. Each has at least 1 deathclaw. Server hop run again.
---
The last goal is not accomplished very well. That‚Äôs the issue. Most people will just hit a point where they are comfortable and then wait until the next update
---
Jesus Christ what a mess. And no I never even went near vault 94. Not even once. They have sent 2 emails thus far, first telling me to power cycle console and all the stuff I‚Äôve already done, then telling me to check my internet connection completely ignoring how I told them my brothers profile is on this console and that the game works perfectly when I sign in under his name. He owns the game as well.
---
Exactly my thoughts lol
---
Whitesprings
---
Youll commonly see if used in sales for things over the cap limit
---
I have a character who uses melee and a 44 revolver, so he collects ammo and crafts but does not use it. An unarmed ninja who does the same, a shotgunner who hoardes shells, explosives and cores, a rifleman who makes eat shot count and a commando who burns aaaaall that ammo the rest saved for him.
---
Bethesda has always had the tools to retrieve lost things. they are rudimentary, as in they have to manually retrieve a snapshot of a previous save from their servers. but they *do* have the ability.
---
they just refuse to unless you make a big stink out of it on reddit. which is ludicrous considering this is their own fault for not having an id system in place to keep track of things.
---
I think to add a little bit of fun, add a couple of robot movers who appear to be moving people's stuff around lol
---
Updated post with the info I just told you. Maybe it will help others. Did realize this was coming up in a search.
---
I‚Äôm replying to their emails and a different fucking person is responding each time, and ignoring stuff I‚Äôve said in previous responses.
---
I dont think 1mil is reasonable i just meant something along the lines of 50k OR just have all caps on your characters be shared so you dont need to log in 4 more times for a big caps trade. 
---
Also, inflation is why I said there needs to be some type of caps sink. I've seen some good suggestions from people on this sub about that
---
He only had himself to blame
---
Sounds good.
---
There‚Äôs the vault 94 raid if you can get a team together or if someone is addicted random high level players to make a team. The legendary vendor that gives random legendary gear in exchange for scrip. A couple events that require people to work together. And tse weapons are still useable just not overpowered anymore but shotguns require you to be inside your enemy to do any damage.
---
What level was this dick turd?
---
It was, some time ago. Now people have high level characters with most perks and it Is possible to use cores very efficiently. In fact, I have all my cores for sale, very cheap, because I do not need them. Like 30-40 caps for full ones.
---
All weapons are viable with the right perk cards. Are you on PC?
---
Thanks.
---
Use 5mm for the queen
---
I have done this with bears and fuzzies.  Facepalm doesn't even cover it.
---
hehehe dick turd
---
Me leaving the door open is part of the deal. Keep that in mind when you decide prices: add an extra tax.
---
don't wanna sound pessimistic but you better hope this thread gets some traction. contact juicehead on youtube if you have to. let him know this has been happening since release (I'm pretty sure he covered it once or twice, too) and that not everyone is as lucky as the vault 94 guy, that Bethesda will only bother helping if the complaint gets on the front page.
---
*maybe* they learned their lesson and will help you after a dozen useless replies, like power-cycling your console. clearly the issue is on their end. but this is Bethesda we're talking about. send them a screenshot of the atom shop missing, it might help.
---
That‚Äôs actually a good idea, I usually just dump the ammo on people for free every now and then, but it might be good for trash kills
---
I sent them a screenshot of it right off the bat. That‚Äôs when they said check my internet. And thank you, I follow juicehead on YouTube I‚Äôll see about messaging him on twitter or something. And yeah I‚Äôm hoping for the first time ever that this post gets a shitload of upvotes because this is insane. And like I said if it can happen to me and who knows who else it can happen to anyone.
---
i'd just buff current one for armor to 20 of both defenses instead of 10. damage to 15% instead of 10%.
---
allowing it to benefit from each mutation would be pretty broken as almost everyone runs a mutation
---
Ha... We have all been there. You need to do the whole thing, so find a nice day with free time and no interruptions. I did it late at night, wife and kids sleeping.
---
I agree at launch is when it was bad, it has improved since then and I find myself playing more often than I have at launch
---
wait these things are rare...?
---
i had one of these waaaay back and i scrapped it thinking it was a dev room item someone had dumped to dispose of it &gt;&lt;
---
that's the problem with this sub, people scrutinize everything because of the negative press Fo76 gets routinely, and take reports such as these at face value. I've been trying to raise awareness of disappearing items for months now and nobody cares, then a couple hours ago another user lost their legendary gear.
---
keep us updated.
---
There are no middle checkpoints, I mean. You can skip the first parts by going to the cavern and checking Taggerdy's body, but you'll miss a nice part of the game.
---
And for how much..
---
I will, believe me I ain‚Äôt gonna grab my fucking ankles and just take it I‚Äôll harass them every damn day if necessary. Thanks for the support.
---
It probably depends on your placement.  Some areas are high traffic and high spawn.  If enough mooks spawn, it is easy to overwhelm the defenses.
---
I don't even mind so much the weak sensitivity of the turrets.  What bothers me is the range.  It's annoying that any mook with a gun will stay far away and plink the turrets to death.
---
Addittionally 
---
Last bastion
---
Trail warden
---
All rise
---
Bunker buster
---
I also want to point out that the perfect storm is the only way to get the incendiary legendary prefix in the game although you can put mods on certain weapons to achieve that effect.
---
No xbox
---
On average, how much do you play? I have 1002 hours. Five characters above level 60-85 (erased maybe ten). Play three days a week and you'll always have fresh caps, fresh scrip and that.
---
&gt;crippling junk collection syndrome 
---
I have no idea what you're on about, but thumbs up for this bit xD
---
Idk some LMG users have bought me out of 308 at 2 a pop. Granted they sat there for a while.
---
‚ÄúAnd now I‚Äôm going to stick my finger in his bum... OH HES REAL PISSED OFF NOW!‚Äù
---
I actually had a server today where Morgantown was nuked. One event came up. Lots of ghouls and scorched, and 100 or more cobalt flux (raw). I might be nuking it tomorrow morning. We‚Äôre ceasing up the place. All the scorched get two taps, and a quick looting.
---
Oddly enough ive never sold those i tried to find some 45 rounds at vendors practically nonexistant
---
explosive energy weapons such as the TSE tesla are now legacy, explosive doesn't drop on energy weapon any longer. the tesla is arguably the worst legacy but you can still fetch a nice trade for it.
---
TSEs in general have been nerfed to the ground and the small damage boost does not justify the massive accuracy loss from TS any longer. that handmade is still a decent weapon however.
---
the TSE dragon is pretty meh but bloodied is actually the current meta alongside junkie's. any BE/FFR/SS weapon is pretty solid, even a pickaxe.
---
shotguns have been nerfed even further than just plain TS or E, but a QE DB is actually not a bad weapon. it's definitely not as op as it once was, but you can still make a decent build around it.
---
that's probably the biggest change, you actually need to have a build now. no more relying on TSEs alone and putting everything on weight reduction perks.
---
not much in terms of end game content, some "quests" like toadpole scouts, encryptid, arktos pharma and the, ugh, burrows. a raid, too. and some college drinking game nobody cares about anymore. the game is getting an overhaul soon in the shape of wasterlanders, complete with news quests and actual npcs.
---
In watoga? Only thing I can think of is some sort of bug glitch in watoga. Maybe related to being the mayor though I appreciate your answer. I will avoid watoga when logging off from here on out. Im on xbox as well. I don't understand how an internet connection can delete your account unless your internet somehow is so laggy it repeats some kind of security hand shake because the packet sent wasn't confirmed to be received so it resends it as part of the network protocols, triggering the servers to think you modded your account. Weird though.
---
Exactly my thoughts.  Especially the +1 Armors... good stuff
---
That man was a damned legend. Haha.
---
If you see a BoS Veteran raining fire on the mobs during scorched Earth, that's me. I clean so the rest can kill the queen. Bring the wendigos, bring the stingwings, bring the radrats. I break two laser rifles per event. Mankind calls. Ad victoriam.
---
Hey, I'm just up the road North of Greg's Mining Supply and get a ton of traffic there too. Seems like that stretch of road is usually good for business
---
About 1000 hours myself. I focus most of my time on one character. I even have a few good legacies sitting around in my stash.
---
I dont hear music? I just hear ambient background forest creatures.
---
I have moved because of that. Something else you can do Is bait those mooks by building defenses on the edge closer to them, so they shoot their stupid pipes against six concrete walls.
---
I have a problem with collecting too much junk lol
---
Are you able to suggest a fairly steady location for finding them? All the places I've been told have them have, for four months now, produced a considerable stream of sheepsquatch and mothmen but only one trick or treater and they had the skeleton, sadly. I've been looking for that dress plan since release.
---
Maybe to collectors but they're really just named 3star legendaries you can find in the wild.
---
Well... With a single character, endgame is always there with you. I even nerf myself, using lesser armor and weapons.
---
If you have been in game for a while you typically know to find them and don't need the power plant.  I did it once early in the game, but have not had to do it since.
---
I haven't been following the game much recently why did they remove it, are they working on it?
---
Its funny, because I only set up there to stay out of the way during Meat Week, but not a day has gone buy since where I haven't sold *something*, and that's pretty telling. I think at most I'll move a few feet away from where I'm at now so I can resettle everything a bit better, but other than that, I'm home.
---
because nobody played it. it was just a drain on resources. not even pvpers liked it.
---
This. But boy, That Unstoppable Monster is really something.
---
Thx appreciate it
---
I've tried a couple of other spots and always come back. The worst I get is some occasional super mutants, it's crazy convenient to some good junk farms, and it's pretty central on the map for fast travel. The steady stream of shoppers is just a bonus.
---
It‚Äôll move at 5 caps.
---
not even pvpers liked survival. they had switched over to adventure pvp a long, long time ago. any form of "protest" is just dirtbags trying to rationalize their actions.
---
just use fireproof and/or dense armor. they're a small annoyance at worst.
---
Well in that case I'm glad they removed it, Maybe now they can actually focus on working on the one game mode everybody actually does like. Instead of trying to focus on 3 separate modes at the same time. With everything going on with Bethesda right now I actually support and can justify this decision.
---
I think legendary perks should truly be legendary! Up to 3 stars on some depending on value.
---
Strength: ‚ÄúJunk in da Trunk‚Äù reduces weight of junk in your stash
---
Perception: ‚ÄúBest Shot‚Äù increases all rifle damage
---
Endurance: ‚ÄúDown with the Sickness‚Äù reduces all disease chances
---
Charisma: ‚ÄúTake it 4 the Team‚Äù percent damage received heals team
---
Intelligence: ‚ÄúSmarty Pants‚Äù All building cost decreased
---
Agility: ‚ÄúHand Job‚Äù duel yield pistols and one handed melee
---
Luck: ‚ÄúLuckyyyyyy‚Äù no server drops (j/k)
---
So is Bethesda doing anything to try to reinforce the PVP aspect of the game, Like re-doing survival and at a later point or is it just on ice atm?
---
Hopefully when wastelanders comes back ya will :]
---
Make .50 cal ammo, snipe away at a distance with hunting rifle mod and long range scope. Stay high, cant reach you. Go near the rim of the world and work your way north killing all the mole miners and scorched. You can make .50 cal ammo in bigger bulk sizes with perk cards and using it to snipe one at a time might be boring but it works to save ammo. 600 rounds can take you a while. Took me about two weeks to use up about a thousand rounds.
---
There‚Äôs a pricing guide, I think it was by Widgeon TV, but his only bad point was ammo for free
---
It's by far the ammo I sell the most of.
---
Same. The first time I experienced a game-affecting bug was BETA and second was this September.
---
I normally turn on all of my daily quests and just run through them all by walking all the way from the forest to cranberry
---
I buy good chunks of my mats for ammo crafting... And still turn an easy profit selling ammo.
---
How about if you purchase from the Purveyor it adds to the scrip amount. Maybe at 50 or 25% return? Also, how about a way to spend caps on adding more scrip to the machine after you've sucked it dry? I think this would be a good way to burn caps. Also what about a cap slot machine where you spend caps and it can yield you useful bulk scrap like acid, lead, gunpowder or even legendary's or outfits.
---
4 caps it is!
---
they said it'll be reworked and return soon(tm) and reminded people workshops exist.
---
pvp is largerly an afterthought at this point. most of the playerbase does not care about it and prefer pve content. thus wastelanders.
---
Big game hunt, idle explosives, buried with honor
---
.50 cal .machine gun plan would have been better to find tbh than anything you mentioned
---
I think workshops are great but until they add an ability to rejoin last server you were on so you can maintain your workshop through all the horrid bluescreens (something thats LOOOOOOOONG overdue), they are pointless to me.
---
Before the survival mode i found alot of high lvl players to be hostile if your base was build on the same spot as his or her base
---
Like I just want a cute dress. I don't want to fight the sheepsquatch or the mothman again!
---
For me any 308 a 1 cap is an auto buy, 2 caps i have to think about it. Got to keep my Furious/Explosive LMG fed.
---
Not really. The modifiers can still drop in game. Only thing special is the name really.
---
It was great when NW launched but it got old fast
---
Yeah, this shit scares me lol. I try to continue supporting Bethesda, but if this happened to me I‚Äôd be furious. People need to upvote this whole post for traction.
---
I have fiber optic one gig internet. It‚Äôs not my connection I have never had an issue in the 18 months since i had it installed.
---
I agree. I‚Äôve been a loyal diehard fan for years and playing this game since the pre beta stress test. It‚Äôs had it issues but I‚Äôve been mostly happy with the improvements they made. I still have fun with it. Well, HAD fun.
---
Stop playing.....if that‚Äôs your attitude then this game is not for you
---
You have to make ammo or buy ammo. You'll never be able to farm enough, no matter what weapon you choose as your main. Your only other option is to go unarmed(mole miner or deathclaw gauntlet) or melee.
---
Put your camp on a lead deposit. Get the scrapper perk and run through morgantown airport and high school. (This will also help with your shotgun shell stash as a lot of the scorched here drop shotgun shells) Scrap all the weapons you get from the scorched for steel. Once you get to a high enough level get the perk cards for super duper and ammosmith to maximize the number of bullets you get from crafting.
---
It could help to implement this idea if they made each room a separate cell and you had to select if you wanted to visit your room or a friends room off of a list (or a random room off of a list of public rooms). I feel like that would make this idea implementable while also reducing lag
---
I tried looking up dolly soda and it says it's just a location, can you give me a little more detail?
---
yeah, let's save an artillery specialist (like ronnie shaw) who teaches us the lost art of the big boom
---
Agreed with this counterpoint. That said I feel class freak does too good a job minimizing the side effects of mutations; there‚Äôs virtually no benefit to running a purist build at all.
---
Would be interesting if Mutant‚Äôs did work like Junkie‚Äôs and class freak was removed from the game.
---
That would be awesome. But, if done right, the downside of Junkie's is not that bad and for me it was set it and forget it since I don't bother taking the stuff I'm addicted to.
---
Will happily buy it my friend, you offering alone is awesome enough üëèüèª good luck on that handmade! Let me know what happens
---
Its your haunted past. You need to put the demon back at the airport so it will stop killing more!
---
That‚Äôs not an accurate counter at all. Just a hype and version of advertisement. 
---
Mark my words, there is zero chance we wouldn‚Äôt make the final goal. It would be a PR nightmare.
---
Honestly, yes. Mostly because we're all here for the same reason. The love of fallout. And a lot of like minded people who wants to help the wasteland since they first started playing fallout, experience other players and takes that bit of them with them. Just return the favor when you're a higher level
---
I'm a new player and still fairly low level and tbh, I kinda hate how every level 100+ on every server tracks me down and drops me 5 legendaries for my level. Every time.
---
Well, to be fair sometimes we end up with worthless legendaries lol who better to use it then you?
---
And you know, what does that say about a company or product,  when so many customers are being supplied with anxiety every time they use the product? I posted this on Facebook as well and probably 20 people have said the same thing as you, that they‚Äôre scared of this same thing happening to them.
---
I believe it. Even if you do get your characters back, it probably won‚Äôt even be until Monday (at the very least), which means you can‚Äôt even really play a game that you paid for (unless you start over) for several days. That‚Äôs crazy to me. This shouldn‚Äôt even be a thing.
---
POO
---
This happened to me as well. What finally worked was me playing alone instead of in a team. I may also have got rid of my marsupial mutation by that point, but I don't remember.
---
Use maxed ammosmith and super duper
---
Go to lucky hole mine with excavator power armor on, this will net you ~300 lead ore which will translate to 1500 lead scrap
---
Next farm west tek and uranium fever for weapons and junk to scrap for steel
---
Make thousands of rounds of ammo in under an hour
---
Are we not allowed to play the game or something? Kind of figured everyone was welcome to play it.
---
Wow thanks for the knowledge shared and in depth description - my sort of friend! Well stated
---
I believe they mean the "Stings and things" quest given there. It has the potential to give out Scout Badges.
---
I take all 3 on my PA heavy gunner, otherwise if I am workshoping on another I will do poseidon and monagha(sp?) power plant  event but not keep the workshops just clear them power up the core maker and move on with what i really want to do.   I keep 30-50 on my PA user. Yes it is nice and the rewards for fixing the plant are decent but it is meh if you are just playing a non pa character.
---
their leaders violated the Geneva Protocol by bombarding us with bio attacks, they must be dealt with in a swift and harsh manner.
---
Firstly I‚Äôm amazed that you‚Äôre lvl 33 and have 21 caps, BUT, I‚Äôm not here to judge. If the main quest is getting too hard, do side quests to gain xp and rewards. And if you are having lots of trouble with ammo, might suit you to try melee instead. As for plans and stuff, those just come by playing the game. Either by finding them, buying them, or getting them rewarded to you in quests.
---
Had this issue too, I found a work around when I was dealing with it...
---
I would start not when the voice would say go but when I saw the quest to the right of the HUD say (Completed) and the timer would actually pop up.
---
It was posted here by a data miner, but I can't find it.
---
Rounding the chances were‚Ä¶
---
- 3* mob: 33%, 33% and 33% for 1*, 2* and 3*.
---
- 2* mob 50% and 50% for 1* and 2*.
---
- 1* mob: 100% for 1*.
---
And this coincides with my experience.
---
Congrats, you have an opportunity to stand out more.
---
Didn‚Äôt do anything. ü§® I might have to talk to support.
---
As many 5.56 I see and sell myself for 1 cap per round I dont know who is buying it for 2 caps apiece? I build and sell about 20,000 5.56 every few days.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt have expected it either. But it exists. Not sure if being a beta account does anything.
---
I want a quest completion log so I could see the rewards (if any) I get.  That way I don't have to check my entire inventory every Time I'm too busy with enemies to read or bugs
---
I miss survival mode!! I'm really bummed about it.
---
Honestly anything that will get me scrip is appreciated because I‚Äôm trying to farm legendaries for the big sale coming up, I do the pack leader event whenever I see it..
---
Also anything I can sell for caps because I blow all of it on ammo and vendors don‚Äôt give me anything whatsover! My best weapon nets me 9 caps at a vendor it sucks lol.
---
Exp farms, decent areas that drop good loot to scrap, or anything in general I should check out that would be around my level
---
This is probably the literal first thing you tried, but I had this happen to me about two months ago, same thing where there was no character selection, no atomic shop, a hard restart of my xbox ended up fixing it.
---
Oh I thought it was by 5 because I saw some level 15 weapons
---
Tried it three times thus far no luck. Please let anyone know that you can to upvote this, that‚Äôs the only reason the guy 2 months ago got his fixed, the Bethesda people on here saw the post then contacted him - submitting tickets didn‚Äôt work. But they did actually fix his account once he was able to talk to the right people.
---
Nah thats a bit too strong, most endgame players run with at least 5 mutations. Class freak makes them way too beneficial. It would need to cap much lower around 20% but not much higher than 25%. Requiring a lot more mutations might be good as well, requiring you to make choices and build around it like Junkies.
---
Exploring with a friend is kind of weird compared to the other games. I like to go through every nook and cranny and read all the terminals, but it feels like I'm holding things up when another person is around. Same for fast travel. I don't like to do it but I think that's a minority opinion.
---
You probably don't want to buy another piece of hardware to play this game. However, I use a gaming keypad which allows custom keybinding. It makes all games easier to configure. Reload is always the same button, the map is the same, and so on.
---
You are the second person in two days to mention buying repair kits. As Croc wrote, they are not necessary. You'll eventually get them for free. Use Gunsmith, Licensed Plumber, or Makeshift Warrior to repair your weapons, and White Knight or Power Patcher for the armor. Don't forget about Fix It Good and Weapon Artisan. 
---
Speaking of perk cards, check out [Perk Loadout Manager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QN5TnFq98L6MOyKUv7Czw7WUIcFXrPfKH-JHmt-XxHs/edit?usp=sharing). At early levels it's not so important, but it really helps once you start accumulating perk cards. Bethesda plans to release a similar system for all platforms early next year.
---
Speaking with others is tough. I like to try and talk to people who visit my camp. Usually I would offer a deal or let them look at stuff that's not in the vendor, but only about half respond. It's weird. There is a text chat mod (Bethesda has not announced plans to add one) where you can talk with other players and plan events. It is easy to install and use.
---
I like the game. It's not a traditional Fallout experience, but it does scratch an itch that other games don't. Have fun exploring! Stop by and see DonkeyHotey when you make it to the Savage Divide.
---
My gt is uhhLoonycross
---
I‚Äôm a big fan of tea time because it‚Äôs pretty easy, and ecological balance because as someone on this group put it it‚Äôs the closest to actual science you ever get in Fallout. 
---
At low levels I can‚Äôt get enough of the rampaging robots in Flatwoods, whatever that‚Äôs called. After level 15 or so I leave it to the newbies.
---
No, because then it's essentially Junkies, but with less downsides. 
---
Tweaking the prefixes isn't terrible, given how most are useless.
---
* Berserker: Up to +100% damage at 0 DR (Making it the true glass cannon spec).
---
* Bloodied: Up to +50% damage at 20% health (Still stacks with bolstering/unyielding/nerd/adrenal). 
---
* Executioner: +50% damage when target below 50% health.
---
* Exterminator/Troubleshooter/Hunter/Slayer/Zealot: +50% damage against mirelurks/robots/animals/super mutants/ghouls/scorched.
---
* Furious: +5% per hit (Max 50%). 
---
* Medic: V.A.T.S. crits will heal you and your group for damage delt.
---
* Mutant: +5 for every mutation (Max 6).
---
* Nocturnal: +50% damage at night.
---
* S.T.A.L.K.E.R: If \[hidden\], +100% V.A.T.S accuracy and +100% V.A.T.S crit damage.
---
* Suppressors: Target takes 20% more damage and delivers 20% less damage for 3 seconds.
---
Map markers were unrealistic and sucked (even worse at the beginning, when pacifist players would become no1 just by chilling at their camp hurting nobody. Damage caps nerfed some builds and one-shooting stopped existing, and it was the rise of the commando. 
---
Truth Is, they tried to please and never found balance. I liked, however, the latest version: the one which said goodbye.
---
Commenting so this gets traction
---
Happy doing business with you, brother!
---
Same to you, hope you kill plenty of scorched with that ammo haha
---
Not me..i enjoyed the leaderboard alot. Especially in the beginning, what i remember is it being based on kills and whoever stayed alive with the most kills was in first..plus camps were still destroyable so they weren't hiding long. Those were the good old days for me. By far the most fun ive had in fo76 personally
---
And on too of all of that i was a bloodied sniper build which totally changed the entire game for me when they added a damage cap
---
Some weapons are 10/20/30/40/50 and some are 5/15/25/35/45 and some specific endgame weapons do not have lower level variants to be made.
---
I can probably tell you why F76 gets no love. I think most regular players are kinda biased and so they tend to regularly overlook a lot of stuff.
---
1. The bugs. There were tons upon tons of bugs. It‚Äôs not to say there still isn‚Äôt, with every new patch update there are bugs fixed and bugs created. Characters deleted at random, inventory disappears and deletes itself, entire quest lines bugged, it goes on and on and you can find hour long videos detailing all of them, past and present. That being said, I‚Äôve had sessions where I‚Äôve not encountered a single bug so it‚Äôs playable. It just is what it is. The guys work really hard to squash these bugs so I can overlook it.
---
2. The Atomic Shop gets a lot of flak. Mostly for charging players $20 for singular cosmetic skins for a gun or power armor or giving players gameplay specific micro transactions in the form of quick repair boxes and soon-to-be-coming loot box mechanics despite specifically stating otherwise in press releases and interviews. Bethesda does this shit, they‚Äôll preview salvage bots in their initial trailers for the game giving people the impression that‚Äôs it‚Äôs base game content and a year later charge them for it. It‚Äôs just god awful marketing and business practices, the flak they get is not unreasonable. 
---
3. Just a lack of gameplay options that should be available in a MMO but just aren‚Äôt for no apparent reason. Text options for PC players, guilds, interesting quest lines involving actual NPCs (Soon to be fixed but how well, time will tell,) regulated game modes that aren‚Äôt gamed by the players, a cheat room that should be inaccessible but still is lol, simple things like collecting Scout badges become tedious and often boring grindfests which I‚Äôve seen in other MMOs but never this bad. 
---
Just lots of things are wrong with this game and it‚Äôs best to just wait until things are added before you do a deep dive into it. I‚Äôd say by this time next year, you should give it a shot.
---
It's not so much how frequently you play. It's how frequently you win. Making it to the top 9 gives you bonus points, but winning is where it's at. Most wins take about 20 minutes, and you get around 970-1200XP for a win. Losing will get you 200-400XP or less.
---
What I tell most people starting out is... If you get 1 kill early in the game and then you die, that's worth 20-30XP. If you get 1 kill and win the game, that's worth 1,000XP. Good luck!
---
There are more horde events other than the Leader of the Pack so watch the map for them.  If I remember correctly, Campfire tales also has a legendary at the end. You're best bet is to craft your own ammo. It costs you nothing but time and since you need to level up, killing enemies and scrapping their weapons will get you some of the materials that you need.  You're almost level 30 right?  I would try Lewisberg. If you're lucky, there will be super mutants or scorched there. The supermutants can be tough if your build isnt right.  Sometimes theres ghouls, you'll get xp from them but no weapons. Kill everything. Pickup all the weapons. Sell them all at the train station. Server hop. Lewisberg again. Kill everything. Sell them all. Server hop. Do this until you've reached your vendor cap. Once you've met it, Do Lewisberg another time or two or three and scrap the weapons for steel to make your own ammo. Get the scrapper perk card!
---
If you're too short on ammo for a midlevel area. Run through morgantown airport (inside and out), the train yard there, and morgantown high school a few times. You'll get a decent amount of shotgun shells and you should be able to use your gauntlet on the scorched there because they're so low level. Then take your shotgun shells and go to a higher area.
---
What build are you going for? Do your perk cards support that build? If so, you can probably start farming whitesprings by level 40.  I'm assuming you're modding your weapons? What platform are you on?
---
Are u in Japan as well?
---
Ah, no. In the US.
---
People are complaining about the influx of griefers, and your response is "PvP is an afterthought?"
---
The griefers are recruiting. I was just in a party with the Beech Bois, who are trying to pull in and gear up more members to grief.
---
*laughs in plague walker*
---
Definitely not your fault. I hope they fix this for you soon.
---
if you're getting griefed then it's probably because you allowed yourself to be. Bethesda made it so it's really hard to bait people into pvp.
---
Ahh just ur shops name seemed very well. If u lived here you would know. 
---
Thank you for the massive response as well. 
---
Much better then sending me to circlejerk.com.
---
The PvPers like it until the Adventure whiners went in there because they can't help but grind the bonus XP and exclusive rewards. We never wanted Survival to turn into Adventure, but that's what the whiners did.
---
I‚Äôve never understood this from gamers.  If there is nothing left to do in a game then go play another game where there is something to do.
---
Kill scorched.
---
Thank you very much.
---
That's true. But as the OP mentioned, the griefers are really good at being toxic.
---
I shouldn't refer to griefers as "them." I'm one of them. Sometimes.
---
Thank you I really appreciate it. I‚Äôm grieving currently but trying to stay optimistic.
---
The 2 in the mire can get you the leather coat and the other can get you a sick cowboy outfit. And idk which ones rewarded them but I did leader of the pack, back on the beat, and collision course today and ended up getting the jumpsuit bundle qnd both scout masks
---
Would you be able to record an xbox clip of you using the menu? There have been cases in the past of people faking this, and it would be good to have some evidence. Also seeing your achievements would be great, too.
---
According to a paper written in 2009, Runescape's economy changed drastically when player trading become more centralized. The largest change was the cut down on "illegal trades" (items for real-world-cash) since players were far more likely to get the items they wanted, and see what items to go out and sell all from the new single market instead of having to build those networks themselves.
---
I saw the same note, and was SO EXCITED, but it was a lie. Bethesda failed again. I can't hear my friends in party chat in between NW victories because of that awful intro music. The only way to silence it is through Master volume control.
---
I can record clips of anything, but I don‚Äôt know how to make them accessible on reddit. Poindextercheez is my Gt if you want to check my feed I‚Äôll make a clip tomorrow from me starting the game to what happens when I try and press play.
---
I have a good camp design for defensibility, I may just switch to that configuration.  I've been doing the "integrate well with the environ" lately, but this new spot has a lot of spawns.
---
For my defensible build, I do a std skinny staircase from a block of concrete, which goes up to a grated floor, that circles out in a box of grated flooring.  That is where I put my turrets, and with the grated flooring, the visibility is not blocked as much. From that ring I go up another level to a cabin/platform, where all my stuff is.
---
It is a highly effective setup.  By the time anything makes it past the outer ring, the turrets from the other side kick in and whatever it is gets shredded.  The only exception being mole rats that spawn on the second ring (grrr), and fast-moving creatures like wolves.
---
Back with Survival, I had a friend approach but we hadn't connected, and he forgot.  He barely made it to the staircase before all the turrets just ripped him up, and he had a level 150 solid build.  You don't want to walk into the center of 8x turrets focused on you.
---
pretty sure the damage cap has nothing to do with people grinding xp. none of the many problems with survival had anything to do with pvers, mainly because they'd just move on when they were killed. this wasn't their server to begin with. Bethesda never knew what to do with survival servers from the very beginning. dropping aid, limiting the cap reward, removing the scoreboard. pvpers moved back to adventure long before any "whiners".
---
and toxic or not, like I said, griefers are a minor annoyance at worst. what you gonna do? shoot me for a massive 0 damage? throw mines at my dense armor? call me names until I mute you? I'm just gonna heart emote and jump servers.
---
hooray for you.
---
Have you sat down and waited at the restaurant tables in Whitesprings? ;)
---
If I could post pics, I could show you how to build turrets properly. My camp is next to several random spawns and a level 91 Deathclaw spawn. I occasionally have to repair 1 wall. Your turrets need spotlights paired with them, and they need clear line-of-sight covering every angle of approach. I build defense platforms that surround my camp. Nothing is exposed. Raised foundations are invincible and protect my enclosed camp. My enclosed camp houses my crops, bed, water, junk extractor, etc. There are internal shotgun turrets as well, for the occasional mole rat attack. It's self-contained and self-protected.
---
can we also get loans from that bank and if we struggle paying for it we can lose our homes (camps)? it'd add to the immersion!
---
Wasn't it BETA? I mean if so, they could bring it back?
---
I found a plan and scrapped all baseball bats I made in order to get colours, sorry if this is unhelpful
---
I didn't mention a damage cap. Not sure where your whole tangent came from. I'm assuming that you didn't play Survival from the very beginning, before it was flooded with greedy Adventure players who couldn't be happy having a PvP-free wonderland of their own.
---
Nice!
---
"Check your internet router" is a completely BS response.  It's from the "support 101 questions" that any tech company uses, even if it doesn't matter:
---
1. Ask the user if their internet works.  If not, ask them to reboot it -- at least this way they might call back and get somebody else.
---
2. Ask the user if they have rebooted.  If not, ask them to reboot it -- perhaps they will call back and get somebody else.
---
3. Ask the user if they could re-install the software.  They will get somebody else once they call back.
---
EVERY tech support question always begins with these.  It's super infuriating.  When I call any tech support, anywhere, I always lead with: I'm a network engineer, I build datacenters, write complex software systems, and I'm a CTO.  I understand what I'm doing, I have already tested my internet link including tracing the route from myself to your servers.  I have checked all the drivers on my system, and I have even rebooted.  Here is the problem: ....
---
In many cases when I do this, they just go, "Oh, ok, let me move you to tier-2 support."
---
Because in all reality, most places Tier-1 support is just the cheapest person they can find, who reads from a script, which is usually the #1,2,3 above.
---
Well i made a new character cuz i ran out of weight on my main character so i was looking for some for my tommy gun and my fixer that submachine gun eats ammo like a champ
---
Haha I‚Äôm level 10 and want to get to level 89, if you‚Äôre on Xbox we can grind together üò¢
---
Put simply? At launch and during the beta, the game was a broken mess, and you only need to go to Youtube to find hundreds of videos with no 'hate' that simply show bug after glitch after physics error. Then the media ripped it to shreds, rightfully, because this is a AAA product people paid full price for and bought collectors editions of based on the trust between customer and developer that a full priced and AAA product will at least hold together at a basic level when you boot it up. Now? The game is a year old, and in a generally playable state, and anyone coming into it does so with an open mind and low expectations due to all the bad press you will find just searching the title, and so these players are more likely to be the sort of person to be able to find fun in what it has to offer... but everyone else moved on to newer titles a while ago. The ship sailed for 76 and Wastelanders is unlikely to do much but bring back curious players who already own the game and moved on for a month or two.
---
Heaven help them if they push it back to early 2020. DOOM 2 is going to have to compete with all sorts of massive titles, not least of which being Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
---
Also, you got a few assumptions wrong. If you are in passive, I can still kill you, whether you like it or not. In passive, you just get to die without fighting back. Wearing dense armor doesn't stop bullets, energy damage, or radiation, nor does it make you immune to explosive damage.
---
Wow that‚Äôs the real long game, kudos man, you‚Äôve got some serious patience and tact. I like that
---
I havent really experimented with all the endless array of non power armour protection. Now that I have levelled up a bit (level 60) I can survive the longer battles against higher level enemies and starting to get some better armour pieces so its definetely on the cards. No Bloodied weapons as yet tho
---
Never underestimate the power of two idiots with too much time on their hands :P
---
In an effort to balance all builds, Bethesda made Bloodied pointless. I mean... balanced. So now instead of being a high risk, high reward, expert-level balancing act, it's just high risk, no reward.
---
This makes me want to go back to the game. I quit shortly after release but reading this makes me crave fallout 76 again
---
you can't. dense + fireproof 3 means I take essentially no explosive damage. especially if I have a full health build.
---
bullets do squat so all you have left are energy mines and pumpkin grenades, to which I'll just jump servers.
---
*hooray for you*.
---
I've been almost playing daily since release. and I don't know where *you*'re coming from because the damage cap was the straw that broke the camel's back and made every pvper return to adventure.
---
nobody ever cared about pvers on survival.
---
Yes. It's all haters. There are none of us who have been Bethesda fans since Morrowind who tried the beta, after that pathetic 'letter' they released, the embarrassing stream with Ninja and the Rick and Morty VA, and ended up watching buildings just decide they didn't want to load today, played at 20fps, with crashes, observed dark areas randomly opening portals into the void, enough stash space to carry a single rifle around, open mics allowing me to hear every excruciating scream from a gamers young child wanting a turn or argument with a partner, invisible enemies killing me before I loaded, and so on.
---
The game at release deserved every single article. And it's not exactly rational to expect enough people to notice it's now (largely, but still far from completely) fixed year on.
---
It's been genuinely interesting observing Youtubers like Mattyplays go from being a massive optimistic defender of the game to a jaded PTSD ridden passive-aggressive critic of the game.
---
An interesting perspective to consider...  Did you ever pay cash for any atoms, which you then used to purchase a virtual item with an expectation that this item would remain available and not suddenly disappear when a character goes poof?
---
If so, I wonder if you could have a legal ground to stand on based on various state and federal laws around expected utility and warrantability.  I know my state has them, and they have teeth.
---
Essentially, if you paid cash for a thing, with an expectation that it would be available during your gameplay and wouldn't mysteriously disappear.  If it does mysteriously disappear, then there is grounds to bring in the fancy-pants legal attorneys.  I'm sure the EULA has stuff about no warrantability yada yada, but EULA's are easy to shred, as they are click-thru and nobody ever reads them.
---
Depending on your state your mileage may vary.  Another option would be to gather everybody effected in this way and see if you could turn it into a class-action.
---
The biggest problem is that just the cost of atoms alone isn't much, so you would have a battle to convince the value of the lost game time invested.  If anything, it'd make a good case to watch, and sometimes that is the only way to get a monolithic corporation to cleanup their act.
---
I was there, and rewriting history isn't going to fly. The same PC I'm playing smooth(ish)ly on at High/Ultra settings could barely get 20fps on Low/Medium during the B.E.T.A. and the game was flat out broken in a lot of respects.
---
Mr. Dick Turd was Lvl 90+ and in PA, so more than capable of taking care of 4 or 5 Lvl 60+ super mutants, especially since they‚Äôre attention was mostly on breaking my shit.

What platform are you on?
---
The yellow pink and indigo cannot be learned.
---
Ah I see why you‚Äôre desperate now
---
Thanks, I really wish I had too.
---
This is my experience as well. Since the last email telling me to do what you‚Äôve just outlined, no response. I‚Äôm hoping during business hours Monday maybe I‚Äôll be able to get somewhere.
---
Surely DR is DR no matter what armour? If X 01 gives 500+ DR what permutation or equivalent non power armour gives more or better protection from pvp?
---
I'd like it if hearted items just cannot be scrapped or dropped. Then you could "lock" things by hearting them.  (can you add a heart to junk items?)
---
Right now it just asks "are you sure???" and if you are spamming keys to scrap a bunch of weapons, I'm always paranoid I'll scrap something I DONT want to be scrapped.

People don't like it because there's no story, who hasn't skipped a cutscene before?

There's a damage cap in Adventure, too. Try shooting another player. It's 110 damage.
---
Here's why Adventure whiners in Survival was a problem, which you'd know if you had played from the start. I'm tried of giving this history lesson to people who pretend they have a clue.
---
Adventure started off as a Wild West for PvP players. There was a slap damage system in place that reduced PvP attack damage until both players "shook hands" and agreed to PvP. However, you could easily be killed in a single shot with slap damage. Your camp could be ruined at any time by any player. You weren't ever safe, anywhere or any time. People who came for Adventure had legitimate complaints. So, Bethesda created Survival. The problem was, how do you get people to leave Adventure? Bethesda's solution was to make PvP in Adventure much less viable, while providing lucrative incentives to draw people to Survival.
---
It worked, at first. Adventure became a place to enjoy PvE without death squads hunting you down. Survival drew all of the toxic players in. For the most part, everyone was happy. But then the Adventure players decided they wanted the special rewards that came with playing Survival. They entered Survival... And got murdered. Again and again and again. So they complained to Bethesda because they wanted to enjoy Survival without the consequences of PvP. For months, they complained and complained, until Bethesda turned Survival into a joke to appease the whiners. At that point, there was no reason to play Survival anymore. The whiners had made it worse for PvP than Adventure. And now the whiners are whining again.
---
Their greed is endless. They need to stop whining and recognize that PvP players need an outlet, and whiners have NO reason being there.
---
Cool
---
I've literally never had someone contest me at a workshop in adventure.
---
Ah, how do you mean-max junkies? What gear?
---
What 2nd and three stars?
---
They capped the damage but did they cap it for only bloodied? Or in general and running full health junkies is a better way.
---
I agree. I miss my bright headlamp so much. 
---
I'm also finding the targeting hud Plan to be impossible to find
---
that's mostly incorrect but ok. you sound like you just found a tinfoil in-game.
---
ragechronicles is essentially the spokesman for the meager pvp community, or what's left of it. go watch his old videos, from the beginning of survival until its death. which was around the time they came up with the damage cap, not when Bethesda actually axed the servers.
---
Bloodied is a glass cannon build, so when they capped the damage for everyone, they turned bloodied into "glass" and took out the "cannon." You can get to the 110 damage cap without being bloodied.
---
10-15k
---
Van crab spawn above it?
---
Not that I've seen. Maybe I'm blocking its spawn as I live in the bridge. Sometimes I see a mega sloth on the trees near by
---
The limits are only there because they use a singelplayer engine in an MMO  Lite.  
---
There is barely any survival and hoarding is basicly the only endgame you could do, if it was possible.
---
I tried survival once and it reiterated to me that I am certainly not into PvP lol.
---
I don't know if it's region or platform related but since pacifist mode was improved so your camp couldn't be destroyed, I noticed the griefers disappeared, it was a nice change to just roam about the wasteland without running into any of them trying to go me. Maybe I've just been spoilt without the annoyance! I just want to build my camps and slain the queen with my pals in peace!
---
Saying it's incorrect without specifying anything incorrect about it is pointless. And I wouldn't need to watch some other dude's videos on something I experienced myself.
---
The Survival servers didn't die from lack of interest. They died because the interacting aspects of Survival were taken away. Do you think it was PvPers asking to be nerfed? No, it was Adventure players asking to have it nerfed. Do you think competitive PvP players asked to have the top 3 players removed from the map? No, it was the Adventure players who wanted to get bonus XP from events without getting a target painted on their backs.
---
Survival was created to keep the PvPers away from Adventure, but the whiners tried to turn Survival into Adventure.
---
Stop trying to make the argument that PvP is dead in one of many threads on Reddit complaining about excessive griefing now that Survival is gone. Clearly, the evidence says otherwise. Use your head.
---
I've been contested there a fair bit as well. I avoid unless I'm desperate for cores.
---
I‚Äôll give ya 10k.
---
Yeah, that's still an issue.  It isn't exactly good if there's no point to using it over the .50 cal unless it's got some legendary effect.  Still, it's good to hear it's not hot garbage like it was before.  I still think of the glassed cavern where there's the soldiers lying dead next to all those scorchbeasts, mirelurks, a mirelurk queen, and fog crawlers.  Those guys kicked all that ass using miniguns but in actuality they sucked shit.
---
I spent 17k on mine
---
I'm not good at pvp, I'm just doing it for the prizes. I'm level fifty something. I hide in bushes like I would do in real life. If you can make it to like 2nd place you can probably go up a level an hour to an hour and a half. Today I went up about 2 levels while I was cleaning the house.
---
Your trained to think that's normal.    Games don't crash this often.  If you are dumping every half hour because the game might crash...   come on man.
---
Thank you for not saying I'm a dipshit for not dumping all my shit every half hour.   Wtf is with people thinking this is normal?!
---
Spent 15k on mine
---
I've gained 75 adventure levels on my mule exclusively through getting my NW character up to level 102.
---
4-6k XP for wins, 8-12k for Double XP Weekends.
---
I have one. Do you happen to have any unyielding sneak right arm, right leg, or chest?
---
It's based on what you do in NW, regardless of level.
---
I didn't try this until about  month ago and I was so surprised!
---
Because i was crazy and expected a game that doesnt crash every half hour.  Maybe we all need to raise our standards instead of adjusting the way we play.  This is bullshit and everyone knows it.
---
&gt;Saying it's incorrect without specifying anything incorrect about it is pointless.
---
that's why I told you to watch rage's videos. I'm not going to give you a, how did you put it? a history lesson. besides, he can probably present the issues with survival better than I ever could.
---
&gt;Stop trying to make the argument that PvP is dead
---
I don't have to. there was a relatively big poll a while back asking what mode people played the most. literally 1% of this sub has ever even stepped into survival servers. can't argue with numbers my dude.
---
&gt;in one of many threads on Reddit complaining about excessive griefing now that Survival is gone. Clearly, the evidence says otherwise.
---
you'd be right if it wasn't for the fact that actual pvpers returned to adventure a long time ago. there's nothing to protest when they themselves stopped playing survival long before Bethesda axed it.
---
to me, the "evidence" points to a bunch of dirtbags with nothing better to do other than stir drama.
---
So thats how i lost all my stuff when i was on pacifist...
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs good to know, I had no idea, thanks man
---
Yep. The Scorched main questline will still be there, but they‚Äôre modifying it to fit the existence of NPC and the 2103 time period.
---
That's shitty.  It's like telling the victim of a crime that, ¬Ø\_( ò_ ò)_/¬Ø that's how it is...  it's the new normal, and this is how we expect games to be from now on...   why are people not furious.  Every 15 minutes I have to run back to my camp to drop off all the shit I got?    Bullshit, just bullshit.
---
that's the majority of the playerbase. Fallout players aren't pvpers. there was a poll and literally 20 something people out of I don't know, 300+? actually played suvival.
---
Some weapons have mod-kit only mods that cannot be learned. You have to have the mod item to upgrade the weapon. Sort of like how you can't learn the Scout armor mods, but you can upgrade your Scout armor with the mod-kits in the Bunker.
---
Good point, at the very least itll point to an asnwer. Ill record my next few matches
---
I'm fairly new to this game, do buildings get damaged by other players or just enemies? Any other tips on the subject would be appreciated too man
---
/r/thathappened
---
They‚Äôre on gears 5
---
Bethesda broke Survival early on with the cap limit, which made it much more economical to grief in Adventure. Even then, people kept playing because it was fun. The Adventure players, who were not there to PvP, took the fun away from it with constant nerfs after that.
---
If you win, a round takes about 20 minutes. If you lose, it's shorter.
---
What is the start date?
---
If you want to PM me the name of the guy or gal who is doing this to you, I probably know him or her and can give you a tip on how to defend against it.
---
Ok, thanks üëç I‚Äôll save my 400 Atomic Points then üòä
---
Ok thanks for that üëç
---
If I'm not mistaken it's FFR due to pvp damage being limited to 110 per shot

I was a day one player who struggled like ass to kill the queen for months without legendary gear or weapons. My journey with the queen has been one with blood, sweat, and one game crash after another. I have lived through 30 minutes of only gas clouds or only sonic screams or never landing, more times than I can imagine. This is not balanced yes, this is justice.
---
Okay, I'll give it a go. Thank you!
---
*That's the dream*
---
you are absolutely not the issue my man, you deserve this win! its bethesda who allows stuff like this, players aren't to be blamed not one bit.
---
Spent 750 caps on mine, majorly lucked out and found a vendor who either didnt care or didnt know it was gonna go up in value
---
This story deserved a canibal end.
---
It should be stable between 40-70fps, the game has not been coded to run above 60fps 1080p and around the 50-60fps is the most stable point with the least amount of stuttering and tearing. The random lag spikes is due to the hamster powered trash boxes they call servers.
---
Why do people always try to deny other people's experience? 
---
I have had very few disconnects and crashes since the start, that is a fact.  (Actually more  CTD's in the past week than I used to see).
---
I have seen a few visual bugs -- everything going transparent at the Nukashine, the wall around the world, a stretched corpse or two.  Big deal.
---
I'm on a PS4 pro, in Europe, with a Fibre internet connection,
---
Can confirm it's massive cost. Pretty sure the signs cost the same as the backwoods bungalow in budget

Oooh I like that too. Something at least

You need radroach meat too but that spoils. Fortunately the cabin nearby has a radroach in it.

Just a rare drop, which I didn't know a few months back when I scrapped a yellow bat (picked up at the violent night trailer from a super mutant). Just sold an indigo lvl5 bat this week for 20k which I got from a collision course scorched on my alt :)
---
I only got it to work at bog Town , flatwoods, Sutton, grafton and mega stop. Couldn't get the other ones to trigger

I have the pleasure of working with this man on a daily basis to help fellow wastelanders eliminate the grind with a low chems, stims and homemade simples.

 If you have the chance be sure to join our playstation community simply look up Dr. Cj Martin! That way you can help us keep lag low from high friends lists and join on us at any time.

I dropped my fixer plan in a paper bag as soon as it was rewarded.
---
I still do not know the plan. Maybe I should join the encryptid event for that reward. Those players that completed the Sheepsquatch at my brother quest are pretty cool now that I think about it.
---
I would say it will have an effect simpkt because scorched can currently soawn at the 2 known locations that are being used in wastelanders (the crashed space stagion and the farm by vault76)
---
Oh, I know. I‚Äôm good. I just want my gear to get better ;)
---
Yep! Better go full on FPS and don‚Äôt use the in game aimbot!
---
i hate coming back and seeing the few crops i actually have (like 4 carrots and 2 berries) and destroyed by something dumb
---
I thought fallout 76 was about surviving I'm the wasteland as any faction you want to
---
Don't get me wrong, that player did bad shit, but a player that aligns with the raiders or the enclave would be pretty immersed in killing innocent people
---
Also you could've had friends with you if you are a multiplayer player
---
I have electrically charged and unstable isotope and have never been forced into pvp or killed even with an asshole stabbing my character repeatedly.
---
I understand that i guess i see a central market as a way to level prices and get a more diverse product mix. But i do undstand what ur saying thanks for the comment
---
&gt;but many people (i.e me) didn't run into them.
---
That is literally you trying to wave off the early bugs because of your own experience, so something something kettle black.
---
I think you already used yours. 
---
First you don't buy the recall card, you buy the recall circuit board used to craft one. And you can't craft them until you've advanced to the quest far enough to get the first card. What I don't remember if you need to pick it up as item or is it given as quest reward, either way if you can craft them you should have already gotten one.
---
I have huge pile of those boards on two of my chars I've not yet managed to get the ability to craft the cards...
---
Ur right about plenty of spaces, tyler county fair grounds would not be a bad place easy access for low levels. Not a bad thought thanks for the comment
---
I'm not outright accusing that person of it, but it's all too common on any social media platform. Attention whores make shit up. Fallout isn't immune to it. You'll find the Tiny Eye website to be valuable when someone posts a picture that says it's 'theirs' and come to find out it isn't.
---
also, do you have a friend that coule try logging in on your account on another xbox? just to see if the issue is the same so bethesda knows it's not your internet connection
---
Never had the good fortune to find the lobbing barrel kit then. From the above comments though it seems as if it spawns on some enemies and events. Reckon I'd of come across it by now. Guess not.
---
And fail. Randoms suck doing the quest.

And it burns burns burns..

Yeah TSE shotguns totally needed nerfing.

I had a guy dump 300+ nuke mines on me the other night. Lol I didnt know what to do. I just pawned them.off on vendor bots. I was wondering what is aim was... it was weird...
---
Use a mat or move the item futher from the walls. The wall ceiling is curved so when the floor footprint is legal it places it but then there isnt enough height so it places it above.
---
So basically, buff *everything* except bloodied? That's not gonna fly - people are already complaining about endgame - no need to make it easier. 
---
The problem is that the game is hard before you reach lvl 55 because you don't have a full perk loadout (which makes ballistic weapons hugely underpowered) and it's much too easy after lvl 100 when your perks are fully set-up. 
---
Buffing legendary effects is only going to effect end-game players, and that's really not going to fix the fundamental weakness in the game which is the perk system.
---
Another unused space right, im thinking there are a lot of unused spaces and really what a better place to sell stuff then a mall. U would have no loading issues either because its an inside cell, correct me if im wrong havent been there in a bit. Great idea thanks for the comment.

There's also a community goal running where we have to kill millions of Scorched, so all the adds she spawns should be counting for that.

&gt;So basically, buff everything except bloodied? That's not gonna fly - people are already complaining about endgame - no need to make it easier.

Buff the currently useless/underpowered shit, yeah.
---
Bloodied, to a lesser extent Junkies, are the best right now and have been for a good while. Executioner, Furious and Two-Shot are all sub-par. Everything else is absolute trash.
---
Well, community wanted that nerf.
---
taht is a dev room item . not only that . it was ahcked in the game . on another note. im gona try and get the lazer musket.
---
If you are doing the quest line it gives you a recail keycard.
---
Did you want shotguns to lose their usefulness? Cos that's what we got. I have a TSE Pump, fully modified, with maxed out perks and SPECIAL, and I still do the lowest DPS of my group.
---
Or I did before 3 out of 4 of us quit.
---
Haha to kill people in passifist for their junk I bet :p
---
It‚Äòs almost the same bro.....isn‚Äòt it?
---
&gt;TSE have all been farmed legit as well?
---
dont know on console. but on pc its a 50%50 . the rest ware hacked in. they ware given the status of tse . you can eddit  legendery effects on pc (by hacking) dont know if you count that as duping tho.. 
---
&gt;If your complaint is the gear and the fact its been 'duped' everywhere, then why don't you have a set by now?
---
not complaining my dude. i was saying two shot explosive dosent mean shit. its just 45% damage increse lol(unbless you run a gap plas or a shotgun with the raid pa)
---
and i sayd its pointless to run sent ass when on pc the meta is heavy faster fire rate with explosive and the new raid PA. (the high fire rate makes you staggerd breaking the effect with easy ) hell most weapons i have been seeing in pvp (on pc) have been gat plasmas(and i started using them before everyone ealse.). with explosive. (i use vampire cus it counters kinda the raid pa with the extra healing). chill dawg dont be so hostile. xD
---
Not a bad thought. One of my reason behind this was more to bring the community together and interact more. I dont think players use their mic enough or really interact with other players. One thing that would be cool is actually closing up the build circle for the camps and that would allow players to build closer together. Great idea thanks for the comment

Really???.. what for to build schools and democracy??
---
That is funny and really cool idea, im going to put that in the edit notes in orginal post...thank u great idea
---
You should just team up with high level randoms
---
I charge 76 caps for a majority of my plans, mods n recipes
---
Upvoted, it took me 3 posts with hundreds of up votes to get back stuff me and my wife lost in v94, including uncut video of this happening with over 1k views on YouTube. 
---
It‚Äôs either another rare bug or someone hacked your account and deleted your characters. They promised 2 factor authentication to be added, hopefully they will implement it before more people lose everything.
---
Commenting for traction - this is unacceptable there isn‚Äôt safe and user friendly ways to get such issues fixed without hoping a Reddit post gets noticed!!! Bethesda hope you‚Äôre listening!!!
---
Yeah i lole it also, gives u time to build up an iventor. Ive been wanting to make and sell berry mentats and that would be a great way to do it and gave time to build an inventory of it. Thank u for the comment really appreciate it
---
Refresh me on the mechanics here...
---
He was in a still claiming workshop, but hadn't actually damaged you at all. How did you get open PvP?
---
People only seem to flock to special events for a couple of days then the interest /attendance drops. If they had done it sooner no one would be doing the event at Halloween.
---
I hope your characters are recovered very soon. Being knew to the FO series (Oblivion and Skyrim fan normally) They they have proven they can recover info, though it may be from a previous save. They BETTER sit up and take notice, and STOP being STUPID about it! Keep on them! Good luck! You have ppl in your corner!
---
I'll trade you 50 reggie nukies for 50 nukie cherries
---
I might had a bug so. Luckily a group of people nuked Morgantown, I joined them on their farm and I was able to farm some flux :)
---
I would be extremely pissed off if that happend to me. I'm currently grinding to get every magazine in the game, trying to make a comic book store. If I'd lost all that, I'd go ballistic.
---
I didnt know that was possible really?
---
Ahh well umm no it's not possible.... shh
---
7 food buffs that stack for +95% dmg, +3 str from deathclaw wellington too. bobblehead and magazine for +50% dmg, sneak perks for triple dmg melee, whiskey, fury, and the optional nukashine for the big finish. With a meat hook youd do even more damage because you can stack one handed AND unarmed perks.
---
I solo the queen all the time if I bother to go out and get all the food buffs, its REALLY broken that the melee buffs stack, they shouldnt let me buff up my weapon to an EASY 7k
---
Yeah me as well, i love thise mutations i dont even hit low level enimies they die as soon as they hit me so funny.
---
36 SPECIAL points is right for level 30. Think there might have been something buggy happening with an update giving an extra point before it was due though. I could swear I got a perk card but no SPECIAL point when I levelled up to 39 a couple of days back. When I added everything up though my points total were correct for my level. Thought I must have imagined it but this sounds weirdly similar!
---
That‚Äôs not cheating. It‚Äôs weird game feature of nuka mine and grenade. 
---
These two explosives‚Äôs radiation damage ignores pacify mode and work as environment damage so you can kill non-power armored player even with pacifist mode.
---
full set of zealots trapper armor(with +1str and harder to detect) and the radiation backpack for me. no radshield required to stomp the queen solo.
---
I run diluted: rad-x and am able to stand in front of her. Is there something I‚Äôm missing? I haven‚Äôt noticed any damage change or radiation besides her large pushback (and that‚Äôs a single blast of +3).
---
Oh good i hope not im always on pacifist and carry a lot of junk...lol thanks
---
I play for couple of days and im 29-30 level. So far only one high level guy killed me while rest of the people are okay. What i remember the most is i was in vicinity of a wanted guy,i didnt realised at first,when i checked the map he was very close to me. I bumped at him about 50 yards away,instant nope and turned around. He catches up to me and wave. He orders me to follow him,in the end he gave me 2 guns which i still use.
---
I dont have any cherries but ill pay u 5 caps each for the nuka colas
---
I almost spent 20k but got it for 15k so im happy
---
In Skyrim I think they were NPC‚Äôs. That‚Äôs why they moved a little bit and had the same trade menu screen as a follower
---
I'll come
---
Cough cough level 250+ dude that the entire continent suspects of cheating. Knows to be cheating.
---
I want to know how people get vendors in there? Also where to find this magic mat?
---
Meat hook no longer gains double bonuses, it‚Äôs now solely classified as an unarmed weapon.
---
Maybe what Bethesda should do is create some type of program or what ever that places players on pacifist with other players on pacifist and players on pvp etc....that would be a thought dont create new servers but group players in a server based on what they are set at and if u change ur setting while in game u get booted. That actually might help not sure how hard it would be to implement. Maybe someone create a post based on this and see what players think. If no one does i will im bored and at work for 12 hrs...lol
---
I signed up for the contest and while I didn't get judged I've heard of plenty of people say he held up his side of the contest
---
On this note: the game doesn‚Äôt bother rendering your camp getting attacked unless there‚Äôs a player nearby. So... if you go to my camp and you hear things blowing up, I think it‚Äôs common courtesy to sort that out. I certainly do it for other people.
---
My people used to slaughter that crew. Glad he is still active. Hope I can come back soon.
---
Thank you so much, could you tell me how to get the camera? I've looked online but I couldn't find anything relating to it
---
Also watch out fixing your power armor at public PA stations, it's still a thing that people can nick your armor whilst your repairing it.
---
Hasn't happened to me but every time I see someone fixing theirs I warn them it could happen
---
Still looking for nuka colas or nuka grenades. Paying well!
---
Still looking for nuka colas or nuka grenades. Paying well
---
You used to just have to randomly look in all of the sight seeing locations. But they listened to complaints and made it much easier. The tourist's location is now shown on the map after looking in the personal terminal at your camp
---
Aww what? I think it sounds great, and coupled with the video of the land wreathed in fire, l personally love it.
---
me waiting to tell the teacher I pooped my pants
---
Stealth and sneak.
---
As of when and do you have a source on that? 
---
Not tryna be a dick, just curious
---
If they don‚Äôt get this so that they can promise that lost gear/characters can be restored I don‚Äôt think I can relay on playing anymore. Playing since beta with one character and 2-6h everyday. That‚Äôs too much time and devotion spent on anything in my life. So if it means that I have to stop playing until this is resolved than I will. Haven even tried the raids cause I scared that I‚Äôll loos my stuff
---
Isn't it a quest reward? Why does it go for so much?
---
Thanks friend!
---
I got a fireplace in there which is going to kill me from carbon monoxide in my sleep.
---
you missed the bloody build like 20-40 rad damage and they drop dead its why most people refuse to team with them in vaults and raids since they either 1 shot things or die 55 times a raid 
---
add in the fact you can't use rad sponge and other team based skills around them and they are fragile loner builds
---
I think a simpler solution would just be having the ability to tag something as visible or not visible, and for armor to rest on top of both what‚Äôs currently considered under armor and outfits.
---
I cant remember which but I have a mod in FO4 (sorry, running 150 concurrent ones so I can‚Äôt tell you what does what without looking it up) that enables this feature at a workbench.
---
Cringe as fuck.
---
I know T51-B plans drop from Treasure Maps, and Im fairly certain that T-60 plans drop from Brotherhood quests
---
Id love a master list of plan locations tbf, so i know whether to bother grinding certain events
---
Considering that my Zealot's Dragon does more raw damage to the Queen than your average endgame heavy weapon even accounting for the reload time... Yeah, that's gonna be a no from me, dawg.
---
Dang man I hope they help you! 
---
I can‚Äôt believe stuff like this still happens.
---
You dropped your ü¶Ä's
---
I don't know about on Xbox, but i's been like that on PS4 since NW dropped.
---
Idk tbh I just know ez money
---
And that the fixer is one of if not the best gun in the game rn
---
I just want the option to replace the Main theme with Johnny Cash's version of  "Ring of Fire"
---
Bonus steps for Prime recievers(be it bloodied builds for queen n such) is basically nuke whitesprings and farm flux items, then depending on ammo you're making(which in my case is 5mm for my minigun) is to nuke the place which houses the most single type flux.
---
I usually nuke near the turtle picture in the toxic valley area for all the violet flux I can pick.
---
since patch 13? well that frees up some perks lol.
---
This is pretty well thought out and would be amazing to see added
---
And in the confines of the game that capitalist society pushed the world into a nuclear hellfire. And we're supposed to do better. Ffs ITS IN THE OVERSEER'S LOGS that we should do better.
---
T60 Power Armour plans also come from treasure maps
---
yes you get t60 part plans from distant thundar event
---
I run Weightless Shadowed for my Chameleon build; I currently have a full set of Combat, but honestly, that's just because Combat was easier to get ahold of (read: Meat Week rewards). I'll probably swap out the limb pieces with Metal for the extra DR.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ sorry.  This is why I only drop plans and sometimes a stimpak or water now.
---
people have been doing this for ages, its because the food buffs all stack together for an incredible +95% melee damage and +3str. add in bobbleheads and magazines if you really wanna show off, and a nukashine for the big finish. I can do damage like this without high str, its just bloody weapons and food buffs.
---
That‚Äòs why we sell items for 5 stashboxes full of armor and weapons.... looooooooool.
---
I hear Vanguard Commandos/Heavy Gunners are popular now, which combined with V FFR guns you can give sustained DPS but keep your health from dropping and maintain power armour levels of DR.
---
DR/ER is capped at 300 for PvP however so full Vanguard isn't gunna be beneficial beyond PvE.
---
Bullshit.
---
Wrong, stop spreading wrong information.
---
The game is rather dead as of right now, so most likely months. I farmed mine back in June/July, until level 100.
---
Sorry you're too stupid to understand. But you missed the entire damn point, and It's not my job to spoon feed it to you. Buhbye now loser.
---
Is his gamer tag Dr. Martin?? I wanna know just in case I see him, I might wanna try one of his quests
---
I used mine on my first character yes. On the second I didn't get neither the circuit or the card. You obtain the receipt as a quest reward in Hornwrite tower. But I can't remember if it gives you the card too usually.
---
All of my 4 unyielding armor is shadowed, no chameleon mutation, 1 chameleon marine sneak armor piece, max sneak perk card, silencer on rifle, squat 24/7. Sometimes i am seen but i oneshot the creature before it can do any damage.
---
EULA are often illegal themselves if they shit all over consumer protection laws!
---
Avoid changing weapons when sneaking. There is a bug that sometimes causes Caution or Danger whe  switching. Heavy Armor makes sneaking harder. If you're using BOS Combat, try shadowed with muffled. Ultralight helps too. Escape Artist is important and if you're Bloodied, go Unyielding. Suppressors on Weapon seem to make a difference. The more bullets you shoot seems to make enemies find you faster. Although it does seem like some enemies share a hive mind, like scorched and ghouls
---
It happened to me once, I died when the sheepS was killed, didn't got any notification that I completed the event or anything, it pissed me. 10 minutes later I opened my pip boy and saw that I had sheepS mascot head, I had the loot and xp but never had the notification.
---
Nothing wrong with this... if you spent the time perfecting this then all the more power to you my friend!
---
How do you get strangler blooms to even spawn?
---
LOL this game needs a serious re-balance!
---
A lot of games with Halloween DLC are starting really late in the month, which is also weird to me.  Right now is the best time for those kind of events to be starting, so you can enjoy the items while it's halloween season.  Kinda kills the buzz to be collecting halloween themed items in november.
---
But you don‚Äôt get the legendary or the steel from the robots
---
No idea where I got this info from. Thought I had seen it in patch notes, but looking back I can‚Äôt find anything. Came back from a break recently and something made me think they fixed the meat hook so I turned my bloodied swing speed meat hook into scrip. Oops
---
Im sure the counter is fake.  This is just a time-gate to give us something to do whilst we wait for new content.
---
The fact it isnt updated on weekends suggests someone has to manually update the count as there is no automation. The whole thing is just made up.
---
It should give you a card.
---
And the super sledge will do more damage!
---
It's a heck of a task to farm the plans. 
---
Get someone to craft it for you, instead.
---
I just wish you didn't have to mention atoms. We don't need more gameplay effecting stuff in the atom store.
---
I think finding them at spawns is probably faster.
---
I am also bloody build. Diluted Rad-X and I don‚Äôt take damage except for that 3 rad hit she does as a push back maybe once or twice a fight.
---
I'm kinda inclined to agree on this point. Suspect and shady lol
---
lol okay so you downvoted me and spit out bad info? cool thanks
---
Sure and thnx
---
They wont.  Too much love at Bethesda for Battle Royal hype
---
An AA Gauss seemed to do the trick whenever it came knocking
---
I don't mind helping if you're still going to want to try later today/tonight. Still have at least 1 keycard too since trying to do it over and over...
---
The 3 ranks of Skeet Shooter under PER makes a world of difference. Also, if you have the twisted mustles mutations, that affects your shorgun dps. You gktta try to hit as many pellets as you are able for the shotfun to do decent damage.
---
Unfortunately most video games aren't very realistic when it comes to shotguns. In RL these things are absolutely lethal up to a distance of maybe 40 to 45 meters.
---
Pretty sure my meathook is doing just as much damage as it always has
---
4 harder to detect when sneaking armor pieces, 1 chameleon armor piece. sneak3, escape artist and when moving and jumping in sneak means no1 can VATS you!
---
The description reads: Increased movement speed whilst sneaking. It sounds useful but I'm wondering if it offers much of a speed boost. I was hoping with both legs it would be noticeable.
---
Look, that thing about your power armor being stolen was floating around since beta and no one provided any proof about it.
---
Even one guy tested and posted a big post about it proving it is no true.
---
I would happily test out my fully modded power armor with you if you want.
---
Unless you press R to drop it, no one else can take it.
---
It's more than just a user interface bug, the game is glitching out and confusing a placed frame with a dropped one!
---
It doesn't happen all the time, which makes it difficult to test for.
---
Caution doesn't mean the enemies found you yet. If you sneak-attack an opponent, they'll know where the bullet came from and go there to look for you, even if they didn't detect you. So it's best to move around and not stay in the same place for too long, because they'll definitely notice you once you and the enemy make direct contact.
---
Ohhh I think I‚Äôve seen that yeah it actually does I‚Äôve had a combat armor left arm piece that had that effect, I did noticed I moved slightly quicker while crouching I made sure to check by removing it and I was correct as I moved slower
---
Mine used to be until they nerfed them.
---
Well im refining mine and moving points arround since im not too far away from my goal
---
At the end of the day, if ur stupid enough 2 take a workshop with a load of junk on u, it should be taken from u.
---
There is no telling with this game so it's a play at your own risk.
---
Lol, actually I am but that's besides the point :) 
---
I'm interested in your damage numbers. What can you expect from an average headshot? Have you tried with anti armor or two shot equivalent? If so, how did it stack up? Or if not, have you tried a non legendary one? If you are a frequent flyer, perhaps you wouldn't mind doing some testing on your next queen run? 
---
Also How would you feel if it was an exterminators? I would it be worth it it then, for the occasions where you fight mirelurks? If you got one from mumbles would you keep or scrip it? 
---
PS. Just if anyone is wondering about the post title, I'm not just hating on slayers effects. I'm genuinely interested in alternative build options and want someone to change my mind.
---
If everyone is doing the 'good' thing most of the time, it would get boring.  
---
IRL, that person would be a hassle and dealt with accordingly. If he/she keeps doing it then it's ruining the game for someone.  
---
Griefers as they are called have been dealt with time and again by other players.
---
I agree, but with Bethesda recent rep for updates, I feel they purposely put this event at the latest date possible to ensure they have enough time to get it right..
---
Instead of for example: launching the event on the 23rd and delaying it a week cause it‚Äôs not ready or releasing the update broken!
---
The mats and rugs are in floor decor.
---
There's really no point trying to bother splitting the playerbase like this. Especially since people seem to forget you can literally use the nuke silos to drop bombs on other players and their property and otherwise make them very upset and want to complain on reddit about it.
---
Do you see Sleek displayed in Effects tab of the Pip Boy?
---
Barring one piece I got full sentinel/vanguard but I'm trying to drop one or 2 van pieces for harder to detect, just I use Urban Scout limbs so they're pretty rare and hard to trade for, and I feel some people probably end up scripping HtD pieces in the search for more conventional god rolls.
---
Yeah I counted mine and with trying to get the cards I needed I would need another 30 to 40 levels to hit the build fully so I just wanted to make a purpose built character.
---
Yeah I posted a video with an example of how broke the bungalow was on Twitter.. and a couple days later I was refunded.. I urge you and everyone who purchased to contact Bethesda support.. you all deserve a refund this kinda behaviour is unacceptable!
---
Yeah just feels like the home in and I seem to catch bullets like I'm in danger. I'll run West Tek later and try and be more mobile and see if that makes a difference.
---
People selling these plans at such prices are being a little ridiculous imo, though I'll admit paid 10k for mine. Actually finished encryptid about 20 times since it started but never got the plan, so thanks again to Bethesda.
---
Meanwhile people that started playing 2 months ago have plans to sell AND get actual legendary fixers to further inflate the market...
---
Dont worry about people say ask ur question its their choice to click on ur post. U can farm Morgantown airport, 308, shotgun shells, 38 and 10mm. Try using melee as much as u can and try to develop ir character for melee. Morgantown is the easiest at ur level and u can run through it 100 times just fast travel away and come back maybe place ur camp next to the train station and fast travel to vault and back cost no caps. Also include the train station another good place and ita all right there. I didnt start crafting ammo til i was maybe lvl 75 when it was a lot easier to kill enemies. Then that is another conversation. When u get better head up to the dam and grafton steel and kill super mutants then u will get caps and more xp. One thing to remember to always get sleep the well rested perk adds to ur xp. There are other xp boosting things but that is the easiest and least used. If ur on ps4 i can give u some ammo to help u out if ur really having problems or could run u through and show u how i do. Im a lvl 130
---
Did you take any pictures?
---
Idk why you getting downvotes. They were killed only by rads has nothing to do with plaguewalker. And tbh if you died on a vendor from rads you prob deserved it with how long you were taking.
---
So I have chameleon mutation, 3 pieces unyeilding armor with shadowed mod, 2 pieces of chameleon armor. I'd say i'm in caution atleast half the time. Both of my weapons are silenced, I crouch all the time and at times I still get noticed even when not moving. I have kilked SB's standing right in front of me without them seeing me and the sneak perk card    only at level 2.
---
I'm from Lithuania, GMT+3
---
I remember it being a quest reward after creating the keycard or something. Was it changed or always this way? I know for sure I got the plans, first time, either as a quest reward or event reward. First time definitely, though. I feel special for knowing the plans.
---
Ok , that's a piece of interesting info.... So if you blueprint the vending machine the inventory stays in the machine
---
I have yet to see this much either.  I really don‚Äôt engage in pvp unless I have to. I play with my dad so we‚Äôre all about making cool camps and just adventuring so we don‚Äôt really find pvp interesting although we understand why people do it. I also only claim workshops when‚Äôs it‚Äôs the daily challenge. I don‚Äôt defend them I‚Äôm just in it for the xp and materials man.
---
Not a bad idea. Who knows what will happen in the future or how wastelanders will work into the game, people have an idea but nothing concrete. Thanks for the comment
---
Tbh I'm set up for dissapointment with the event, Fasnacht and Meat Week were ok n all but it's just not Fallout. This is coming from a massive BGS fan who strongly believes they are better for the franchise than say, Obsidian. But these events are so childish in nature and the tone is just so overly happy and make no sense in the setting. 
---
I'm 100% down for wacky fun like fighting ghouls covered in bright paint in Kiddie Kingdom or allowing a brain in a jar to convulse over the mere sound of my breathing, but this stuff is just bland gameplay-wise and never has anything actually *interesting* going on. I guess at least Meat Week had Grahm?
---
Ok thanks
---
Your way past the sneak cap
---
All I want is the ability to roleplay in this game without it being taken as me being a dick. I want to shoot some other players.(preferably raiders)
---
I'm only level 12. Yesterday I got in an area where the enemies were a bit too high level for me (it was a horde of scorched that were all in the 20s) and there was a higher level person there that ended up saving me by killing them while I ran around smacking them with my walking cane.
---
Your mutation does nothing unless your in weightless gear FYI
---
The event itself is broken, 80% of the time it fails because noone wants to be a conduit because it does so much dmg... Its not even worth participating because its just a waste of aid and ammo
---
Explosive breaks stealth
---
Vault Raids... I think they‚Äôre more guilty of this stigma
---
Ill pay for ur nuka colad. I dont have nuka cherry
---
Treasure maps an distant thunder
---
Thats very cool to share that with ur dad, very cool. Workshops are nice sometimes. I take them but never defend them unless i can defend from outside the kill zone. I would rather just wait til its taken by someone else, sneak back pick the locks and take what i want. Then i use my buddy to kill me so i lose nothing and gain the resources. It has worked so far. Thanks for the comment
---
The character I‚Äôm currently playing is level 37. I‚Äôm focusing my efforts in high level areas. I‚Äôve hit every obstacle you can imagine. I spend time housekeeping each time I play (farming, repairing, etc). If you need caps, go to Whitesprings and pick-up everything you see and sell it to the vendor bots until you hit the daily limit.
---
I see differing views on this, but from my experience it does. Just wish there was an effect that could match it, Commandos amd Heavy Gunners have FFR whilst Riflemen have nowt.
---
My excavator light still shines to the right from my feet in 3rd person. We need updates so badly.
---
I have 2 characters around level 150 with a different build. 1 has 7int and the other has 9. No Unyielding on both and I got everything so far. I still don't believe higher int can't get more. Same for luck, I don't believe it gives better dropps or better weapons from Mama Mur :)
---
I dont see anything wrong with that at all i think its great. This game sgould be for everyone and not discourage play what ever form it takes. Thanks for the comment
---
maybe not the sawed off. The chances of every pellet hitting at anything over 20 meters is pretty low. I've got a short 4/10 for killin snakes when fishing and it's only good at about 15ft or less with bird shot.
---
Now, a 12 gauge I've owned a sawed off, but ive shot them many times. They hold a 2 ft spread at 15ft. and a 4-5 ft spread at 30ft. 
---
My 12 gauge that I own with a full choke holds a 1ft spread at 30 meters. Screw in an extra full and I can get that 1ft at 40meters.
---
Yeah......the shot guns on this game are some of the most unrealistic, but I've still seen worse on video games.
---
But wouldn't you want to cook faster in an apocalyptic setting so that roaming raiders and feral ghouls can't attack you while you are sheepishly cooking one chunk of mole rat meat at a time?
---
You have to completely exit the game to fix this, waking back to an empty event area is pointless. All the loot is despawned once you leave the server.
---
Speed Demon maxes out your BMS so any effects or perks effecting it will be redundant.
---
Game crash or freeze?
---
In Fallout 2 it's revealed that the vault experiments were an attempt to test human adaption to life onboard spaceships. If you think about it, vault 76 is a pretty good experiment of this even if its experiment was simply "Give narcissists jobs they are heavily overqualified for."
---
Because spaceships have limited space and factor in that they're not gonna waste any space on a low priority job such as janitor or waste management, that means overqualified people will definitely be doing the shit work.
---
Personally, if this is an experiment of that, then our vault is a failure. We let our talent and genius get to our heads, just read the vault terminal entries. Not only that, we could be seen as "taking revenge" upon one another
---
Everyone knows this, and on top of that, there‚Äôs another 2 vaults you missed that have storylines involved in 76
---
Haven't seen any of these posts
---
Medic Legendary
---
I wanted to include the other 2 vaults, I just couldn't find out what their functions were. Also this technically was meant for fun or to discuss what people know about the vaults
---
Melee gives you a higher chance of disease. Sometimes even if you kill them first in melee, you'll get rad worms or something. If you shoot them with a shotgun, there's no chance of disease unless they hit you. Personally, I think they need to make the negatives of diseases greater. Like they did with addictions. You'd have to use antibiotics or cure disease to get rid of the negatives. This is how they could help balance it
---
Mods my manüëç Got some great alternatives as well, like Jingle Jangle or someone made their own take on the theme, called 'Creepy Menu Music' or something which was quality.
---
I want some electroshock therapy from that Aid bot. üòä
---
If Scorched beasts mostly spawns in The South East part of The map we probably should make it so People with camps in those region thats highly infeasted with scorched beasts should be able to build ASAM turrets but scorched beasts arent dangerous they are just annyoing to kill cuz they are a flying tank that makes your screen fucked up by its screaming so a way to take away The annyoing part of scorched beasts attacking your camp would be easy to fix If we are able to build ASAMs
---
I agree this is a great currency becuase u have no cap on what u can hold. I have been spending the last month making 556 and have a lot of it spread across all my alts. I sell in vendor for 2 caps and use in trades as one cap. Most of the time i will lower the price if i want to move it and need caps, but really i dont ever really need caps. I also make 308, 50 and 45. I have shotgun shells and flamer fuel i have been sitting on for a long time. I think if i was to rank them according to my sales only it would be (1) 556 (2) 50 (3) 308 and last 45. But 556 is king.
---
I don't want to sell. I want to collect.
---
Oh ha that was you
---
it would depend on where your build is and where you want to go with it.. 
---
its difficult to say without knowing...
---
Great, now this will happen while I‚Äôm trying to do just enough damage to get some drops off her. I hope to god a player doesn‚Äôt do this while we‚Äôre all joined up, but alas. It probably will happen, and my heart will be sad
---
Well then my guy good luck to you! I hope this method works for you like it did for me.. I mustn‚Äôt stop warning you tho.. this is a jarring method it almost sent me insane getting the indigo üòÇ
---
The griefer was triggering the plague walker in order to detonate the nuke mine
---
[deleted]
---
You can definitely make 2 handed melee into a Frontline heavy hitter. Can I ask what kind of weapon and armors you're using?
---
Thanks man!!
---
Probably, I had an Unyielding set on one character and a bolstering on the other. I didn't see how int gives mods when scrapping. I got everything really randomly.
---
The area has to be ‚Äúin bloom‚Äù
---
Not all of us.
---
I‚Äôve seen people post them to fallout facebook pages, I‚Äôve seen a couple on twitter and people are reporting it on YouTube
---
Looks great.
---
I've only ever seen that happen immediately after the quest, either me or stalking another player, never at any other time... :(
---
Oh haven't seen any here, and this is usually the place people go to post bugs
---
I was the exact same.. that was the one thing I was excited most for. I use my party chat mixer and turn the voices all the way up while I‚Äôm on main menu.
---
Also.. are you on Xbox and is your name the same as your gt? I think I‚Äôve seen you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
If that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a resource issue they‚Äôre testing
---
The weapons are not designed that way anymore, laser rifles are short-range only now for the most part and plasmas are long-range
---
Just a saying: the apprentice to the great master is called the grasshopper...
---
I got the plan first try lmao
---
I built at the dual node lead/acid fissure site and kept things minimal, only had an extractor and power connectors outside the cave and I was left alone.  If I built much else I had attack after attack.  I have seen some build there using mostly foundations outside but I never cared for that myself.
---
Just because it doesn't do one thing doesn't mean it doesn't do anything .)
---
EG... the higher your int, the more XP you get, and when crafting your items get a larger healthbar. Luck... the more luck you have the larger the healthbars on found items (over 15, you even get condition over 100%), which translates in higher cap value when selling.
---
Makes sense
---
See my post about getting killed over a 10 cap bounty
---
You need to download Imgur and upload to there and then post the link here or on a update post to let everyone see. I hate that you can just directly post but it's whatever
---
Or to borrow some brown sugar?
---
I try but I‚Äôm always missing adhesive.
---
Xbox
---
Ok so im legitimately asking why should this game be for everyone? No other game is for everyone. Not that i know of anyway. Im not mad at pvpers wanting to shoot people or the pve folks who just want to be left alone. Its on Bathesda for trying to dip in the pockets of both and doing a poor job. I dont believe that there is some middle ground here. Most people are here for fallout. Not pvp. If Bathesda implements more forced pvp then those guys still wont have anyone to shoot because people will stop playing. And i agree with you griefers suck.
---
That should work! 
---
I usually have to explain to people in states how I'm 6 hours ahead and eventually go to bed lol
---
It was kind of a jerk move, but the game isn't called happy cooperation simulator 76, it's a survival rpg where you can role play as an a hole if you want to. This isn't the Sims. Without threats to you or your camp, what fun is a game like this? I'm sad they took away the survival mode, it was the only way to play  it that actually felt like a dangerous survival game. The quest content isn't good enough to play this full time as a solo or co-op game.
---
The "event overhaul" should have fixed this, but their priorities were elsewhere and they never claimed to have fixed it.  It's a known issue - dying at the same time an event completes prevents you from respawning.
---
The vault is judged on the whole. More than most have... Grown accustomed to the wasteland. When the the Enclave sends another troop to investigate Appalachia, they'll try to purge us
---
This. A lot of good points here on how to get ammo, but having alternates that use the stuff you usually don‚Äôt will allow you to rack up more ammo for your favourites.
---
I guess you mean "forest", if so, there is no difference besides the color.
---
It's neither.  Your camera is just stuck orbiting your corpse when this happens.
---
Thank you. If it becomes too much of a problem for me then I will start a new character.
---
Because this was supposed to be a survival rpg, not the Fallout edition of the Sims. I've got no problem with Adventure mode, but what's the point of a survival rpg with no danger, risk, or actual survival mechanics? By level 50 I was so overloaded with food, purified water, and stimpacks the game was basically over because there's nothing in the world that can beat you. The game and story aren't good enough to be taken as a single player or co-op rpg and there's no element of survival in it as a survival rpg. It just doesn't work either way. it was a bad idea to get rid of survival mode. Once I got the hang of it, it was the only way to play Fallout 76 with any level of tension or excitement.
---
GoToSleep!GoToSleep!GoToSleep!
---
Glad it actually worked for you üòÇ. All the quests should work like that!
---
Obviously they do have something to do, you just don't like it. They aren't cheating, or breaking the game and soon with human npc's there will be factions. I personally like feeling a little danger when I play.
---
3% per mutation no cap, this will make it balanced because running all possible mutations have negative effects.
---
Yeah that is a very good idea. Hanks for the comment
---
I'll be sure to be wearing my uniform, then. Sorry, y'all, but these folks seem to actually know what they're doing, mostly.
---
Pretty sure forest has a higher defense rating. Forest being heavy, ubarn being light. But don't know 100%
---
I don't know which Fallout 76 game you're playing but this hasn't been my experience.
---
Sure, but make them a bit harder to get.
---
It's coming back. They want to reinvent the concept, but they said that right now they want to launch Wastelanders and get that going first which makes sense. Some form of PvP may come back in adventure mode since there will now be joinable factions. I would welcome that since this is supposed to be a survival rpg, not Fallout 5. Making an adventure mode in the first place was a huge mistake.
---
I find the soft serve location works better as nobody camps there
---
Seems I get 50 one star pieces of crap for every 3 star, which also is usually crap...
---
Yeah I play on PlayStation so I‚Äôm all too aware of how many bugs resurface with every patch and update... and it will use the broken instance for tech.... so expect lots of characters to lose their whole inventories!
---
What weapons with what prefix and and third star? What armor? What perks? What play style?
---
Not true. I have two characters. One is an Enclave loyalist in Adventure mode to experience new content and the other was a raider in survival mode and survival mode was by far the better experience imho. It actually felt like I was trying to survive and scavenge in a dangerous world instead of the boring Sim's Fallout Edition that adventure mode has become.
---
Thank you for this. Quick question, do stealth headshots do more damage than in-combat headshots?
---
&gt; No idea if that's possible on consoles
---
You know damn well it's not lol. We console gamers aren't trusted with such important files.
---
You probably won't need pack rat all that often, but I can recommend enforcer in agility. Shotgun builds can totally be viable. Maybe lose a couple of strength points and look into some more crit luck cards?
---
Edit: ironclad might not be all that useful. For that many perk points for that much damage resist, I dunno. If you have good armour you won't need that card really. Invest more in crit luck
---
Bloodied, explosive/ffr
---
Either vats crit, or heavy gunner.
---
Classic reference to kung fu tv series
---
Sorry to everyone who messaged me or asked to play. I've been really sidetracked at the mo, currently sorting a house move. Hopefully won't be long
---
Sounds like a bgs game
---
And there is a civil war reenactor spawn nearby.
---
My suggestion is close to that, 3% dmg per mutation no cap needed as using all mutations have negative‚Äôs slightly worse then using 5 addictions. 
---
For armour to make it slightly unique my suggestion is +1 dr/er per mutation and +1 special with 18 mutations.
---
Or other option make it work only with 18 mutations (no effect or full effect)
---
I have over 100k spread across my alts, just as good as caps. I make all mine use the perk cards and excavator armor and dont be afraid to take workshops with lead or acid. U can also buy it i always sell it most of the time 1 cap some of the times 2 caps...if ur on ps4 let me know and i can hook u up.
---
&gt;That‚Äôs not cheating.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;These two explosives‚Äôs radiation damage ignores pacify mode   
---
&gt;you can kill non-power armored player even with pacifist mode. 
---
QED.
---
Bloodied stealth FFr.
---
Lol yes thank you
---
Thanks for the advice! I put pack rat in there because last time I played I was constantly running out of inventory space. Would you swap for Psychopath, Four Leaf Clover or Critical Savvy?
---
Edit: enforcer also looks handy!
---
Just say thanks to people exploiting camp builds and move on. Beth put in more checks and didn't give a damn about legit builder.
---
I guess that even if u/ladydevann were to push these bugs to the "devs" that nothing would happen.
---
I remember reading about a group of players who attacked the Fashnact parade with the anti robot protest signs. 
---
Always funny to see people role playing.
---
I would respec, I wouldn't want to loose the experience and stuff. But I'm sitting on like 80 level ups, so that's easy for me to say.
---
Hey I've had a dead pet scorchbeast that's been plopping next to me for about 6 months. Don't complain they'll take it away!
---
I've had BoS members patrol and on roads I live under and ask me for my Tesla Rifle a few times. 
---
Also, Italy AAE, so no.
---
I believed you can find it at Garrahan Estate in the Ash Heap
---
Nah I think they're fine, they're meant to be a constant threat
---
That‚Äôs were I was server hopping for a long time and then I read you couldn‚Äôt get it from there no more.
---
Where is that spawn if you don‚Äôt mind pointing me in that direction.
---
The truest relevant perks I have already are the slugger perks
---
I already don't like you.  Go to a workshop and I'll show you.
---
Only 2500 atoms
---
Using 2 handed melee ‚Äúall rise legendary‚Äù often use power armour and heaven armour when not in power armour
---
No I don't really know anything about modern consoles.
---
76 is a control vault, meant to do what it says with, I believ, a secret motive for the overseer to carry on vault tecs work. 
---
51 was designed to be run by Zax to determine the perfect overseer. Zax went whacko and designed his own experiment which was survival of the fittest
---
94 was designed to preserve plant life but thanks to a geck malfunction/misfire it sent off a cloud of radioactive fog similar to the fog in far harbour. This lead to the creation of the mire
---
96 was similar to 94 but instead of plant life, it was dedicated to the cryogenically frozen embryos of varied animal life. I expect that thanks to some huge fckup it got irradiated. 
---
We don't know much about vault 63.
---
Its not that bad of a place always have to defend it so not as great as u think. Fusion cores any one who farms nuke zones can make their own fusion cores so really not that valuable to high players. Its fun for pvp because of all the obstacles u can jump and move around to avoid attacks. Their are way better workshops i could point out that never get taken and really surprise me. I usually take those and never get contested..
---
If they were to make diseases worse, then I would want to also see them eliminate the difference between environmental disease and creature disease, and fold everything into a general "disease chance" that a single group of perk cards or armor perk covers.
---
And prevent Mole Rats from being contagious by proximity, because their wonky burrowing logic makes disease almost guaranteed.
---
Thank u all for the help. Much appreciated guys
---
Four leaf clover seems the most useful to me!
---
For the past week or so horde events have been broken in general for me, click on join, pay caps, fast travel to a location and then no location marker or any idea where the horde is located. Search the immediate area and no horde anywhere, then get a completed notification, which I guess is someone else killing the hoard.
---
Hkiib jijkkkkbbkmhujiiu77uyuji77uu7oo8esiillllk0

helvetia in one of the display cases?..
---
hm.. might be a pistol.. I forget
---
The DR/ER stats on both are equal, though Forest is supposed to be the heavy variant of Scout armor, and Urban the light... Don't recall if there is a weight difference between equivalent pieces? Perhaps one day this will make a difference, but for now it looks to be cosmetic.

Vault 76‚Äôs diabolical experiment:  a vault where everyone is the same height!
---
Huh, well that is interesting, thanks for giving me the info on 96, I did not one that was the vaults purpose.
---
I worry about this a lot. Even before the posts. But there have been 2 more in the last 12 hours. ü§î
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the clarification. I have heard of forest being heavy, so assumed it would have a higher resist
---
Never happened on my PS4. Maybe anyone else logs into your account from another playstation?
---
I may be wrong on most of this but that's what seems to have been datamined. I can't wait to get into 96!
---
So, what you're telling me is that the Shotgun in the original Doom is actually quite realistic?
---
I could live with that. üòÇ
---
Lady Janet‚Äôs soft serve. It‚Äôs up above Vault 76 in the forest.
---
I typically take all three pylons during this event, unless someone already grabbed one and is able to handle it for the duration.
---
All I do is jump on top of the shack, crouch, potshot the impostor while sucking down a stim every ten seconds, and event is over in less than five minutes. Drop down into the toxic water, put bloody perks back on and rad myself back down to normal adventuring status.
---
Chem Fiend, Field Surgeon and First Aid perks for an easy win. I might use 15 stims in a group with low DPS.
---
Phone hot plates, whitesprings and the bunker
---
So I know ur issue bc I worked a mobile camp situation for a long time. Plopping camp into queen area straight after/between nukes for convenience.
---
I'd gotten it to work with regular foundations, so long as it wasn't too large, no more than 2x6 for each structure. Usually there's 2, vendors in one and workbench in others.
---
Every time I'd put ANYTHING on a wall surface or anything where it wasn't obviously intended to be, it'd stop me from placing again, so a rebuild it was.
---
Example: neon letters on the back of the white book shelves. Small letters on... well, anything. It doesn't like bookshelves or other items stacked as well. Basically anything creative. Thought I'd been super clever once getting the single ceiling track light to set inside the display case, but since that's not it's intent, it wouldn't settle.
---
They all lose their support when it tries to get placed. This also applies to a blueprint.
---
I finally went to domes for the mobile thing, worked awesome so long as things weren't "wriggled" into the edges too far or stacked or placed on a vertical surface it wasn't meant to be.
---
They weren't super pretty, but it was the cheapest damn setup to fix I've ever had, when the dome gets destroyed and it's 1 whole steel, concrete, and glass to fix it. Everything inside stays untouched.
---
Good luck, hope this helps. I'm on xb1 but I'm convinced over so much trial and error that this is totally the reason.
---
Yeah. The way it was described it makes it seems like vault 96 might be a type of event that's full of mini-boss fights.
---
It's not so much a bug as a build defect. It's a picky one.
---
Me and a few mates walk the roads acting like militia members
---
I had to take a backup spec of 1H melee on my shotgunner.  The nerf has ramped up my ammo consumption to the point of ‚Äúwhy bother‚Äù.  Now I just use shotguns on big events and melee solo.
---
Plus my instigating explosive combat shotgun will hit something for 3/4+ health and it‚Äôll heal back up because of the nerfs.  So frustrating.  Moreso that I‚Äôm running bloodied melee and there‚Äôs no way in hell that won‚Äôt get nerfed eventually.
---
Immediately after my above story I had Patrol Duty pop up, paid my caps, arrived  to a Fail on the event. So stupid. I really want to love this game, but crap like this keeps me solidly in the realm of only liking it fairly well.
---
No one else has my password, and I have verification so I would get a text on my phone.
---
I like this idea a lot. To be honest though, I think they should further seperate them if they go down this path. Illnesses/disease. Illness is more common and temporary. Disease is chronic and doesn't go away
---
Get the starched genes perk maxed and you'll never worry about your mutations going away.
---
Gold skin is in.
---
I've tried, they take a LOT of doing to make and they spoil too quickly
---
Then they don't need to be harder to get rid of.  2 points in vaccinated and 1 piece of environmental resist armor and I still caught a disease every time a ghoul was even near me.
---
One of the vendors in the Whitesprings resort sells them, as well as plans to craft them yourself. The Battlefield Cemetery only has pistols in my experience, and Helvetia only has the Blunderbuss.
---
Yea I wanted to recommend the SMS thingy to you..
---
Maybe it's any network issue, you could try to delete the network connection on your PS and set up a new one. Or update/reset your router.
---
I think that's all I can say.
---
Concentrated fire + VATS headshots. I retired my instigating shotgun about 4 months ago because I wanted to try out different weapons.
---
It's probably the type of Flatwoods monster, most of the Mothman I run across do that too.
---
I dont think so. My alt character barely breaks 3k and I do all the same stuff. That's way to big a difference to be coincidence.
---
Nice argument. üëç
---
I‚Äôve only had them drop from census violence.  Good luck, I just sold my spare maybe a week ago :/
---
Vendor bot in watoga shopping plaza has them on rotation
---
I just got rid of my level 50 T60 as nobody wanted it oof.
---
Sorry I meant the civil war possibility, I know of the responser bot.
---
The bot spawns down the road just past the overturned bus. The reenactor spawns just off the road if you go the opposite direction. There is a corpse in the road, the reenactor is nearby in the grass. If you are on xbone i can show you, gt is the same as here minus the underscore
---
There are a lot of patch notes and they‚Äôre not too interesting and many people are casual gamers, so a simple question asked to the community seems to make more sense.
---
The end-game is repetitive and boring, with content updates few and far between, and what has been released is garbage, especially the vault 'raid', which is just shit.
---
Bugs since release are still there, and they consistently fail to produce good content for updates, so I've given up on hoping. It's never going to get better so I'm wasting my time waiting for it.
---
Thanks for the response!! Ill get to it.
---
Dude, I'm for sure remembering this post if ya wrong but tbh I am sure you have to be right...
---
You can use a combo of rad sponge, and share it with a team, and then someone else shares... I forgot what perk card it was.. I think it was rads heal you. And it makes you invincible almost. Well, your team. Idk if it's patched or not. 
---
And bloodied builds don't die alot, if you know what you're doing and watching your health. Ive only run the vault raid once, with 2 levels 40s, and I was carrying them the whole time with a DCG. And one hit kills in the vault raid is really what you need, because there's almost no xp in kills so you can just let that guy do all the killing while everyone else finds everything.
---
You can server hop while your partner is holding the robot that way his inventory changes and you can get all the outfits but make sure someone is always in his inventory so he doesn‚Äôt die or despawn.
---
So dont build in those places, its not my job to buy ur stuff then have to fix ur stuff because u choose to live in a high level enemy area, god im already paying the caps to travel across the map just to see what u have. Alot to ask my friend
---
Actually players will gather up enemies and lead them back to ur camp so they can wreck it because they cant. So u never know.
---
People think Wastelanders will be the saving grace this game needs, yet less than a month before it's to be released stuff like this still happens, hope you get your accounts back man. 
---
If by some nightmare you don't get em back, add me on Xbox "Moist Coco Pops" I've got heaps of guns and can help you out.
---
And people were trying to tell me melee and non auto didn't go together, and I've been re building my build to be main non auto üò™
---
OH! Is that what that was?!?!
---
I had some dude in my camp... level 890... invisible... with lightning coming off him... and his character constantly making the ‚Äúouch‚Äù sound...
---
I‚Äôd just been out collecting junk, and was crafting at all of my benches. He‚Äôd come up to me, drop a mine, it‚Äôd explode, and I‚Äôd take a little radiation damage. 
---
He did this dozens of times, until my health meter was more than half way Radiation... then I took some RadAway, and continued my crafting. 
---
I couldn‚Äôt figure out what he was trying to do!
---
I hate that player made buildings can get destroyed, but anything non player made is invincible.
---
He looks like a confused mutated Greek scholar thinker or something
---
Pretty sure this is their way to, in a lore friendly way, "deal with the scorchbeast issue". The main plot for the story was creating a vaccine to the plague, then in the BoS story, getting rid of the last scorched. So if the community were to genocide them, then they could lower the population of them, leading to the return of all of the people that fled Appalachia to escape the plague.
---
Nope, radshield is awesome!  It doesn't suppress mutations.
---
Regarding what the other person said starched genes prevents removal of mutations but not suppression.
---
Is it me or is it now I noticed there's a ton of these assh\*les on adventure mode now that survival mode is gone?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thanks again, Beth.
---
Weird that you're downvoted for this when the whole bloody point of the post is to spout the claim that humans can replace NPCs and roleplay.
---
It is called Black Powder iirc
---
No it does not neither does glowing blood packs
---
Lol git gud..... with salt :D
---
How did you get them out of the Xbox?!? I can‚Äôt find any way to download them...
---
Bringing the beers and roasted meats
---
Nope
---
Agree
---
yup, adventure is still the same including workshop pvp.  there has been a slight increase in workshop clubbing and pot shots trying to get people to engage back, thats about it though
---
Try perks/weapons that stagger. That worked for me.
---
How is it wrong information? When someone is repairing PA at a PA workbench, another person can genuinely interact with the armor. It says to enter it (or whatever it says) n everything.
---
I havnt personally tried to enter the armor because y'know I'm not a douche and never go round nicking other people's armor to know if it actually works or not.
---
I can try with permission off one of my fo76 buddies to test if it does or does not work later.
---
If it doesn't work I will apologise for giving false information
---
I actually switch weapons to get the Escape Artist to activate instead of standing up and crouching again... I've never had any issues with changing weapons messing with my sneak.
---
I think of it this way, Bethesda‚Äôs been off all weekend. Game gets updated Tuesday, right? They‚Äôve probably already sent out the update to go through the platform verification at this point
---
People say to use mats, but that's a work around that the average person wouldn't and shouldn't have to do.
---
Also the blue vault tec canopy has the same issue, items just fly to the top of it, they never used to.
---
Hang it up this game is not for u, u have to actually play not hide in a hole. Lol just kidding get out and kill shit
---
xboxdvr website. Take a screenshot of your photos and upload them to xbox live first.
---
You can't damage camps unless your actively engaged in pvp with the camp owner.
---
Right, it‚Äôs a cute little event, but I just wanted everyone who‚Äôs been freaking out about meeting the quota to chill. Haha
---
I think you make a good argument for balance, but things aren‚Äôt always balanced.  Some guns are just better and some are better at certain things.  Some (as you point out) are just more fun to have and use than lethal. 
---
I would hazard to guess that Bethesda is allocating items more along the scenario lines, where the tech of some things is less prevalent than others.  
---
For me, I either enjoy the gun while I can (ie have the ammo) or add a personal subquest to acquire/ make the ammo.
---
Suppressed is different. Suppressed only happens from rad-x. Diluted rad-x does not do it nor does rad shield.
---
Thank you very much
---
I have tried with another Xbox it‚Äôs the same deal unfortunately
---
I will try that I already have imgur thank you I didn‚Äôt think of that
---
Haha, ok, np. Then you are looking for +25% fire rate weapons, junkies or AAE thingies.
---
Thank you I appreciate the offer
---
He does spawn with a CAMP... at least if it‚Äôs in the pond.

They are the mafia and need their cut, dont worry about it or vinnie might have to rough u up
---
Yeah I sincerely hope it doesn‚Äôt happen to anyone else.
---
Or you can have all the possible mutations and not worry about being killed by a griefer once in 100 years (or at all), as the death in F76 basicaly doesn't carry any significant punishment sans shattering one's sense of being omnipotent wastelander.
---
I'm pretty sure they don't need updates to give the purveyor sales. When the mystery pick was bugged they simply swapped it to a 25% sale.
---
Exactly. Thank you.
---
Thank you I appreciate it!
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping.
---
you finished the mission - you have to leave it partially done.
---
Np man just what you to get your account back
---
My group tried to run it last night. Even after all three pylons were active he would not uncloak. After a server swap we tried  again and were able to defeat him. We got the event failed animation but received the rewards.
---
I don't doubt that - to a very specific melee bloodied pve build, sure. Though for a HW user even Action Hero is subpar.
---
This is kind of the life cycle of every game ever released, though. IMO having the expectation that you can play *any game* every day, forever or even for thousands of hours isn't a bar that should be set.
---
The players who have that kind of time to play are an extremely small minority in the first place. It's okay to put a game down for a while, and it's okay to eventually quit playing a game entirely - neither of those necessarily means a game is bad.
---
I only play fo76 really hard every two months or so. I'm still really enjoying the game but I simply don't have time to play every day, especially if it means I wouldn't have time to play anything else.
---
Any game that is designed around forcing a captive audience is doing it wrong, as far as I'm concerned.
---
I‚Äôve seen this base before
---
The enemies weren't any harder at all.. the only survival aspect was fleeing from players with god tier loadouts... if they had  actually made survival mode hard... it might have been fun...
---
the golf course is a really pleasant place, to look at, to grind, to hang out, too bad there isn‚Äôt a golf mini game that would be really fun
---
I am never for rewarding failure.
---
if you see/find a flatwoods monster in the lower lvl areas like the forest, toxic valley or ash heap, it will always teleport away, never to be seen again. the flatwoods monsters spawning in the savage divide though or mire/bog, will always fight you. thats my own experience with them.
---
This is what I needed to know the whole time. I got my hands on a few once but never thought to wear it by the queen
---
I know the secret to farming strangler bloom for radshield I curently have 40 in my vendor for 35 caps each and I don't see them for sale very often in other people's vendors. I assume people don't know they don't suppress mutations like radx does, as they don't sell very well. Glowing blood packs don't suppress mutations either but are far less effective. Finding ash rose for formula p is also one of the harder ingredients to find, the ash heap being the most plentiful source.
---
If the stars out out the strangler blooms spawn.  Only a few of them each time, usually 6 to 8 at at time.  Use greenthumb to get double, use chemist and superdupper to increase yield.
---
I have an explosive Minigun for Distance and The Action Hero for close up.
---
Only Rad x supresses them, radshield is okay
---
I think he's talking more about how Rad x will surpress the effects of mutations
---
Instead of heading down the road to the Responder bot spawn point, go the opposite direction up the road. The spawn is in the grass by a telephone pole.  Hopefully you find it, it‚Äôs hard to describe it any better.
---
Thank you I really appreciate it.
---
I‚Äôm reaching same conclusion but a different angle:
---
Bethesda knows how many scorched we kill, they‚Äôve shown they have these metrics.  Goals were set to be obtainable and the extra push of being told to get it means we‚Äôll hit the goal just fine.
---
Watoga vendor does not sell the plans for the weapon only the mods. To get the actual weapon plan it‚Äôs a pretty rare drop from census violence and also distant thunder events in cranberry bog.
---
Well, do tell more. What kind of booze, what ingredients for rolls, how much of an AP regen increase..?
---
It's a good representation of the total. This is one of the largest remaining Fo76 communities. It's even worse if take the official forums into account.
---
Yeah that was my thread you probably saw but I mostly got downvoted. Don't really know what I'm doing wrong
---
Guess I've had bad luck then, as I have not been able to find any at all outside of the quest...
---
Okay I just uploaded the clip I took last night it should appear on there now. I‚Äôll copy that link to the main post. Thank you I forgot about that website.
---
Not necessarily. I've met some of them in the Divide who vanished upon being hit.
---
Things cant be easy huh :&lt;
---
Well it‚Äôs not showing up on there. It‚Äôs a 2 minute clip, and I just uploaded it to Xbox live less than 5 minutes ago. How long will it take to pop up on that site?
---
 Every green dot in the forest on this map has a chance to spawn that vendor bot.

Use slugs, no need to worry about pellets then
---
I found the vendor but was short 600 caps so I'll just grab that when I can afford it &amp; I've had the same experience with the battlefield cemetery and helvetia
---
I did find it thanks!
---
It's a blunderbuss not a rifle unfortunately
---
Indeed.  Sadly it was poor quality picture cuz I had to take it fast.  I was going to post it as a picture in the subreddit but apparently they don't allow those anymore. Hopefully putting this link is okay.
---

Pics or it didn't happen :-D
---
Honestly, i love Bethesda and all.. but I think if Bethesda and Obsidian both worked side by side, it could have came out a stronger game. All I can say is, look at Outer World's. It looks fantastic. Of course, I'm not going to be playing it off the bat because this event is going on durning the release, but it still looks fantastic.
---
I am encountering the shotgun regenerating health bug but its still a fun play style.  One on one-two-three, sure use a Super Sledge but when the swarm is coming out of a nuked WS club house, the shotgun beats the sledge as I can shoot a lot faster than swing.  Also, I'm knee capping as many of them as I can (while tossing a molotov here and there).
---
There's been times when I'm literally by myself at WS and a crowd shows up after I'm done to finish off the limping and downed glowing ones.  
---
On the SBQ fights, I'm using my heavy 2-shot Plasma, Gatling and Lasers.
---
the pump action with the long barrel is pretty good. DO NOT put a supressor on it as it will nerf the range badly
---
The lower level Flatwoods and Mothman are shy and will flee if spotted. If you find the lvl 50 versions, they are more aggressive. üòâ
---
Check the reply under Deadpools comment, i put an imgur link.  I tried to post it says the pictures but apparently fo76 doesn't allow picture post anymore
---
Alas, serendipity rules the last 3 of 8 slots in luck :( there's delberts sunshine oil a friend makes for me
---
Kez, I‚Äôm like you I want the BOS camp bundle badly. I want a big BOS flag on the wall of my base and logo‚Äôd stashes etc.
---
I see all these other bundles, Free States, Raider etc, but BGS, how about some love for the OG Brotherhood?
---
As for a laser build, we‚Äôll, even with the buffs, and upgraded Ultracite weapons it‚Äôs still a pretty weak option sadly. Can‚Äôt touch the damage of most ballistic rifles.
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem like Bethesda has any interest in buffing energy weapons to ballistic strength any day soon, but we can wait and hope. 
---
The new (old) plasma casters, gauss pistols and such coming with Wastelanders have me curious, but I don‚Äôt expect them to be any more powerful than what we have.
---
I‚Äôd love to be wrong tho...
---
Rolls are better used for selling shit at the vendor bot.
---
Thanks
---
Second born?
---
Yeah but people can rub bloodied and get a base damage of 8k with a meat hook and that‚Äôs not too strong?
---
Even if the OP got what they suggested, junkies would still be better than mutants. Reason being that if you have for example a psycho addiction, taking psycho will both remove the withdrawal effect, and add the extra damage buff from the chem itself, but the addiction will still be present, giving 10 extra damage. This works with all addiction, so alcohol addiction would give 10 more damage stacked on top of ballistic bock for 25% more damage etc.
---
Yeah you could just take all  the chems on top of bloodied or mutants, but the withdrawal effects would always be negative. 
---
So i agree that mutants should have a max of 5 mutations for 50%. That would make it much more viable but still not as good as junkies or bloodied, which require more perks and or chems to get full benefit.
---
I‚Äôm assuming this would be against the TOS and EULA. Blizzard bans people for doing it in WoW. I‚Äôm sure it will happen with Bethesda too.
---
&gt; All I do is jump on top of the shack, crouch, potshot the impostor while sucking down a stim every ten seconds, and event is over in less than five minutes. Drop down into the toxic water, put bloody perks back on and rad myself back down to normal adventuring status.
---
I try to do this, too, except I seem to get groups that focus on taking out the respawning robots rather than the Sheepsquatch.
---
On the plus side, I have way too many stimpaks, so doing these events periodically helps keep my carry weight low.
---
Another thing that I‚Äôd really like to see is the ability to select an ingredient in my inventory and see all of the recipes I know for that item.
---
If you're on controller you can use a rubber band on the walking stick and walk against a wall. For example in whitespring resort, there are no enemies. 
---
On pc you could put something on the walk forward button. 
---
If your hunger and thirst bars drop it only affects your AP, you won't die.
---
Tough call. Not sure the missus would want to go through another 9 months for a JE gatling laser but the plasma may push her over the edge.
---
Rolls uses 3 sugars, 2 purified waters, 3 Sugar Bombs (with rads),  1 wood, and 2 spices.
---
All of its ingredients are non-perishable, but the Sweet Roll itself is. Make them when you need them, like when you would like an extra CHR to sell your junk.
---
i think it has to do with their lvl then or as long as it is called "mythical flatwoods monster" it will not flee.
---
It is not every night, check back often and you will find the flowers.  I depend on it for queen runs so I farm it a few times per play session.  Whenever it is night time I walk along the bank near dyer chemical to check.
---
You gotta sneak up on them with a good melee weapon and power attack them. Usually it 1 shots them
---
Make some at your camp?
---
I saw one 3 weeks ago for ps4.
---
Harpers ferry, small building by itself...
---
How does this help people with no interest in PVP?
---
Ammosmith 2 + 2 variable charge fusion cores + 1 stable violet flux + 1 ultracite = 3 **fully charged** ultracite fusion cores (without Super Duper).
---
Guess what? They're usable for power armor. I have ~100 of them that I couldn't even sell due to their weight.
---
I started a new character last week. People kept showing up in my camp, leaving me things and buying things from my vendor. I got back on my regular character and now I just get the occasional sale again.
---
I found one there already like I said in my post, but its twice my level
---
gotcha.. 
---
twice a week is a lot.. and valuable information is not of interest..
---
Ill keep that in mind when someone posts this again next week..
---
thanks for straightening me out
---
I once went to a guy's camp and saw him in a locked room doing random circles. I assume he was afk and don't know why he had windows to let others see in.
---
Your best bet is to do Census Violence as you also have a chance to get shielded marine wetsuit as long as you have protective unlocked and I think maybe the fatman plan. Luckily the plan is nowhere near as rare as most other weapon plans like the tomahawk and plasma grenade.
---
oh wow, that's AWESOME!
---
I haven't played Fallout 76 in like 6 months. I thought it was dead, but happily I'm wrong. 
---
Time to fire it back up :-D
---
Do you not take periodic damage? I do afk but only long enough to make a coffee usually or nip to the loo. I never pushed it far enough to know for myself lol.
---
Also works just spinning the camera, I done it on meat week leaving the playstation on over night
---
I think we'll still get the reward because of the mess up with the mystery pick anyway. Community will be bummed if we don't.
---
I have no interest in PVP so this is a terrible idea in my opinion.
---
 I don't want to have to constantly look over my shoulder for every douchebag looking to snipe me from behind. No thanks.
---
Aren‚Äôt there servers? If so there is a slim chance we can find you
---
Chill, it‚Äôs a vidya game
---
Nevermind I got it posted on YouTube. https://youtu.be/46V18EQqI0E
---
https://youtu.be/46V18EQqI0E my video clip
---
Doesn't matter what it is I don't approve of rewarding failure
---
https://youtu.be/46V18EQqI0E got this uploaded instead
---
[I don't think anyone got your reference.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMT7RFevVlg)
---
That may be part of your problem. Pick a weapon type and start putting points into damage for that weapon type. Melee is good because it saves on ammo.
---
Nah man, we talk about it all the time.  You were just aiming your weapon manually like a casual.  
---
We'll save some Tarberry and Cran Nuka-Cola for you at the next, "I'm going to aim in the general direction but not really stress or challenge myself due to the poor combat system in the Fallout Engine meet and greet"
---
*cries in silence* 
---
I'd probably trade 3-4 weapons for one.
---
My apologies
---
Lol thank you. Please check my 2 minute clip of what exactly I‚Äôm seeing (I don‚Äôt care about likes on YouTube) https://youtu.be/46V18EQqI0E
---
No worries my man, thanks for the input!
---
Neat
---
Supposedly if you're in a bed or on a chair you will stay logged in longer.
---
Build a floor piece then build a Vending machine on it. Put a small mat in front of the machine, then Blueprint both as a pair. You'll then be able to build that Blueprint within the bungalow, position the machine as you like, then scrap the mat.
---
Make adhesive at my camp?
---
https://youtu.be/46V18EQqI0E this is what I‚Äôm seeing when I try to play.
---
You could always just keep it and make another character. I have a friend who has three different camps. There all pretty cool
---
And thank you for your kind words.
---
Brilliant! hahah
---
Lol dork
---
&gt;We were never told that the event started
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Thank you for your well wishes. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm experiencing https://youtu.be/46V18EQqI0E
---
A for effort
---
No damage.
---
I also don't do this, I see no use compared to the waste of energy.
---
I got it from distant thunder, I will admit it was probably about my 50th or so distant thunder along with hitting every other event there about the same number of times
---
Thank you very much. I doubt I will play again if they don‚Äôt fix it but thank you for the offer it means a lot. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeing, my 2 minute clip from powering up the game to pressing play. 
---
https://youtu.be/46V18EQqI0E
---
I hope you at least played the drums or turned the meat ;p
---
Are you still having the armor issue? What platform? I'm asking because I'm on PC and it always locked me up but now it appears to work better, slow sometimes but no freeze.
---
That's  scraping the bottom of the barrel if they get rid of that option instead of fixing it lol
---
What is this event because I stopped playing to play sea of thieves because it got boring after nukashine was added then rejoined just after pioneer scouts,I found the pilon ambush site but I have no idea what it is
---
I wish it was easier, I've sunk to much time into this character and alot of the plans I would have to re-find for that other character. I've been thinking about blue printing it but I would have to do it in fractions.
---
I'm sure it's all to come yet. They release just enough to keep us interested.
---
How do you get the camera to sit that long without being logged out?
---
Incidentally, I spoke to Roger and he did get his stuff back. All his characters exactly as they were.
---
Every mothman I run into, always spawns heading to my direction to try to kick my ass.
---
Possibly last night I had to sever hop twice an never saw the message. Was standing where my CAMP was though so it wasnt that hard to tell.
---
Ahhh, I didn't realize they could be used for that, thanks!
---
Ok, but is it a one-off AP regen, like Quantum, or a long lasting stat, like Well-tuned or Corn Soup? Only looking for AP increase/regen; trading is easy as it is.
---
Gorgeous!!
---
That's even better, I'd make an update post with the video in it for the proof, so more people will see it. And send that video off to Bethesda. I find it more weird that the atomic shop is completely gone also. Bethesda has been known to take it's time with these things. Like with the previous people who lost everything, I'm pretty sure it took atleast a week. This should be a top post though, considering you didn't even do the Vault Raid for this to happen
---
Encrypted
---
Why do you kill snakes?
---
I used the photo mode to adjust my shot and would slightly move the camera every 25 minutes. These are speed up 64x so you can barely notice.
---
What's the gamer tag.  I on Xbox 76 a few hours a day
---
I used to follow people who I encountered, making up stories about them as I walked, after the mute update most people stoped talking so I followed them until they either left or responded in screaming, longest time I followed someone was 90 min without a response, ended as the guy played the game from level 10 to 80.
---
I added the link to the main post already. I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would downvote this, but they are. I‚Äôm hovering around 160. I have sent the link to Juicehead as well, as well as the link to this post. Hopefully he can give this issue some attention.
---
This happens to me as well from time to time. Do you by any chance have Frontier Fios internet? That's what I have and the router is upstairs in my daughter's room since that's where the old tenants had there box set up. It's all wireless so that's my problem.
---
If the Tesla is automatic, get all three commando perks under perception maxed out, this requires 9 perception
---
If it's more than 100 pieces then yes. But blueprinting it would be a good idea (it's either 100 pieces or a special buget I don't remember)
---
Nice. I'll throw a couple of deathclaw steaks on the barbecue.
---
This happened to me yesterday but I closed the game and when I came back I hadn‚Äôt lost anything, fortunately. This has happened to me when dying at the end of other events as well, only starting after the recent Events changes.
---
Kool thanks, the explosive one is really good but i really like the one that shoots out lightning and kills or damages more than one person and really want to max that out. So would the automatic barrel do that?
---
Grafton mayor: come to Grafton, *FUS RO DAH*
---
^ cut scene to open Wastelanders.
---
Shotgun shells cost so much to craft for the amount of damage they do that I hate to fire my shotgun...
---
Well I hope its 100 because that might be manageable :P
---
Gamertag is **Rokasai** - same as my reddit username.
---
Haha
---
Thank you!
---
Ah, Juicehead is a pretty good one to send it to. He's reported on things like this in the past. It could pick up traction from there as well.
---
No,I mean what is it?
---
The automatic barrel makes it to where you can just hold the trigger button down and it'll fire until you have to reload
---
Yeah it's something like that. The only blueprints I have is a giant staircase and a bunch of sleeping bags stacked on top of each other for the  missions were you build stuff
---
The event is Encrypted
---
You might be right... but how else am I supposed to get steel if not from scrapping after a wee bit of genocide? Mine it like some sort of peasant..?
---
I do agree with u but also kinda disagree, i think pvp adds an element to the game, maybe what should be done is u dont lose anything if killed and just lose the workshop. If something that happened then maybe it would work, i think that elemt should be tKen out of the game entirely even in pve not just pvp. Then it could be pvp over resources ie workshops?
---
Eh, most of the grind spots are good for materials anyway. It gives a theme for different farming routes!
---
i see you want the weapon to arc between enemies thats not possible with an explosive one
---
the explsoive one is best to use with the shotgun barrel, rifleman perks and vats
---
if you want the lightning arcs you need a non explosive tesla and in that case an automatic barrel plus commando perk cars are your best option
---
Lol that actually sounds pretty funny looking
---
Search reddit and youtube for build guides. Captainoob has a good review of many tesla rifles and perk cards for it.
---
Bloodied rifleman commando build
---
Use only these mutations: 8 mutations are needed for a ranged player's build: Adrenal reaction, bird bones, carnivore or herbivore, eagle eyes, grounded, marsupial, scaly skin, speed demon.
---
Oh i dont have that i need it. Will start looking for that mod, not going to build and destroy 100 tesla rifles for one mod....thanks appreciate it
---
If you're on Xbox I can put the automatic barrel mod on for you!
---
Yes that is what i want to do, going to statt looking for auto mod for it tonight when home...thank u for the info much appreciated
---
To quote Johnny Ringo in Tombstone ‚Äúsissy boys should have stuck around‚Äù 
---
The reality is PvP is the new reality in adventure mode.  Learn and adapt.  And for the downvote duckies and bunnies crowd, congrats.  You bashed survival so this is what you‚Äôve got. 
---
And as Mr Ringo also said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you have the guts to play for blood!?!?‚Äù 
---
Exactly
---
no problem mate have fun :)
---
Thats a completely different issue and you are putting words in my mouth. I never said anything about meat hooks or bloodied builds. 
---
If you made mutants stacks up high like 50% it would be too powerful compared to other prefixes like anti-armor, Two-shot, and junkies. Bloodied as a prefix isn't even unbalanced, its all the other aspects of the builds that break it. Tol many synergies.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty ridiculous. I killed a deer with my 20 gauge from 75 yards away. No way could any shotgun in any game I‚Äôve ever played do that. 
---
Given I was using slugs and most games use buckshot or birdshot but still.
---
A good 2h weapon makes more difference than totally retooling your spec until you reach a point of trying to be *the best.*
---
Solo: instigating +power attack 
---
Group: (preferred prefix) +power attack dmg or swing speed
---
I only have 7 str and often don‚Äôt have the best cards equipped to max damage and do fine. Not the best, but I‚Äôm not putting the effort into min/max.
---
Get a Quad tesla go full auto with commando, it is pretty fun but many I can go through 4-5k in ammo a day.
---
People have solod queen in less than five seconds.
---
That's crazy üòÇ
---
I just got a tweet from Bethesda support, telling me that the ticket has been ‚Äúescalated to another team‚Äù and thanking me for my patience lol
---
Soooo
---
What guide did you follow? I do have a melee char but he is nowhere near this strong....
---
Good luck man. I‚Äôve done over 500 maps and just have the helmet. If you want a set crafted for you with mods etc. check out a trading sub.
---
Yes. It‚Äôs under utility at a cooking station.
---
There would be some humor in it of they were like "oh, didn't clear out enough scorched, no wastelanders for you. Try harder next time ;) "
---
It‚Äôs all fair game.  Luring enemies to a camp isn‚Äôt some new strategy.  I did it many times when certain people got greedy and built their turret camps behind the golf club.
---
Yes. All stealth damage is multiplied by 2 or more.
---
I love my bloodied laser, I've got it on full auto with the focused barrel and it does the job nicely.
---
I've also got an AA FFR with the beam splitter and it lasts literally 30 seconds until it breaks.
---
Using gunsmith 5 definitely helps and I've got a nice supply of energy bobbleheads with curator perk.
---
That's understandable as this is a real kick in the gut from Bethesda, it's strange the Atomic shop isn't even showing up. If you change your mind throw me a message on Xbox, Goodluck dude.
---
Is that scorch beast queen? I can‚Äôt tell
---
We have Spectrum. I've thought about hooking up directly, but I don't want a wire through the house.
---
The best was a team of 3 decided to try to PvP me at their camp while I was buying some of their stuff. 
---
After killing all three of them I went to work on their camp with my BE handmade.  They returned and started flipping out so I killed them again and basically finished the job. 
---
Man that was fun
---
Netflix helped alot haha
---
THanks for doing so. I hope they at least got noticed.
---
Thank you again. Bethesda have responded on twitter and told me the ticket had been ‚Äúescalated to another team‚Äù so I‚Äôm just waiting for further info now.
---
I did half the main quest early, then stopped about lvl 20 to start exploring. Then at 50 continued with it and its pretty easy going.
---
Use melee for about 30 lvls whilst hoarding decent stuff. Dont keep 100 weapons though, until 50+ everything will just keep improving so that cool legendary you found will quickly become obsolete.
---
Explore, gain xp for literally anything, craft pointless stuff, sell items, pick locks, find new locations, farm low lvl enemies for xp and junk items to either sell or scrap.
---
Dont just try go op and get caught up in min maxing or follow endgame guides etc. Just chill, learn the game and start thinking about your build around lvl 35/40
---
Damn
---
All weapons need a complete rebalance.
---
Not so fast 
---
I had a lvl 80 claim my shop at Poseidon and he killed me twice. I‚Äôm lvl 250.  Damn explosive gatling lazers.  He made quick work of me and took practically no damage.  Needless to say that doesn‚Äôt happen much but it can.
---
There you go! Maybe this will get settled faster than the past experiences with this. I mean, when there is proof in front of them, they cant tell you it's your fault. And they themselves can prove if you had an account or not because they cant restore a account that didn't have an account. So hopefully this gets settled fast! I think this is the first time I've seen it happen on a Xbox as well, it makes me worried to recreate something that you could have done. 
---
Considering this wasn't from the vault raid, it makes it a more scary possiblity.
---
Do different profiles have different installations? Could it be that your installation is corrupted?
---
I don't think there is a Red Rocket or Super Duper Mart in or near Watoga.
---
Blizzards a piece of shit, and I haven‚Äôt heard of any AFK bans yet
---
Devs are Raiders mwahahahaha
---
What exactly happened before you got back on? Like, was there a game crash before and you stopped playing for a few hours and got back on and it was all gone? Or just a normal session, regular bugs etc and then logging in just happened like this?
---
I know right. If they can‚Äôt determine exactly why or how this happens then how can they prevent it? It‚Äôs a ridiculous thing to be anxious over in a game.
---
Complain to Amazon about the servers, maybe they'll do something about that.
---
I don‚Äôt think so. It was working fine, I went to sleep and tried to play after I woke up then everything was fucked up. I don‚Äôt know honestly. It supplies me with anxiety.
---
I haven't been so anxious because I didn't touch raids at all cause of all this. Then I decided to try out a raid, dies at the end etc. Nothing bad happened. But if Bethesda is quick about this, then it won't be much worry. But I'm hoping the sole problem gets announced to us soon, things to avoid etc.
---
Yeah Super Duper is where Phoenix is Watoga .. but I think you right, I think they referring to Big B's according to these screenshots
---
[https://imgur.com/a/15PAAwy](https://imgur.com/a/15PAAwy)
---
Didn't realize there was a different Super Duper or at least I haven't been paying attention
---
Absolutely regular. Nothing out of the ordinary, I don‚Äôt even recall having a server crash during my final play session before this happened.
---
Exactly.
---
I tried it for a while but it's easier to just use grim reapers. Never have issues with ap.
---
Love nuka mines and nuka grenades
---
Expect Halloween decorations in the Atom Shop this coming Tuesday... No sarcasm.
---
I'll add you! My gt is galacticbeluga, I'm always looking for people to play with!
---
Nice one dude, from what I‚Äôve read and such levelling up does seem the best route, cheers for that. I‚Äôll just focus on making caps and levelling up!
---
Ambiguous Duo, Bro
---
That's my problem as well. I have heard about the powerline adapters, but not sure how well those work and don't really wanna spend 40 bucks on it right now.
---
It was never good loot. Just a lot of loot.
---
Hope they do the same for you. Good luck.
---
Interesting. So you're saying Squad Manoeuvres is also pointless with Speed Demon? I've had Speed Demon for some time so that isn't the cause of the Sleek display issue but I guess I should find another armour mod.
---
Thanks again.
---
Oh, that's in the mire. It's not the one at the galleria, but it's down the road west of the galleria. I think.
---
And the top 2 are the giant teapot.
---
And the bottom one I'm not sure, maybe the one by the purveyor?
---
And I forget that Supper Duper is where Phoenix is, it doesn't look like a super duper. üòÇ
---
Relax...
---
I see at least 1-2 a day within the last 4-5 days but none of them have posted concrete proof.
---
Nice. I want the bohemoths fire hydrant for a weapon but have to have a certain lvl of strength and perk for it maybe
---
Yeah that would be so awesome!
---
I've seen a few reports but nobody has posted concrete proof besides the one vault dude. Honestly take a video of your inventory every so often. If something seriously does happen they do seem to have some kind of things in place to help now. Its normally a earlier roll back but they do help with your items or at least something to replace them if you have concrete evidence. But out of the 800 hours each my friend an I have we've not had anything gone missing except back in the first month or two of the game.
---
I think, therefore I am... the STRONGEST super mutant!
---
Lol who‚Äôs gonna tell him
---
I got my first one around Pickets fort. Theres a few civil war museums around there mine was in a case.
---
Yes, but irl one pellet kills.
---
There's a sneak cap??
---
It's just flat 300AP sorta like quantum.  It's not that useful.  I think the best AP regeneration you can get is from hard lemonade.  Plus it stacks with well rested and corn soup or the other AP regeneration foods (I think thistle salad or whatever its called has more than corn soup)
---
I run bloodied and don't die a lot. I get to about 10% HP and then i magically heal up if i get lower than that. I have no idea what does it.
---
Anyone?
---
That looks so nice, especially with it being dark, I love the way the lights glow!
---
Cool beans lol.
---
I could not agree more
---
Probably because he never made it clear in the beginning. He also was just making a few Reddit post with mistakes an looked like they were written by a kid. It's also the internet trolls will troll. He should have made a video or something going into better detail or some kind of quick site or something rather then a few half ass Reddit post.
---
Glad it worked out for whoever actually got paid out though. Maybe next time he can try an set it up better.
---
I think they really went overboard with melee and unarmed in 76.  Melee and unarmed were by no means impossible choices to make work in Fallout 4, but you could tell they weren't as in-depth as guns in that game, and unarmed totally felt like an afterthought that couldn't (and still can't) be used with power armor.  
---
In previous games, I'm pretty certain what set melee and unarmed apart from guns is that certain ones could achieve insane critical rates, they usually all had much lower AP costs than guns, and last but not least, they had very good armor-piercing capabilities that were sometimes inherent to the weapons themselves, such as the deathclaw gauntlet in its former Fallout 3 glory.  But in terms of raw damage, they didn't always outclass guns in raw damage fully specced up, and if they did, you still had to work for it because enemies could still blow you away very easily if you were careless.
---
Now, with the way mechanics have changed and with things like manual criticals, modifications, both options are really almost too rewarding given that there is actually very little risk to approaching most enemies up close.  In fact, the only enemies that genuinely seem to punish people getting super close are things like mirelurk queens, hermit crabs, or scorchbeasts, but there's still ways around those with things like stealth too.
---
I'd argue there's far less strategy to approaching most enemies with melee and unarmed than there ever has been in previous games.  And that's also just a consequence of Fallout 76 generally being a much easier game, both in the early game situation where Fallout is supposed to be the hardest, and definitely in the late game situation where it's usually easier.
---
If the solution isn't toning down the power of melee combat overall, it's definitely buffing shotguns and other close-range weapons.
---
That's an amazing gt
---
This is the best idea I've seen on here. üëç
---
Its the same as old i think. I always head there as soon as it pops. Takes about 5 min and easy 9 scrip. Loads of meat to cook too
---
Edit: 15 scrip, dont know why i thought it was 3 per 1*
---
That's where I looked too man, really having no luck with this
---
No!
---
I want my booze and buff-food to be effective immediately, just as it is now.
---
Do you have proof of this?
---
It's more convenient to work with other AP boosting foods like just plain old sugar, or sugar bombs. Or you could just use Nuka Quantums.
---
Thats awesome
---
Picked up a Bloodied Exsplosive auto shotgun yesterday, still does around 1k dmg, it's a far shot from useless!
---
I get where you‚Äôre coming from, but how many people are actually dickheads like that? Most of the people I run across are absolutely fine. A faction system may also help, so you don‚Äôt do damage to people if your own faction, and there‚Äôs some incentive to protect eachother.
---
That‚Äôs been a thing for a while
---
This!
---
Set up the hemlock holes workshop resource extractors for acid (be sure to take the acid from the pools as well!), then farm the grafton monster right next to the workshop for acid (and caps, oil), check for snallygasters out in the golf course, then take the acid from the lone pool at the far end of the golf course. Check back in on your extractors every 30-40 mins, by which time the Grafton monster will respawn if you walk out to the previous corpse/meat pile (even more acid/caps/xp). I'll usually just do this while launching nukes or doing runs unrelated to farming ammo materials.
---
In between check-ins on hemlock holes workshop, you can do a yao guai run (yao guai drop acid): through dolly sods for 2x yao guai, a detour to a road in the mire where some wendigo's drop from trees, then to mountain side bed &amp; breakfast where, just north from it on the railroad tracks among the railroad cars are at least 2x yao guai. Then keep walking north to whitesprings where, near the service entrance, is a dead yao guai you can loot. Finally, walk down to the 'snake' logo in sourthern whitesprings to the cave in the middle of the golf course for one more yao guai. (yes, there are other places yao guai *can* spawn, such as the middle of whitesprings, but my personal pref is to just go where they always spawn so the run is more predictable in terms of what I'll get from it versus time required).
---
Augment with Tanagra Town and other areas for crickets, and after a few hours you should be stocked up with enough acid for a couple days.
---
I want nuka cherry bombs..... I would also like a nuka explosive for every flavour and I want one of them to be a healing grenade
---
Believe he ment through in game but yeah the website should be referred too. The pop up in game is unreliable. Sometimes it shows up with outdated info.
---
I think you read it wrong or something. ü§î
---
Most people wanted to get rid of slap damage in the first place, I doubt they would want it back.
---
If you want to PvP, go play Nuclear Winter, it's balanced much better than Survival was.
---
If you don't like fairness, stick with raiding workshops.
---
Just need to tag her for drops
---
This red rocket is just north of treetops in the mire. It's called big b's rest stop.
---
Nope. As far as I'm concerned the lack of pr and ads on wastelanders tells me the update isn't worth it accordining to bethesda. Why spend money promoting something that will flop again?
---
Ok, thanks for the explanation. Yeah, hard lemonade + well tuned + corn soup actually allows for AP regen in-air while jetpacking for the least amount of grinding effort, which is very cool. Also Tarberry juice or Sugar works like a poor man's Quantum...
---
I found a chainsaw yesterday. I was pleasantly surprised that it was a weapon and not a junk item. My low level little old lady character found it and it looks really funny when she equips it. We she uses it the screen shakes. I wonder if I hit somebody with it if their screen would shake too. Too bad I play in pacific mode...
---
I would love it if they made all of the instruments into weapons as well. Arm the band camp kids!!!
---
Need a main menu theme selector.  I miss the original main theme menu.  It was easier on the ears.
---
This will actually make looting much better. Instead of being able to just eat food right from the container, why not also let us equip stuff too? This would be perfect for Nuclear Winter.
---
What emotes?
---
dude i don‚Äôt know why but all the sudden, in the last week or so i have needed to be within 5 feet of most normal sized enemies to vats headshot them with my normal scoped rifles
---
Turns out the effect is only shown when you're actually Sneaking! Doh! Ran a few tests with +10 and without and I can indeed so no discernible speed difference. Perhaps I'll go muffled.
---
Ah, I was sure I went last week for some nostalgia and it was all closed still.
---
Like on the emote wheel for waving, thumbs up ect. Im trying to switch out to ones ive bought in the atom shop but just cant get them.
---
Maybe they added something else. But when I was playing last month there was only one entrance and the basement was there
---
I agree with this too.
---
Ok. What emotes did you buy
---
I tried survival as soon as it was available because I loved immersive mods in Fallout 4. But it became: "I fast travel to the leader and shoot him." It was stupid to see the message of "Bob has killed Tom, Tom has killed Bob, Bob has killed Tom" in less than a minute. 
---
There was no real hunt: it was childish. It was just camping and teleporting, killing and being killed. There was nothing else to do, no playing the game and having to pay More attention to things.
---
Battlefield shotguns you could have killed that deer from 800m away.
---
All games should have a menu music slider. The lack of this tiny feature in so many games last few years kills me. And they always have menu music that's 4x louder than in game and one track.
---
Ive got a couple there some ive gotten free but one i bought was like the raaider salute.
---
Cause VATS is for babies. ;)
---
I guess you could try petting them instead
---
Or, just stop playing the game if you don‚Äôt like it? I‚Äôm fairly certain nobody is forcing you to play and if they are, you have bigger issues.
---
It‚Äôs just a video game, dude.
---
Yes! Something like what they did for the number of unlocked mods on weapons, but for ingrediants/recipes would be nice.
---
Calm down. Lay off the psycho
---
I'm really looking forward to Outer Worlds but it's ugly as shit imo. I'm not talking about graphical fidelity, I'm on about how their artists decided to clash as many colours as possible for each asset, from rainbow raider armour to rainbow wildlife. Sorta why a joimt effort between them and BGS would be great, as the latter's art department is top notch. 
---
Looks great RPG wise though, and I like that it has real frontier vibe. Less that 2 weeks away now too!
---
Slap damage is part and parcel in a nuclear wasteland. Pvp too. We need slap damage. Badly.
---
Go to the wave. Hit right number if your on consle and if your on PC idk but at the bottom of your screen it will say expand and you do that and cycle through the emotes and select one and that will replace it
---
What kinda of dmg do you see? I get just over 1k with a Bloodied Explosive auto-shotty. Wouldn't exactly call it useless :P
---
I don't know how bad it is since survival was taken down, but I rarely ever got pvpd holding workshops. 
---
Just take less popular workshops, that may help. 
---
You will generally get plans for completing the "take x workshop" quest that showsnup each time you're near one, and also get them from "defend the workshop" quest to kill waves of enemies.
---
It‚Äôs good to see people still playing this game after all the undeserved hate it has received!
---
The servers have bad days. I think I haven't been disconnected in maybe thirty hours of playing. And it feels like a miracle. 
---
Sad thing Is, this problem IS normal in this game.
---
Potatoes can supposedly help to reduce salt levels.
---
\- The scorched tend to spawn as legendaries very rarely, definitely not 5%, more like 0.2%. Is this chance also defined in the datafiles and if so, what's the number?
---
I think you may need to walk away from the wasteland for a bit.
---
Yeah I've got an explosive double barrel and with the enforcer perk it absolutely decimates baddies even from medium range.
---
Soooo...
---
Not having a good day are you ? :D
---
LOL
---
Yeah I'm quadding reasonably often. I also forgot that I have Scattershot 3 so reloads are faster and my shotgun weighs maybe half a pound.
---
Good points here
---
Or to Grafton, where "It's GRAFTON Daaay!"
---
Quadding? 4k dmg pr. shot?
---
This would be a great addition
---
Ya im on Xbox. Not sure what the wave is but ill go in game and see if i find the option to expand the menu.
---
I have been a bit unmotivated past two days because the damn counter is apparently manually operated. Like WTF??
---
The wave is the hi emote
---
yup they know, but would be great to have it confirm'd that this will be fixed in the first patch coming...
---
Honestly WGAF. Outer Worlds, Call of Duty and Death Stranding are less than a month away.  There's also a metric ton of other games available now.
---
Just had to vent boys. Fucking swing and a miss, swing and a miss, swing and a miss
---
So much NaCl...
---
I totally agree with you
---
Yeah that was redesigned several months ago. It's good maze now, for low levels.
---
Think I've heard this before, would explain why they're so wank.
---
No, quad as in four numbers, sorry. 1k or more.
---
THIS. I love this idea!!
---
Now that's commitment. Good job.
---
I read it as if he wants a long keypress to eat/drink something,  [u/Gumbybum](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gumbybum/) am I wrong?
---
Camp destruction, no. That needed to go with the vendor update.
---
I would not mind seeing slap damage return.
---
Bethesda just needs to make a Peaceful mode. The PVE only players are the weirdos imo. Go make a separate safe space for them instead of making the main game an easier experience for all.
---
Can I have your account?
---
I really cannot stand reading people saying if you want PvP go play NW. NW is lame as shit and nobody wants to play it! Get over it NW sucks and is not fallout so quit telling people to PvP there. Its suppose to be a wastland like he said not candyland where all the friendly little wastlanders drop brown bag presents for eachothers gay asses while they literally never die.
---
It sounds like you should just go play Ark.
---
Oh cool thanks u
---
See, this is why i always say there's a difference between criticism and bitching. Not once in this post do you say specifically what bugs are occuring, much less help Bethesda fix the problems, and you even tell the developers to kill themselves which is just not okay in any situation. You aren't helping anyone, least of all yourself, making posts like this. If playing a video game can make you so upset that you log in to reddit, type this out, and hit "post" without even once considering "maybe i'm being too rash and need to calm down", then you have some problems you need to work on.
---
The game is buggy as all hell, yes. That doesn't give you permission to be an asshole.
---
yeah, seems to happen on a lot of the newer cpu's, Intel and AMD, but on AMD Ryzen you get a 100% lock that you can't wait out, need to force quit and re log :/
---
And this happens with Strangler + any high dps weapon and also without using the Strangler but firing a laser rifle mode'd like i wrote above.
---
I'm genuinely surprised by this. I thought flux would be the player made currency.
---
What are you having trouble with?
---
That sucks man on ps4 but that is really cool of u thank u
---
Yeah
---
That does sounds fun thanks really cool
---
I have created many characters, tried all weapon builds, currently, my lowest level Is 58, shotgunner. 
---
I heavily suggest creating a new character. Because it Is fun. Also, if you get frustrated, you can go back to the one you are using now. 
---
2h melee Is great, unarmed Is greater. But if you want to be the big boy, you should go for a tank build, focusing on defense.
---
When you hover your cursor over an emote there should be an ‚Äúexpand‚Äù option at the bottom of your screen. It‚Äôs only for certain emotes since it replaces it (for example you can‚Äôt have ‚Äúwave‚Äù and ‚Äúsalute‚Äù since your salute counts as your wave).
---
You're lying. Im on this reddit every day. I see it very infrequent. Maybe once a week.
---
There is.  Put the trash in the trashcan.  Bring back survival servers!
---
I have had the same thought while cruising the Reddit markets over the past year.
---
I haven't played fallout 76 in months I still follow this sub to see updates though
---
  Perfect storm, black diamond, bunker buster, and all rise are unique legendaries.
---
While their non legendary counterparts can be upgraded to include some of the benefits of the legendary, not all effects can be added.
---
The Gutter is a non-legendary with a legendary effect that cannot be added to the base version of the weapon.
---
I completely agree, I've already been bracing myself for it especially with the legendary system being pushed back.
---
Playing an instrument or sleeping are ways to stay logged in for a good while. Plus you have a buff when you come back.
---
Honey?
---
Where‚Äôs my super sledge?
---
It‚Äôs for the greater good!
---
Past 2 weeks I go to attack an enemy in melee and I get hit sound, blood and damage numbers but their health stays the same. Past 3 days have been especially bad to a point where I‚Äôm just getting killed by 3-4 scorched cause I can‚Äôt lay damage on them half the time. Along with server crashes and just general buggy play I finally had a rage moment and had to vent.
---
I actually think they‚Äôre being really smart about it so far. Just look at what happened when they released The Burrows. They pumped it up as more than it was and it led to players being disappointed. Even more than they need new people to be excited, they need existing players to be happy. If the existing player base dumps on new content as soon as it comes out, that would be terrible. 
---
At Quakecon they said they were aiming for November. That still seems realistic. We‚Äôve also seen locations around the map quietly getting updates in preparation for the new content‚Äîgo look at Anchor Farm, there‚Äôs a lot more there than there used to be. 
---
On top of all that, this is going to be a major update. We know that those come I‚Äôm with an increased likelihood of bugs and an increased number of players‚Äîwhich puts extra load on the servers. If there were a huge marketing push ahead of it, it would only add to that load. If there are bugs‚Äîand we all know there will be‚Äîthat will only serve to create a perfect storm of problems, resulting in yet another disastrous launch. 
---
If they continue as they are, being quiet about things until they drop, not getting too much hype going, they‚Äôll be in a better position for success. They can always turn on the PR and hype machines. Better to do that after everything is in place and working. It‚Äôll be even more credible if the existing player base has positive things to say.
---
You need skeet shooter. You NEED it. That and a hardened receiver, plus a long barrel. Then, you have a working weapon which hits SO hard, the game wont register damage of each pellet properly and you will HEAL enemies instead. 
---
Welcome to my shotgunner.

Hey /u/Eckserah, does the queen scale?

Does the scorchbeast queen scale?

Sounds right. You were just making a joke with your earlier comment, yeah?

Amen brother ....  I had some ass running circles around me daring me to shoot him. Did I want to unleash with 2 Daisycutter and wipe him off the server? Yeah .... but I did a step better. I said, " Peace be with you .... "  He left.

---
You log on to the server but for whatever reason your camp was packed up.  Just say you got foreclosed on and move on.
---
I don't drop anything from my main until level 50. Because I have to rely on others for that. Also rifles still hit a lot when you headshot super mutants, even without perks. Shotguns are terrible because you can't use another weapon, besides melee, but I imagine you have the strength for the damage boost even without perks. From your comment I can only understand that you play the game wrong.
---
i don‚Äôt wear armor just a prototype hazmat suit, good for sneak and berserkers weapons. also the fixer works well too
---
Ah :P
---
I still think they're viable, compared to the other "normal" weapons, ignoring melee which is just down right broken at the moment.
---
I like to use mine to clear out silos, also makes destroying mainframe cores really fast.
---
Range could use a buff though.
---
They changed many things. In my case, they blocked the entrance by the roof, which was my favourite. Loved that roof access.
---
Complete opposite experience. You have to do enough damage to get drops. I'm 6 of last 10 for not doing enough before I switched to crowd control
---
There probably won't be any news, good or bad, until after the Halloween event is done. So I'm looking at the next inside the vault following the end of the event.

no she does not scale Answered by /u/Waffle_Cop
---
I've tagged her, ran off to the weird tree grove to kill the legendary that spawns there, ran back when she was at 5% and still gotten loot.
---
Same with the adds. I rarely kill them to make sure anyone can get them tagged.
---
Oh duh, my bad. 
---
Ya im in game and i press up to bring up the wheel and it wont let me expend the button is grayed out. And i just back out to atom shopped and checked and made sure i have my extra emotes equipped and still nothen.

Are there still references to a chinese assault rifle as a weapon in the files?
---
I've been having a few problems with melee's registering, so I get it.
---
Yes... That's works ..... Thx.....

The problem with slap damage was that it was possible for griefers to slap to death low level, pacifist players. 
---
There are too many holes in design which make it impossible to balance things.

No damage numbers. Boooo lol

edit: what's this about radshield not supressing mutations? It does. I promise.
---
Weird... full rifle set up for perks  furious prime gauss. Dozen or so shots into her and they never count. Had to get in her face with tse gatling and unload for a minute
---
10 minutes after you walk away odds are you will be disconnected from server lol. Let's not forget about that problem
---
1. is the camp item use calculated by the number of polygons each item takes (like in F4)?
---
2. are there any mentions of the "Beer keg" in the data, apart from being in the camp build menu?
---
3. how are the public events queued? can we force start a specific event or is it pre-determined?
---
4. can the explosion from an explosive weapon cripple a limb in combination with a crippling per (such as Enforcer)?
---
5. can you write or point us a guide on how to extract the database from the game?
---
6. is 25 charisma really the cap for a maximum discount or is there a way to buy items from npcs even cheaper?
---
7. can you share a table with all the armor upgrades and their effects on weight and other stats?

Based on some other posts I‚Äôve seen from /u/eckserah and /u/gilpo1 I assume you have a similar line to bug reporting as /u/aten_ra. Since this side channel bug reporting has been created have there been improvements to Bethesda‚Äôs bug fixing? Everybody has some pet bug/annoyance and sometimes it feels like not enough communication comes from Bethesda on long standing issues.
---
Hi,thanks for doing this ama. I have some questions:
---
DAMAGE QUESTIONS
---
When you do damage, what does the grey part of the health bar represent? Your damage only of the combined damage of yours and other people?
---
Might sound like a silly question, but with the explosive legendary effect is the damage type energy, explosive or inherited from the guns base damage type? How does this effect the armor damage calculation ie. Are the two damages counted as combined or separate.
---
What is the deal with Two shot with regard to armor penetration, is it calculated per bullet or as a combined total.
---
The queen seems to have some damage mitigation on top of her resistances, do armor pen perks or legendary effects effect it. On a related note,does she have any explosive resistances? How about the sheepsquash?
---
NON DAMAGE QUESTIONS
---
What factors dictate agro? Is it just location or does damage output,damage resistance etc factor into it?
---
Im confused with the stealth system in general. What effect and magnitude does chameleon mutation, Chameleon legendary, harder to detect legendary effect, sneak perk, escape artist, fixer effect, shadowed mod and agility have. Also, what is the deal if you are in caution but the target is fighting other people who aren't sneaking.
---
Does the tenderizer perk actually work? Is it worth ranking up?
---
Does lucky break perk work - ive heard it doesn't at rank 2 and 3
---
Legendary drops, what effects what you get? Ive noticed I get more nocturnal drops at night,is there anything else? Ive also noticed that if I get a world drop of say junkies, then there seems to be a better chance of getting a junkies from the purveyor - is this a thing or am I imagining it?
---
lies.
---
Up to 3 for balancing reasons.  Everyone has some combination of marsupial, bird bones, adrenal reaction, healing factor, or melee mutations.  Junkies makes sense as your addictions reduce dr and special stats, you take a hit for the bonus.  Same with bloodied builds.
---
Now if they buffed junkies to give a max of 75% damage bonus I'd say mutant's up to 50 would work, so they can both kinda keep up with bloodied builds.
---
I like the idea though, it's currently just a ripoff of +10% damage when aiming.  That one too should get buffed a bit by like 5-10%, since for most weapons 10% isn't even a major damage increase since it is based on base damage before all the perk and mutation and legendary buffs to damage.
---
yes. theres 2 mods associated with handmades that have the names. https://imgur.com/cmQLTDX Answered by /u/Eckserah
---
Hah, yeah, I agree on everything you just said. I agree *more*.
---
I love the concept of these community challenges, but I agree that they need a little work. 
---
1. List the goals from the get go. 
---
2. Put a counter in the game. A Watoga style sign with the flipping numbers/letters at each train station would be awesome‚Äîbut I‚Äôd settle for a daily counter on the main menu. 
---
3. Include the ability to have the target of the challenge spawn as legendary. I know some scorched do, but it‚Äôs pretty rare. 
---
4. Increase the number of events that feature waves of the challenge target. Really give people a chance to get in on the action and get some rewards along the way.
---
Oh wow your right i found the ones it works on now. Thank you very much for walking me though it im psyched i figured it out. Sorry im a little slow sometime hah.
---
Do scorchbeasts use dragon AI from Skyrim? I remember a post popping up earlier about it but someone else said all those files were empty.
---
Any actual info on luck affecting legendary drop rates? (shifting curve tables, increasing 3* mob spawns or 3* drop rates, etc).
---
*edit*
---
TY kindly, no need to waste time grinding that  test. All just variance then.
---
Is there a cap on INT xp boosts? Also is there a cap on AGI stealth boosts?
---
No, no joke. I don't want a long keypress when eating/drinking.
---
If there were to be a delay, I couldn't put that stuff on my wheel and use it fast. I would have to open the inventory and scroll around. A big no way, no how.
---
Some of them may be grayed out. Circle around until you see it turn white
---
*Enters Behemoth
---
Youre right i just figured it out. Thank you much for taking the time to walk me through it im a little slow with stuff sometime lol.
---
What happened to the Gilded Minigun? Does it still drop/spawn?
---
Every single point, I'm in complete agreement with. If I ever see you at a bar, I will buy you a beer.
---
It's good. Have a nice day
---
u/aten_ra is part of our group actually! we also have some contacts with the bethesda community managers. As for bug fixes: I'm not totally sure how much we have managed to effect the rate at which they are fixed but we do help the cms by detailing bugs better than a lot of people do. Answered by /u/Eckserah

Communist detected on Amercian soil. Lethal force engaged.
---
Sealth for any rifle build is op.  The sneak perks plus escape artist work great and allows 2x damage as long as you don't get into danger.  Covert op also increases the sneak damage bonus.  All three sets of commando cards are a must.  I also run tank killer and ground pounder.  Ground pounder works great for hip shot accuracy.  For nuke zones I switch out tank killer for glow sighted if I'm running a nuke zone full of glowing ones.  If your a solo player lone wanderer is another great perk for damage avoidance and ap regeneration.  If your a vats user, there are multiple good perk cards in both agility and luck.
---
The bloodied build is super strong when combined with a bloodied weapon, sneak, and the adrenal mutation.  For armor with the bloodied build I run 5 pieces of unyielding most of the time.  If I'm going into a hard fight or going into an area where I will not be using stealth and will be taking damage, i run 2-3 pieces of unyielding and 2-3 pieces of bolstering.  For perk cards I invest in some of the defensive cards like nerd rage, blocker, barbarian, dodgy, serendipity, etc.  Armor I've been running what I can find.  Mostly heavy combat since 2 star pieces can be found from queen fight rewards and player vending.  I've had decent luck with the marine or heavy leather for arms and legs but would recommend the heavy combat chest piece.  
---
For my full health build I've had good luck with instigating rifles.  Most enemies are full health so the 2x damage on the first shot takes effect.  For armor I run a set of 5 bolstering pieces.  The bostering offers increased damage resistance the lower your health and starts kicking in when you drop below 90% health, maxing out below 10% health.  I prefer it over vanguards because I like the extra tankyness as I take damage.  Vanguard's adds extra damage resistance the higher your health but only cover the range from 50% to 100% health.  I haven't tried the junkies build but others have said it will give you 50% bonus damage if you have 5 different addictions and still run full health.

I've had great luck with both the handmade or the combat rifle when paired with the powerful automatic receiver.  Ive been running with combat rifles because I've had better luck finding them at cheaper prices in player vendors with the legendary prefixes that I wanted.  For the secondary prefix I perfer the faster fire rate over explosive but both are great modifiers.  For starting out I've had great luck with 1 star legendarys or 2-3 star ones with undesirable secondary/tertiary modifiers.  You can find them cheap and it allows you time to either find what your looking for for a decent price or allows you to get that "god tier" weapon drop.
---
For mutations, I recommend adrenal reaction ( increased weapon damage with decreasing health) whither you run bloodied or full health.  I also like speed demon because it increases your movement speed and reload time.  Marsupial for jumping out of the way if you get overwhelmed.  And carnivore or herbivore to counter the side effect of speed demon.  Eagle eyes and bird bones are also of use if your a heavy vats person for the increased perception and agility buff.
---
Sorry for the war and peace post but hopefully it helps.  Overall I've found if you can stay in sneak, have a decent 1 star legendary, and focus on damage perks instead of quality of life perks most things die within 5 shots or less.
---
Adrenal Reaction + unyielding set for melee builds is a pretty intense synergy, the only downside is needing to cover a distance to a target that can most likely start hitting you long before you hit them but with the right perks your dr can soak up hits, and with a psychobuff, medx, or fury they can tank even more hits.
---
I wonder if there's any other super good synergy builds.
---
I have only one single question...
---
Where the fuck can we get the Scout Armor Mask? 
---
All that u/valseek's henchmen can tell us is "it's still in the game". Even a ticket I opened for this, got closed with this bologna generica.

A central bank upstairs once the renovation is completed that gives people access to anyone's vendors that are hooked up to a satellite dish or something?  That'd give people a huge reason to visit WS Resort more often.

Is it game-play effecting?  I would be more concerned if the end result was a defense bot, but just something to send a notice?  And you don't have to pay $$ for Atoms, I never have, and I've "bought" many things with Atoms, just from the awards in-game.
---
I agree that in-game addons in a pay-to-play manner are a dangerous and slippery slope, but I haven't really seen anything (YET) that is egregious.
---
If anything, I'm concerned that Bethesda's model is unsustainable.  Let's be realistic here, it costs real actual cash for them to run these servers and keep patching things.  If I were to estimate, it's probably between $80k to $120k a month for /just/ the servers, but that is on supposition gleaned from their server loads and player bases.  It could easily be double that.
---
Frankly, I would suggest they move to a nominal subscription model for in-game content.  Don't freak out on me.  Think about it.  If instead of a $60 up-front cost, they just charged $2/month when you want to play, as a player you would hit a break-even point in 2.5 years.  But then the ongoing subscriptions could keep it alive.  They could keep Appalachia as-is, and create a new server/map set for the uplifted subscription.  So if you are on the legacy pre-paid, you can keep using it.  Maybe even for 2.5 years.  And in the meantime, they build a rev stream that allows a perpetual engagement.
---
Furthermore, by tying it to a subscription, the dev teams are now directly beholden to players, rather than stockholders, as if they piss-off too many players, subscriptions drop.  It's a far better rev model.
---
As it is now, if they don't see a recurring revenue stream, then fo76 will be shelved.  So hate it all you can, remember that they HAVE to somehow figure out revenue.  Nothing is free.

(sorry, I will step off the soapbox now)

Luck doesn't have any effect on the rank of the legendary, the rank of the legendary drop, what item type drops (weapon/armor) or what legendary effects are on it. The only thing that is effected by luck is the durability of the weapon or armor when it drops (I've had them drop fully broken before) Answered by /u/Eckserah
---
SBQ can be killed solo BUT you need a good build and everything that pushes your dmg up, fastes way is melee especially the meat hook.
---
I just made one, she's not the greatest but still pretty good. Focus on perception, luck, and agility. Pistols aren't super viable except for revisiting low level areas or tagging enemies in events unfortunately. Rifle builds tend to focus on sneak or crit shots (or both).
---
don't listen to these posters, rad shield does prevent and suppress mutations.
---
Thanks for taking questions. Are there any dummied Mistress of Mystery quests in the questline, or any clean variants of the outfits that just never got used?
---
Oh, and is Abbie's corpse actually in the game? I've yet to see proof of her assumed death anywhere.
---
Great idea -- I hadn't thought of having it report other statuses!  One would have to be able to adjust the notifications, or it could get super noisy.
---
I'm Hoping they start sharing something soon aswell.     I'm thinking the next "Inside The Vault" with regards to patch 14 should be pretty telling on what's going on hopefully.
---
I was just in a queen fight and the Strangler Heart caused screen tearing and freezing.  I ended up crashing.

yes it does
---
I love ap regen.  But tbh i take what i can get :)
---
What affects the maximum durability of identical items? I had two items with the same stats (both legendary and non-legendary) have different durability with the same upgrades.
---
If a special affects this then how much is it and at which number does the bonus max out?
---
Also, are items crafted with higher intelligence actually better (higher DR or other stats) or does it only cause the weapon to be repaired for up to 200% when it is crafted?
---
[this is not min/maxed but it works and could be used as a basic sneaky/vats/crit template to tweak](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7c455bc&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72lr2l11pp1pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1s50si0sj0l71ao0an0ar0p00cu0&amp;w=p80p90c52i30ia0ij2i42iq2at1lm2pa0&amp;m=8c&amp;nw=&amp;n=)

Rifle will be either sneaky sniper or commando (automatic).  Perks are in the same tree, and you can swap in and out (once you have enough perks to spare).  Sniper is powerful, against one or two mobs, lots of 1 shotting things.  Against more than 2, you will have issues.  Commando is easier, but uses more ammo and guns are harder to come by at lower levels.
---
Pistols are uninteresting.  They can be OK (especially full auto), but the damage lags behind at best, and isn't useful nearer end game.
---
Rifle/commando use perception, you'll need 15 there.  6-9 points in either rifleman or commando.  Tank killer and at least 1 in concentrated fire.  Definitely some points in lone wanderer and bloody mess (charisma and luck respectively).  Those are the real must haves.  Gun-fu for commando is nice, sneak and evasive help a lot.  Beyond that you can branch out depending on your play style (VATS or not, sneaky vs non-sneaky, things like that).
---
Seems to be getting worse - I've frozen a bit myself too, and its not just AMD either.  Have to be careful when using certain weapons, I try to avoid full auto too long.  My faster fire rate Ultracite Gatling is the one that triggers it the most for me...  though the other day I crashed to desktop with my 50 cal - was at Encryptid and had the imposter right in my face.
---
I can see your point on that, and can agree with that. BGS just needs a bigger team or something close to that. I know they were doing a big hiring thing awhile back, but with most problems would have been fixed with a bigger team. Or even fans on this subreddit have come up for fixes and pushed them towards Bethesda.

I know it's 2 weeks away!! Only problem is, I'll be on fo76 for the event every second I'm home, since I'm at work a majority of the event.

-What are the percentage chances for the hyper-rare outfit drops from events? 
---
-Do the various progress bars/damage bars play a role in what is rewarded from an event? Example, the extractor health in Uranium Fever and if repairing them increases your chances at good loot?
---
-in general, how important is the Charisma stat when it comes to event rewards? In-game loading screens say it changes your chances of getting rare rewards.

If I recall correctly, you can find a black powder rifle in the Garrahan Estate which is at Ash heap.  There's a locked display case in one of the rooms  that contains the weapon.  I'm pretty sure it's the Garrahan Estate, but it may also be the Hornwright Estate if it's not there.
---
Maybe try to click the respawn button with your mouse
---
I'm playing on PC with an xbox controller, so I don't know if this makes things different. 
---
When I first encountered the issue it seemed to be an input problem. 
---
The game kept running but didn't react to any input.
---
 So I took out the batteries of my controller to disconnect it and the game switched to keyboard and mouse control. My keyboard didn't do anything by hitting space (to respawn) but I could click the respawn button with my mouse and that worked. 
---
I know that it will obviously work on pc only. 
---
has anyone else tried to click that respawn button at the bottom of the screen with their mouse? 
---
I'm really curious if it's just a keyboard lock or if switching the input mode did the trick...
---
No guide really. I wanted to overhaul my main and spent a couple hours swapping points and reading food and drink effects online, to get as much melee bonus I could get. In the video I pop a Fury and Whiskey because they don‚Äôt last long.

So some things like sneak, Lock pick, disease resistance, crafting condition must have a cap though?

I wish we could‚Äôve gotten to the 50% off purveyor goal :(

Just because games in general do this doesn't make it okay for Bethesda to have this type of game design.

You're not doing anything wrong, this sub just has people who downvote things they don't like.
---
I've noticed there's a limit to barter aswell. At this point I've got such high charisma that hard bargain isn't useful anymore.

The balancing fact for this is that 1/3'd of melee hits don't register even if you land them correctly.
---
Does achieving 100% disease resist via armor prevent disease from all sources? or does it only prevent specific diseases, of so which ones and would wearing such a set make the gas mask unnecessary?

does the disease resist bonus from well fed/not thirst stack and provide the same effect?

any other way to reduce the disease chance in the game and how much does one endurance point affect this? any way to reach max disease resist with increasing endurance to 25 or more?

No unyielding str* bonus tho...

I have walked like a god through a silo wearing full troubleshooters way back when. But I stick with that juicy S. P. E. C. I. A. L. bonus.

Understandably so. Finding a random encounter deathclaw (or other cool animal) isnt the easiest. Sure, you can serve hop for a few hours, but that's no fun. I'd rather play the game naturally.

With a good rifle and Adrenaline, you don‚Äôt have to give up your rifleman origins. Tbh, the rifleman build isn‚Äôt strong enough for the queen but 1-shots everything else. Without being perked for rifleman, a bloodied lever action after stacking adrenaline, 1-shots scorched at the queen and pretty effective regardless.

SO MUCH YES

Can you give us the datamined info for the plasma grenade plan drop?

Maybe something like:

I‚Äôll check HF. Is it a limited supply item?
---
Good point, I'll keep my eyes open for the mod itself at the vendor.
---
Then maybe you didn't understand. Imagine you're* walking through the wasteland and come across a box of Dandy Boy Apples. A tap of the button moves an item into your inventory, like it currently already does. A long press means you immediately consume it without transferring it into your inventory. You'd still be able to move the item into your inventory with a short press and hot-button it to your wheel. That functionality wouldn't change. But the new feature would let you quickly consume food items without going through the menu.
---
Thank you
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie, 6 people were probably in a loading screen the entire fight. People spawned in not knowing wtf just happened and started giving me thumbs down. 
---
I got a lame 1* troubleshooters harpoon gun for that fight. You aren‚Äôt missing out on anything.
---
This has been talked about loads before. It makes no sense to have it in the game, it's a minutemen only weapon. So unless the minute men come into the game somehow, NO!

Yeah I know, only SD I knew about or paid attention to. I have been to Big B's but never really paid attention to it been a SD.

they already have it in the dev room they just gotta adjust the damage on it before it can come out officially.

This is a purely for fun build and while the damage output can be insane especially if you run a bloodied explosive and remove gunsmith for demo expert I only have a BE15 revolver but I would guess that a pipe action would headshot for upwards of 6k. This build in now way i helpful for raids nor SBQ (just grab your favorite type of heavy and go to town anyways)  but if you want to try something different this is it and it is a blast.   
---
PS AA/Executioners work just fine with this build too but if you want the big damage go bloodied. Junkies was for some reason lack luster but that could be the fact I have limited chems or would forget thus suffering the negative effects.

u/valseek, u/ladydevann any chance to bring the mask back to modus or to substantially increase the drop chance? I've been doing the events for longer than I care to remember and with the change in event-triggering, these masks are effectively unobtainable now!

I got lucky as shit lol. If no one else is there using their noisy ass guns and stun-locking her in the air, she lands consistently.

* **Is the camp item use calculated by the number of polygons each item takes (like in F4)?**

We wanted to say yes as a knee-jerk response, but because they can manually change the "Cost" of specific C.A.M.P. buildables.

Explosive damage is a modifier for the primary damage type, and would be effected by related perks from the fired weapon.

It's also counted as an additional hit, so Suppressor's, Vampire's, etc all benefit.

Yeah without knowing how your special and perks are set up if would be difficult to advise.  If you haven't done so already nukes &amp; dragons is a great site to use to plan out your build or respec.  It would at least give you an idea how how many points it would take to respec.  Also places like the events, whitespring, harpers ferry, and west teck are good places to farm xp to build up special points fast.  Link below.

Thing Is the Sbq fight comes with a serving of radrats, scorched, mirelurk hunters and stingwings on the side. Fighting the dragon Is More close and personal. You get distracted.
---
They enjoy it. It‚Äôs not an inconvenience for them that they‚Äôre looking to avoid with a server hop, they‚Äôre actively seeking combat and a little tension surrounding their resource grind. It‚Äôs not something that I do, not much of a PVP person, but I can appreciate why some people seek it out and why it would be fun to fight another living, thinking player over some resources rather than gunning down 10 more mindless super mutants.

What are the drop rates for colored bats (pink, yellow, indigo)? 
---
Also not sure if this is answerable, but sor weapons like these bats and the Charging Lobber Tesla, was the intention to make these mods unlearnable on purpose or an oversight?
---
Do you have a subterranean base?
---
CAMP plans arent always in stock. Sometimes you got to sever hop for them. You want to look for the plan called Dresser singular. There is another plan that's dressers plural that's the broken wooden ones.

It's one of Graham's potential inventory items. If you are on Xbox I can come to your camp and build a few for you?

I didn‚Äôt make this clip for an audience. It was an accidental solo that I barely remembered to record. So piss off.

This looks great, I did something similar just south of Mama Dolce's, but this is way better! Did you have trouble with placing the floors around the trees? That is not easy!
---
Then you are a tool.  There are two things to do at a workshop, only one of them is PvP.  Do you know if the other player(s) want PvP, or do you just enjoy being a dick?

What makes Uranium Fever's uranium extraction bar fill faster?
---
While I can see a fight as being fun, the last 3 guys to take a workshop from me were crouched while cloaked or stealthboy with an automatic explosive, not much of a fight
---
It's the only possible PvP. I only claim them for plans and exp. Or challenges. If I get contested, I Let them keep it.
---
It‚Äôs. Bloodied exp with 1perception I think.
---
I stopped using the backpack at all. I had the increased capacity but omg I was dying from radiation SO FAST. So I guess it's back to camp for me

For this plan to have a chance to drop, all three creatures *must* be alive. Answered by /u/Sergeant_MQZ

No thank you.   Forcing PVP on people who dont want it is just lame.  Oooh real challenge to get the drop on PVE players.

What is the highest percentage of harder to detect while sneaking you can get? What % bonus does the harder to detect while sneak legendary provide? Does chameleon armor add to this or is this separate from it? What bonus does wood armor with shrouded provide?
---
I have dyslexia and I read that as Cosby Tree House and Immediately thought of Nukashine in the punch bowl.
---
I think that makes sense to group players into servers based on if they have Pacifist off or on instead of making it a separate mode.
---
The drop chance is dependant on the item you are looking for, most of the super rare outfits have a drop chance of 0.03%.
---
The progress bars do matter, in the example you gave(Uranium Fever) There are 7 different reward tiers that give you more loot each time you go up a tier.
---
Charisma affects XP and Caps rewards, but not items. Answered by /u/Waffle_Cop
---
Thanks for the info
---
I want your caps and the shit you are carrying.
---
I uninstalled to save space recently, but I have notes on a lot of these:
---
IIRC the armor penetration calc depends on the full damage, not on the number of projectiles that hit. If you land a single projectile, you get exactly half the damage. Shotguns work the same way.
---
The SBQ has 70% damage reduction, which is applied before the armor penetration calc and so works out closer to 80% unless you have ridiculous damage output. I'm not aware of any effects that reduce or bypass damage reduction, although VATS crits are a possibility. I don't recall the Imposter having any damage reduction bonuses, but it's immune to crippling.
---
Stealth items and perks use three entry points, "Mod Detection Movement", "Mod Detection Light" and "Mod Detection Sneak Skill". I don't know how those stack with each other, as the interaction is code rather than data based.
---
* Sneak skill: +25 per point on both Mod Detection Sneak Skill and Mod Detection Movement.
---
* Muffled: Probably supposed to be +5 per piece on Mod Detection Movement. Extremely poorly written, and may be +10 or +15 depending on how the bugs fall out.
---
* Shadowed: +5 per piece on Mod Detection Light if Subject.GetLightLevel is less than 50.
---
* Legendary sneak armor: +5 Mod Detection Movement, +15 Mod Detection Sneak Skill. Does not stack for multiple pieces, which is probably a bug.
---
Last I checked, Tenderizer worked extremely well in practice, probably bugged as the contribution for each player wasn't being capped except by the global limit of +40%, at least for shotguns. It used to not report in the damage numbers though. I don't know if that was fixed recently.
---
Lucky Break's ESM definition looked fine to me last time I checked.
---
lol workshops are pvp zones ..i think it may mention this when you claim it
---
Thanks. On Pc but appreciate the offer.
---
Damn right I would, I'm shocked &amp; appalled that they would only cater to blokes. Women have needs too #Triggered
---
You could keep the gunsmith card, but not run with it.  Get Weapon Artison up to 3 pts and repair to 200% while in camp. Then switch it out for something else while roaming....demo expert, nerd rage, something else? I only have 4 in INT and explore with Nerd Rage x3 and scrapper.  Scrapper will net you more junk to sell in vending machines.
---
Take extra int points and add to luck? Can Do is handy for food, Pharma Farma is good for getting more caps via drug sales.
---
I'd also shelve the slow meat metabolizer and aquaboy.  Theres rarely a need to go in water. Good Doggy 1x and dromedary 2x does me fine for food and water, combines with Can Do.  That's with Adrenaline mutation.
---
I liked it when you needed certain special points in order to use certain weapons. Like, being able to swing a deathclaw should ask for 6 strength, etc.
---
It does, wasn't my question
---
Wow. Just love the lighting placements. Looks amazing at night. Daytime video tour in the works?
---
It won't, Bethesda employees have commented saying scorch and Scorchbeast will remain in game when Wastelanders is out, there will be two main quests.
---
Questions about Arkthos pharma:
---
1. How does it affect the rewards when all animals survive?
---
2. How does switching to Quercus affect the rewards?
---
3. Is it possible to get formula Q ? (same as P, but without addiction chance and penalty to hydration)
---
4. Does having the bear arms plan unlocked prevent another bear arm plan from being rewarded or does it in any way increase the chance of getting the upgrade plans?
---
I'd be interested in a comparative analysis of the different perks that affect stealth, like Muffled, Shrouded, Shadowed, and Chameleon, along with the Sneak perk card.  Do they all affect the same value?  Are some quantitatively better than others?
---
How entitled.
---
Your prices are not low enough. Plans go for 5-10.
---
So I could ask in return why do the people that  take workshops continue to ask this question. I mean other than to stir the pot.
---
No worries. Glad you found it. Everybody has had to learn it at some point ;-). Besides, you‚Äôve asked a question I‚Äôm sure others are too scared to ask.
---
I just keep killing them in the hope we get the final stretch reward. But yeah a hourly updated timer or something would be more motivating then the 23.98 million we see now.
---
Is there any cage/spike armor in the datamines?
---
lol nice veiled trading post good try though I liked it
---
Thank you taking the time to do this! 
---
Does Glow Sight work vs the Queen?
---
Is Suppressor/Tenderizer reapplied after every attack, or is there a cooldown?
---
Any interesting stealth buffs/nerfs from the last couple patches that you've discovered? A lot of people (myself included) have noticed a huge buff to poison damage since the Raids update, though it was never mentioned in the patch notes.
---
Wrong. I'm not a tool. All of the Players in workshops agreed to PVP, whether they "want" to or not. The dialogue box says "Spend 25 Caps to Claim this Workshop? Other Players may initiate PvP with you by attempting to Claim it from you!" And they said "Ok". They are the only PvP zones on the map. How I choose the conduct myself within them is entirely within the confines of the games rules and none of your business. Maybe you should try not being rude to people because they don't play the game by your personal rules. I'm playing by Bethesdas rules. The only person being a "dick" here is you man. Chill out
---
Awesome!   
---
The Guilded mod is still on the MiniGun object template combinations, so rarely if the engine "bugs out" a bit a minigun can spawn with the upgrade on it, but currently it is not linked with a leveled list or script as a available option
---
Ive never seem them that low in any other camp ive been to but ill put em down lower then
---
My commando has a l√°ser rifle, automatic, as his main weapon. Just get all the commando perks, Vats and that.  Ammo Is expensive to make, but. You can buy it
---
its 160 with just one crank
---
Is this what Strong does once he finds the Milk of Human Kindness?
---
That is a bit high, how much is max cranks?
---
After talking to another player maybe the best approach is not losing anything when u engage in pvp. I know some will say no risk no reward. Maybe if there is no reward for killing a fellow vault dweller then maybe player will be less likely to engage. I dont know what the best answer is because u will never make everyone happy. Thanks for the comment

I cribbed/copied/compiled this elsewhere, but my teammate runs this build. I keep the mobs busy (or the Queen cryolated)  just in case while he gets all up in her guts, as it were.
---
They will update it tomorrow.
---
I think a good way to balance is if someone else wants to contest the workshop, you get a notice that gives you the option to just give it up or fight in pvp, so you don't get blown away abruptly. I mean.. still won't save you from some ass 50 levels higher with an explosive shotgun. But it would be a nice quality of life touch.
---
Are you ready to pay them to work on weekends?
---
I personally love the event but a better counter would go along way. Adding a personal challenge for the time would also be sweet , kill 5000  yourself get 250 atoms would have motivated me to kill more. I had already completed the kill scorched with ‚Äúx‚Äù weapon type ages ago. Hopefully the next clean up is to kill  robots
---
That was probably the fun of it, the wait and the moment of finally getting to strike. That‚Äôs what hunting is more or less, a lot of waiting for 5 seconds of thrill, and people seem to enjoy that. Just playing devils advocate here.
---
Can you (or myself) share you're  comment please ? I think alot of people don't know  about that ?
---
160x6=960
---
960x2.50=2400 for sneak damage
---
it does the moment you claim a workshop it asks you if you are sure to do so because this makes you open to pvp 
---
every time you claim one
---
You mentioned in one comment that Luck affects weapon/armor durability when it drops. Do you mean *maximum* durability, or current durability? Same question for Intelligence and the durability of crafted items. 
---
I know there's 4th and 5th star legendary effects in the game files, but is there anything in the data that indicated when or how they might be implemented? edit: or if the 4th and 5th star effects currently in the game data will be changed when they *are* implemented? I'm noticing some potential conflicts, since a bunch of the 4th star effects override the projectile just like the explosive modifier.
---
Thanks for doing this guys and gals. 
---
During the first handful of months after launch a bare Power Armor Frame gave a 60 DMG/60EN/60RAD resist on its own with no Power Armor Pieces attached. Those stats even added to ones total DR/EN/RAD resist in Power Armor. 
---
At one point that‚Äôs was removed from the game completely without a word from Bethesda whatsoever on the subject. Did Bethesda remove that from the Power Armor Frame or simply make those numbers hidden?
---
When Bethesda reworked the Power Armor system a few months back did they change anything fundamental in regards to damage resistance while wearing Power Armor?
---
Happened to me, you can respawn well I could at least but it took an absurd amount of time but after several thousand 308 rounds to kill her I was pretty determined to get my loot

It's not over until tomorrow?
---
High five for Grafton High bed!
---
C.A.M.P. looks great, keep it up!

Use a pressure plate..

Nah, that‚Äôs exactly what it is. Crouching on the power pylons at Poseidon with a 2-shot fatman and the poor guy with X-01 doesn‚Äôt know where I am is....more than nice.
---
You can never reach 100% immunity for any type of damage "normally" as damage resistance provides diminishing returns.    
---
There is a rough chart in the link below.
---
# For Disease / Poison Resist:  
---
&gt;For Poison Damage  
---
&gt;Poison deals damage each second, as a distinctly inflicted hit,  typically for 10 seconds; for example, if the player character has a  poison resistance of 5 and suffers a poison 3 hit, then once per second  for 10 seconds, they will suffer a 3 damage hit, resisted with a  resistance of 5, which otherwise follows the rules for projectile  damage. 
---

---
Wow, that is a bit high.
---
That‚Äôs my point! Almost one year and no balance at all!
---
Yeah this is the exact problem I'm having lately. I'm using a bloodied handmade with 10% scoped, with the sneak damage card rank 2, and I'm getting about 76-100 ish damage on a queen, where as my bloodied ss strength DCG is pushing 121-130 with no perk cards. My handmade 2 shots most things with sneak. And for some reason, the sneak card for guns has been working with my dcg so I've been getting 300 if I'm sneaking by the queen, but I need radshield to stop dying or coming too close to death. 
---
Okay quick question, how many ranks of adrenaline do you have? I only have 1 of them, but I'm thinking of ranking it up but haven't been able to ask people who use it. Also, for a bloodied, would you put on any fireproof or leave it off? Someone told me it was pointless to have on a bloodied build, but I've seen bloodies running it also. So I've started to take it off but left 1 rank on
---
my bloodied gauss rifle is about 860-890ish damage `when i am at low health so yea thats pretty crazy get a bloodied laser musket with 6 cranks and you just might be one shotting scorchbeasts and sheepsquatches.
---
Well who knows we may get to meet the start of the minutemen with some Garvey in wastelanders demanding we help a workshop this time.
---
\-takes notes-

Legendary super mutant

They take them to grief people then normally leave the server if you dont fight back.
---
Maybe I want more than 1 workshop? If I leave this server I lose the other one I just claimed
---
Have there been any recent responder related datamines?
---
The shotguns used to be good in this game. I have a 3 star TSE version of each one sitting in my stash hoping they'll put them back to the way they were.

No he is not a tool for doing PvP in a PvP area. Whether you like it or not, you agree to PvP by taking a workshop

If in Passive Then Slap Damage = 0

Someone with a differing opinion than yours should go play an entirely different game simply because they enjoyed aspects of the game at its release? Seems wrong to me to say that.
---
Great thread. One question - Most ghouls wear pre war military and fireman outfits. Is there obtainable versions in the game files? Many thanks
---
I've seen a map that showed a huge land mass area of Fallout 76 -  is there anything more to this?  Are we getting more land with Wastelanders?
---
I really love to use shotguns in videogames, but fo76 forced me away of them. I had a TSE and a BE Combat Shotgun, the final damage nerf really killed them.
---
Then why isn‚Äôt everyone killing the queen in 28 seconds?
---
The ability to obtain a wanted level past 5 caps is something I'd love to do, but not at the expense of having to unlock 40 owned locked items... There needs to be a method of damaging bases that causes wanteds to raise. The wanted system is pretty much obsolete at this point and it was a valid system to have.
---
While the Fireman outfit can be obtained, the military uniforms cannot. Answered by /u/SoleSurvivor10232077

They could automate updating the tracker. Not necessarily even a live feed, just set it to update every 15-30 minutes.

Because some of us think it‚Äôs dumb to play like that.

We do not know, unfortunately, it will just have to be seen when it comes. Answered by /u/SoleSurvivor10232077

1. When all creatures are alive, the tier three rewards are given, which have the better rewards.

2. When switching to Quercus, there is an alternate level reward list that is used.

3. No. Here you can see that Formula Q is not linked to any quest: https://imgur.com/a/b37Xs3f

4. Some plans, once learned, will not drop again. The Bear Arm plan does not have this condition, so you could get it again. You have to know the base Bear Arm plan though before any of the mod plans will drop. Answered by /u/Sergeant_MQZ
---
Awesome, thanks for that. I'm still super interested in the answers to my other questions if anyone has any input. Esp. The grey part of the enemy health thing as I'd like to know if it's me doing all that damage or I'm self congratulating myself too much üòú
---
if you have more weapons or more armor in your inventory it changes the legendaries you get ? (i.e if i have a lot of armors in my inventory the game will drop more weapons, and vice versa ?) or its totally random ?
---
In the course of a week i had three dissapear so i gave up on taming i have a theory its something to do with server hopping
---
currently the colored bats only drop from vendors. I am unable to get the drop rate for them ATM as that script is a WIP and currently doesnt have that info.
---
As far as the intents of the developers, its all just speculation. Honestly dont know if its intentional or an oversight here. Answered by /u/Waffle_Cop
---
That is awesome !
---
Thank you, but my questions was about Disease , NOT poison :) 
---
I imagined that disease resistance reduced the change to get a disease, but you are right, it could work like in skyrim where there was a hard cap.
---
But the again, you could become fully immune to disease in that game (apart from bugs when this was ignored).
---
unfortunately i was unable to find direct references to anything adding to the score, however we do know(as the game says) that it is reliant on how long the extractors are running. Answered by /u/Waffle_Cop
---
Can I add you! I‚Äôve been trying to find people to play with and none of my friends have the game!

Edit: a word

Why not just turn off pvp and structure dmg entirely for adventure?

I am not going to lie, I had an existential crisis after the fight. It is lonely at the top.

I run a shotgunner too, and I don't have all the damage perks but Enforcer 3 makes everything cake.  I just run around crowds of ghouls and scorched crippling their legs, then stroll around and finish them off at my leisure.

I can usually cripple the Scorchbeast Queen's wings to keep her from flying off, makes things much easier.

Thank you. Could you share the Tier 1 to 3 reward lists and the conditions when those are awarded as well as the alternate reward list for Quercus?

And thanks for answering this even if you won't, has been informative!

Good one! LOL
---
Okay, neat, thanks for answering. To go into it further, does the loot improve as the bar is filled? Specifically asking because I'm wondering if the Shielded Raider plans drop chance is higher if the bar is full up
---
I just take a workshop if I really want it. I also don't feel the need to switch servers just because someone else has already claimed a workshop.
---
Also I'm not one of those guys that takes a workshop just for pvp. I truly intend to keep using it after I stole it from the previous owner.

We aren't ignoring you, finding the specific data as the INT calculations were adjusted in '76
---
I have both sets, but I use X-01.  I use the X-01 more because it has the highest rad-resist and I only really use the armour when I'm in a nuke zone.  Ultracite has a lower rad-resist abut a higher dmg-resist than the X-01 so using either or kind of depends on the intended use of.  I can't speak for mods because I rarely find any that I can tell are for those sets but I'm at a point in the game where I am going to start focusing on some of those aspects.

Griefers don't take workshops because they want the workshops. They take workshops because the they are shitty, horrible people, without acception.  
---
In before a bunch of ill adjusted sociopaths who probably have freezers full of dead puppies in their basements downvote this and rant about how PVP is a "game mechanic" and forcing others to engage in it is "just playing the game, if you don't want to be murdered, avoid any aspect of the game that I can abuse to make the game shitty for you".

You can craft them at Tinkers Workbenches under Energy Ammo.

Perhaps there is a problem with your connection.

Try... Switching your router of the for at least 2 minutes.

Or try a "hard reset" of Xbox (when console is on, hold power button down for 10 seconds and the console will turn off) This clears the consoles cache.

So a home made rifle made from spare parts of a laser rifle or from a broke laser rifle is something that can only be made by the minutemen?
---
I guess that any capable and technical skilled wastelander would be able to create a weapon like that.
---
 It's a bit of a flawed argument to say that only the minutemen would be able to would be able to craft and use them because it's made from parts that are probably a bit easy to aquire in the wasteland.

the spell PerkTargetDebuffSpell "Perk Debuffs" [SPEL:0043CEFE] has the description "This spell is a hack for all perks that need to use the "Apply Combat Hit Spell" to place a spell on the target you are attacking. Unhelpfully, only one instance of that perk entry point is allowed to work at the same time, making perks override each other. Therefore they must all cast this single spell, which has conditions to determine which affects to apply. Yeah... ". this applies to the suppressor and tenderizer perks. Answered by /u/Eckserah

Kinda sucks we won't know how far we got until the last possible day. I originally thought it was auto updated and something just got fudged.
---
Hello!
---
I have an idea to make spreadsheet of all weapons and their stats for game. Tried to do it manually, but that will require enormous amounts if recourses and time. Also when I tried to get some numbers with goolgle spreadsheets, they were inaccurate for pipe weapons and hunting rifle (only weapons I get damage data for atm).
---
So, I have a few questions about weapons.
---
1) How does the damage from different receivers stored in game? Are they set numbers or calculated using some base value and modifiers?
---
2) Is there way to get numbers for other weapon stats like durability, accuracy?
---
3) Seems that damage for weapons is rounded, but it may be rounded up and sometimes rounded down. For example I've got 30 and 31 damage for .45 cal. receivers of lvl 50 pipe rifle. Is it a rounding bug or not (and these numbers are actually different)?
---
4) How legendary effects applied? Are they multipliers?
---
4.1) If yes, what are Junkie's, Bloodied numbers for damage? Is there a cap for Junkie's damage bonus?
---
4.2) Do they reduce durability of weapons? I've noticed that Two Shot breaks easier and have lower accuracy. Is it actually so?
---
And, probably question to all: was there other attempt to make similar spreadsheet?
---
From what I noticed, which I understand isn't going to be taken as fact because this is a *datamine* thread and not an anectdotal one, it is entirely dependant on how soon you started the extraction process in relation to the event starting. Meaning top loot=starting it in under a minute after the event notification, not to mention not letting the extractors be destroyed. Anyway thanks for answering this my guy
---
Wow that dude is my hero!
---
Where are these low prices at and for what plans?
---
1) the damage for the recievers is stored in curvetables in the archives
---
2) there are ways to get the durability modifiers for intellligence, higher intelligence means higher durability
---
3) it is most likely errors thrown by the game, so yes it is a bug
---
4) for the most part yes, there may be some exceptions i'm not thinking of
---

1. How do crit effects stack and how much do they stack? Stuff like Better Crits, tweaked receivers (how much do they add?), crit damage chems, etc.
---
2. How do sneaking effects stack and what is overkill? Stuff like the Sneak perk, sneak legendary effects, shadowed effect, Agility, etc. 
---
3. Does the SBQ take less damage while flying? I've seen several people claim this recently but it seems unlikely to me.
---
4. In PvP, do the players Perception and Agility factor in when using Berry Mentats vs. Stealth Boys? People have claimed that your Perception must be over 20 while using Berry Mentats to be able to see another player whose Agility is over 20 while using a Stealth Boy.

This. Why hype it up beforehand, just to have history repeat itself? Instead, quietly work on the update and content, make the announcement a week or so before it's out, and let the playerbase get all excited and hype AFTER it's out.

While there is a datamining Discord, the server is closed-knit and fairly small to keep productivity and focus as high as possible. At the moment, invitations have been limited to those with established and reputable backgrounds (Mod Authors, Data-Miners, Bug-Hunters), not to be exclusive / jerks, but to avoid defusing the results / bogging down the community. In regards to how long a datamine takes and how it is done, that is something that we cannot disclose. Answered by /u/SoleSurvivor10232077

How casual/hardcore of a player are you? The numerical differences between the models are insignificant in practice, due to dimishing returns on resistances, and all power armor pieces providing hidden 7% damage reduction (42% total) and 15% radiation reduction (90% total). What's more important to consider is...
---
* Ultracite is the most difficult to obtain mods for. The mod items aren't sold anywhere, and the mod plans are rare drops from the Scorchbeast Queen (while mod plans for all other models are sold by vendors). So you'll need to be willing to find the few players who can craft mods for you. It also requires ultracite to repair.
---
* T-60 is the easiest to obtain mods for. The mod items are sold relatively often by the two vendors in Watoga. It's also much cheaper to repair than other models.
---
* Excavator has a set bonus which gives +100 carry weight (which stacks with Calibrated Shocks for +200 total), so you won't even need to worry about getting mods initially. For most players, end-game revolves around farming things, so carry weight becomes the best stat for them.
---
Inspiring!!!
---
What armor do you use? Vanguard's? Chameleon? With what prefixes? I'm very interested in making a stealth commando build, but not sure what armor to look for.
---
They don‚Äôt list the goal to gauge progress from the first goal. They set the final goal so it will be met.
---
It was nerfed a while back,  but grinding for a few hours will help you reach higher levels
---
That‚Äôs be amazing. I‚Äôm not sure if I should say my gamertag in the comments or not, so I‚Äôll just message it to you
---
They don‚Äôt want the workshop... you agreed to PvP when you paid to take the workshop with a big warning screen telling you. 
---
That‚Äôs why the far majority now literally don‚Äôt take workshops any longer.
---
Yeah I think it‚Äôs legal though, people sell off entire accounts because of shit like that. The duplication sucks, it does ruin the game.

Items are unable to be taken from dev cells anymore. They are also actively removing questionable items from the dev cells. Answered by /u/Waffle_Cop
---
So a few things. one, you won't "loose" those things, you have multiple save slots, so you don't need to delete your current character, even if you DO decide to start a new one.   
---
Two...always re-spec. Look up good melee builds, ditch the all-rise you're running with (it's trash, it's great as a freebie, but if you really want to run a tank...start building towards bloody).   
---
And lastly, post your stats here. What are you sitting on, what's your current build, and we might be able to help you shift over towards melee with as little suffering as possible.   
---
A few points to consider. Start looking for 1-2\* unyielding armor and buying it as you can...unyielding scout limbs and unyielding combat chest is "bis" but frankly, ANY unyielding armor is going to massively up your damage. You just have to deal with dying a lot. If you're specking into a tank, make sure at least one person on your team is specking out as a healer.   
---
To go with that, look for a bloody sledge hammer. Bloody+swing speed or power attack damage. 90% reduced weight is a cherry on top, but that takes it from "obtainable" to "an entire inventory worth of caps".  You can get AMAZING mods on a sledge that bump it up (unless this has been nerfed) past a super sledge in output.   
---
Also worth noting, you're not really  building a "2h melee" character. You're building a melee/shotgun character. 1h/2h/unarmed/shotguns all take advantage of the str tree, you just need to grind your levels and buy your appropriate perk cards, because you might find a bloody meat hook, which is 1h/unarmed and wrecks FACE.
---
I also don't see any. Almost anything that the minutemen used in F04 isn't special to their faction with maybe the exception of their clothing (even thought it's a old military uniform) and logo.
---
Their weapons are basically made from scrap that's widely available. The artillery pieces are scavenged from old military forts and the same type is also available for player camps.

---
The Explosive legendary effect replaces the Tesla Gun's chain lightning with a generic explosive projectile. So you'll need to get a different Tesla Gun entirely if you want the chain lightning.
---
I'd advise against using automatic barrel mod in PVE, as an automatic Tesla Gun is the fastest way to trigger the damage desync bug, where the server starts rejecting all your projectile hits (it will look like the target's health keeps going back up after every hit).
---
How though when they don‚Äôt have the copyrights to do this
---
take it slow... but most of all be patient. things are much smoother than beta, but things aren't perfect yet
---
If they increased the effective range by about 25% with Skeet Shooter, that would help a lot. I think the damage is alright, but it falls off a cliff past 10 meters/yards.
---
As shotguns exist right now, there‚Äôs really no reason not to respec into either melee or heavy guns. You basically have to be in melee range anyways, even without a two shot version.
---
I think the only place shotguns do well is cramped interiors, like the vault raids. Even so, I have a combat rifle just to shoot at flying scorchbeasts and enemies on ledges.

If they took your bag when they killed you, or earned caps from your death, then they did it for resources. They did it in a workshop because game mechanics forced them to, not for workshop specific resources. Killing you and taking your stuff is the resource they are farming, that specific experience, not necessarily acid or copper ore. They came for YOU and you got farmed. I feel as though a lot of PVE centric players don‚Äôt understands this, and I‚Äôm a PVE centric player myself: PVP players like PVP they seek out PVP that is their reward unto itself. It is one of the unique gameplay offerings of a multiplayer fallout, some people have waited years for the chance. There are a dozen of these posts every day trying to rationalize why they do it. Because it‚Äôs enjoyable to them. People ask me why I grind my face against the vault raids every week. Because I enjoy it. Play and let play, and as much as it pains people PVP isn‚Äôt griefing, it‚Äôs just another style of play. In 1500 hours I‚Äôve never been killed at a workshop and never been drawn into unintentional PVP. I make careful choices to avoid it and it works fine.

It shouldn‚Äôt matter what platform you are on the junk spawns are always the same. The few locations I‚Äôve already done I collected all the junk at the location and immediate vicinity and include the wood I pick up laying around and the junk created by scrapping any weapons from the location‚Äôs enemies. I make sure my character‚Äôs inventory is free of any junk and random weapons before I go to the location with the intent to inventory the junk so I get accurate numbers. I know that this will cause wood and steel numbers to be a little inaccurate but they shouldn‚Äôt be too far off. If anyone interested has ideas on changing the method I‚Äôm using I‚Äôm open to suggestions, but we all need to decide on what method to use and stick to it for consistency sake.

It's against the ToS, and while not *strictly* illegal, they can be shut down and/or sued over it.  Not that BGS will probably sue someone over it, but they could.

I just clear West Tek for steel by killing all mutants with 1-2 hits from my Fixer. So effectively farming West Tek costs me less than 100 bullets.

Based on the damage most enemies deal, at which point does increasing armor (both energy,ballistic and rad) stops making sense?
---
&gt;This is Adventure Mode. I have Pacifist enabled and still got killed for my junk. J
---
PSA - Pretty sure this is bullshit.  Considering the amount of downvotes this post is getting, I'm not alone in this assessment.  If you have pacifist mode on then you can not be hurt by the electrical mutation and although I haven't personally tested it with Plague walker I am about 98% certain it holds true for it as well.  Also nuke mines from other players can't hurt you either with pacifist on so the whole post is *highly* suspect.

Maybe to make the box's more user friendly, aka raiders couldn't steal all of your stuff.

Without it being to much of a punishment for the average player
---
The loophole is that you're paying for "their time and investment into the acquisition of said items", meaning you're paying them for their service. They are still required to claim it as income in the US. People have been doing it since the creation of eBay. It's annoying, though, that most people that do this run farming programs or duplicate items. Definitely morally shit-colored.

I was at Grafton Steel with my furious explosive combat shotgun (before the nerf) shooting the super mutants at Grafton Dam across the pond. Thats hella far... Now you do almost no damage to them point blank and this has been my argument since, may as well use a melee weapon unless you're just trying to cripple them, then shotguns are amazing for that...
---
No 50% sorry bud

1k scrip on my alt 700 on my main should be good for the next 25% off sale

got two, one if em is in my storage, the other I nuked the shit out of it.

Go to the trading subreddit and buy one for a few thousand caps
---
Yup..its looking that way
---
I killed a flat woods monster just north of Freddy's Fears and all I got were some screws and an oil can.
---
Ha! Thank god I wasn't the only one rereading it until it made sense. Lol
---
Pretty much everything is good except for shotguns and pistols and explosive heavy weapons
---
IDK. I love my shotgun so much I sleep with it. Great Ghoul Gun.
---
Don't feel bad, melee misses 50% of the time for no reason anyway.

Full set of 3* chameleon with stealth bonus on 3 pieces (but I gather that due to a bug they don't stack like they should) and acrobat on the other two (got tired of falling to my death when vendor shopping and the camp owner logged out üôÑüòã).
---
I'm running a junkies build (je handmade or j25 handmade depending on mood). This build allows me to solo vault raids (on novice only due to server lag) and I do significant damage in sbq and impostor events.
---
Note for those events, I do pop a psycobuff and ballistic bock which stack to a 42%ish damage buff. You can also add the small arms bobble head if you want to push it further.
---
It works out being like a 'bloodied light' build.
---
Im looking for a fixer plan so I can have a chance for it :(
---
Thank you for answering! Sorry for mess with all questions not being separated, using phone browser to post these questions.
---
I want to make it a little more clear for myself:
---
1) Are those archives accessible anywhere?
---
2) That wasn't what I wanted to ask. I wonder, is there numbers like "weapon A have 150 durability and weapon B have 180 durability, represented by longer bar"?
---
4.1) So, if player have all possible addictions, maximum damage will be 150% of base? Or that 50% per addiction?
---
4.2) Is it known what effects affect stats of weapons and how, except obvious ones like quad?
---
Thank you once more in advance!
---
Some people like PvP. If you don‚Äôt want someone to take it from you, why don‚Äôt you swap to a server it‚Äôs not taken and take it again? It‚Äôs like a few dozen caps plus once the defend event comes, you‚Äôll get a good portion of them back. Sure, you can argue ‚Äúresources,‚Äù and I‚Äôll agree with that but resources are plentiful in this game.
---
I know this isnt a really important question, but what sort of things are you all most excited about in the coming updates? What parts of wastelanders and so on.
---
Doesn't matter if you can obtain it in a year or a week. It shouldn't be obtainable. Good gear should slightly improve your character, allow small % min maxing, not making a walking god.
---
When you get it from battle bot, is it an event reward or found in the locked drawer?
---
Well lore wise up until the events of Fallout 3 the capital wasteland was not much different from the glowing sea. There is a very good chance that a mere 25 years after the war the whole area is just full blown radstorm central. I think they dropped the ball a bit by not including some distant crazy weather effects past the western border of the map in the direction of DC.
---
Is there any way to get lists of items inside each interior cell?  
---
I'm specifically interested in junk items that I can't find in the world that might be inside interiors (Some junk I'm still trying to locate, if they're even obtainable at all- Clean Tea Kettle, Pre-war Lamp, Mouth Harp (junk item), Triangle, High-powered Microscope.)
---
Thanks for the AMA.
---
1) does the SBQ actually take more damage in the air vs on the ground
---
2) what is the actual Regen rate AP refresh gear adds.
---
3) any datamines handguns found?
---
4) Thanks!
---
Why would anyone use the optional boxes in the first place? If they‚Äôre vulnerable, no one would put anything of value in them.
---
Does repairing to the max the various stations in "Powering Up" events influence the loot given at the end?

It really gives you that dirty, dead beat dad look that my melee drunkward character needs.

---
You could also check if the effect is working correct and if it stacks when applied by multiple players (or by the same player several times).
---
How does it actually work?
---
Plan your build early and use melee as much ss possible early on
---
It doesn't look like anyone's asked yet (sorry if so).
---
What's the drop rate/quests for the Responders fireman jacket?
---
Yes! This is my current pet project. We actually have exported out lists of every interior item in the game. The biggest problem is that we don't have nice base maps to show the locations of these items in the cell. And the cells are 3 dimensional unlike the ouside cell. So, while we can get these items and their locations, they aren't really usable without a map to overlay them on. My project is trying to draw maps of these cells and then position the items and their locations on these maps. I'll try to see if I can locate these specific items after the AMA and let you know on those few. Answered by /u/Gilpo1

How much luck do you need to get max durability and is this linear or it increases the chance to get more durability?

Oh wow never thought of this.....is it a confirmed TOS violation?

You wont get that off the purveyor lol
---
Build a Terminal in your CAMP. Access terminal and it should give you a quest to find a suspicious person. Find said person and it should start The Bucket List quest then.
---
Shotguns pretty much need bloodied or instigating effects to one shot higher level enemies, even with point blank sneak headshots.  That's unacceptable.  They do need a major buff, as in some sort of inherent armor penetration. And a lot of it. Like at least 50% across the board.
---
Where does the plasma mine plan drop and what is the drop percentage?
---
It‚Äôs not about optional boxes, they‚Äôd only get 1 stash box that could hold only like 100lbs worth of items, which isn‚Äôt much due to perk card effects not being carried over to stash boxes and all you‚Äôll have left is to use the raidable boxes.
---
Sorry dude, didn‚Äôt mean too üò≥üëâüëàüòî
---
Yo, dude, chill. It's just a game. Breathe, take a break
---
Yes it is still in and yes anne/ansel still spawn at the same locations. Easiest with highest spawns seems to be the philippi cemetery and the teapot. I have found them also in a car at wavy but only seen that once and probably the next highest spawn is the miner monument south of whitespring.
---
If it‚Äôs any help I once got a spiked indigo bat from a ghoul at Solomon lake, it‚Äôs the only colored bat I‚Äôve ever gotten in the game
---
Still there. I use it regularly. Jump in PA then change servers. You'll get the extra 100 on reload
---
This.
---
Just as annoying as people one shotting legendaries in uranium fever before anyone can tag them
---
There are a whole wack of balance issues.  Melee is way more powerful than guns.
---
All the legendaries that target just one baddie type (troubleshooters, mutant slayers, etc.) don't make enough of a difference to even make them a tempting option to do anything other than scrip.   Bloodied is so overpowered that it makes dying/being reborn an acceptable game style.  Pistols/Revolvers aren't fun because they are so wimpy. 
---
Shotguns are just one of many.
---
Ok
---
Yes, I wont get a fixer off the purveyor until I learn the fixer plan
---
Bloody swing speed spear is what I'm using right now. It's no pole hook but I like it.
---
Look for or spam encryptid, it drops the plan sometimes.
---
I experimented with this and can safely say that after hours of bumping against it there isn't a particular spot where there is no border.  I tried glitching myself through the border with camp items without much luck.  I also tried fast traveling nearby and just booking it to the border, trying to catch it before it loaded.  No luck there either.  
---
Godspeed to you though, I'd love to do this.

Please don't let this distract you from the fact that the curator at Prickett's Fort excavated a civil war soldier's remains. He's asked that you give the body a burial in Philippi Battlefield Cemetery.
---
Yeah, a glowing sea like glow in the distance would‚Äôve been amazing, even being able to see the silhouette of the Capitol Building and the Washington Monument in certain areas would‚Äôve been amazing, like they did in the elder scrolls games where you could see other locations silhouettes from previous games

How would you die if someone walks in front of you?

You won't get any love here. These people like their wasteland warm and fuzzy. Collecting stuffed animals and joining the scouts is the way of the world.

This is why I switched to my Ffr during scorched earth , I can jump, dodge and starge away from all enemy‚Äôs with my explosive just fine and stay alive , but all it takes is 1 brain dead moron to walk across my line of Fire and blammo I‚Äôm dead to the explosion
---
I bought my plan for 15k. Best buy ever as I sold an explosive fixer for 35k and a top weapon the same day.
---
I don't understand people complaining about shotguns. I one shot almost everything with the ones I have and I don't need to be so close to enemies.
---
That would be a great idea if they don‚Äôt want anyone to play the game anymore. The vast majority of players love hoarding things and hate PvP. If they can‚Äôt do the first and avoid the second, they‚Äôll quit. I know I would. If I wanted to play Rust, I‚Äôd do that.
---
Explosive automatic heavy weapons with high rates of fire.
---
Explosive guns like the explosive plasma can kill you instantly if somone stands in front of you.
---
They tailored it to the stuffed animal collecting population.

Its the fourth time this happens to me this week.

It will be a quest reward.

Do you play bloodied?

Ebay after a certain dollar amount reports to the IRS as does paypal. I want to say the threshold is $5,000 combined sales which makes it look business like. Selling 1-3 huge ticket items item will not normally ping you to the IRS.

Honestly for me personally its not losing the junk or caps or whatever. My time is limited and im busy. I have goals, things im grinding for. PVP detracts from that. I get zero joy from pvping. None. And i never will. In any game. Someone could gift me a full set of sentinal powered bolstering friendship bracelets and a bloodied howitzer and i still wouldnt do it. And i know im not the only one that feels that way. And im sure as hell not going to respec my characters and spend all that time acquiring all that gear just to fight over workshops. Bathesda is never going to add the amount of pvp to the basic game that would satisfy the pvpers. Not going to happen. They know their customer base. The vast majority is not people interested in pvp. Its the rpgers. 
---
I get why these guys are salty they spent all this time and effort building these great pvp builds and they are all dressed up with nowhere to go. But its the wrong game for that. My 2 cents anyway.
---
You think my 1000 hours versus someone with 100, should only be a 10% increase? Please show me any successful model where that works, including real life. Game would be dead in the water after launch.
---
Yes, like how you cold see the white gold from some mountains. just give un a faint glow over the mountains past the Mire. That would be a nice touch.
---
This is exactly the reason I refuse to touch Rust, and if it was added I would quit this game.
---
This is not a PvP oriented game, I only wish they would add survival back to PvPers can return there, they can add this feature to survival though.
---
I would forgive bethesda for a lot if they just decided to have the 50% off sale anyways
---
 then how do you die so fast?
---
Thanks gentleman going to try it today.
---
You could never achieve this. You. I say it‚Äôs balanced. Everyone dosent walk around doing this. Farming meat alone before refrigeration and having to use better with salt makes this hard. 
---
You just see awesome results intended for entertainment value.
---
Currently we haven't found where there's a max limit on intelligence in the ESM. We're still looking for that info and I'll let you know if someone finds it. Regarding AGI stealth boosts, it would appear it's 50. What 50 means, I'm still trying to figure out. See my other posts I'm about to make on other questions regarding stealth and sneak.

Why not... Well I was going to say 'Y' for Xbox but idk what that relates to on other platforms. They have the 'Y' press for harvesting and a few other interactions, seems like a natural command to use.

They replaced the use button with the long press and Idk if they can have a single command allow for both short and long press on and item. 
---
Other than semantics on how I fully want to see the idea implemented this was done in Skyrim I see no reason it can't be done now.
---
 There is a place where a perfectly preserved pie spawns...

Theoretically yes. Disease resist can go to 100% so you can essentially ignore diseases at that point.
---
The legendary effect for armor only increases the disease resistance against enviornmental hazards like standing in water or near toxic gas.

Well Fed adds 25% (30 with rejuv1, 35 with rejuv2) disease resist. Answered by /u/Eckserah
---
You can't have bloodied and furious or power attack damage and swing speed

Considering this game isn‚Äôt rust, I wouldn‚Äôt compare it to such. I was talking about taking the concept of the raiding aspect of the game and use it in a better way. Fallout is a PvE game, hence why you‚Äôre still able to kill people and destroy their bases. If they didn‚Äôt want it to be a thing it wouldn‚Äôt be allowed.
---
I didn't know this was a thing, thanks a ton!

It‚Äôs nowhere near as sweet as this one

Alright, thank you guys so much

Try lowering any overclocking. I've had overclocks that ran perfect for everything but one game before. That's a good easy place to start. If you still have trouble test your ram, make sure nothing is overheating and use a quality power supply.

I have another question regarding the Red Asylum Uniform and would like to know what is the spawn chance for this outfit?

You had the same good idea too!

it is possible for the weapon drops to bug out and give a combination that shouldnt drop, the way they work are a little bit different than just saying 'This has x drop chance from this quest'. Answered by /u/Waffle_Cop
---
I think I‚Äôm close to 900 at the moment. Was looking forward to 50%, but that may be a stretch. Just wondering how much to squander in search for something half decent.
---
well, originally it was going to be. However, people couldn't accept that a SPINOFF was not fallout 5. So as an RPG there is really no substance yet because wastelanders is the redesign. If the game was open world PvP all the time like survival mode it would have made a lot more sense.

Open your ports

This has been a very hard question and it's something I wanted to know for myself. It seems every sneak and stealth effect does something different. The underlying mechanics are locked away in the .exe so we can only see very little of what these do. So, in the interest of maybe getting some other thoughts on this, here's a complete list of all the effects and their values from the notes I've been compiling: https://pastebin.com/gjDcNDaa Answered by /u/Gilpo1
---
Had another question, but this one is more personal. Knowing the data like you guys do, you know what bugs there are, exploits, glitches etc. How do you guys feel about using them yourselves? Do you "cheat"? I mean if the game allows it, then is it fair game to you? I heard about some double Unyielding glitch and was wondering if any of you used it?
---
also as i hit enter too soon. Disease chance scales with your endurance. at 1 endurance its 2.0x the usual disease chance. it then goes down 0.1 up to 10 endurance. 11 - 15 endurance then it goes down by 0.5
---
because, I want a YOUR stuff and YOUR workshop.
---
That was what was causing him to die I think. As soon as my partner rejoined it was causing him to drop dead :(
---
Due to the way the leveled list for clothes placements work, it is rough to figure out the exact drop chance as there is so many items in the list.
---
It is anywhere from a 4% chance to a 0.2% chance, depending on how exactly the drop list interacts with locations. Have yet to fine  tune that portion of the drop chance script. Answered by /u/Waffle_Cop
---
That's been my experience as well.
---
I would say that is why survival died u are right totally. I very rarely pvp and i do a lot of grinding as well but i also take workshops because most of the time they are left alone and im not stupid i store all my junk and dont make workshops my new camp to decorate or fortify, i put up collectors power and a couple turrets no stash box no workbench. In and out and if it gets taken i sneak back and always empty the collectors if i get a bounty i have a buddy kill me and nothing lost. My main character which i use all the time is built for quality of life and weight reduction. I can defend and do some damage in pve but i am not built for pvp. I am building another character that will be strickly pvp just to work on tactics i want him to be an assissin. Im also going to build a melee character for queen battles. I think we all have different goals when it comes to game play and hate to rain on what one player might want to do or style of play. Now griefing on the other hand is wrong and should be reported.  Thank u for the comment very cool
---
Thank you for settling a debate
---
It's not T51, it's T51b which means it's an upgraded model
---
So four pieces = gas mask. That is quite underwhelming for a legendary effect. The well fed boost behaves the same as a gas mask as well?
---
Sorry for asking again, just curious about this topic as its not documented at all anywhere which is mildly annoying.

---
They took it away because it is too difficult to actively develop three different modes and the Wastelanders update at the same time.

Also, you ever noticed how the PVE players here are always vulger and verbally assaulting the PVP players? I sure have. They have been making their own subreddits recently so they can talk about what they enjoy without being labeled, ‚Äúsoulless sacks of shit.‚Äù You guys are being hypocrites. We are the assholes yet you are the ones sounding like one.

The shotgun healing bug is awfully frustrating.  I'm on my first playthrough, just hit level 50 this past week.  I have every shotgun perk maxed out, my legendary 2-shot pump is doing 207 damage per shot.
---
I should be 1 or 2-shottiting mole miners but it ends up taking 4-5 shots.  Makes me feel like I've wasted all this time to build a specific shotgunner character only for it to be broken.

Hasn't the shotgun health regen bug been around for a while, too?  Does Bethesda have any intention on fixing it???

Perk cards are level-locked. For example, hard bargain doesn‚Äôt unlock until level 15.
---
Thank you for checking that out it's much appreciated.
---
you cant save levels for cards like that..
---
the game treats you as youre whatever level you started saving at until you spend them
---
youll have to start assigning points and picking cards to unlock the higher level cards youre trying to get
---
dont forget you dont have to pick a card from the same stat you assign the point to either
---
Why can‚Äôt you answer those questions? Is it that it could get you banned? Or is it competition purposes, where you want to dominate
---
Can't save up levels like in other RPGs, even if you hit the requisite level it won't show the perk your after until you use the previous level-ups, if that makes sense.
---
Starched Genes for example is I think level 30, but if your still holding onto the last 5 cards it won't ever  show up.
---
Haven't been a huge fan of that, as it kind of forces you to take a few perks that you may never really use. But then again after a point you just start stockpiling level ups (I think I've got like 47 right now).
---
&gt;Is it game-play effecting?
---
Bumping for visibility
---
Can confirm it works as well, also on PC. 
---
I recall seeing a post or two about it previously, but it was weeks/months ago.
---
At this point the ability to kill people and destroy bases has been extremely limited‚Äîdirectly as a result of the majority of the player base wanting nothing to do with it. While your idea could make for an interesting mechanic in a new iteration of Survival mode, it‚Äôs just not going to fly in the base game. It would push away most of the people who have been actively playing and supporting the game.
---
Haha! Relatable as hell
---
A legendary drill was in the game, but it was removed shortly after
---
It‚Äôs still there. Got one the other day.
---
YO CAN I BUY IT FROM YOU
---
Um, ok... but I don't know why you're so pissy...
---
Scraped it. Thought they just lowered the chances of getting one.
---
Explosive plasma gatling with all damage perks, prime receiver and beam splatter does around 94 damage per hit, with a fire rate of 82.
---
Block him?
---
I‚Äôm talking about a legendary one, but if you ever see one, it is worth a lot. Even if it is a meme weapon
---
It does seem like there is at least a little bit of commonality with the Sneak Skill and Movement attributes.  I might glean that "Harder to Detect" isn't a particularly worthwhile tertiary armor perk since it appears to be, at most, a 5% reduction.
---
Likewise, Escape Artist's thing really is crouching/standing to activate Invisibility for a second, which generally puts you in Caution.  That's how it plays out in practice, but it's poorly described on the card itself.
---
Have you tried resetting the audio settings to default levels to see if that cures it...
---
It suppresses one of them. I'm pretty sure it's random.
---
Thank you very much. That certainly helped the other player who had the same problem. His post got enough attention on here and they eventually fixed his account.

It absolutely does.

In all honesty, maybe twice a week. If I have someone with me who likes to PvP, it‚Äôs a lot easier to get started. If they see two people then a 3rd and 4th will most likely join.

In the past week it has been more active for sure. It really is how PvP should be. More than 4 people would be absolutely awesome

Go to the map and open the social menu on the left. Find his name under the Recent Players list and you should be able to block him from there. Choose **Block** and not just **Block For This Session**

Sounds like a problem I had with my ASUS motherboard. There is a BIOS setting called Power Saving that can step  the CPU power up or down. It was causing hard lockups similar to what you describe. If your BIOS has a similar feature and setting, try disabling it.

This is a loaded question and it depends on who you ask, so your gunna get multiple answers here. I believe the leveled lists need a lot of work, not necessarily game breaking, items are just way rarer than they need to be. Answered by /u/Waffle_Cop

It is definitely soloable. I‚Äôve done it with an AAE handmade. You just need to watch your health and not simply shoot like a maniac. Using the shack as cover from the laser is also helpful.

Ultracite. The mods are a pain to get, but it seems to share mods with the Vault Raid PAs. So even if you don't like the current Raid set, you will theoretically be future proofing for future sets. Also Ultracite looks sick and not many folks rock it, so you stand out more.
---
&gt;I'd pay good money for that. 
---
Yes, yes you will.  Five dolla!
---
I guess they don't update it on weekends but I don't think it's gonna matter much tbh. I've guesstimated that we're gonna hit 30-31M dead scorched by the 14th (32M max) which is respectable but still far short of the 35M they're asking for the 50% off legendary vendor sale. So regardless of when they update the #'s, we're not gonna hit the mark.
---
Go offline the two of you  that way he wont be able to keep track of you and block him.
---
I run it but mainly because I keep forgetting to transfer all my stims since I'm a bloodied build now. Most are already muled but still have around 200 on my main
---
To my knowledge, the only buff that stacks for multiple items from the same vector (food, booze, chems) is the + melee damage %. So, you can take as many food + melee dmg % as you want and stack. You can also have stacking buffs from multiple vectors (a food dmg buff, a drink dmg buff, a chem dmg buff, and a booze dmg buff.)
---
I did do it recently. It sometimes disappeared but closing and opening fixed it
---
I use to run this til I found armor pieces reducing chem weight. That helped alot and gave me extra card space.

I'm interested to see how they are gonna tackle Wastelanders, NPCs, Dialogue trees, how choices will affect you contra other players, etc and of course, how much will break from it. Answered by /u/LadyDevRoom

Watch out, next we know there's an etsy for this \^\^

As always, it would be possible, however they would have to re-structure a large portion of the game to implement this.

Right now enemies are spawned at a set level depending on a set of conditions(level of player) and they stay that way.

To have each enemy scale to each players level would require them to completely change how the enemy NPC's work. Answered by /u/Waffle_Cop

One of the best three house camps I've ever seen! Kudos for the patience it must have took to place that beast.

I'll bet it gets hella cold up there in the winter, tho.

Dialogue choices and hopefully some real replayability as a result Answered by /u/JuiceHead2
---
Then block him on xbox, not just the game.
---
I think the first time it might happen by accident, but then every other time someone does it is probably on purpose lol. I mean if we're talking about the same method I mean. Makes me wonder what else you guys found out how to do accidentally üòè
---
Does this game have different servers? Could any player drop by and see this?
---
they make them too complicated with lists nested under other lists  under more lists. Which in my opinion, is why they miss things like the Plasma Grenade plans being so rare Answered by /u/SageAZ
---
No I mean I gave it to the legendary vender but if I get it again, I‚Äôll tell it.
---
Go junkies build, get an explosive combat shotgun and you'll realise how bad your double barrel is in comparison :)
---
Yeah shot guns are waaaay under powered
---
Believe me when I say I don't do anything special. Anyone can use Bethesda's bug reporting tool. The key is providing the info from a developer's point of view: a description of the problem (actual vs expected behavior), steps to reproduce, and thoughts on how to fix it. Just saying something is broken means they have to do work to confirm. If you do a lot of the leg work for them, they can just go 'oh yeah, that looks right, we'll get on it' and off they go. But sometimes, even that is ignored, because it's either not a big enough problem...or big enough yet. They obviously have priority lists that they have to follow like any company would.
---
What cool stuff
---
Mischief night rewards??? Or just Halloween items in general???
---
Please and thank you
---
AWESOME!! I run a flamer build just for fun, I'm so stoked now
---
Nops . Just waited for permission
---
Im not on my PC right now but ill show it to you as soon as I can (which has a possibility to be in 2-3 days, and 5 if I have more work than expected).
---
The game disconnects randomly, as Fallout 4 did too.
---
However if there is a pattern to the disconnections, like every 5 minutes then it perhaps it is an internet issue.
---
I had a similar problem that turned out to be a dodgy connection, once I reported it and my ISP fixed the issue my connection has been much more stable...
---
Still get disconnected or game crashes, but not as much.
---
Nice! I always enjoy seeing creative camps, cause I suck hahaha
---
I do not get these complaints so many people have with shotguns, i use a non legendary pump action as my main weapon and can still kill basically anything that isn't supposed to be a "boss" level enemy with just a few shots.
---
They would have to pay income tax on anything earned (at least in the US). If they don‚Äôt that is illegal. Now the duping itself I‚Äôm not sure... could be a breach of the terms of service or copyright...
---
Having people in my CAMP instead of living alone Answered by /u/Gearsthecool
---
Erm, pardon my asking, but why a 2shot Dragon? My exp with it was meh, if it wasn't even slightly worse than standard version.
---
It would be really nice if 76 had a system like path of exile trade. Or just strait up implement an action house.
---
Oh hell yes, now i can eat eat delicious dog food even faster.
---
It‚Äôs not just pins!!
---
No glow sights does not work against the queen. Suppressor and Tenderizer are reapplied after each hit. The poison damage one was huge and was an adjustment made for the enemies in the vault raid. Answered by /u/Eckserah
---
I really like the spot and it's near where I want to farm things, with its own lead mine. Im trying to keep it lowkey blend in which is easy enough with the camp limits. I just didn't like the fallout supermart camps lol
---
Legendary drills do not exist... bud
---
I‚Äôd love access to FO3 maps.
---
Oh to clarify i'm not digging for exploits to use, I was just wondering if you guys used them personally and if you felt they were cheating. The fact you brought accidental exploits again answers the question so I appreciate you. If you only take advantage of them the first time when they're accidental then that's pretty cool. Knowingly using them would practically be cheating lol. Kudos, not everyone resists that temptation ya know
---
Shit, yeah, didn't even think about a rank up perk. That kind of solves it right there doesn't it?
---
I wonder how effective the decreased disease chance from environment really is, and if it makes chilling in water a bit less frustrating. Though it's quite a few points for an endurance perk either way...
---
Now that this game has Legendary Power Armor, there is no reason not to be able to wear a Hazmat Suit with standard armor. If folks want to keep it fair, you could make it a Raid reward you have to grind for.
---
I think if this happens nuke zones become so much less of a challenge, it‚Äôs good that you have to sacrifice armor (or use power armor) in order to survive a nuke zone. 
---
Also the poor gamma gun and radium would lose all their pvp use!
---
Or over it like an under armor?
---
lol
---
The lower carry weight sometimes shows on new servers, but it‚Äôs infrequent.
---
1) Yes, it's caused by weapon damage falloff, not the queen's stats.
---
2) AP refresh legendary armor has a "Fortify Action Point Regen" value of +5 and multiple pieces do stack. As for power armor mods, Core Assembly and Kinetic Servos both have +1.  
---
3) We haven't found any unreleaserd handguns, other than the already announced Gauss Pistol.
---
4) Welcome! Answered by /u/rynlnk
---
My favorite shotgun was in a game called Natural Selection, where the spread was exactly the same every single shot.
---
Players changed the crosshairs to fit the spread pattern, using it to shoot multiple enemies at once more easily.
---
Enjoy the scouts, I guess.
---
That's what I'm saying it doesnt jave to be sweet rolls just so.ething with a similar effect
---
Go play RUST.
---
Go play Farmville.
---
Good I'm glad you did this he deserved it
---
6kish. PVP is dead and those don‚Äôt do anything in PVE.
---
The problem is, even if the pellet spread is completely accurate, each pellet is doing insanely reduced damage (usually 1) based on arbitrary scaling depending on your distance.
---
I have an explosive double barrel that makes an incredibly tight spread at very decent range. Essentially every pellet is doing 1 damage when far away, while the percentage from explosive carries what little damage it does. When I get close? Same spread, but each pellet is hitting for the actual insane numbers it should pull when every pellet makes contact. Targets drop properly in 1-2 shots. 
---
The obnoxious diminishing returns on accuracy really holds shotguns back. A god roll isnt much better than a 1 decent affix weapon simply because of range limits being consistent across every gun.
---
If they changed shotguns to slugs rather than pellets they could make them more realistically ranged weapons.
---
1. Better Criticals gives a 20%, 30%, and a 40% increase to the critical damage amount. The calibrated receiver increases crit damage by 34%. Tweaked by 12.5%. There is no known max on increase in crit damage.
---
2. See my response here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhco2s/master_thread_for_the_dataminer_ama_oct_13th/f3n9vy8/
---
3. The damage you deal to her is based off your weapon damage falloff in regards to the range stat. So, while flying, she is much further away from you than you think and therefore can max out the range of your weapon and cause you to do less damage. But no, she doesn't have any effect on her that makes her take less damage while flying.
---
4. As far as we can tell, there is only 1 level of invisibleness created by the stealth boy (it's a shader effect), so it would appear that Per and Agi have no effect on someone's ability to see a stealthed player. A stealth boy also does effect your detectability, so it would seem to have an effect on the compass marker visibility of the player as well.
---
5. Yes, but it's a paltry 1%, 2%, and 3% increase by perk level. However, you're also able to target the weakest body part, like the head, so you get a huge damage buff from that. Answered by /u/Gilpo1
---
Look at the post you're replying to. First off. This asshat wants to go back to forcing anyone, anywhere, into PVP. 
---
Second... yeah, I get that this is the existent mechanic. But all that does it make workshops _completely useless_. People who need them for events grab them and then run, 99% of the time, because it's _inevitable_ that some asshole will come along and make owning it _pointless_. 
---
If people fought over workshops and then actually _used_ them that's one thing, the reality is, _every single_ time I've been murdered by some sack of shit at a workshop, they don't work it. The vast majority of the time they don't claim it at all, they are _just_ there to exploit the mechanic to _force_ someone into PVP. Generally speaking, by murdering them from sneak. 
---
I play with pacifist on. I avoid workshops unless I'm forced by the game to take one, and then I run away. I've still been murdered by a _sack of shit_ multiple times, in the few minutes I'm there building walls or whatever for a daily. 
---
You can defend your viewpoint all you want. The reality is, if you see someone take a workshop and you fast travel there to kill them, you're a shitty person.
---
Because killing someone is fun, don't see why I should have to go through the process of switching servers just to avoid engaging in one the games mechanics.
---
I usually only take them for atom challenges but sometimes I'll run through and if a player is there I'll kill them.
---
Does ignoring him work? Are you sure you should be using the raider tag?
---
Take a look at the real map of West Virginia, then the Fallout map.  They put the state in a blender, rendering any attempt to logically expand to neighboring regions all but impossible.
---
I‚Äôll take it off your hands if you want 5k obo
---
Lmao what you did there, I saw it
---
What I want is for them to include being immune to water diseases with the Aquaboy/girl perk and to make gas masks actually protect you from water diseases, cause right now the only reason I don't spend alot time in water is because neither of those things protect you from water disease.
---
DrCJMartin
---
Now we're getting into legendaries and that isn't what OP is talking about.  An OP legendary is gonna be OP.
---
Now THAT is the kind of content I want to see more of around here.
---
Once you have played and shopped long enough, you realise some plans and recipes are special (certain clothing recipes, for example) and the rest are meh. I sell good plans for 10 percent their price and regular plans for 0 to 10. And I learned it by seeing other people do the same. If you want to sell for higher prices (I laugh when I see people trying that) you need to set your business in the forest, near the overseer's camp, to catch unninformed new players.
---
I used that perk until I had Starched Genes 2, after that I only need a handful of chems.
---
Keep telling them how to have fun and stay off the lawn, Gramps.
---
They dont even have to add the reloading bench, they just can add the functionalities to the Tinkers Workbench
---
It can be a very trying game. Fun (usually only with friends, though), but trying.
---
We should be able to mod our shotguns to shoot slugs
---
This site lets you see what perks are available at what levels.  Slugger is available at 6 for example.
---
Just pick the special stats you need and in time you will be able to pick the perks you want. 
---
There will be levels where no peek you want is available, just pick something you can use later like a crafting or qol perk.
---
 But what if they like to staple bread to trees?
---
I‚Äôve gotten further. Never been able to complete one mission in there, I‚Äôm over level 200
---
Yeahp. I don't stop to think about it because otherwise I would put away the console and do something more productive.
---
I mean, I don't give a shit how they have fun, unless their method of "having fun" makes me and a bunch of other people not want to play the fucking game anymore.
---
Heard this rumor and you guys might know: does staying in a Mr. Fuzzy ride prevent you from being kicked for being afk/inactive?
---
Legendary hazmat suits could be a thing, but wearing armour with one would negate the very much intended side effect of having no armour value on it.
---
It's either sacrificing stealth (Power Armor) or armour and legendary effects (Hazmat Suit) as a trade-off for high radiation resistance.
---
Dont go to Necropolis no mater what the chosen one does either drought will get ur fellow citizens or supers will wipe the city i say head to dundalk or carlingford. With post war mutations you will fit right in wuth the pre war abominations
---
That's known as a brittle soul.
---
Laughs in BFFR.  I dunno, my secondary character is slowly becoming my main. Auto pistols with FFR and a decent build make them pretty viable IMO I run a Bloodied with 3 pieces of Unyeilding and Bolstering legs. But I have a 10mm for any occasion.
---
You wont hear a peep bud lol
---
Multiple jet packs just increase AP drain and Fusion Core drain.
---
Ive tested it and there seems to be no difference in height or acceleration
---
Put a jet pack on one of the arms, and you can still have a torso mod
---
I think we should get atoms upon crashes and freezes. It would tempt people to set off nukes again.
---
For xbox?
---
Ok? Join a new Sever lol
---
I use to use coffee some times now I use sunshine oil, but it only lasts a minute or so.
---
Also dropping everything from my inventory did not help :( Amazing.
---
It's Bethesda's fault for your confusion.  All three diluted rad-x, Radshield and Rad-X will say "suppresses mutations"  However, only Rad-X will display something additionally from the other two. You see how it still tells you your effects for each mutation when you have Radshield?
---
Now take a Rad-X and you will see all your mutations under effects read as "SYMPTOMS SUPPRESSED" instead of listing each mutation's effects.
---
You're just wrong bud.
---
Um.. maybe because of would be extremely Overpowered..
---
The good trading sub got taken down so I use this one. Some people get pissy about it but they can get over it.
---
This looks great. i started a new character. I was thinking of making my new camp a tree house. Hope I can get it this good! My last one I did kinda of up in the trees but had the issue of branches just extending through my walls into my rooms and I couldnt see anything
---
Not sure what you mean, just be on some Outer World....
---
I'll see myself out
---
Been playing an auto rifle character after a shotgun character and I'll never go back.  Being able to kill enemies from a reasonable distance and craft ammo out the wazoo is way better.
---
You'll need to view the data files using xEdit. The damage reduction effect (editor ID: "EnchPowerArmor\_ReducePADamageMult") and radiation reduction effect (editor ID: "EnchPowerArmor\_ReducePARadResistMult") are referenced by every power armor paint.
---
i kinda enjoy just wearing a hazmat suit everywhere, i guess you could use 250 dr when reloading, it‚Äôs bug makes it super viable for that
---
In this sub? Probably not. In the other subs and markets. Ohhhhhhh boy.
---
It's wild.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen before on Xbox. 
---
Spent all day trying to farm legendaries and never got a thing from them. Or any other mob I killed
---
Stopped playing for a week and all has been well now, I‚Äôd contact support if I were you
---
Rad-nadoes!  These need to be a thing!
---
What do you mean "knowing their not around anymore"?
---
Or just use the personal terminal at your camp and find out exactly where they are.
---
haha   thanks!
---
you get more damage by safely hanging out at 9% health in full zealots and poison resist than you do hanging out at 30% in unyielding. one hit can drop you, I'm an immortal god of  the scorched
---
Never mind, I thought y‚Äôall were talking about arktos. Beanstalk was easy
---
Good luck bro
---
I have an Imgur account and upload to there first.  Then I place a link to that post inside my reddit post.
---
Post about this #100 
---
Itll be coming back after wastelanders. They need to update the servers and took them down to prepare. Itll be back up afterwards. Hiw could they not bring them back? I dont want pvp cancer any more than anyone else but lol you guys. There's no way it's gone for good.
---
If only this would become the case...but knowing Bethesda...Yeah no it's not happening.
---
Considering that travel is in caps and the collector costs atoms, I'm not sure how you ever would.
---
I know, too literal.
---
Yeah it's easy but it auto-fails all the time because there's no timer. I'm a 214 and this is ridic.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox too, guess I should have added that. It‚Äôs getting really frustrating. Because my husband will be on a team with me and he‚Äôll get loot from it but I won‚Äôt.
---
So literal ugh
---
Beer is + 3 strength with party boy, and nuka dark is +5 strength I think. And rad ant lager is +50 carry weight. The brewing quest was way more fun than I expected.
---
Wait a year
---
As far as im concern, yes its a serious offense
---
Hopefully ur right
---
I'll have to try this to see how effective it is.
---
Yes, screenshot and send to BGS
---
I mean nukashine is fun.
---
I mean do you not remember the ‚ÄúEliminate the Gays‚Äù issue?
---
Also why even report it? You should really just walk away and not even pay attention to it.
---
Edit: Oh no, please stop downvoting me. Whatever will I do? How will I feed my family?
---
It is very tightly integrated, frankly.  Garage door right next to the other wall yeah.  I think it's so they can shut it down when they aren't around.  If I come across them again, I'll ask if we could do a video walk thru.
---
I guess so, but u/ladydevann would know for sure.
---
Nevertheless, open a ticket and bring it to their attention, but make sure it wasn't you who wrote it. Griefers are known to do this shit, and logs usually can catch the real culprit.
---
Yes, and be sure to attach all evidence you have and report through BGS website.
---
They act if you report hate speech in usernames, this should be no different
---
Someone mentioned with Wastelanders coming v soon, and with it human npcs, the radium rifle might become more valuable than ever?
---
I would not be surprised if selling items for money is not against TOS, but I doubt many companies spend much time and effort enforcing it.
---
Well I for sure wouldn't do that shit. But would like a 10 sec vid clip be sufficient? I'm still on his server, I can go take a longer vid.
---
The 50 is either:
---
- max 50% sneak from AGI
---
- maximum multiplier of 50 
---
What is the sneak bonus for each point of AGI?
---
IIRC, it worked like the former for Fallout 4.
---
Haven't tried it on the Queen yet myself but regular SBs? Basically every day lol
---
Still too much NV in 76
---
I‚Äôve fallen prey to the eating or drinking game locking bug a lot from the pip boy menu, super frustrating. I finally hot keyed food and water so it doesn‚Äôt happen to me anymore. I‚Äôve also adopted scrapping and stashing junk asap just in case. I feel your pain.
---
The WVU Mountaineer mascot always carries a musket, so it would be appropriate!
---
all three say that but only Rad-X will change the effects of each mutation on the status page to "SYMPTOMS SUPPRESSED"
---
I got one of these two days ago in Alpha silo on a whim in the middle of a gunfight, on my first try too if you can believe it. I turned away to loot something while the claw was doing its thing, and when I looked back it had the pie in its grasp. I about shit myself.
---
It's now sitting in my vending machine for 1000 caps. I'm not necessarily trying to sell it, more flexing to randoms that I've got it lol, but hey if someone throws down 1000 caps I'll take it.
---
I've only got two perfectly preserved pies in my entire fallout history. Once on FO4 with tons of luck boosting items, and now.
---
Yes he does.
---
It's hard to say. Some people like it some don't. It's like asking "what do I like"? 
---
I might wait till Wastlanders comes next month and see how that goes first. But I would think anyone who liked 4 would like 76.
---
:(
---
I agree or even just a personal counter so you know how many you killed. If the game can keep track of how many hours you have played or can count how many robots in Watonga you have destroyed then it should have been fairly easy to code in a personal counter for the how many scorched you have killed.
---
They look good as decoration. I don't brew anything, like ever, but they're nice to have nevertheless.
---
Like rewarding you for breaking the simulation
---
adrenal reaction mutation adds 50% damage at low health and is boosted even more by Strange in Numbers.
---
&gt; 1) No, the queen does not have the keyword ActorTypeGlowing [KYWD:002129C7] so it doesn't count.
---
&gt; 2) Tenderizer does not stack. Suppressor does, but it maxes out at -40% damage output from the target.

3) Poison damage was increased along with the introduction of vault raids, but it carried over to everywhere else. Answered by /u/rynlnk

Thank you for the helpful reply. I was monitoring my temperatures and everything seems cool before the freezing happens so I don't think it id a temperature issue - which was the first thing I suspected. I will test the RAM as I have a high quality power supply installed.

Whiskey is +2 strength with no Perks to make it better, I keep extra corn and razorgrain so I can keep my punchbowl at least half full for visitors.

[](/kpinkiequestioning)Lemme ask you a question, did you keep playing fallout 4 vanilla after you did the quests? If yes, then you'll prolly love the game. If no then it's not necessarily a no, but more of a maybe.

I had this happen before, i dont believe the kid ever got in trouble for it. It was race related too.

test it yourself. they all stack. If you like, I can type up a guide on where to quickly farm the minor ingredients like pepper, starlight berries, mutfruit and carrots once you get all the meats.

Yeah the only perks in endurance that are balanced enough to be value are chem fiend, fireproof, Adam-skeleton, rejuvenated, radicool, and revenant.

There is one in the files called terrarium. It's an ATX item that is currently and has been sitting there for a bit. Answered by /u/Eckserah

Was just saying the same thing. It's been miserable with people randomly walking into my camp and attacking me or my Brahmin and it's gotten so much worse the past few days. I play in pacifist mode, but it still takes the fun out of it.

They are still tameable.
---
It does not affect the number of stars a drop will have.
---
Hahaha thanks for the input tho
---
Wow can't believe I didn't spot that thanks.
---
lol you can easily test this by taking a radshield and jumping. dont tell me you havent noticed you still have marsupial with radshield on. then try jumping after a rad-x/ rad-x diluted. the pip-boy displayed values and the damage number popups are incredibly unrelialble. never ever believe anything without testing it.
---
Honestly i would be much happier with just being able to bundle large amounts of ammo together and sell them to vendors for caps. 
---
Like i get selling one bullet for one cap would destroy the economy but i should be able to sell like fifty .32 for one cap at least to the vendor bots. 
---
It is just dumb that we cant, are we supposed to believe that bullets are of completely zero value to the vendor bots that bloody sell bullets themselves?
---
I miss that show.
---
Yes. You can find them in Lewisburg and near Silva Homestead. They cannot be used by players.

Sucks about the loot :(

But that was oddly satisfying to watch it get swallowed up by the fissure lol.

Where do schematics for the T-45 and T-51 drop? The armor pieces themselves, NOT mods.
---
I will just toss this out there but i almost never wear any armor at all and can survive very well against most anything easily. 
---
if you build your SPECIAL right and take the right perks you can get innate damage resistance that is honestly just a little worse than wearing low level power armor. 
---
Its great for your carry weight and you can wear a hazmat suit into nuke zones with no penalty.
---
Lol
---
I use it when I'm getting ready to fast travel.
---
mine never once showed it and others have reported the same.
---
I totally believe you. I've only tested the melee damage stack, so I'll only speak to that. But I've seen the results for sure!
---
The Distant Thunder event can give them.
---
Treasure maps from the Ash Heap, Savage Divide, Mire, and Cranberry Bog can award them.  
---
Also 3\* locked toolboxes.
---
This is total bullshit, but hey, I've never heard someone call Todd Howard a "stubborn cuck" before so that's new. Do I need to list the multiple direct references to New Vegas in Fallout 4? Or the various gameplay elements from New Vegas that were added to 4 and 76?
---
You can still do the old water edge glitch that's worked since fallout 3 where you get your eyes right at the surface of the water and you can see everything underwater clearly. I do wish for more underwater exploration stuff like we saw in new vegas though. Maybe even bring the rebreather back with a related quest.
---
This shows why the servers are struggling to hold it together.  
---
Everything is custom build, piece by piece, individual items. The super mutant needs his clothes to spawn as separate items and be loaded onto his character.  
---
Why not just have a dozen builds/outfits for super mutants with the outfit integrated into the model and just run the rng and plonk down the result. So if you run into half a dozen SM, you might have 3 dressed the same but you'll have 3 dressed differently too. Without the server having to store what each one is wearing.  
---
You see the same thing with the BOS corpses you find, they're actually in PA frames with armour on.
---
Yeah! I've really enjoyed it!
---
I also recommend finding a friend to enjoy it with you!
---
Oh yeah, why has obsidian never been invited back to work on a Bethesda project.
---
I have them because I think they look cool, but I never brew anything.
---
Just as a note, there are people who will team with you so that they can put things like this on your camp.  Because we are so used to running past our camps without thinking about it, you may miss it.

I'm sorry man :/

Have there been anything datamined recently about Vault Tec themed items? I really want a Vault Tec backpack...

Run memtest64 on ur ram do a dism and sfc scan aswell repair game files if u can open up the log where crashs are listed check the error code i was having lock ups aswell turns out wasnt the game was my bad ram and corrupted system files. Also get ccleaner clean ur registry aswell.

if you're still on the server, go to social, find the player and use "report". An email will be sent to you, to confirm the report, just attach the vid then.

Mm I was talking about the bazaar. I haven't been able to see it for like a month now.

If the RAM is good turn off any OC. I had a Pentium II 266 OCed to 283 I believe and it would play every game I threw at it but Grim Frandango, it would just randomly lock. I rolled back the speed to 266 and Grim Fandango never locked up again. That's your history lesson for the day, lol.

Because they've been busy with their own projects, now they're owned by Microsoft, Bethesda now has multiple studios in-house to work on side games, and a bunch of other reasonable and unfortunate business reasons that don't involve industry veterans holding grudges like petulant children.

Why not really. Plus they're worth 1c, can basically usurp the 30k cap limit. Not very efficiently, but if somebody was a bit short and wanted to throw in pins on a deal I don't see an issue there. I never used to grab em now I'm around 470 pins.
---
People are doing the same with popular ammo, 5.56 is generally 1c/each but no limit on how much you can have. Can't sell ammo to the NPC vendors, but you can sell pins + pins weigh very, very little.
---
I think you may not understand how a basic M40 Gas Mask works. It filters the air to the best of the filter's capacity only for a short time. I've been wondering as a CBRN Marine why the masks never DET over time. All those filters unless from the sealed Enclave bunkers, should be ruined already and shouldn't prevent anything except to give you cancer faster.
---
Who completely disregarded the power armour to look at their fancy house instead?
---
Sweet. I'm off his server now, but know his gt from the vid. Thanks!
---
Right, the mods were scamming people. No wonder they didn't have a blacklist/do not trade section lol. I'm talking about the sub with a karma system so you know who is a legit trader?
---
Guys, thanks so much for this! These AMA's are a fantastic idea, I learned so much for you all already, just by me digging around on this subreddit, so having it all in one place is awesome. I appreciate you sharing your knowledge with the community, missed this one as I was working, but I'll definitely have a list of Q's for your next session.
---
Thats what I did. Arm mods are all pretty crappy, so jet pack arms is great.
---
Lol. Those stairs lead to a nice little pond out of frame.
---
Its the house that love built
---
Say what now?
---
I resent the accusation. I definitely don't have Nukashine in my punch bowl. You should definitely come by and have a drink from my non-Nukashine-filled punch bowl. You definitely won't black out. What?
---
I'm a very fun person. You won't regret it.
---
Double the strangler heart acid, double the love, double the lag. üòÇ. Upvote though.
---
Only bug I've noticed is your quest not showing up on the map.
---
I agree, know what you want to do and look up what perk cards you can get and when. This isn‚Äôt like the previous fallouts, so you can‚Äôt see what and when you unlock. I wasted a level 47 character because I didn‚Äôt know what perks I would unlock until it was too late. I created a second character and that ones extremely fine tuned and level 220.
---
This is a really cool idea OP, I like it. Honestly you should probably have a blacklist for your market section, that way you don't admit any known scammers. The other trade subreddit with the karma system has a really detailed banned list that gives reasons and all so you could look through and make sure you're not letting in any known banned discord accounts
---
Why didnt he do each for 1500
---
I'm gonna guess it autocorrected "uninstalled" to installed.
---
I've read of this issue on here, but have never experienced it. May still be able to launch from the executable in the install folder. Doesn't help come patch time though.
---
You said, "It's not about optional boxes, they'd only get 1 stash box that could only hold like 100lb worth of items...... all you'll have left to use is raidable boxes" in a subsequent post. That's mandatory storage of 700lbs in stealable, raidable loot. That's mandatory and not a choice. 
---
I can't imagine anyone wants to play with stash capped at 100. 400 was unbearable.
---
Oh, no, they can be tamed, just not pacified anymore. Only the random spawn level 21 ones tho.
---
Well sexually or fatality doesn't matter. Have you seen what's out side?
---
We have a excommunicado list for blacklist people. Also thanks!
---
Can confirm. I just experienced it today and its brutal.
---
Well yeah but you don't want to have to start your own. There would be victims before you banned the bad people. Could lead to your market not taking off
---
It just works
---
I'm about 60 off max lol. I wish the site would update so we could actually see how close we are
---
That's why it's not installed.
---
A video game caused the worst level of dread in your life?
---
Woof. Hate to spoil it but things can, and do, get much worse for people.
---
Genius.
---
Honestly the servers need object permanence for any legendary that is killed. Far too often me and my friends will kill a boss and have it explode and all 3 of us find the body in a different location or not find it at all. Really frustrating.
---
You can tell whether it's gonna grab it or not right away. When it goes straight down = no luck. When it will actually grab it, the claw will move slightly before going down
---
The floors were relatively easy. It was the walls/fences that I had some minor trouble with. I kept getting "needs support" or "object is floating" messages whenever I tried to attach them to some of the floors.
---
All those cool recipies! Ballistic bock, rad ant lager, white Russians, lead champagne! 
---
Also the brewing station looks good in a kitchen

Once they launch and stabilise Wastelanders then the PVPers can have their survival back, which I‚Äôm guessing to be in the new year
---
Never had a girlfriend, never had a heartbreak, this is all I got.  
---
I mean I guess that time I got my favorite silly band stolen by that fatass Chesmond on the playground in the 3rd grade. That was also pretty upsetting.
---
Anecdotal evidence, friend got bear arms plan from winning with only 2 pets.(Remotely possibly same toon beat it w/ 3 prior, and my friend just didn't notice he had it.
---
It called excommunicado cause of the John wick theme. It, not a new system it just a name for the blacklist channel. It not a new system
---
Ah, title makes sense now.
---
Digital copy or physical disk? Have read some reports of this earlier from folks who ran the Beta version and later updated to the full version. Not sure if there are some common "buggy" files that live in the Beta code that would trigger something like this.
---
If you're playing with physical disk then this is concerning indeed. No reason it should uninstall itself unless you're running the same disk on multiple PS4's... and even then you should get some kind of warning of multiple use.
---
Should show reports of a suspicious person
---
It's not, but I might film one after work.
---
The last "trading" server had 14 members, this one has leastwise 30.
---
Everyone starts somewhere. At least when I kill you at a workshop I won't wonder if youre going to beat your wife!
---
Wdym last trading server
---
I was at a weird angle.  I was kind of off to the side when I triggered it.  I move over to the normal spot to take the picture
---
does this happen when other people use Strangler Heart Power Armor (you will see green clouds around enemies) and/or Legacy Weapons near you?
---
If yes, welcome to the club. I have been waiting for a fix for over a month now
---
Damn I'd love to see this. Does it look much different than the SBs we got now?
---
Again, the game is never forcing you to take workshops. Weekly challenges are not mandatory. You can skip them. I ignore them. You choose not to.
---
The real shitty people are those with 90% of the world map devoted to them insulting PVPers for PVPing them inside of a PVP zone. Just take a look at the language you use. You're so vulgar and offensive. You are not arguing a point; you are spewing hatred.
---
There *are* different servers, but you can always find me through my gamertag (same as reddit username).
---
Now I wonder how many beatings I've caused by killing someone
---
I don't even know who they are.
---
The lack of updates has been incredible to me. They're plugging an event and can't be bothered to let us know how we're doing more than a couple of times a week.
---
i have waited for a fix on this for a month now and am pretty much unable (or better unwilling) to play because of this
---
Yikes that‚Äôs a bummer.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd def report it next time. Wishing it never happens to you again! It‚Äôs such a let down after using 100% of your ammo and 2hrs to get nothing ):
---
loot their corpse, there will be a bucket list and a broken camera, read the bucket list then fix the camera at the tinkers.
---
I guess that might be true. If we end up fighting raiders and what not.
---
Oh sweet! i did that months ago and do have it active guess its just glitched telling me to find them again
---
 I am against hate speech, but it Is a game about killing and cannibalisng, so, maybe... We should remember some people who hate others also play videogames.
---
Is there any Brotherhood of steel camp items in the files?
---
It seems to be kinda clicky on the xbox for people, I tried for the longest time to get a team for raids, so good luck to you as I am now a soft time player.
---
Lmaoooo. You gotta show us that
---
If you are on PC and it says "install" it likely is just not recognizing the current install. Just click install and direct it to where you have it installed and it will say "installing" and complete in a couple seconds to a minute in time. This commonly happens after a hard crash of the game or the bethesda.net client updated. Considering they are hiring for the client itself currently this probably wont get resolved soon.

I don't pvp so I hadn't thought of that angle, a valid concern for many I'm sure.
---
I AM THE GREATEST GOOD YOU ARE GONNA GET!!! *snaps fingers in wavy motion*
---
This mostly only  a problem with suppressed shotguns because of the way the game reduces range by 30 if you add a suppressor... no matter what the range of the weapon was to begin with. So on a rifle with a range of 200 you end up with a range of 170 (entirely usable) and on a shotgun with a range of 36 you end up with a range of 6 (entirely not usable).
---
They need to change suppressors so that they reduce range by percentage instead of by a fixed amount.
---
Cool appreciate the answer man.
---
Big ups to all you lot for the work you put in!
---
Thank you for reading. I do really like the idea, but price fixing scares me.
---
I do exactly what you‚Äôre talking about here, my damage is d√©pendant on Adrenalin, Gun Fu and vats luck perks. 
---
I certainly think it‚Äôs worth it and run around with a ton of Ap bettering drinks (especially drinks cause some of them don‚Äôt go bad)
---
So yeah that‚Äôs what I do, I also use powered armour and ultra-light build.
---
There‚Äôs a nice food and drinks buff and ingredients calculator on nukes dragons that helped me a lot
---
Ye, going with this build https://www.kevduit.com/two-handed-melee-build-fallout-76/
---
There isn't any listed benefit from lighter armor or the ultralight or muffled mods. Those should play into account as well. I also thought total agility would play more of a role. 
---
Never reaching 100% would fit with other effects, like environmental resistance or weight reduction.
---
I agree with the stealth difficulty during primal cuts. Escape artist would get me back to caution, but I'd be back in danger a few seconds later.
---
Depends on the rewards.
---
Didn't NV have that? That would be nice.
---
I'd settle for some kind of on screen notification (turned on/off in the options menu) telling you if it was night or day and if you are in low light or not. Also something which tells you is you are in caution or danger without needing to crouch.

you do understand that we have access to the raw loot lists for everything right? its kinda the reason we did this in the first place. Answered by /u/Eckserah
---
I really think the ragdolls need work. There's no weight to dead enemies. It'd be nice to get some proper weight distribution on corpses especially as a console primary where ragdolls fall in slow motion.
---
It wasn't a bad weapon to use just for .45 ammo however now that fixer can be legendary it makes it obsolete
---
Are you going bloodied too? And another suggestion if I may; Tenderizer rank 1 is a great perk, but you get extremely diminished effectiveness at rank 2-3; you gain 5% damage at rank 1, but only end up gaining 2% more at the cost of two more points. I find it far more valuable to put those 2 points elsewhere and go with rank 1.
---
I'm not selling nothing. I'm saying be prepared for tons of those posts or similar. Lmao
---
But did you have one of the armor sets on too or were you just entirely naked except for the hat?
---
3800 scrip and counting....
---
Happened to me yesterday. Used up lots of ammo and nothing!
---
Game is not real life. Your experience in the game alone should be an advantage. The fact that you know how the game mechanics work and you can maximize it but to an extent. Look at a game like QUAKE, HALO or COUNTER STRIKE. There is no magical gear that makes you unkillable but you can immediately notice who's the pro. Skill ceiling should be high but not gear dependant. Just because you are 00.01% who can no-life a game doesn't mean you should be an unkillable god who doesn't need to put any effort in the actual combat. If you're unkillable because you're that good then it's a completely different story. 10000 hours spent in fallout 76 doesn't make you good, it just makes you have op items.
---
Not sure if it's too late to drop a question in here, but in case anybody sees it and knows it ask anyway. 
---
1) I have heard from many people that there is coding in place that auto-bans players if they enter the dev room or take an item from the dev room. Not sure if that's true or if it logs there info, but curious about the logic behind how it works.
---
2) I've also heard rumors over many months that Bethesda bans people who have dev room items in their inventory, or have some way of being notified of people who have them, not just by other player reports. Not sure if there is something in the files that talks about it or any type of logic. 
---
3) Is there a chance for things that shouldn't drop (i.e. Dev Room items, Explosive effect on Energy guns, or things like the Gilded Minigun that were removed from game drops) to drop if there is a server "Bug Out" like I saw mentioned above? Like how colored baseball bats drop with mods from enemies.
---
It scares me as well, i cant tell u how many times i have gotten great deals from high level players who do care or dont need and i feel its those prices that will help balance ot all out. If i can get a legendary max level from one player for say 5k and another players is selling the same weapon for 15k who do u think will sell first. I believe that is were players will find a middle ground and level out prices. Legendaries is a bad example because it is based on how badly someone wants something. Thank u for the comments really appreciate it
---
Hmmm... I suppose I can see that happening.  What I can't see is someone triggering your own mutation effects  for damage if you have pacifist on.  And this is a pretty specific situation here - you craft and place those rad emitters at a CAMP so we're only talking about this being a possibility at someone else's camp.  It's basically just a CAMP trap which, fortunately, is pretty rare.
---
Nope. Nope. It would be like removing rad damage in a game after a nuclear apocalypse. Really stupid.
---
This is on a ranged character(low str and end) so DR doesn't matter a crazy amount to me as I'm sneaking and doing damage from a distance. Hmm...maybe this would be a good reason to keep an eye open for a berserker's combat rifle, drop anything I don't need to carry and see how it goes.
---
Those perks are also great at helping a bloodied build's survivability,
---
Yesterday I loot a level 20 instigating explosive gatling gun... So I'm like... Cool! Lucky server.... I'll just zip over to the purveyor and blow all my scrip....
---
Crash.
---
And for some reason the recent players tab hasn't updated. None of the other tricks worked. Lucky server eludes me.
---
Today, I get an instigating explosive pipe gun... Sweet! Another lucky server! So I'm slimming down and gearing up for a silo run and...
---
Tl;dr) Bethesda put their out advertisements way back in E3/Quakecon and let YouTubers and journalists cover it further, that was their free PR. Lack of communication is just a result of suspense on the update creating hype and speculation.
---
The likely-ness for not advertising it is because they already explained themselves at E3 and then again at Quakecon to cover some finer details to get everyone excited that way and now with those two events the majority of the player base are informed giving them a greater window to work on it, therefore they can leave it up to gaming urinalists and Fallout YouTubers to spread that information (and their own speculation) further into the community who either might not have understood or heard about it from E3/Quakecon. The majority of their PR and advertisement has been covered by those tactics, so now anyone else who cares to keep updated can hear about it in the next ITV, for example how everyone was just told that the Survival Game-mode has been taken off so that can put all of their energy and resources into Wastelanders. We don‚Äôt need to be told as soon as they have x, y, and z optimised or improved either. Not to mention they‚Äôre doing a community event for Halloween so of course they‚Äôre going to prioritise that quickly before getting on with Wastelanders and their weekly ITVs about what‚Äôs to come.
---
Read through this thread, thank you to all those answers. Good info here. Hope to be able to make the next one live. 
---
I'd like to add a new question/subject for any of you that have the time or for the next one. 
---
Welded Rebar &amp; Reactive Plates PA chest mods. 
---
How do they work? What are the official numbers/variables involved and are any of the modifiable?
---
The wiki says Welded Rebar reflects 10% of melee. Is that a set amount or modifiable somehow? Different for each PA due to DR ratings? Will +dmg resistance food make the reflected damage less &amp; reversely can I lower my DR on purpose to increase the reflect damage? Any info on the systems for Welded Rebar and Reactive Plates would be helpful
---
Personally I run Welded Rebar and love it. I'd like to get the most out of it though so Thank You again for filling the information void Bethesda leaves.
---
With quests that have an optional objective, does completing the optionals change the drop? For example, Thrill of the Grill.
---
Meh. If not you then something else like the sunset would cause it.
---
What? I've been hitting that up every time and it's super ez for a character of any lvl. Did someone start it then run off? Can be a very boring 6 mins if you over lvl 5.
---
Wait what? Since when does one of those spawn in the cranberry bog? Unless you mean the quest in the mire was causing server wide issues during a queen fight?
---
I played this quest one time in 2018......sad.
---
What you talking about bazaar being good? They were frauding people out of thier gear. Lol either you're lucky or you were one of them.
---
.049%? Dang I‚Äôm lucky! I‚Äôve gotten three drops of sturdy raider armor!
---
Wait, people can kill and eat you in game, that's perfectly fine. But roleplay a racist or homophobic character is illegal?
---
Lol..over how many characters?
---
Can the game glitch out and still give legacy weapons like this?
---
You can get it glitched on to your head once the mission is over. Not sure if others see it but i had one on for hrs afterward. Fixed on next log in.
---
Saw you there, sorry you had to put up with that too.
---
It might be your dps is too low to register that you contributed enough to the fight, but it shouldn't be that strict for the lesser enemies in the fight...
---
I bought 3 of them ü§£
---
yes i had hoped they fixed it when they fixed the mire quests but no :( i this quest  once during beta ...never again
---
I strongly suspect that the grey damage is just the difference between the enemy's current HP and the HP from the last time you didn't hit it for a few seconds, and therefore it would include damage from all players. You'd need someone who decompiles UI modules to confirm though, and it's probably easier to run a test: Get a weak weapon with a very large clip. Keep hitting the SBQ and see what the bar does. If you've got a friend to help then you could run the same test on a high-hp mob like a Sheepsquatch or Behemoth.
---
No, the super-rare craftable power armor "Strangler Heart" has effects that cause problems for other players during a Scorchbeast Queen run.
---
How does the glitch works ? I would love to wear it even for a couple hours
---
I think a rad suit works. I did all of disgusting grafton lake, and I dont remember getting any diseases.
---
Oh that buggy armorset,

No matter what your opinion on this sub reddit these people will down vote you and talk shit.

Dont feel bad. I just found out myself since I started using my Gatling Plasma more often.  I was running low on cores so I just googled where to find more.  Turns out you can make as many as you can afford at the work bench :)
---
They should let us issue quests from terminals in our camp. Find me (insert whatever) and receive a (insert item). Or let us sell things cor things other than caps. Sell 10 .45 rounds for 1 .44 round for example. Sell a plan for junk. Idk, they say they want the community to be the experience this game offers but they dont give the community the tools to do so
---
The crafting condition table maxes at Int 20, while the drop condition tables max at Luck 20. However, you can find and craft over-condition weapons, so the maximum permanent condition should be reached with much lower stats.
---
That would kill the playerbase, and thus gravely harm Fallout 76 both as a game and potential income. With everyone who doesn‚Äôt want to PVP chased off of the game there‚Äôs only the minority group of players left; the PVPers and greifers, which unless every single one of them are wallet warriors, isn‚Äôt going to keep Fallout 76 afloat for the 10 years they announced. Let alone 5.
---
The majority of players are PVEers, the majority of the problem with the game was constant grief and no NPCs so they are catering to that over PVP because they can afford to lose PVP players but they can‚Äôt afford to lose PVE players, but they have still compromised with PVPers and given them both Survival and Nuclear Winter, they have let them keep Nuclear Winter while they work on Wastelanders. Whilst I personally don‚Äôt want any PvP in the game at all, it includes more people if there is, but that doesn‚Äôt mean anyone should be allowed to punish pacifists because they miss a feature that was costing developers players and revenue.
---
These discords crop up ever so often. The last I saw with the 14 members was posted about 2 weeks ago.
---
Agreed, I thought that was going to be the point of trading with other players. You are in their inventory menu. They pick what they want and you pick what you will trade it for.
---
Yeah I don't get the logic either. In a post apocalyptic world I'm pretty sure racism and bigotry would be through the roof.
---
Why people become overly sensitive is way beyond me. I mean if you don't like it then why are you eating people? It's a taboo in nearly all cultures/a crime against nature. Yet people complain about someone 'possibly' role-playing??
---
Two aliens and a UFO last time I checked!
---
They are just trying to advertise their small businesses like me. You're always gonna see discord server like these if you're in a fallout subreddit
---
What ive noticed is theres a huge PvP crowd. They just arent a bunch of whiney bitches on reddit. Its the pasavist food builds on here crying all day
---
Wow, learned alot just by reading the post. I domt have the ability to patience to test all this myself. I wish there was a more reliable way to find all the interesting information on this game like this because the wiki is so useless it's not even funny
---
Just the hat had dropped outfit for armor and I usually ditch vault suit.
---
I've been terrorised by the Flatwoods Monster three times in the past two days. The last time was at Whitesprings clubhouse... Purple Scorched, purple Feral Ghouls and not one, but two purple Scorchbeasts. At level 78, and all alone, I took an absolute pounding! 
---
All I wanted was a frog for my frog habitat!

Caps havnt had value in a long time

Haha nice, I can solo it with my bloodied meat hook build, I just die about a hundred times
---
Why are you encouraging people to exploit a bug?
---
I really hope wastelanders is this games come back and brings alot. I hope they take this chance to show how much they listen. Because I see near to no dev interaction with the community directly
---
Quake halo and counter strike arnt MMORPGs. Unless you‚Äôre trying to compare nuclear winter to them. 
---
We are talking about a queen kill here. Two completely different styles of games. Hell let‚Äôs include Tetris in your discussion.
---
Currently, there are not, Answered by /u/Gearsthecool
---
I suspect it does. Explosions deal limb damage to every body part. Cripple abilities hook the Mod Limb Damage entry point, with a chance to multiply that damage by 999 (not actually a direct chance to cripple, but usually the same thing). It seems likely that Mod Limb Damage would be triggered separately for each limb.
---
If you really want to know, your best bet is to test it. Once something has an entry point interaction, it's not strictly a data mining question.
---
That‚Äôs happen to me at the sbq event. Always gotta love being the one doing the most damage then not being able to loot it lol.
---
Very nice. I had built a treehouse a few months ago, across the highway from White Powder Winter Sports. But mine was mich smaller, I wrapped mine around the trunk of a very tall tree.
---
If it was open world PvP, many people, myself included wouldn't have even touched this game. There's a reason survival mode was always empty and got removed.
---
Nobody is around me when it happens so doubtful this is the issue.
---
Unless you know the other player wants to do it, it's nothing short of bully behavior.  Just because somebody parks their car on a street doesn't mean they agree for it to be broken into.  But, the risk is there, right?  Same thing.
---
But, if you like to be a bully, go for it.
---
This is why I don‚Äôt team with anyone.
---
Least you‚Äôre not as downvoted as me for saying ‚Äúwalk away.‚Äù But in a much harsher way.
---
I've had this problem on and off for like 2-3 months now. I stopped doing queens for a long time because of it. I just started again this week and have only been able to loot maybe 6 out of the last 10 I've been a part of.  
---
Even had one this morning where it registered, and I was able to loot the body, but there was no legendary on her, just the other junk. Like WTF?
---
I thought having a high level super mutant ravaged DC would be a cool addition. Like always in a rad/ nuclear storm.
---
Heard the datamining ama group is gonna be working on them soon

Okay pog

I have now had somebody trying to do this to me two times today.  WTF is wrong with these messed up people.
