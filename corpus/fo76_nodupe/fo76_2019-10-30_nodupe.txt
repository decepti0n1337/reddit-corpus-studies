You get used to it after a while.  It ends up being just another bill you can't get away from like a utility bill.  I didn't get the F1 subscription, and I don't plan on it.

You know, I'm getting pretty tired of having to repeat myself here. You seem to think I was somehow traumatized when playing WoW 14 years ago and you just can't let go of that thought. And even in the case of an absolutely TERRIBLE design choice (i.e. a kill all-button that anyone can press) you would still blame the players for pressing it, and not the developers for putting it in the game.
---
Again, I think we're done here because I really don't have anything else to add to this discussion.
---
Wow very interesting, I appreciate your time,  and explaining it to me, in layman's terms. All very interesting. 
---
I wish you the best.
---
Oddly the Sheepsquatch mascot costume isn‚Äôt registering for the Trick or Treat weekly challenge for me. Not sure if it counts for the event.
---
Which are also bullshit and just today I was calling review bombers out on different SMs. I'm no idiot.
---
If you're on PC I'll make you the outfit if you want
---
As a consumer, I want to say that I really appreciate you taking a stand against these scummy capitalist shills working on behalf of corporations that will do fucking ANYTHING to try and push their products. Regardless of the quality or lack thereof

If you're on a "stable" server most of the time it's something you'll never notice, again it's not actually an "upgrade" mechanic but rather the server lagging to assign the proper legendary tags fast enough.  But if you're soloing an event where an enemy is freshly spawned and still glowing it's always a good idea to give it a bit to see if anything happens before you kill it, especially if it's an event where it should be a three star but spawned as anything else.
---
So far got some Halloween themed plans, a Clean Space Helmet and A Clean Ranger Uniform
---
I mean, Obsidian builds games in a way where playing with different mindsets toward dialogue options and other choices tend to lead to different outcomes. So while the ‚Äústory‚Äù isn‚Äôt too different, it still ends up different. 
---
So, why not play a sneaky melee type who sides with corporations to further their own agenda next time, rather than a science weapon wielding smooth talker who values freedom over the corporate bs, ya know? 
---
That said, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of games that want you to dedicate your life to them. I like to play a game and be able to be done with it eventually.
---
What they are saying is:
---
I cannot defeat your arguments so I will deny your right to make them.
---
I think the better answer to that problem is a rad-suit as under-armour with an accompanying helmet.
---
I agree the non-PA players have a hard time with nuke zones, and I think the best solution is an under-armour that helps with that. Probably less so than PA, and without the usual under-armour stat boosts.
---
Well they are really a steal when people sell them for 10-30 bucks a piece! Just a few days ago I were at... um.... the station that is straight east from Watchpoint (?) Bravo and I found 20 fully charged fusion cores on the floor that someone had left.. yummy yummy xD 
---
I also use this build now: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1c7a38&amp;d=sr2s32s82sq2sg2ip2id2ig2ii0cr0cu2ls2lh1lt2a82ei2ed3ee2ep0p20cm2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=

I know that it's probably quite shit, but I guess it's playstyle. I like RP (literally used to do heavy RP on the old WoW servers back in the day.. not the Goldshire kind if you catch my drift.. if you don't know what I'm talking about, please don't google Goldshire RP. It will scar you FOR LIFE). My character is a miner, thus I'm using the excevator armor - although it might suck, I guess (I like the look) - and the .50 caliber heavy rifle - I obviously want to use the flamethrower but I've yet to find the event/quest for Pyrolizer and I haven't found the schematic for the Flamer yet. I have tons of fuel for them though, it's just waiting to get used! 
---
I guess, as long as I enjoy the game and have fun, eh?
---
Ooh, I didn't know that straight jackets sold for a shit ton at the vendor... I've... literally just scrapped them every time I've seen them &gt;.&gt;
---
I received loot from the bonus loot table that only activates if you are considered to be wearing a costume, so I doubt this will work, but I will certainly try, I want those atoms

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*

I use a full sheepsquatch mascot  outfit, not sure if that counts. Had the same question also does it count if yu get in a P.A suit with costume  on
---
Anyone who critically thinks about it could make those predictions, or have those expectations. And no, don't pretend you know what you're talking about.  Your assumption: I read it then agreed with said predictons. Reality: I've already considered most of what was said in the post and make a reasonable conclusion most items could be figured out.  You're under a false belief that I couldn't predict it because you couldnt, or didn't bother. Nothing what I say descredits the leaker, rather it vindicates 
---
And don't try to high road on karma points. I'm sure *you're* better than that.
---
Maybe not love but that really doesn‚Äôt matter that much because if you are earning money with the thing you do as a company, you are doing it at least partly right. This is the only thing that really matters as a company ... profit. It‚Äôs nice if people love your company but if they don‚Äôt and you are still making good money it‚Äôs not that important. That‚Äôs just how capitalism works. It would be way worse if your customers love you but you don‚Äôt make any money. Money &gt; Love
---
I haven't experienced this because I just stay on the private server but the war rages on Twitter as well. I've been blocked, unfollowed, branded as an elitist and raged against by people whom I've known for months simply because I purchased 1st to test it out. It's ok though, I low-key like the chaos.
---
&gt; The only difference is, more people are upvoting the one in question.
---
Up voting.  But, noticeably not commenting on.
---
Sorry, I don't recall.
---
This goes above and beyond Bethesda's usual antics. For them to so obviously strip-mine fans for ideas then turn around and sell them makes me think they're really hurting.
---
My theory right now is that they bet the farm on FO76 making them money hand-over-fist, and now that it's a financial failure, both from lack of interest and no one using the Atomic Shop, they're scrabbling to find additional ways of making money.
---
So my point still stands, did not progress for wearing a costume during the event.  Couldn't quite remember the other 2, at work. Thanks for the polite resopnse.üëç
---
What is it? Pm
---
Sweet, I want those atoms!
---
Well, at least you're consistent! &lt;3
---
I figure if there are BS negative ones, the positive ones are reasonable. Ideally we wouldn't have either, but it is predictable.
---
So how exactly do you play Fallout 76 on your console when it requires Xbox Live Gold to play?
---
Pretty sure beth were the ones who said "unlimited storage is impossible" 
---
They say alot of things are impossible unless you pay for them.
---
So, can anyone clue me in on candy and graffiti.
---
I have no problems blowing up cars and killing robots. :)
---
Uh... how?
---
I did mention this in another comment on this thread, there's no reason the hazmat couldn't be under armour
---
I like how almost everyone is just meming
---
Yea gonna need a PM on this stat please.
---
I have 1st but don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre on about. I‚Äôm guessing if you‚Äôre not trolling, it‚Äôs a dupe exploit.
---
I wouldn't expect any bugs to be resolved for the time being. Fallout 1st has to make money, or they're going to delay the Wastelanders update even more (let alone solve problems with the  game they're not profiting on). Remember: they're not making any money off of having the developers fix errors in the existing game.
---
That would work but only of you have power armour on you
---
Sorry my bad. Still, same sentiment applies to the cost of this game, and others really.
---
If they hate it and aren‚Äôt playing then they aren‚Äôt even a concern or a factor... I‚Äôll include those that have uninstalled it or admitted they haven‚Äôt even played per their own words in numerous posts... 
---
Glad they found something else...
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a pumpkin but instead of a face, it has a vault door shape. Probably the most common drop
---
I dont know if it is possible. Unless he dropped the frames.
---
\&gt;You can't think of some game that's worse? We're literally in the sub reddit for it 
---
WTF are you actually talking about? You haven't tried to do any research, have you? Fallout 76 had quiet "soft" monetization system a small time before and even now it still handles it better than some of FO76's competitors (like ESO, which fortunately has already been stated in this comment section) [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dmfeyl/theres\_always\_going\_to\_be\_new\_content\_changes\_in/f51aqz3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dmfeyl/theres_always_going_to_be_new_content_changes_in/f51aqz3/)

\&gt;the gaming community 
---
Turns out it is pretty dumb as a whole.
---
Just reconfigure mine with halloween decorations and just did a recreate no issues for undermesh
---
Vault 94 scout mask w/ ncr ranger outfit
---
Add ralba3055 I just started playing again
---
are you sure the mask on power armor works? i tried both mechanist and the in game skull mask and no luck so far counting towards rewards or the weekly challenge.
---
I have a basement. Just gotta play that bass to get in
---
Fair enough, my bad, have a good one.
---
So you just dropped your frames?
---
No. Most players don‚Äôt know the value of stuff
---
It's not possible unless they dropped the frames.
---
Okay, I‚Äôm more confused than ever about OP‚Äôs point then.
---
Are you certain of this?
---
How exactly did someone take them from you???? 
---
Only way that happened is if you hit X to drop them individually and repeated that 3 times... 
---
If that‚Äôs the case... blaming the community is 100% wrong.
---
Yeah, how did you do this? It‚Äôs not really supposed to be possible unless you dropped all 3 frames
---
So for the last one you have to earn 14k XP that day? That can't be right?
---
I was just away a minute and I dropped them for a couple minutes to do something
---
There is a watch tower North Mountain lookout, that spawns the outfit.
---
The watchtower is decorated with Halloween stuff.
---
you're way overblowing the paid mods thing, yeah it kinda sucks, but it's all made mostly in house or in conjunction with other mod developers and it's all technically dlc for the game, just a bit outsourced. there are *plenty* of other things to criticize them for, optional paid mods is only barely one of them.
---
There's candy buckets by the doors of the houses. There's paint splatter on the sides of the houses that you can interact with.
---
I didn't have enough room in stash or inventory so I dropped them for a minute
---
Why
---
Maybe they unlock one everyday but you have all the time of the event to complete them. The last one requires 14k xp. For me that would take way more than a day.
---
Those moments when my subconscious deadpans humor, and it takes me a while to actually get the joke
---
No 100% uncertain, want to know aswell so I can just use a clown costume  or something  more common.. and if I can use a power armor aswell cause everywhere  I go the event is nuked
---
We need Nick Valentine to eradicate the shills!
---
I have Xbox Live Ultimate and I've not had to pay for it, because like I said, you can get it free simply by using Bing. I haven't payed for it in at least four years, and I'm actually "prepaid" for the next 3 years.
---
Houses on the cottage row towards the station?
---
Thinks for the info.
---
I didn't have enough room in my stash or inventory I put them in a room with level 3 lock upstairs in my base so they would have to pick the lock to get In
---
Not sure if related but for example the witch outfit and hat were not counting maybe because it specifies mask. The full skeleton outfit and mask count.
---
Why didn't you deploy them????
---
You can wear a pa but you'll need to put on a costume head instead of the pa head
---
I play quite a lot, and I think the game is terrible. Poorly made mess. But that doesn't mean I cant enjoy it. I really am crazy about the fallout universe and the wastelands that I can explore. 76 is a huge world with tons to see. It does get boring a lot, but I always find myself coming back to just hang out and find random quests or hunt down places I haven't really explored. Again, I'm very aware the game is bad. But I do enjoy it. I haven't spent any money on it yet, but I've seen some datamined armors that look beyond amazing and I would definitely be willing to spend a bit to have them
---
To go a layer deeper, the *exact same thing* is what caused this sub to branch off of /r/fallout... then they had to do it a second time with the casuals sub. Same thing with /r/fo4 shortly after 4 came out. I actually wish the filty casuals ironically named themselves /r/fuckfallout or something like that.
---
Because they would get recalled to my inventory
---
Actually just experienced this with a sheepsquatch. Mowed it down with my TS minigun (thing must be broken, way too powerful) before it had the green mist and didn‚Äôt drop a legendary.
---
wtf man I'm sorry you lost your power armors but deserve what get
---
Yes. During the second phase of the mission.
---
Nope.
---
You sort of forgot all the important details -- platform, region, connection.
---
Me: PS4Pro, EU, gigabit fibre, no wifi.
---
Well idk what to tell you.....it certainly sucks but junk items aren't as important as PA chassis. Next time drop junk and leave room.
---
I guess I'm just ticked because t51 is my all time favorite and I was grinding to level 30 to wear it
---
Poll is already tainted by your question... you imply that everyone thinks it‚Äôs pay-to-win and either is against it or isn‚Äôt bothered by it. 
---
A large part of the community does not think that its pay to win at all so you leave them out which the result is bad data.
---
After cramming Preston's Garvey down our throat, they realized we hated him and wanted something opposite of him. Sadly that dlc wont have much if you really do wanna be a good guy. In 76 the raider stuff I think was to prepare us for the wastlanders update where we choose between the settlers or raiders. Not sure what sorta gear the settlers would have
---
When you say "let us know" it doesn't sound like you're talking about the community, so who is "us?"
---
like increased storage 
---
pay to play and and stuff like this is fraud and should be illegal
---
I think it's a fair question.
---
Thanks, I guess Sheepsquatch doesn't  work  so hopefully  the clown hat does or I'll have to go look for the skeleton  mask/outfit
---
That might be it since it says ‚Äúhead‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmask‚Äù, but that is bizarre considering it is obviously a mask lol.
---
another ‚Äúpositive comments must be rogue accounts from Bethesda‚Äù opinion. Ive never worked for Bethesda, I enjoy the game and have no problems spending 13$ a month to support them, especially when it finally allows me a private server. bring on the hate, but i‚Äôm sure outside of the reddit community, most players are enjoying the game instead of crying about it. honestly they might be killing two birds with one stone here, getting all the chronic haters to finally move on, and giving the remaining players what they want.
---
I've gotten a couple of them, in fact.
---
&gt; they aren‚Äôt even a concern or a factor
---
"you don't matter if you don't like being defrauded"
---
like seriously dude, go shove it
---
Where are they in the workshop?????

He was, ya know, made by college students.

People are angry at Bethesda. They want to lash out, and the easiest target to get at are the FO76 "Brand Ambassadors" on Reddit.
---
Since it's hard to tell who they are, anyone who *doesn't* hate 76 is a valid target to them.
---
I mean the community. Not working for Bethesda or some 3rd party data collection agency.

I disagree, the scrapbox should not exist, the ranger armor should be in the atomic shop, and everything else can be in Fallout 1st, or atleast that's how i think it should be.
---
What is the challenge? I can‚Äôt see it
---
Likewise got some Halloween related decoration plans, also got the Tattered Mole mask and the witch outfit.

Did I say they didn't intend to profit? I suggested they don't appreciate their purchasers. Shill.

What you saw was a bundle. I personally got the camo bundle, which was a PA skin (technically 4, since it can be applied to 4 different PA'S. SOME PA skins replace any PA with a single specific model, 2 outfits and 2 weapon skins, NOT just a PA skin. They released that particular PA skin by itself. I don't know the price solo but I can find out when I get off of work tomorrow. 
---
And once again, it's 3 pieces of data, description, (arbitrary) weight and quantity. The game does not count 10,000 pieces of lead as 10,000 individual items, it merely say does the player have lead, yes, how much, 10,000. Hypothetically ammo could be limitless too, except for used cores having x% capacity.

except that it costs more than the monthly subscription you need to even play the game, and instead of fixing the issues that caused private servers and unlimited stash space to become so appealing, they just forced you to pay a monthly fee for the fix so they don't have to do shit about it. $13 a month is way too god damn much for something that costs them nothing.
---
...you put me down a rabbit hole of answering quizzes and doing random searches on Bing. After 15 minutes I ha d only 345 points. You need **5000 POINTS** for a $5 gift card which would pay my monthly pass fee.  How the F am I supposed to earn **5000 POINTS**?

First rule of Fallout 1st club. Never talk about the Fallout 1st club.
---
Their title is, and will always be:. Hypocrite.
---
If someone that has never played it or uninstalled it... why should they factor in especially the ones that never played it??? 
---
If my comment triggered you that bad or the Bethesda mad you uninstall it... there are way more things going on there... 
---
It‚Äôs a game... like it or leave it... play it don‚Äôt play...
---
Actually, I'm trying to do the opposite. As I've stated it's pay2win, however you interpret that.
---
There's no denying there is a good portion of the community who thing utility items are pay2win. It's also clear, much like your comment, that there are those who don't.
---
Maybe I didn't word it the best but the question I'm trying to ask is whether or not you have an issue with pay2win items in the game, whatever pay2win items means to you.
---
Hope that clears things up.
---
While fallpit 1st sucks imo, it doesnt stop making the game look any less pretty.
---
Totally missing the point again. I never claimed that the majority aren't sincere, I'm part of that majority as I've been largely critical of the move. I wrote-- as per the context of the OP and the thread he was referencing-- that the positive shills are the same type of minority as the negative trolls. Extremes and fakes on both sides are the problem.
---
Get fucked.

That's just the thing; it will.

Fans have the collective attention span of a dog. When companies do unpopular things, they're always going to go quiet until the outrage blows over or stagnates.

Well it‚Äôs good to learn these lessons at level 30. You can find frames everywhere and you would upgrade the parts anyway. Chalk it up to experience.

From a data perspective your results then would be biased and incorrect since you haven‚Äôt accounted for all the variables. 
---
So saying you want to know how the community feels would imply you are asking the community as a whole. 
---
Instead you are asking only those that think it‚Äôs pay to win. 
---
Since many don‚Äôt think that it is, you‚Äôd be excluding them and it forcing people to admit if they take part in the poll. 
---
If you want to conduct a fair analysis of the community then you should ask fair questions.
---
13$ is too much? I assume you won‚Äôt change your mind, which means we have come to a disagreement. 13 a month is fine, and if not then maybe Bethesda has killed two birds with one stone. finally forced out all the chronic haters, and kept the players willing to support them. I mean 13bucks lol, its peanuts
---
Honestly despite a lack of proof of his past job, there are plenty of other factors beyond "I am proof shills exist, so there are probably Bethesda shills here." For example the product in question... Fallout 76 is over a year old, in terms of video games that is past maturity in its product lifecycle- meaning the overwhelming majority of people who are going to own the game already do- their target market has been nearly fully penetrated. A few late adopters, sure, but it overall it is like suggesting Marvel execs are shilling for End Game reviews shortly before it was leaving theaters. Hence Bethesdas focus on in game MTX rather than showing commercials to further expand the customer base.

This whole thread is laughable and serves as self justification for dismissing the opinions of people who aren't matching the popular outcry level of outrage.

Not necessarily. Sometimes a server will be scheduled for maintenance and new users can't join while existing users won't be kicked out.
---
Well they really are not having any problems targeting and shooting me, my stimpack stash took a hit but since I am so bad at avoiding damage I assumed my fault specialty during Mischief Event.
---
You are right.  Bethesda has all types of data on how many players are spending money and how many are subscribing.  If everyone is crying foul on reddit but the data suggest otherwise, then the reality is that people don't mind paying for stuff.  Voting with your wallet has the biggest impact.
---
You fucked up bro. You will never see them again. Don‚Äôt do this. Just don‚Äôt.
---
For it to mean anything they would have to get a statistically valid sample, which to be fair would need to include likely a large number of people who don‚Äôt spend time on reddit. People always over estimate how much of the community spends time on Reddit, or other social media
---
Xbox?i can make u one if u want
---
Hey, look at all these new accounts posting positive stuff about FO76 in the wake of bad PR. Neat.
---
Yeah I'm online now
---
I don't mean reddit specifically. I mean emailed out to Bethesda accounts and then the results posted on inside the vault or something like that
---
I think they didn't explained that because ennemies' mutation was a mechanic in FO4

I swear I just saw these plans at either Sunnytop or R&amp;G.

Thank you I knew the items were all data inclusive i didnt know that junk was simply 3 lines of code. As for the price thing you're probably right I stopped playing when they added in repair kits and than the whole fridge in the atom shop debacle.
---
Get fallout first, block all your friends, take every single workshop and do the retake events
---
Additionally pay to win would technically be the wrong phrase to use since literally nothing makes a player better to win anything in game or gives them a better chance to succeed over another player. 
---
More scrap? How about those with 4-5 miles packed with all types of items? 
---
Dupers? Or those getting god weapons and armor who truly to have an advantage over others. 
---
Those that purchase outside of the game like on eBay or Gameflip any item available (they would literally be paying) 
---
So why not include all those variables which have a greater impact on the game and players than a scrap box or a tent or private server?
---

I'd literally need to pay 10 a month just to play the game on console, and with that 10 I'd also get access to a plethora of free games. What do I get for thirteen from a broken game with a disheartened developer? Private servers? That thing that every other multiplayer game has *for free*? Oh, and unlimited scrap storage, a thing that only exists because their current storage and encumbrance systems are, surprise, broken. Also dont forget, the one update that represented any promise that this game might actually improve for once got delayed, solely because of this subscription. Absolutely not worth 13 a month. With the amount you'd end up spending over a year, you could buy three AAA games that would give you 100x times the enjoyment over this dilapidated crapfest.
---
Actions speak louder than words. For example Utility items are the top seller in the arom shop and that's why they are making more.
---
Haha can't understand how dumb ppl are to defend this trash game. Halloween event out and it's a waste of time unlike something like borderlands that gives you several unique legendary items, skins, etc.
---
Criticism taken. Now please address my argument.
---
Can we please just be honest...paying to win is just that.  Where can I pay money to drop a nuke or kill other players in NW?  There is no such thing as pay to win in this game.  I get what you mean, but come up with a different name.  It‚Äôs not catchy,but at least it‚Äôs honest to say:
---
Pay2belessfrustrated vs.

No Pay2belessfrustrated
---
I want decapitated head props and meat bags to make my raider camp look more raidery
---
That's very true.  Companies think about the current fiscal year, but don't think about how it will affect the future games.  It's more of an issue in gaming I think.
---
Bwahahaha.
---
Workshops are fair game.
---
Building armor,guns, ammo is something most, but not all, players tend to do. Me, I dump unnecessary low level stuff all the time, Power armor frames get left at overseers camp.
---
Stealing player death bags... well, here's where I kinda, nearly, almost do just that. You find a death bag, look inside and see a wealth of lead there, well, I might just liberate that lead, but drop 500 5mm ammo there, and maybe that Fatman and mini nukes I just got off the SBQ too.
---
Do you go to high school if not I do so anytime past 4 I should be on
---
Patch will be available in the next atom shop bundle.
---
You have to do your searches every day. I've earned over 10,000 points this month.
---
well, seems you disagree, but clearly there are plenty of people out there who bought and enjoy the service. good riddance, go play your other free aaa games then, we won‚Äôt miss you
---
Well, there ya go.
---
So you use Bing search deal to get free Xbox gold... got it...
---
Mod that to pipe revolver rifle and it benefits from both Rifleman and Gunslinger perks. Someone will pay well for that.
---
Ok. How would you word such a question to exclude biases and account for all the variables?
---
I know the limitations of the poll. It's a clear for/against. I also have to acknowledge the background of the poll and its intent, both of which I do.
---
I can't ignore the context in which this is raised.
---
I feel sorry for people that paid big money for them the last few weeks
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.

I had t51 minus the helmet with the skull mask, it works

Don't even know how to answer this.

Well I can confirm Whitespring Jumpsuit as possible 5th reward. Received it on 3rd run. I'm amazed.

Thinking from a business perspective, subscription services are much more profitable and have a higher yield, but as a consumer, I would just want a one time purchase

The one in the fo4 dlc was not a real elevator?

Uber gaming pc(team amd) and Chinese smartphone gang, best value for dollars hehe

At the top of each hour you should see an announcement that the event is starting at White springs. You can teleport directly there with join event.

Or just get.. Windows free edition.. Arrr
---
No mate i have a job lol.dont worry u get them back.see ya soon
---
Thanks!
---
Don't let the rest of my comment get you down, this is a bloody good idea, there's just a few things in the way.
---
Firstly, many of the things Bethesda have done (especially with 76) arnt bad things on their own, they were just bad timed, implemented and planned.
---
Secondly, there's things like owners, higher ups, ect that can put pressure on them to implement certain things.
---
Using the last week and fo2st as an example, about 40% of the posts in this community were people bitching about it, another 30% bitching about them. I doubt fo1st is going to be removed, or altered, even with such a loud outcry from the community
---
the poor thing can‚Äôt handle people playing it üò¢
---
Thank you!
---
Not a new account, yet exclusive comments on FO76 subs, and made several hyper-positive posts on this thread. Neat.
---
Are you for pay2win items or not. That's really it. 
---
Not even acknowledging whether or not the current items in game are pay2win or not. Just are you for or against the idea of pay2win items, however you interpret that.
---
well its impossible to please everybody, thats a pipe dream. this does not mean they don‚Äôt respect their purchasers. I heard many of their purchasers, on stream, off streams, friends etc say things similar to ‚Äúid gladly pay for a private server‚Äù. now that they offer that exact thing people said they were willing to pay for, others get upset. its optional, you can still play the same way you always have, or you have the choice to buy private servers, if anything it sounds like they actually listened.
---
If they gave us an ar15 in fallout and not an elephants penis theyd be more prevalent. NV had the M4 idk why they ruined it with the AR we have now
---
Thank you see t's soon
---
You do realise the "win" in pay2win isn't ever meant to be taken literally. How could anyone possibly win in a persistent game with no clear end or win condition?
---
Now they stopped making the game better for ppl that bought it now it we're hard at work to make the game better for are brain dead subscribers. Lmao
---
Yeah, get it and find out!
---
Haven't seen dab on in a long while.
---
Correct. Gourds look like small pumpkins and you can plant those.
---
fallout 1st exclusive. dont downvoat me for saying something so controversial yet so brave
---
Yea it's annoying as fuck. I'm personally also disappointed sentry bots are so weak in 76, gutsies with their ridiculous armor pen damage are way more of a threat than sentry bots shooting 5000 noodles per minute at you
---
They‚Äôre a SYNTH!
---
And never will be but hey buy a sub for $13.99.
---
why are so many people defending this game with accounts less than a year old? hmmm.....
---
However you want to phrase it for yourself is fine. You still understand the context. Pay2win isn't an ideal word but it's one people (generally) understand the meaning and intent of.
---
And so it goes. There will always be bootlickers and boots to be licked.
---
This is kinda in line with how Mojang did/does with Minecraft. They put out their ideas for the next big thing and bam. 
---
Would be too easy to set up a section on BGS site and vote. 
---
You would have to come up with a system to prevent not BGS fans or trolls to vote however.
---
Guess this is the reply I was looking for, thank you
---
Because ppl will buy it anyway just like they buy atoms for the trash microtransactions.
---
And scrap storage specifically is something they could have given everyone basically for free.
---
Every player already has a bunch of rows in a database table with some amount of every type of scrap stored there. Won't cost any more to set the weight of scrap to zero when it's in the stash.
---
You should ask the community if they think it‚Äôs pay to win first. 
---
Second problem would be who you are polling and where. 
---
A poll asked here will get different results if asked in other groups outside of this group which is also the community. 
---
Third problem happens if only people that think it is or isn‚Äôt do the poll... 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to give you a hard time here... I know data like this regardless of content so having questions that don‚Äôt imply or force a user to accept are better.
---
No but for real tho
---
Itll never be fixed that'll be $13.99 a month thank you.
---
A new one is added every day for six days. Then you have until Nov 12th to complete them all.
---
I doubt it
---
Because they have the best dps for rifles.
---
ü•Å‚ò†üê¥
---
This been a problem since BETA. 
---
There have been several instances I had to restart my game because some insanely loud sound was playing on a loop.
---
Thank you. Delete is next I guess
---
Oh, but do they count as pumpkins? Or do I have to keep going back to the pumpkin house...
---
Man.. lol. It's funny that there are still people upset. You literally get the value of your monthly payment in Atoms each month.
---
We at Bethesda heard your suggestion that'll be $20
---
Where the fuck did I said that? Talk about going on a limb
---
I have an inkling you may enjoy this video (er, vidjayo): 
---

---
Interesting; an account that has stayed exclusively to the 76market generating karma suddenly has had a change of heart and now posting here with zero criticisms of the game and only denouncing the 'toxic people'..
---
Neat.
---
Gotta go into private servers for it to work properly thanks for your support.
---
I got in this afternoon just fine. A few hours later and zilch. This is ridiculous. My download to reinstall is 73 hours!
---
Nothing I enjoy more than having to listen to an Indian guy  on YouTube take 20 mins to explain VERY QUIETLY (why is this always true? Lol) how to get past X company's outrageous attempts at making their bloat difficult to remove :D
---
lol, no.. people usually don't make an account to post in just one sub. Not normal behavior unless you're posting in porn subs or other weird stuff you might be ashamed to associate with your main account. Who cares otherwise. 
---
Your post history does come off as being a little strange in how upset you get when people have anything negative to say about F76. I don't think you're a shill though, they would hire people who make good arguments and who don't sound so mentally damaged in the process.
---
I made a account cause someone told me what reddit is and I was curious but what do any of us know. So far i can tell there isn't anything different about the community then facebook communities
---
Outer worlds is really special man, I didn‚Äôt get into at first as well, it took my mind a little while to comprehend that I was actually playing a real RPG which I hadn‚Äôt done in so long. Give it more of a chance, and playing it thorough longer, listen to dialogue thoroughly and really focus on a specific character build, youll really enjoy it, especially if you love rpg‚Äôs.
---
Oh for sure. There are certain places that work better for positioning.
---
My routine is
---
-shoot
---
-reload
---
-kill with throwable object(I use knifes)
---
-repeat.
---
I use objects to avoid weapon switching animations, actually saves a significant amoint of time. Also, after every kill it can spawn legendary but it takes several seconds to fully gain its star rating. You can get (lvl25) 3* from this process, as well as all the meat you could ever possibly want. The reason we reload before killing is that sometimes, the spawn is hostile. So having the round in the chamber helps protect against that. Depending on your build you may have to use 2 knifes,though I get away with one because of my str I'm pretty sure.
---
We're all actually cryo-frozen right now
---
**CONFUSED DEATH NOISES**
---
[removed]
---
Ive gotten blue screened at least twice a day since last week. Hadnt had that issue for awhile. Maybe more players or just 76 being 76 idk.
---
The people who get upset believe that unified action from the community could get Bethesda to change course on this decision and ones like it. They're angry that you aren't taking action to protect the integrity of the game, as they see it.
---
I mean, I broadly agree with the 'angry consensus' if it could be termed such a thing, but I also agree that some of the discourse has gotten over the top.
---
What? How exactly do expect to fund the continued support of this game?
---
It slipped by because "gamers" dont give a shit about mobile games, and for whatever reason we seem to be the only consumer base that pays attention and complains. 
---
Like seriously, we'll kick up a massive fuss over the tiniest shit. Meanwhile car manufacturers can literally kill people with bad brakes, food processors can poison you with a bad shipment and all it takes is a quick recall and theyre still in good graces. Almost every packaged product has lost roughly 10-30% of its volume over the years while increasing the price and its just nbd. 
---
Consumers in general are just very complacent, but there's a very vocal minority of gamer-Karens slowing the descent of the core games industry
---
It‚Äôs just an outfit. Who cares?
---
nice "private servers"  you bought eh?
---
I guess you could take my argument to mean that the latest thing they did that upset their base is the issue. My suggestion is that from the very roll out of this game, they thought of us as clowns...and continue to.
---
I think a more practical solution is if the FO76 world was modded on top of FO4.
---
These are probably FO4 fans. I was one of them and would have jumped on the sub &amp; private servers to try the game out.
---
 If I didn't get it for Xmas last year, that is.
---
How are people still commenting on this it‚Äôs been like 2 days
---
The food processing machines at
---
#MMMMMMMMAMA DOLCES
---
have finally cooled down enough to work again!
---
Bethesda= We're sorry, was you in private servers that has a chance of alleviating the issue.
---
I dont generally. But do sell lead for caps, I switched to bloodied melee to get away from ammo in general, with the exception of shotgun and syringer ammo.
---
Possibly, that's a good catch.
---
Nope. If its pumpkins you want than its the pumpkin house you need.
---
I think Juicehead posted something on YouTube.
---
Well shit. Thanks!
---
If it‚Äôs not meant to be taken literally then don‚Äôt use it. There is. I spirit of what it means... 
---
In this community especially now, pay to win points at those with a 1st subscription and you know that, as does anyone reading this thread. 
---
Again asking first if players think the game is pay to win first would be a fair question. 
---
Then ask that same question in other groups. 
---
Take those numbers and from there depending on results you could ask more.
---
It's only a logical fallacy if you have a tendency to be incorrect or less correct than you believe because 1: you make multiple predictionsand only catalogue the ones you've been correct about. If you understand cognitive biases, you can, you know, learn from them and learn how to correct from them, human. 
---
Did you see the qualifier word in the article? It's 'tendency' , you know what that means. It certainly doesnt mean always. 
---
Again, you don't know me, and you're making hasty generalizations. Maybe read what hasty generalization means 10x over. I'm sure there's also a logical fallacy for using logical fallacies fallaciously. That's what you're doing. Again, because *you don't fucking know me*
---
Yeah, I'm "digging a hole," says the guy who doesn't understand what they're saying. 
---
But you're the type of person who harps on an obvious typo while talking about pettiness( great job practicing self-awareness) so this is now clearly a waste of a waste of my time.
---
Ah and just got free heads code for borderlands today.
---
I've already found *at minimum* four PR accounts active on your thread, very quickly following your post.
---
Just abandon this account, we've got this one marked as of now. Go get a more honest line of work, dude.
---
There's a visual thing where it says it unlocked "classic" jack-o-lantern, but in the build interface it should let you build the correct pumpkin.  
---
 I get the same message, but it's unlocking the correct pumpkins for me despite the message.
---
The pumpkin house is real???!? Wtf lol. This is awesome.
---
***‚ÄùDamn kids, get off mah lawn!!‚Äù***
---
&gt; You should ask the community if they think it‚Äôs pay to win first. 
---
As I mentioned before, I'm aware of the limits of the scope of my poll. Whether or not the current items are considered pay2win at all are immaterials to the intended poll and I say as much in the OP. That's outside the scope of the poll.
---
&gt;Second problem would be who you are polling and where.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;A poll asked here will get different results if asked in other groups outside of this group which is also the community.
---
I know that. I also asked the same question in fo76FilthyCasuals as a point of comparison. However, I'm not going to ask the wider gaming community. Once again, not looking to do a comprehensive poll across all gamers of all different gaming genres. The poll is specifically limited to people in the Fallout 76 sub and FilthyCasuals.
---
&gt; Third problem happens if only people that think it is or isn‚Äôt do the poll... 
---
This is an entirely unrealistic expectation, in much the same way I have no control over whether or not this post gets upvoted for visibility or never sees the light of day.
---
This poll is very limited in its scope. Intentionally so by design. I get that the topic can be considerably nuanced. I won't bore you with the depth of my understanding of that.
---
I think you're expecting this poll to be something it just isn't. It's just a simple for/against whilst not trying to (but failing drmatically it seems) to make commentary as to whether the current utility items are pay2win or not.
---
I haven't been on for over a week as well. The paid subscription and outrage sort of kept me away. I know a little about business and the way Beth runs blows me away lol. It reminded me when my girlfriend worked for Facecrack and she said the place is filled with entitled Harvard no experience babies lol. 
---
I picture Beth the same way, some kids running the place making horrible decisions trying to make the quarter for the Todd's. It's all good I chose to step away from all this B.S.. Eventually Beth will get it or they will dissolve. I still can't wrap my head around the subscription service? A major fail. 
---
I'm going to log in and see if they fixed the endless gunfire from the sentry's lol that was written to be fixed in Patch 10. 
---
Good luck Beth.. üéÉ
---
I love this xD
---
of you're on xbox, I'd gladly play with you.  fo76 is the only way I really socialize
---
This is so cool thanks for sharing.
---
Okay
---
Private servers.
---
This needs to be made illegal as fuck right away.
---
Also you need to call these companies out asap for selling such services.
---
A huge bright spot light needs to be shined on this.
---
This is fraud, pure and simple.
---
Go get a better job that doesn't involve playing pretend, dude. Also, this account is now marked; please switch to another one to continue shilling :/
---
I see your ripper and raise you https://youtu.be/VaF10Vawl8I
---
That counts
---
Thanks!  Which station do you build them at btw?  Haven‚Äôt been able to get back to camp in a while.
---
Mighty impressive!
---
What are you doing in my private server? -"shrek"
---
Vault 94 on washout has a ton of crickets that just keep spawning
---
Bi-monthly
---
Can't even access the game right now. Tried 10 times. Netfixing and chilling instead.
---
You're asking for this to be something it just isn't. I'm not looking to poll all gamers to see whether or not they're ok with pay2win items. I'm asking the Fallout 76 sub since it seems clear here that there isn't a clear consensus one way or the other.
---
From your posted question and picture, anyone answering automatically gets put into a group saying it‚Äôs pay to win 100% and if they care or don‚Äôt care... bottom line your saying the results or could that it is implied that those taking it think it is. 
---
So I stand by my assessment... ask the community if they think it‚Äôs pay to win first. 
---
Avoid any confusion whatsoever or the results will be tainted
---
You can easily compare Bethesda‚Äôs shit servers to any other servers. If I am getting disconnected 5 times per day in a Bethesda server and 0 times per day in other games, then it is probably not my fault.
---
Mine is a rather revealing build that relies on Light Metal Armor and no underarmor.
---
It's pretty unique - I've only bumped into another one like me maybe once.
---
Chainsaws are under powered in this game
---
Nice! Deal good damage?
---
Nice is it very durable?
---
Bethesda‚Äôs initial statement on FO76 is that they don‚Äôt want it to ever end. Compare to ESO having a terrible release and miraculous comeback,  now bringing in a ton of revenue, I‚Äôm not sure what is laughable about the possibility of Bethesda using PR tactics to salvage their brand that they plan on having around for years and years to come
---
It worked for me using the Halloween Vampire Costume and the Fasnacht Man mask. I think you should try using different outfits and if it still doesn't work I guess the only solution would be to report it to Bethesda themselves.
---
76 definitely has alot of problems, there are still annoying glitches that interfere with the game (ghouls stuck in walls during workshop attacks lol..) and personally I think the 'questline' was laughably  bad compared to other fallout games but it's definitely a fun game in alot of ways. It's in a weird position but the game definitely has a shit ton of potential, I highly doubt the player base is low as people think considering the high amount of people on this sub constantly.
---
Just nuke the entirety of Morgantown. In fact, triple nuke it to be sure.
---
Still a fun game...to me. What most people don't understand is it is a company that exists to make money. People regard reviews too heavily at times (similar to the shill post earlier) and lack the ability to formulate their own opinions. Secondly, like a highschool and most people it is easier to join a bandwagon.
---
Fallout 1st subscribers take 70% less damage!
---
Sadly you can convince others of this.  Big brain gamers see legendary, kill legendary. You no hit. So sad. I jest but this is the normal thought people have. 
---
Maybe with enough upvotes people will see this more.
---
Then ask this sub if they think it‚Äôs pay to win first... I‚Äôm telling you a lot do not think it is. 
---
So asking a question as you‚Äôve written implies that it is regardless of how they answer. 
---
That‚Äôs why you have to ask the community if they think it is pay to win first...
---
That said, it's still valuable to look into. I remember posting a 1/5 review for a former employer. While most were being hyperbolic and saying nothing worthwhile to anyone, I went into every pro and con I could with that place. 
---
But yeah, the ones posting 5/5 or 1/5 reviews on anything usually are being melodramatic, hyperbolic, and toxic rather than informative or helpful, which defeats the entire point behind what a review is for. It's important to look at all reviews, but the 1's and 5's should be taken with a grain of salt sometimes.
---
Lol wow. Good god. I dont even know what to say. Cause I've no idea what marked is or anything. But yea not like I care what u have to say.
---
The event will remind you (in the quest objectives) if you‚Äôre not wearing a costume, but it seems like almost everything works. I‚Äôm playing with just the skeleton mask and that qualifies.
---
I think a subscription is fine, it just needs to not paywall QoL items the community has requested. 
---
If I were to rework FO1st and it‚Äôs items, it would look like this: 
---
(Keep current pricing)
---
1. Private Worlds
---
2. At least 1650 Atoms/mo
---
3. Free exclusive cosmetics each month
---
4. Early access to new Atomic Shop items
---
5. Double Atoms from challenges
---
6. Discounts on Atomic Shop purchases
---
Give the Scrapbox to all players. 
---
Create a new section in the Atomic Shop for ‚ÄúCommunity Suggested Items‚Äù that includes things like the fridge, Collectron, Survival Tent and other future items of that nature. Those items would be one time purchases, using Atoms, either paid or earned in game. 
---
Eliminate consumable items from the Atomic Shop entirely. Either pull them or make them recipes you can get as one time purchases in the Community section so you can craft the items in game.
---
I will look into this thank you
---
One of the mods took great offence that I jumped on the first posts after the last screw up. Despite the hullabaloo, they were all, "oh hey great camp photo"... etc. I only drop back in here now to see if they've started posting. Sure, the crushing they will receive will be less than last week, but it will be tough for them.
---
Please let's try to redirect the fluff back to the problem at hand.
---
1. No. It‚Äôs part of the game and you‚Äôre fair game either way. Don‚Äôt want PvP?  Don‚Äôt take workshops. 
---
2. I‚Äôm okay with this. Besides, they need to level up to be worth the bounty and have decent loot bag drops. 
---
3. I‚Äôll use what I paid for how I see fit. Walking around in my NCR Armor and Helmet isn‚Äôt ‚Äòshowing off‚Äô. I‚Äôm not responsible for your emotional well-being. 
---
4. Um, no. Stash your junk if you want to keep it secure. 
---
5. Again, no. I‚Äôm not overloading my friends list just to let people use my private world, and when I‚Äôm ready to log off, I‚Äôm logging off. Now, if you want to negotiate an offer of caps for a certain amount of time to have access to my world, make an offer.
---
No bad blood or toxic attitude for you; extreme love that you don't try censpring everyone's opinions unlike many Blizzard subs did.
---
Just out of curiosity, does the mod team have any method for handling the PR accounts BGS is using? I understand it is tricky, but have there been bans over the issue?
---
Yes.
---
ugh i really hope that‚Äôs not the case
---
Place then instead of dropping them next time. Get rid of something else. 
---
I guarantee you that you have excess junk or gear you don‚Äôt need. 
---
Quit hoarding stuff you don‚Äôt need.
---
Yeah the forums are out of control.  I'd say it's time for Bethesda to start issuing some perma-bans.  No call for this level of utter immaturity and lack of civility.
---
Why not "Fallout 1st Responders."
---
I have junk no extra clothing except pa frames ammo and like 2 or 3 extra weapons now I cleaned out a lot
---
Maybe sell it I got rid of it somehow or stash it
---
Usually relogging works
---
Yeah no. They can play however they like. The fake class struggle people keep pushing is becoming pathetic. üñì
---
Leatherface called, it wants it's Chainsaws back!!!
---
I've been subscribing to games since March of 1999.  This is not a new model.  Get with the times.
---
&gt; If someone that has never played it or uninstalled it... why should they factor in especially the ones that never played it???
---
right let add a word to my original comment because seems like it's needed
---
"the reason you see scrap boxes everywhere may be as simple as those who hate it aren't playing" anymore
---
&gt; It‚Äôs a game
---
I love that argument. It's ok to be unethical and commit fraud if it's just a video game.
---
My god...
---
I'd be going around in circles to respond to this as I've already made that response - it's immaterial if specific items are pay2win or not. A more abstract question is being asked about pay2win items in general. I don't know how much more I can simplify that for you. 
---
20 people (as of this comment) got my intent but to simplify it even further, if you come across an item you consider to be a pay2win item, are you ok with that or not?
---
The thing is I already ask that in the OP.
---
I honestly don't know how to make that clearer to you what my intent was.
---
It's not too bad, but it's terribly difficult to aim compared to adventure mode. It's just visually worse, choppy, and laggy.
---
Just letting you know this account is now identified; best move onto the next one if you want to make that minimum wage for a brand ambassador.
---
It would be great to have the ghoul mask back in game
---
Lol nah it just broken game they fail to fix then ask for more money.
---
You sure the questline is complete? I was able to drop mine.
---
Thanks. I'll try that. Hopefully I won't have to do it every Tuesday.
---
Working great on ps4 pro.
---
Damn. I really spent hours server hopping to get that shit.
---
5th time.
---
No. Nobody has to pay the thousands, tens of thousands, or more disgruntled players to post shit about the game. But they sure as hell have to pay people to deceive people into buying 1st, and they are absolutely doing that.
---
My most unique build is my Big Iron. Based on the song. While yes pistols aren‚Äôt new but the style the build has is. Armed with just a single action and lots of booze.
---
Will have to try that. Any specific location(s)?
---
You're tired of repeating your self??? lol Now that's hilarious. You keep using your experience with WoW to justify targeting players in Fallout, and now you're blaming me? lol Nice. 
---
You're losing me now on the whole death button because before you wouldn't blame the players, but now you would?
---
I've been done a long time, you just cant seem to get past your terrible experience with WoW so now you want to target players in FO.
---
Minor Cosmetics? What about the workshop plans?
---
i wonder if bethesda will ever acknowledge this shit
---
Yea, I‚Äôm a full on mistress and I still can‚Äôt drop it....
---
I just server hop at Toxic Larry's
---
Hopefully relogging fixes the issue.
---
Pretty cool.
---
I wish it didnt constantly crash
---
Different games deal with disconnects in different ways.  While some will instantly allow for a reconnection as soon as things stabilize others will end up dropping you out, bethesda's servers are definately the later.  You can't hold all services to the same standards of operation.  
---
If you're getting disconnected five times a day playing this game then there's definitely something wrong with your or your provider, just because another game isn't dropping your connection entirely doesn't mean you aren't likely suffering from something like lag spikes or the occasional extra long loading where these connection losses are happening and recovering.
---
What are u talking about? Brand ambassador? If anything I'll just say fuck reddit and its shitty community.
---
I'm sorry dude. You just don't get that it's immaterial to the poll.
---
A perfectly interesting poll could be ask as to whether each of the utility items are or are not pay2win items. This is not that poll.
---
This poll simply asks are you for or against pay2win items in Fallout 76, whatever a pay2win item means for you.
---
Look, it's pretty clear you don't get it or your intentionally being obtuse about it. I think I'll leave it here.
---
Shh bethesda
---
WTF is this? French?! I can‚Äôt read French
---
Thank you Bethesda. &lt;3
---
Makes me start wanting to do some of that stuff instead, like the giving people stuff part, which I was gonna do anyways
---
Yup
---
Its MN. It crashes everything
---
It's a shameless cash grab. They see a pie they can dip their grubby fingers in, and they did nothing to add value to the modding community that is the cornerstone to why Skyrim is so popular.
---
The problem here is intent.
---
You can say I'm overblowing this issue, but to me it's the first baby step towards how shit Bethesda is today.
---
I like whitesprings station. If you run into the back left corner away from the door and stand on the trashcan. They get stuck inbetween the chairs sometimes. This is ideal, as when you pick up loot the meat piles will stack on top of each other. This makes harvesting after a 100+ session less tedious.
---
does the half pint slasher outfit and mask count?
---
You ask you don‚Äôt have a problem with pay to win or they are against pay to win... in a Fallout 76 subreddit which literally a few have been talking about it being pay to win. 
---
Numerous posts asking what exactly do you win? 
---
The argument really is if the community thinks it‚Äôs actually pay to win... plain and simple. 
---
Sorry but the way you have it worded is biased and implies that people taking think it is pay to win by defacto... 
---
Like I said... ask the community if they think it‚Äôs pay to win... 
---
Then ask those that think it IS your question above...
---
Not even close to being lame, but okay lmao
---
Pretty sure not supporting exclusivity is a reason.
---
I can also confirm the game can lock-up/freeze when you attempt to use a Stimpak or RadAway within your Pip-Boy via the shortcuts present on the character status screen.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the context if we are going to decide that words/terms don‚Äôt have universally accepted meanings.  That is why there‚Äôs confusion in the first place, because of the inherent verisimilitude present in labeling a non-cosmetic item by default a pay2win item.
---
Yeah so? And your point is?
---
Because for the most part this ISN'T a unified action from the "community".
---
Look at the level of "support" threads like that end up attracting with well over 8000 upvotes and climbing and compare it to any other popular thread around here.  Just because the vocal minority gets their complaints out to the rest of reddit which then upvotes the shit out of it because "lolfallout76" doesn't mean they represent the people actually playing the game.
---
Awesome, will definitely try this tonight
---
lol it's the best seasonal event they have added, I mean I liked Faschnacht but it's fun to have enemies that can down people, and Meat Week was good with primal events but it's better blowing up cahs
---
How can you not get excited about blowing shit up, the event is actually fun af btw.
---
Most times I'm in whitesprings anyway I'll destroy every car I see n now with this event we get plans for doing it
---
Then your poll is biased and tainted and anyone who thinks the game is NOT pay to win won‚Äôt take it or shouldn‚Äôt since doing so literally implies that they think it is pay to win... 
---
So if your initial concern was to ask the community as a whole... then rephrase the question... 
---
If you want biased results... that keep it...
---
I tried relogging, nothing still stuck in my inventory as a quest item
---
Holy fuck we get it you don‚Äôt like fallout 1st, nobody is literally forcing you to buy it.
---
Because you've certainly stretched your legs into the Reddit community beyond FO76 outside of two posts, right?
---
Because recommending that subreddit rules be followed is clearly the real offense if it might offend the crusaders
---
You need 10 glands to make the barrel though. There is a cave to the NE of Freddy fears. It has a handful of bloatfly and 2 yau gaui(totally butchered that name). 
---
You can server hop a few times here if you need more glands

Got one first session.  Love it

I cant believe people are downvoting you

Server hopping still works? Thought it got patched or something
---
On Xbox. I'm laggy but haven't crashed. Played 3 MN events.

Stw3793/mitchkruse49
---
Usually play most weekends
---
I totally agree with this, but the early access atomic shop i think its not necesary. It will be compensated with the free cosmetic extra items each month or maybe they just half the price of the subscription till they add more stuffs cause the true is that the actual premium items are not worth it. Now talking about the scrap box it MUST bee free for all.
---
Other sub.
---
Now we have seen this counter narrative all over these posts calling out the PR/Shills, about the anti Bethesda shills. The thing you have to ask is who has something to gain, or cui bono, to whom is it a benefit? There is nobody paying shills to talk shit about 76 or Bethesda, because nobody has anything to gain from that, except gamers who have been cheated and for the future of the games they play, that is what they have to gain. Good games that don't rip them off.
---
A voting system in game or in the main menu would be a good place to get real votes. 
---
Would be neat for sure. Weighing in on future content.
---
I'm not sure if that's really something that can be prevented cos even if you have to be signed in, people can sign up easily. Unless it‚Äôs a link you can only access because it‚Äôs emailed out to you. Even then people could find out an still easily sign up but yeah.
---
Been disconnected from server 1 of 3 times, and for some reason it takes about 3 times as long tonfsst travel to.
---
6. Keep your phone close and Mama on speed dial.
---
Im getting that skeleton outfit
---
In game would be ideal. I really hope they implement something along those lines to taper content
---
Already tried that
---
It works on some random event locations. Like those albino radstags in the lying lowe quest. They respawn with every hop ime. This one mostly does, but sometimes you do stumbe into one that is empty.
---
Its just a bit off the beaten path, so most walk by without even noticing it.
---
Melee berserker's. Stack broken cavalier's armor with perks like moving target. Mobility is key since you take little damage while sprinting. It's constant frantically closing distances and wailing on them with swing speed, martial artist and speed demon.
---
&gt;And this time it didn‚Äôt work for me! ü§£ still was fun
---
Only one perfusion can activate them. I triggered one, went to the next house right after someone else set off the mine, and it witless let me trigger it again.
---
Vault Raid on week 2 (the one with voting) is a pretty great acid farm...and sucks in every other aspect
---
constantly rising rad levels might be a problem but thats what rad sponge is for
---
I didn't even think that it needed defining since the intent seems pretty clear but added a definition just to be 100%.
---
Thanks for the feedback :)
---
I can. Proves my point. Subs want the p2w, which is pretty depressing. For us and the game.
---
I've been on reddit for about 2-3 weeks I think and yea I've looked up posts mainly to try and find people who actually like the game. See how other people play and base build. I even tried to upload a picture of a naked scorch that was glitched lol I didn't know how.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a little of the march of Fasnacht but smashing everything in your path with absolutely no waiting for scripted moments. I‚Äôve done it 6 times and it‚Äôs still ‚Äúa blast‚Äù. See what I did there?
---
Wow. And people are even defending this? Still? Unbelievable.
---
Put it on display at your camp for a month then move your camp and sell it
---
I‚Äôm having a similar situation, but instead of endless loading my game crashes while loading. Are you on Xbox?
---
Same got to the last stage and frame rate lagged then it disconnect from server.  So annoyed it's in playable  
---
Going to try in private to see if it does the same.   So lost I'm not robbed of end rewards.   If their are any?
---
Ya. I have no idea what to do. Idk.
---
I paid 60 dollars for the game. I'm entitled to free content and cosmetics. That's what they promised. End of story
---
which name should i add and can u play later tonight?
---
I think a lot of people know this happens but would be surprised to know what calibre of company that resorts to it. That or they just don't want to admit a company they like might do it lol
---
Hmm might use some of that I havent heard of that one too much
---
this is not my experience in the 3 that I have done so far on PC
---
Bloodied Swing speed 90% board from a Queen drop is my "best-worst" roll
---
stfu shill
---
So a drunken gunslinger? Interesting
---
It's a camp item
---
Works pretty well I just never am able to get more than like 5 worlds worth then it just puts me on the same worlds lol
---
They did not promise free cosmetics lol
---
I know of at least one in the states that will open up a loophole. That would allow the Jack Thompsons of the world to point at any game, no matter how violent the content, and say it's for children. Because the bill sets a definition of a childrens game as any game a kid can get access to
---
Ah ok, cool
---
I roam with 2k rounds of 50 cal only. I dont kill sb very often
---
I'm not talking about an example of how to fix a borken game.  I'm saying they should be looking at people who are in the same dev-space and be paying attention to how they're running *sucessful* games.
---
Instead, Bethesda seems to be determined to ignore 15 years of lessons-learned to go and make the same mistakes other companies have already made.
---
They've done it with paid mods, with Bethesda.net, with the CC, with FO76, with this subscription crap.  All of it seems like they have no idea what's happening in their own industry.
---
Look at end game trading discords, places you trade legacy items. They all use 556 ammo as it doesn't have a 35k cap like caps do. Caps are worthless in this game for real traders, we've made our own currency just like how it was done in Diablo 2 where gold was basically worthless while high runes/sojs/"3/20/20s" were what was used at currency.
---
The private world's let you mass produce 556 at the ammo depot while afking. That is literally creating currency out lf thin air with zero danger.
---
Pretty much. Just a single action, booze, a mare‚Äôs leg styled lever action, and guitar sword called Johnny Guitar. 
---
Even set up a bar for him.
---
Not yet, but it signals they are gonna expand scouts eventually
---
Isn't this the same as blatantly lying about a product?
---
You haven't seen the flying unlimited ammo God moders? Youtube "beef_curtians hacking" you'll find tons of videos.
---
yeah thats kind of what your suggestion sounded like, thats just not how I see it. but disagreements happen, and one as civil as this is rare enough on any online forum, so I still consider this interaction to be a victory, even though nobody has changed their mind
---
I just met Martin as I was reading this comment haha
---
Bro it's a super useful item it's a gas mask with no -2PER
---
I think the fan base has already been soured a bit by the opposite.
---
27 minutes until the next halloween event
---
Why am I not SURPRISED?
---
I'm more a fan of 2's and 4's ... 3's couldn't make up their mind.
---
Might be an Xbox thing
---
My point was showing it existed less than a week ago.
---
Love it.
---
username checks out lol
---
what platform?
---
Oh ok gotcha. You would of thought they would of done that with the delay of wastelanders!
---
It‚Äôs more expensive in all other countries, to varying degrees. Tax and greed.
---
A lot of the scrap merchants have it, at least according to my friendslist, and so I am sure their will be some undercutting that will lower the price. I've already seen flux going for 80c a piece where a few weeks ago it was anywhere from 100-150.
---
Yes, drown out the concerns, you fucking shill.
---
So the subscription model is normal. There's no offline single player so it takes resources to maintain.
---
There is nothing wrong with my provider. I play many online games and I always have stable ping. It is usually between 35-45 (EU) but with FO76 I have no way of knowing (certainly feels way above 100). What I know is this game frequently fails to register shots and sometimes takes up to 10 seconds to load a simple terminal or a container. And it is certainly not because many people are playing it.
---
Its obvious we r the clown whether we like it or not
---
Fuck you Spacer's Choice. Monarch or nothing
---
I agree. Thank you for being open to someone else's views. A rare thing here on the net.
---
I actually saw him today took off from Freddy's to Whitespring one hour before first Mischief Event, I thought the event was starting at Freddy's and went there to check.
---
I guess it is a long travel XD
---
Well you can think it isn't p2w but nowhere in the definition of p2w dkes it state you have to get a win condition. Just that you get an advantage over the game/other players. Even a single player game can be p2w. Such as candy crush Saga elder scrolls blades.
---
Everyone is created equally.  What they do with that opportunity is up to them.  Lots of underachievers in the world trolling forums and griping because they are just generally not happy people.
---
Its laughable because your own admission of being a "shill" doesn't make it any more likely that it is occurring. It is also laughable because as others have pointed out, your post is providing *more* reason for people to dismiss anyone against popular opinion as shills. As if it wasn't already prevalent enough. 
---
 Also as I pointed out there are vast differences between typical CPG based products (which I would bet you were involved with) and entertainment software like a video game. Namely the product lifecycle. Despite claiming to support the game indefinitely, the market for the game is mature and will only further dwindle with every other newer game that comes out and I gurantee a massive company like Bethesda isn't in the dark regarding that. Hence my metaphor about Marvel "shilling" for movie reviews shortly before the film leaves theaters. Joke about Bethesda's incompetency aside they aren't new to this and aren't idiots when it comes to marketing. Regardless, if they were desperately trying to bolster sales think about just how many other avenues they have at their disposal to attract new potential customers- promotion via platform ads, commercials, social media ads, hell even a flat out cut in the price of the game or putting it on sale would be exponentially more effective than convincing people on reddit who have already made up their mind that bethesda and the game sucks. 
---
If you think they have a lot to gain by swaying the minds of a small (relatively speaking to their entire consumer base) and outspoken group who already made up their minds on the game, you are sadly mistaken.
---
An incredibly easy to fix mistake in a Bethesda game that'll probably take weeks!?
---
I'm shocked
---
Nope, look up "science tools". There are whole unique guns that are complete one offs.
---
Only downside is that it looks like a dirty thong
---
Sure there is always a tax difference but if companies like EA or Blizzard can manage to get that by leaving the price 1/to 1 I am sure Bethesda could too...
---
I think awareness of shills is fine but i still believe you can't accuse someone of being a shill without evidence since it's a kind of serious accusation, and i often get the feeling its used as an insult or just an excuse some people use to invalidate opposing opinions. People think they can tell who a shill is simply by if they defend or are ok with ( things they consider to be ) negative actions. But the thing is fans/fanboys have already been doing this for ages and i would expect their opinions could very much be similar to shills.
---
Personally, I‚Äôm a Rizzo‚Äôs man myself.
---
Can't stop me.
---
Can you share your platform and username so that more of us might enjoy your creation?
---
It's surprising here that stating the facts can get you downvoted for no other reason than people not liking the facts.
---
I don't look forward to what Bethesda has in stall for the future. Hopefully the mismanagement is limited to BGS Austin only but who knows going forward. I'm pretty sure the anti-consumer monetisation practices will likely carry forward as I doubt that's a studio-level decision.
---
That's what I have been talking about since launch. Maybe they can't fix it. Maybe the engine is just broken. Or maybe they have more important things to fix, like fixing 1st and Atom store issues in a few days because that is what is important to them, and crashing doesn't fall high enough on the priority list. That is what I have been complaining about since the start, but they never fixed it. So why should I give them more money? The fact is I shouldn't, and I won't, ever!
---
Then they are cruel bastards and I want that job title
---
Blizzard isn't always 1-to-1. Hearthstone has similar issues, though nowhere near the degree of price gouging as 76 has.
---
Great idea, I just think it should be a few flatwoods monster's controlling a bunch of tougher mobs though. A full scale alien invasion might be a little weird for most players
---
Yes! I‚Äôm on PC, ign is Mariekenna. 
---
I‚Äôm in the whitespring area 
---
For those who are on other platforms I can provide a link to a video I‚Äôve uploaded showing a simple walkthrough if requested as well.
---
My self as well to tell you the truth, not that I enjoyed there trouble but fighting against them was fun.
---
Yeah the Gutsies tear through your HP its so stupid then you have the Assaultrons...
---
Last Fallout game ended with number 2.
---
Nah, Bethesda isn't really in the business of actually making content anymore sadly
---
What do you mean
---
Clearly they are turning to their PR accounts. Don't give players a way to confront BGS and have fake accounts drown out the dissonance. When we calm down and feel disenfranchised, they'll show their faces again with happy smiles. Hand out one free event to make us grudgingly accept the state of the game, then repeat the process all over again.
---
Like they've done each time they screw things up.
---
It van happen,   in the middle of the night is when I have experienced it
---
Unless they have fixed it, you can join a private world if the owner is on your friends list and is online in a private world.
---
Or you join one of your friends who is in someone else‚Äôs private world.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox so I‚Äôm formally requesting a link to video! I love themed camps.
---
They're somewhat common now?
---
Not likely.
---
That was an Obama approved quote right there
---
Oof someone messed up with that jumpsuit lol. At least you got it and it didn't disappear forever
---
You canuse any bandana as gasmask. And most face mask too.
---
Bethesda is not going to post poll with hard numbers. Doesn't give them wiggle room to just make up what they want to.
---
You know, much like how the community gave the devs feedback on what we wanted or are saying that utility items are very popular but give no hard evidence or numbers that can be independently verified.
---
Theres plenty of disconnect in every department.
---
It should have been free as an actual full armor outfit similar to the garb of mysteries (Or pretty much any outfit armor in Fallout 4).
---
That way, Bethesda could have put a cosmetic variant on the Atomic Shop, as well as any additional skins for the cosmetic variant and functional armor.  This would have probably earned them more prospective buyers because since everybody can access it, there's more an audience for people to buy the Atomic Shop skins, and people requesting the armor would still have it for use.
---
[here you go! ](https://youtu.be/fTHnN2nzxEs) I know it‚Äôs nothing crazy, but I think it works well for what I had!
---
Ya! GTFO AR that we have now, no one likes you!
---
I only play wow and there the service or sub is almost 1 to 1 so I took that as a base. I would not even say anything if it where a bit off.. it's as tou said it. The price gouging is a bit too extreme especially if you count in all of the factors
---
What areas are you hanging around in?
---
Sounds like a broken game to me.. hmm surprising
---
How much is the jumpsuit worth? I got one
---
Hallowen is just Halloweens younger less popular brother
---
they have no power if its Zenimax pulling the strings. they could even be using this as a way to bump up stocks to sell the company and not give a fuck
---
You should not just follow the main quest line. Find some side quests n do events in the forest and toxic Valley and level up there before moving on. You should be around level 40 or 50 before completing the main quest
---
I think all the asylum outfits work
---
It‚Äôs shame whenever something good happens people assume it‚Äôs fake
---
I‚Äôm Xbox too, it would be nice to socialise more
---
After listening to it talk it feels more along the lines of Bumblebee from Transformers. The way he changes different voices from different sounding broadcasts
---
Bethesda MAY do what you say, but if they do, not everyone will feel negatively about it.  You have no facts to back up this conjecture.  Just stirring the poo pot.
---
This kind of thing happens a lot. The game is unbalanced. Get used to it, I guess.
---
There's just no way to positively enforce this. Also, Im not sure this counts as fraud because the reviews and comments are technically not selling you the product. At most it's against terms of service for the platform, but im sure a healthy donation would sway opinion there too.
---
It seems that they are releasing one reward per day!
---
so nuke it to ruin everyones game basically? and the majority is Fallout 1st yes? so nuke the event cause fuck fallout worsters?
---
5th time for me. Very disappointing.
---
Bruh, id rather have an AK-74 than an AR15 ngl
---
Don‚Äôt do the main quest until you‚Äôre over level 50.
---
I can't believe there was a lobster trap helmet and I missed it :(
---
The fireside tales event spawns a ton of bloodbugs which are good for acid.
---
Seems reasonably but I'm sure it'd be buggy and open to exploit somehow.  People always find a way.
---
Oof. You're one of those "true" Fallout fans.
---
No, the issue is he‚Äôs too low level to do the quest.  Any decent build can handle the main quest without issues if they are the correct level.
---
I feel like I'm the poor sod that got stuck on the electricity bike lol
---
my favorite mobile gaming bullshit that I've been seeing lately is having some obscure (probably fake) streamer person be HELLA excited to stream some bullshit-ass game that nobody in their right mind would stream since it's a mobile game
---
like come on, we can all see right through that shit. I guess it's better than the ones narrated by people speaking [English in this wacky accent that I have no damn clue where it's from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbPWitSTe2k)
---
You‚Äôll either get people who will give you good answers or people who will answer you upset with Bethesda telling you not to play...
---
Stick with the overseer mission and lvl up as best you can. 
---
You‚Äôll find and or build armor and weapons as you go and plans.
---
Nah, that's Moe the mole.
---
Haha. Thats a good one
---
It's a cringey and gross thing to do unless you first offered to return it to the original owner or gotten their blessing to trade it away.  They maybe could have used it on an alt character or sold it themselves.  Don't be surprised if they don't give you stuff in the future.
---
I always thought blocker was only applied if you were actively blocking, good to know!
---
I do not think it is fake; I think your account is used by brand ambassadors to raise the positive PR of FO76. Don't worry; it's already been logged. Feel free to move onto the next account. No amount of playing dumb will change that. Please consider getting a more honest line of work; you'll have less stress and feel better about yourself.
---
Wait, so I‚Äôm walking  around in lore-friendly Charleston PD riot armor, I‚Äôm suddenly a show off? But how?
---
Very cool
---
I am sure I am not unique but I‚Äôll share my build. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what I would name it... armoured parasite would be a good enough haha.
---
So I use a full set of experimental power armour With a vampire laser Gatling 
---
On the top of my head the key perks I have are:
---
Power user 
---
Batteries included
---
Stabilized 
---
All the heavy gun dmg ones 
---
One gun army 
---
Bullet shield 
---
So as long as I am firing on my victim (aka host) I don‚Äôt die- I actually barely take damage due to the vampire effect and the bullet shield. With the power user perk each fusion core at full gives me 999 shots- so to be honest I am almost never firing when in a fight. I‚Äôve sat I front of high level legendary mirelurk queens and laid fire as they spray acid all over me and I just chill and keep firing- my health meter barely moves. As long as I am feeding on the host I- the armoured parasite.. won‚Äôt die. 
---
I‚Äôve also taken multiple direct hits from assultrons during the Halloween event and laughed (as long as I am shooting)
---
To get caps, try to sell 1,400 caps per day to the vendor bots.  Kill stuff near a train station, loot all the weapons, walk over and sell them.  The real caps are made on your camp vendor, but most of that will happen once you are level 50+.
---
Seems that euros are worth less to them, for some reason.
---
More specifically a camp item that takes a pumpkin. You can find some to the North West at the farms near Vault 51.
---
This may surprise you, but I actually AM one of those middle people. I've had a lot of fun with the game since launch, and even bought some atoms here and there. I think Fallout 76 is a half-decent game that has a lot of potential that could be unlocked if they'd just give a shit about fixing it properly, assuming it even can be fixed. That said, Fallout First is abhorrent bullshit everyone should call out for the trash that it is.
---
I came unto this post expecting defensive arguments and personal opinions to justify this practice, but I honestly appreciate the level headed and unbiased interpretation, especially from a professional perspective. 
---
To me, that practice stinks of fraud, but very difficult to prove and argue fraud. Artificially inflating the positive review to affect sales is like the old snake oil salesman saying his tincture is the best in 15 counties. By the time you prove it, it doesn't matter.
---
Done it 8 times and crashed 3
---
Why are you trying to make this some sort of class war? It's really not that bad aside from the unlimited junk storage
---
State that then üòÇ or better yet, don‚Äôt even state that after the fact that it‚Äôs been fixed unless you also state it‚Äôs been fixed. You‚Äôre only adding fuel to the fire for no reason at all.
---
I had 1 x legendary scorchbeast in defense...
---
Certain areas have high level enemies. If you are seeing level 60+ you are not ready to enter that area. You are only level 16 so you should really be staying in the forest, ash heap or toxic valley and shouldn‚Äôt see that level with the exception of a few small areas. Gotta level up!
---
So, that makes you a furry then if you're fucking the kung fu panda, right?
---
Even a year on, people still can't really agree on how to rate the game in the first place: The review of F76 as a character-driven RPG franchise entry is very different from that of a general multiplayer survival title. Leading many people to view the "other" types of reviews as false/shills etc, further muddying the waters.
---
It's more durable than you think, but not that strong.  It keeps me on my toes.
---
You can't spend real money on weapons and armour (Thankfully!).
---
Levelling is by experience. You hit a hard limit by 50 but you need to keep levelling to get all the perk cards you need for whatever build you want to go for plus all the utility cards for crafting, repairs etc.
---
My advice is to take the game slow, explore everything as much as you can. Worst thing you can do is rush the game. If you explore each area in full as you go, you won't end up in a higher levelled area that you're not prepared for.
---
Also, for the early to mid-game, lean on melee to conserve ammo.
---
The rest you can work out as you play. Enjoy!
---
15-20K
---
You need like... what? 3 mil for it? Pretty sure one of the Ceo jobs offers like 250k clean. Plus I can sell my coke for like 500k, granted it's maxed out. Even more with double sales weeks, which happen prety often, and that's just Bikers. You can steal and sell cars and make like 100k profit per car, with up to 4 friends you can sell up to 4 cars, this of course also pays double when the right promotion kicks in, there's also gun traficking, when the warehouse's maxed you can sell it for 1.4mil alone, there's also club, it passively generates shit, so you just need separate running businesses, and it'll passively fill up with stuff to sell, there's of course special cargo missions, once sold a golden egg for like 300k. Double, when profits are doubled.
---
It's just funny, you know? People lack the will to make money, and just complain how everything's done. Fuck, my first business, marijuana plantation I just bought out of doing double cash week deathmatches and vehicle derbies. 90k a won match, with potential for more with right missions.
---
Not to mention the double cash doomsday heist. We've been doing that daily, and made like 20mil off that. Upgraded most of my shit, fully Upgraded Terrorbyte, Club, Opressor MK2, started to collect old time'y vehicles, cause I like the designs of em. :D
---
You know not about which you speak.
---
I'm just going to disregard rule 3. I'm going to wear that Ranger outfit as I please. Course I already do give out resources and aid.
---
Earlier i unlocked the AR skin, was doing the new event and blue screened when i got back i noticed there was a new challenge for getting 750 NW xp, i did that and it unlocked the 10mm skin.
---
Cant lie this is so unique I always hear of tanks but almost all are just wrecking balls or heavy gunners you instead turned that into litterally what you described. It's perfect and honestly feel like stealing that for a character cause sounds like a lot of fun.
---
Boy people spend caps on the dumbest things haha... I mean suit for sale get your suit right here!
---
We literally have voting machines in game. It would be cool to use them
---
It‚Äôs a drop in the event. Not worth that much anymore.
---
I think it's just that many atom shop items currently available aren't able to be placed in display cases fue to being outfits, a large helmet, etc.
---
So you actually think there is no reason to worry about leveled rewards? I've been putting off all quests.
---
Hmmm not really. It was worth around 10-15k before the event. I imagine alot less now with a major influx of rewards
---
I don't think you understood my question.
---
Lol good. they deserve it.
---
It's not the best choice, it's Spacer's Choice.
---
Nice!
---
Uh huh, cause bethesda hasn't been throwing gas on this dumpster fire for the last 6 months.
---
Sounds like you're rushing the game. Well, I say rushing but I mean following the game at the pace it wants you to go at, not the pace that you want to play it.
---
Slow down and explore the lower levels out more fully and hit up some of those side quests.
---
Also high level people entering into an area can affect the level of creatures in that area too.
---
&gt;lost it all in 1-2 years
---
Ill believe that when their next title doesn't sell an obscene amount of copies. Reddit doesn't represent the fanbase or even playerbase at large.
---
This is very true. There had to be seven of us fighting the legendary Sentry bot and it down somebody. We killed it and I walked away to revive the person and I ended up dying from a assaultron.  Been awhile since I died unexpectedly, it was a wierd but nice change in the events.
---
**[Liberty Prime hated that]**
---
New Vegas was amazing, 3 wasn't bad, and 4 was acceptable for the most part.
---
Don't forget to do feed the people for the canned meat stews 5% exp gain
---
I know people have different experiences in the game, I've never had to pay for cores and my stash has probably 20 in there from me just finding them or taking them from random PA frames I see around.
---
HAHA who just leaves cores lying around?  That's awesome, nice find.
---
I never got into WoW but I have played a few other MMOs so I get what you're saying.  My play style is kind of in the middle of it all. I used to play as a tank in Rift but for Fallout, I'm kind of just down the middle of it all.
---
I was looking to see if I had the Flamer plans that I could give you, but I dont.  I can build them, but I dont have any copies of plans.
---
Yeah, a lot of people here focus so much at the mechanics of the game but for me it's all about me just enjoying it.  Do what's fun for you, ya know?
---
Straight Jackets and Miners Claws sell pretty good I think. I get 48'ish caps for the jackets.  DONT SCRAP THEM lol
---
My sample size is too small to really say one way or the other.
---
I‚Äôm a pretty avid trader, and you absolutely can‚Äôt get one for under 15K unless the trader is clueless.  
---
If they are indeed dropping more, then you are right and the value will decrease. I got a clean ranger outfit today. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Helmet is available at Captain Kid's store.
---
FFS BETHESDA READS THIS!
---
You expect companies to eat your VAT? That‚Äôs absurd I‚Äôm sorry.
---
I‚Äôm not defending them, just explaining why.
---
In the handbook, there is meant to be a Zetan Captain or such. We definietly need more Alien/Flatwoods related events or such. God knows that the game content will go dry after Mischief Night.
---
Also, most quest rewards are easily outclassed by 2* weapons with decent rolls, just farm legendaries and if you aren't lucky you get a second chance at the purveyor
---
Thanks for destroying great universe that Fallout once was.
---
Ok, thanks though. I'll be grinding a lot to hopefully get one
---
There is.  CC items were *commissioned by Bethesda*.  BGS owns them and paid the modders for their work.  BGS then keeps all the money from CC sales - but, again, the people who produced what is in the store were paid for their work.
---
I hope no one thinks the creators are getting a percentage of the sales of the stuff in the CC store.  Bethesda was quite clear that things in there are done under contract as paid work-for-hire.
---
It honestly is- I have no trouble doing vault raids and I rarely if ever use a stim. I have gone a giant the imposter sheep and taken her blast full on and laughed (as long as I kept fire on her) 
---
I don‚Äôt know what else to test it on. The queen scorch beast does nothing to me. 
---
Fusion cores come easy from the power plants so ammo isn‚Äôt a issue
---
Can you describe some of the trends you tend to see? Would help us that don't have such insight determine a real review / comment from fake ones.
---
Nah I uninstalled. I will never trust another bethesda title again.
---
What event now is dropping them?  The Halloween one?
---
Ok! For those who send me friend requests,  they don‚Äôt show up for me right away so I may have to accept them later. I‚Äôll have my camp this way for a while though!
---
Why do you want to drop? You won‚Äôt be able to ever enter the bunker again
---
I just completed the pumpkin house daily while wearing the skull mask and skeleton costume. Didn‚Äôt count. I don‚Äôt understand?
---
Some would consider that an upside.
---
So lets start with my background. I have a doctrine in business administration and have about five teams of two people each. I'm part of a very famous company that I do not want to reveal the name of. My job is to simply vote up the business and discredit any negative reviews against it. I had over one hundred accounts and counting. We actually had a team that would create the accounts and another which would make the reviews. We also take part on reddit. For reddit it's more easy than you think, because all you got to do is write an emotional life changing story which convinced the product we are selling was actually worth the purchase. We too created conspiracies to make communities clash with one another for profit.
---
Not that I think about it, Ephphany047... aren't you in my database?
---
Oh you see how that works? You're full of shit and everyone can write the same crap, manipulate it, and turn it back on you. You think Bethesda gets bad rating and press because of some underground conspiracy which one company is all linked to? It's more likely that Bethesda poses as people like you and making these deceptive narrative.
---
Yes
---
Currently just slightly east of Flatwoods.
---
I mean...
---
You're right, but I don't like it
---
That‚Äôs cool.  I‚Äôd like another BoS jumpsuit.  All I got was a clean ranger outfit today.
---
When will people learn the ps4 is a piece of junk?
---
every single fucking bit of fallout 1st should be free. they already had the Gaul to release a half-finished half baked buggy glitch fest of a game. every single update is them making up for it!
---
NV as a spiritual successor yes. Good game tells the story of clash between cultures and civilization and shows actual progress of humanity in the world.
---
F3 is like F1 but I'm Bethesda version.
---
4 was a good game but terrible Fallout.
---
Thanks
---
Nope, my account is used by my self, an honest fallout 76 player who had a good experience, definitely something different from the bugs and negative people(I can‚Äôt blame them for their reasons) so as a result I wanted to share how I felt about my experience running into a really nice player. 
---
I wonder how many people have proof of people faking their encounters for a little bit of positivity, we have to take everything with a grain of salt
---
üò¥
---
So I need to grind for hours before being able to complete what is usually considered introductory content?
---
I think one of the major takeaways from my perspective is that is for one year. Once that time is up you gotta toss that money back at them again.
---
Gotta keep those Cryo pods running!
---
Was running a nuke zone at WS tonight when Mischief started in the pre-existing Blast Zone.  Everyone went to the event and I was able to collect more HRF's than I had ever seen, 21 in one run.
---
You know what buddy, I was just kidding. The "true" Fallout fan knows the game ended with 1. All those 4th wall breaking pop culture references were so gauche.
---
Get it, and find a good group of friends to play it makes the ok experience great
---
ill never understand how repair kits and such are pay to win. every time ive ever seen someone ask, they always get a super specific response about a super unlikely situation where they *might* be pay2win. Like its reaching super far.
---
Do events, explore, etc.  If the enemies are too high level, the game is telling you that you‚Äôre in the wrong area.
---
one item counts, either a hat or clothing
---
Yep froze at the last part on my second try.
---
What if you built at Wilson bros. Auto repair? It spawns low level scorched inside, but it looks similar to a fire station
---
No ofc not. But if you calculate it they charge more than what they would need to cover that. And that is not ok
---
I'm just slightly East of Flatwoods, not sure how any of this justifys a main story locked behind a massive grind, that part should always come after.
---
I‚Äôve gotten the sense that there were a lot of overpriced vendors out there and now that there‚Äôs more competition the general consumer is running into the more reasonable prices.
---
Bump for more visibility.
---
I think the rewards are booty, definitely some nice drops though!
---
There isn't a more leathery mask?
---
I wear a tinfoil hat with my power armour and it works
---
Yeah I know, sorry. I'm just a bit pissed with what they are doing üòÖ
---
I think i got my fallout halloween costume in order, just need a machete to finish it off
---
Not only do I crash every time, but then it takes several minutes to get back in!!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm6iyp/full_list_of_mischief_night_rewards_odds_of/
---
Do not need to pay for salt, Op is giving it for free!
---
They already do something like the scrap box for ESO subs (crafting bag), why would they change it?
---
Very neat idea but I‚Äôm also intrigued what letter is before that....‚Äùunt‚Äù üòÇ
---
Still better pop culture references than "le funny skeletons in funny poses" Bethesda fallouts.
---
Commenting to find out.
---
Yeah competition is good for consumers, bad for business. Let‚Äôs just hope no cartels form to try and get a control over pricing
---
6th
---
Bethesda is my Lord and savior. I am not a shill. Drink the Bethesda-aide.
---
I can‚Äôt really say why they did it this way, but that‚Äôs how it is. Once you complete the airport missions I usually focus on just leveling.  Find a good spot with supermutants to kill or whatever you like. 
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary or Graftin Dam are good spots I use.  I leveled a new character 1-30 in two days that way.
---
Once I hit 30-35 I‚Äôll start doing West Tek,   Harpers Ferry, Whitesprings, etc. The Halloween event is a good one to do right now every hour.
---
It says $13us for me
---
Xbox.  I'm done with this event.  Get your dhit together Bethesda!
---
I keep getting disconnected everytime I try to do the event
---
Apart from the lag on console it's good pretty fun ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
My frame rate drops, my lag is enhanced, my XBox is wheezing like an asthmatic, and I‚Äôm loving every minute of it. Honestly my favorite of the seasonal events thus far!
---
some say they're still fixing it to this day
---
&gt; Instead, Bethesda decided to put the container behind a paywall, despite it costing nothing on their end to maintain or implement. It's just another database storing the counts of the spam. I'm sure it can hold some special weapons and armor, but no way "infinite".
---
The locker will not accept item of any kind, it's for scrap only, which is least complex form of spam. Just change the value associated with a fixed list of component IDs for each player's loot box as scraps are added/removed.
---
Nor the ghost Sentry bot that keep attacking you kill the body!
---
Darn, I wish the other jumpsuits could drop too.
---
Gutsys are probably the highest damage enemy besides the sbq or mirelurk queen acid attack lol
---
&gt; Ill believe that when their next title doesn't sell an obscene amount of copies. Reddit doesn't represent the fanbase or even playerbase at large.
---
This. Everyone on here is very much a vocal minority. Skyrim's subreddit, for example, has more than 700,000 users but that's out of at least 30 million sales (as of 2016).
---
It says "Haunt" LOL
---
terrible rewards ... thanks bugthesda
---
I wonder if the Fireman outfit is the new hot drop? ü§î
---
Nah ps4
---
What about graffiti?
---
Same, 4 out of 5 times the event has crashed on Xbox and the one time I have been able to complete the round it was an event I joined near completion. Twice it crashed during the last phase right as the sentry bot appears.
---
I am not sure I would go that far.
---
&gt;and I only see them active here or r/fallout.
---
Well, some people only subscribe to various fallout  subs, like me. I only got a Reddit account when FO76 came out because I had never played an online multiplayer game before and I knew I'd need help. Um also old, grumpy and argumentative...but I'm certainly not a "paid shill" for Bethesda. Of course I guess that's exactly what a PR person would do! LoL. On the other hand, feel free to browse my posts, I think it's clear I'm "real". My point is, it seems like the most voracious anti-76 haters always seem to throw the "shill" word out as soon they start to lose the discussion..followed quickly by slurs and insults. There are a LOT of people that really do like the game, the severs were packed today. The Halloween event is fun and unlike anything previously done. It didn't matter if a person was a 1st subscriber or not, it was fun. I was on an adhoc random team with a gal from Britain,  a Pole living in Canada and a Yank from the Northwest.  To me, it was an exceptionally good time. Your mileage may vary!
---
This guy's job sounds like the 6ixers from ready player one.
---
I'm in XBOX and never have crashs. Tonight I've crashed 3 times. Twice during the holloween event.
---
Sign me up. You want my anal virginity as well?
---
Oh yeah, there's a Halloween event going on...
---
Not as severe but yes. I rarely get crashes, like once every two weeks. Have had 3 tonight.
---
I would.  That way all the rewards are max level.  I just do the quests up through the airport, and then I level in the wild.
---
Wtf are you smoking? Gamers will buy any bullshit that has the right logo on it. Maybe you won't, but there's a reason certain franchise keep getting released with the same complaints year after year.
---
&gt; If bethesda does ANYTHING, there's a dedicated group of individuals that will make it their life's mission to shit on it, and blow it so far out of proportion that some will think that Bethesda publically murdered someone.
---
says the moderator of r/AntiFO76
---
Now it makes sense. They keep hitting the legendary sentry bot while it has green mist and we only get 1 star sometimes not even legendary. They all want to get the kill first.
---
Some people would consider wearing a dirty thing on their face a feature and pay good money.
---
all non-cosmetic content, features &amp; DLCs, past, present and future should be free for all those who bought the game before the policy change
---
Why are people downvoting you, that's a perfectly valid statement, and judging by these comments the progression is just completely messed up.
---
just like this post we see a lot of complaining of complaining
---
No, the paranoid contagion of the r/fo76 community will look at every new feature as f1st
---
...I fucking knew this was happening. No one was listening.
---
I'm down
---
True, but is there a compelling reason to ever go back?  200 levels later and I have not found a reason.
---
I actually think you can't use explosive eeapons.  Too much for game to handle.
---
Do you think the people in youtube or social media doesnt think Bethesda is doing a pretty poor job?
---
Probably the rush of players with the event.
---
pahahahaha what
---
Same.  I feel like I wasted my whole evening...
---
Junkies commando
---
not even most Americans can speak English lol
---
I use one for Encyptid when the sheepsquatch decides to chase after me. I can tank her and the pylons until I have to reload.
---
Think the fixer holds that spot now
---
I am not a melee player, but that would be pretty damn cool.
---
Fight the good fight brother. Take it all the way to judge Judy if you have to.
---
No you get that in the Atomic Shop
---
 Combat Knives are my binky. I have 3 main ones, all +40% speed and I am very stealthy indeed.
---
 Few things more fun than murdering Harper's Ferry, taking very little damage and wandering down to visit Wallace with an ass load of Assault Rifles. 
---
 I have put on the X0-1 and done Nuke Zones but I kill stuff so fast everyone hates me, so I don't. ;)
---
Yeah thats why i said vocal *minority*, and I said *slowing* not preventing. There's certainly more resistance than i can see in other industries
---
That will be 1000 atoms
---
Watch out, we gotta...
---
Like I said, get used to it.
---
Agreed. The event is exactly quite fun. Unfortunately the rewards are a bit, meh. How is there no pumpkin head. Maybe a sheeted ghost costume would be hilarious, a Frankenstein or werewolf outfit.
---
Even like a flatwoods monster, or thing from the black lagoon/mirelurk could fit well into the law (the posters)
---
Yikes.
---
It does, but the Handmade has some advantages still, a larger mag and  I feel it has a bit less recoil.
---
I‚Äôm just gonna leave this here

---
Thousands, maybe.
---
Just pray you don't get a scorchbeast reclaim mission
---
From you it‚Äôs free tho. I only get like 1400 atoms a month
---
Have you read the Mueller report.. shills doing more than marketing to us. Internet and social media need some rules and regulations.
---
You tried uninstalling and reinstalling on your PS4?
---
Oh, unless you're some high level lawyer with hundreds of positive cases, I don't think Bethesda will be too worried about a mouthy console player.
---
What if he wants the game to improve?
---
I hate it so much.  I hated in in FO4 and the first mod I always installed was a replacement model for it, then the 10mm pistol, they are too damn big and fugly!
---
OMG, not only are all the in-game npc's robots, so are the tech support.
---
it's called fraud
---
About tree 'fiddy.
---
How is being able to repair on the fly without uncrouching not an advantsge? Especially when survival was still a thing.
---
Am wearing skull mask and clown outfit
---
But yet every other game is fine?
---
I‚Äôm mad at what Bethesda is doing but I‚Äôm still gonna play the game, I just don‚Äôt like what the creators are doing, plus don‚Äôt bash fallout 1st ppl if they wanna waste money on something that should be free let them do it
---
Lol. Sounds about right
---
Skull mask in PA with helmet removed. Works
---
&gt; lucky enough 
---
you mean, dupe-buying scumbag?
---
You can try Morgantown High school, sometimes they are there and you'll get loads of plastic for your time.
---
Goddamn Loch Ness Monster
---
Probably a lot.  You dont have to display the icon or use the items.  I bet there are tons of closet fo1sters
---
Tanagra Town is full of cave crickets. Kill, server hop, repeat till full of acid.
---
That was like 11 months or so ago. Get over it.
---
&gt; I highly doubt the game was that good.
---
Speaking of video games in particular this is why I love Let's Plays and other YouTuber content. You can see the game in action before you buy.
---
Enough to ruin this game, as well as the entire gaming industry while also speeding up global warming and finishing off every single endangered species.
---
Got to give them something
---
Your school newspaper doesnt care
---
Vampire's FFR Plasma Flamer is also quite nice!
---
Lol. Roasted!
---
I guess but I don't consider any of the rewards that worthwhile end game.
---
Go home Todd, your drunk again...
---
Junkies has become very popular lately
---
Thanks for being patient with me I searched and saw other people asking the same question
---
Ive crashed 3 or 4 times now completely missing rewards as well.
---
Dude a Flatwoods monster outfit would be so dope!
---
I died at the end of one and  was stuck in the death animation.
---
I use a vampire laser gat. No problem with ammo as I just take the power plants on my private server and I never use stims.
---
Anything is possible thru the power of Christ. But youll probably need several highers to carry you thru the event. Just stay out of the way cause nobody will save you....except Jesus of course.
---
Or I could just delete the whole game and move on...like I should. I guess.
---
Definitely, you don‚Äôt necessarily have to engage the bots. With this kind of event it‚Äôs going to pull in a lot of higher level players. Let them handle the bots. Be ready to stimpack anyone you see down and others typically will get you when you go down too. Light the fires, and blow up the cars. Easy peasy.
---
Lol
---
I enjoy the game, never said I didn't. But I am not happy about how they spend our money. Removing free survival, adding premium private servers and kicking Wastelanders into who knows when, well... those are too many dick moves, considering some bugs are older than the game, which still behaves like a beta, sometimes.
---
I run similar. Instigating PA Attack Damage power Fist, Van Cav armor. Since running attacks count as power attacks that initial hit will one shot most things. Also First Aid, Field Surgeon and Born Survivor to stay topped off and maximize Vanguard without having to stop swinging/sprinting to self heal.
---
They won‚Äôt care about that either.
---
Oh no not the dreaded YouTube and social media outrage. Im sure they'll miss a couple thousand dollars from the people who actually don't buy their stuff out of the millions that they'll make from the people who do. Hey remember when social media freaked out about Battlefield 5 but it still sold 7.1 million copies? And im pretty sure that's just physical sales. Hey remember when Reddit lost their shit about SWBF2 lootboxes but it was still EAs most profitable business year ever with them making **5.1 billion**?
---
The people who you see being "angry" about this kind of shit often do not represent even close to a quarter of the playerbase.
---
that isnt very civil..
---
so you're killing ghouls by irradiating them?
---
Would try but can‚Äôt even play the game. Keep losing server connection
---
Okay. That's damned funny!
---
Epic, thanks!
---
Blocker and rad protection Is what you need. Maybe try a hazmat suit and see if you are really weaker.
---
So you used a product for a total of one minute and made up your mind to get a refund? 
---
Really?
---
Just enough.
---
Plenty of comments on here have asked how to find players who purchased 1st.  Goal was/is to target those players specifically simply because they bought it.
---
extra life is a scam, look up how they spend their money
---
At least $12.99.
---
So what's the lore on th-- bahahaha I can't hold a straight face
---
Private servers, I'm not really sure. 
---
I hear that 1st players can display something on their profile that makes them stand out.
---
I told him to keep his power armour on.. ugh
---
How could I forget? I suppose that issue is a little less clear cut though. Does rockstar not address it because they are technically incapable? Too cheap? Or because getting griefed by cheaters also encourages mtx purchases? Lol *tinfoil intensifies*
---
I haven't done the main quest on my alts because I can't stand the thought of suffering through her inane chatter and grating voice again.
---
It's the real cap sink in the game!
---
Sweet thanks, I didn‚Äôt see any task to equip a costume so I think I‚Äôm in the clear
---
It dropped for me as well. Wonder if there are more?
---
Shocking that a business would do that.
---
I've counted I thing four posts from people asking how they can find 1st players so they can hunt them down.  One guy recently trying to justify it.  I wont pay for it regardless, buying in-game content is just something I normally never do.
---
There's a Halloween public event going on for the next 7 days I believe. Some Vault Raid(s) you can do. A battle royale. Become a Boy/Girl scout and thats pretty much it (probably forgot some stuff) aside from the normal trading from player vendors farming legendaries etc
---
Having a dedicated playerbase with good games gives more money than unfinished games with microtransactions every 2 steps and losing most of the fans.
---
When Driver 3 came out (or Driv3r if you're criminally stupid.) The internet was just becoming something everyone was getting. Even during that time, Atari (the publisher at that time, though they were actually just infogrames just rebranded.) hired pr firms to go into various game forums and shill for the game super hard. The posters eventually sussed them out as working for Babel Media.
---
Anyone who thinks this isn't happening now that the internet is ubiquitous is a fool, or previously mentioned shill.
---
Except ESO didn't repeatedly lie to its fanbase and monetize things big gameplay advantages after stating the game will only sell cosmetic microtransactions. There is zero reason to trust Bethesda anymore since they selling microtransactions with better and better gameplay advantages. Just look at where we started with repair kits to where we are now.
---
If that is the goal I think they really fucked up. Stocks prices are about the confidence investors have in you, moreso than how much you're actually bringing in. Hurting goodwill will not boost your stock value.
---
I'm on mobile right now, not going to go through a bunch of videos just to prove to you that you can put them on your favorite radial like any other consumable.
---
So, how much ***is*** Bethesda paying you to post this? :P
---
Non-disclosure should be a criminal offense. Wild West of the internet out here with all this bullshit
---
I aint givin u no tree fiddy u goddam loch ness monster

&gt;ff14 level recovery

Perfect they should do a Reborn and nuke Virgnia
---
Bethesda paid thousands upon thousands of dollars to run market research in NYC for 76. Probably like $100-150k
---
Hm that wasn‚Äôt what I remember from eso+, has it always been that way? Where you get the dlcs for free if you have eso+?  Orsinium, Morrowind, Elsweyr were free for ESO+ subscribers?
---
Fun fact they're not a consumable. They're in the MISC category :)
---
You never even played the game did you? You're just another troll with unsubstantiated claims.
---
Who are the pro-consumer shills with a sincere interest in negativity? 
---
A sincere interest in positivity and shilling are mutually exclusive concepts. EA Gamechangers get perks rather than money, but their enthusiasm is hardly sincere.
---
To reiterate on your first comment, it's other companies who might have vested interest in a competitor's demise. Pro-consumer shill is quite the oxymoron.
---
Sounds like a pretty nice little chunk of content to hold me off until wastelanders!
---
Rofl never played the game? Check my post history, I've probably given away more legendaries than you've ever found. Adorable:  https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d608ae/always_check_stashes_in_the_world_never_know_what/
---
Well yeah, but it also means you aren‚Äôt going to get destroyed trying to do them at level 16.
---
There was a L10 in the one I just finished....  the L250s+ with him melted the legendary before I could even aim at it...
---
Just got it from the event, it‚Äôs pretty good
---
Fair enough. I think I'll try to get another harpoon  and do what u said, or maybe make other compensations. Thank u!
---
There's a ton of stuff to do. The event right now is really fun! Mischief for sure, but rewards are meh. A lot events have been fixed, you get notifications when events are up. Fast travel to large events free, other still cost caps. 
---
Scorchbeasts can be legendary now! Did you do any Sheepsquatch quests? Biv? Visit the refinished Capital building in Charleston? 
---
Sorry if you've done any of those already.
---
You still haven't proven that you can favorite them. Funny that your cursor is in the exact same spot every time for every screenshot, even funnier that you didn't show a picture of the cash register with the things in them, the background to that photo is the floor at the purveyors train station. 
---
Try harder troll.
---
That explains why I got 1 star legendaries in Mischief Night both times.
---
Of course, this is better than getting no legendary at all, which will probably happen if I try to wait, due to everyone killing the thing in about 10 seconds.
---
the BF and i just tried this event together today and it looks SO fun but yes, it crashed for us :/ right as i blew up a car it froze and we both got dumped out of the game. We will prob try it again tonight.  we play on xbox one
---
Will do. Thx!
---
900% sure blizzard is on this right now. Since the HK stuff their posts I see in popular have probably quadrupled
---
I've seen a post one where someone wants to remove 1st people to any world the person is in
---
Thanks, I hope it keeps peoples interest for more than a couple days.
---
Good to know thanks.
---
Go back and play it friend
---
If it‚Äôs anything like Fasnacht and Meat week, people will be active until the very end üòÅ
---
The icon that says 1st can be a giveaway, but I feel like you'd only use that one if you wanted to be bait
---
Look at this dumbass enlightened centrist Bethesda shill.
---
Ayt. "We the community". Guess your not apart of it lmao.
---
Yeah that makes you an idiot.
---
If you buy Fallout 1st you won‚Äôt have more issues ;)
---
Private Servers worth the money No jagoffs
---
How does that work? Everyone buys the game once, then they make no more money? Lately microtransactions have made more money than just selling a game ever could
---
Now I know you're just a liar the mouse moved, you can see comparing any of the different pictures. Yes I moved a few feet over to the stash after finding all those in the register next to the purveyor. Why wouldn't I go and stash them? Are you so bad at this game you don't even realize about the hard cap weight limit? 
---
Jesus, Bethesda needs to hire better shills that at least know the mechanics of the game. Lmao
---
I'm not saying no microtransactions, I'm saying give a crap about the product you release.
---
I mean that's good and all.  Saw that as well just a few minutes ago the aftermath is good after the radiation goes away and it's safe to go in but being nuked in the middle of an event and forced to evacuate before receiving rewards is not.
---
Ah, rightio then, just didn't seem too clear that's what you meant
---
Nope, it's very real! Just on the opposite side of the state.
---
The Whitespring Jumpsuit (caddy) is on the 'Good' rewards list above at number 20. The fireman outfit is on the same list. So you could get those outfits as well as the pirate or the suits on the same round as they occupy different reward slots.
---
That works pretty well!
---
ü•∫‚òπÔ∏è
---
I haven't checked R&amp;G yet I will have a look there ty.  I did check sunnytop they didn't have them but I found other plans I've been seeking so a win either way!
---
Yep.  So far it's crashed 2 times out of 4 for me.  I'm on XBox.
---
Like seven. I use weapon reduction armor three pieces for 60% reduced weight. You can get it up to 90% for all weapons and never have to worry about wasting perks again just armor slots
---
Yes, it's definitely gotten more popular over the years!
---
Vocal minority is just another way of saying I‚Äôm going to stick my head in the sand and ignore what is happening around me.
---
It's all good, I didn't think it was you downvoting tbh. Generally random *I dont like that* type peeps as they are passing by.
---
I get your point but legacy items wouldn't go for caps or ammo though. Both those things can be ground out (in public or private). Those top items are purely swap deals for other legacy or top draw legendary items and that's a terrible deal if somebody really does give away something legacy for something grindable (IMO).
---
I absolutely agree that the subscription enables a few things that are very pay to win (or convenience or however we want to summarise it) but I maintain the comparison with GTAO shark cards technically doesn't work. They are very different pay to win aspects. GTAO lets you directly and instantly have access to whatever you want by paying real money. The FO subscription, as much as it pisses me off, doesn't do *that*. Maybe not *yet?* I dunno. I really need a Vampires Sentinel left leg and right arm. I can't buy those. I suppose there's an aspect of that with the atom shop (you can grind or pay) but they still aren't the same. in GTAO you can buy a better car and a tank right now. In FO76 you can buy a scrap bot or some wall paper for your camp.
---
Sorry that's a bit long, hope it makes sense.
---
I like the idea but people annihilate it almost immediately so if I don't get my hits in, I get nothing. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Steel is the hardest to get so if you dupe 50k worth or steel with 0 weight in stash space. Yeah I‚Äôd say ammo is extremely easy to make
---
I still play Fallout 4 regularly, and if there's one thing they did better in 76 than 4 its the vanilla graphics. 4 may be a better overall game, but 76 looks nicer out of the box, in my opinion, and from most reviews as well from memory.
---
You‚Äôre not seeing a lot of private world players tonight because there‚Äôs an event (you should try it) that greatly favors large teams.
---
I subscribed for the year. Only used the private server once. Prefer being on a populated server
---
Until you realize 16 bucks worth of atoms ain't worth jackshit.
---
That suit. Tommy Pumpkins. You all see it, right?
---
and you Dont have to Pay for it..
---
Legacy items absolutely get traded for 556 that is the main currency for them:  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Meercat76/comments/cyv629/ps4_h_caps_and_556_w_legacy_weapons/
---
Change meercat with market to get link to work.
---
No problem.  Just be warned. I am not kidding how melee hit detection is total garbage. [here's](https://streamable.com/nc503) an example of just how bad the hit detection is. If you get frustrated easily i don't recommend melee.
---
I'm like 90% sure that if they add npc companions (immortal packmules) with wastelanders, they will be a fallout first "member" exclusive.
---
I'd suppose so! However imma find some sauce for obscure reference!
---
You mean all those comments on Facebook ads saying ‚Äújust ordered mine, so excited‚Äù or ‚ÄúI love it!‚Äù aren‚Äôt legit??
---
People, like me, who aren't or never have been pr shills that still think positively of Bethesda?  The point was never about saying they are liars or you being a liar, it's that our differing opinion is disregarded as a pr shill simply for disagreeing. 
---
Side note, bitch move on your part. You are happy to be compensated when it benefits you, but now you jump at the opportunity to throw them under the bus?  Cowardly.
---
I‚Äôve done 7 events. Got Whitesprings Jumpsuit once and Fireman Outfit once. Also Pirate Costume (my fave so far)! Looking forward to more days grinding this one!
---
A letter to those who support the directions and decisions of Bethesda on Fo76:
---
 I'm glad your enjoying your experience of the game. I mean no I'll will by it. And I'm sure many people or the less than average person has been enjoying it as well.  It's just funny to see that when something controversial around the game hits that people with concerns get smashed the downvote and you see a immediately mass posting about "everyones good times" getting featured out of the blue as if trying to mask the controversy.
---
Also as a off topic to all the comments now comparing Fo76 to GtaO: I was never trying to compare the state of the paywall between the games. ( I mean guys, they have flying cars lmao).
---
The two states of the paywall is way to argumental and fundamentally different in how both studios proceed and execute there style of in-game microtransactions.
---
(BACK TO FALLOUT 1ST)
---
Only that for a 100$ additional purchase it seems we are getting another incomplete product with a lack of substance/Information and a Roadmap of what exactly can be expected within the development of this feature. 
---
 If we are looking to compare it to another Server hosting game let's try DayZ (A game that's been around 6 years and just got ported to console).
---
And supports player owned servers and Is currently a thriving community. 
---
Again thank your for everyone's feed back, regardless of "sides" people are taking. If theres anything I say that I hope reaches everyone is that I hope we can be given the tools to all come together so that we can support this cough* super mutant corpse of a tile* cough*.  (Bad jokes still?)
---
No. But seriously. Let me mod my server damnnmit. Give me- Us something we can look forward too and be proud of owning. 
---
Btw. I pre-ordered the power armor addition and never tried to return my game. I still have hope. And I hope You can too. 
---
END LETTER....lol
---
Ps. Didn't check any of my spelling so yolo.
---
Wait a minute, y'all are getting paid for this?
---
Wastelanders will probably cost 40-80 bucks, but it'll be free with a (active) fallout first subscription. ESO anyone?
---
\&gt; I would post positive reviews about the company‚Äôs products, and contest / discredit negative reviews. 
---
this should be illegal.
---
If you want to see it that way that is on you, I see it as more support and content for a game I love.
---
The last one I did featured a guy with an explosive gatling plasma.  I don‚Äôt know how many cores he blew through, but he did not let off the trigger once. Just marching forward with tiny stops during reload. I admired his enthusiasm.  I think he was also shouting stuff in Greek.
---
FFS the degree is COMMUNICATION, no ‚Äús‚Äù.
---
I like how the vote counter refuses to stay negative, the instant you downvote it jumps back up to 0.
---
I crashed twice during the event. Friend crashed once. Also on Xbox. 
---
The game's framerate has been abysmal, and button prompts for things like bonfires and  forks are taking way too long to register.
---
The entire event has been a disaster.
---
They already have the non-subber's money, why should they give a damn about what they want.
---
Any diseases in the game though? :p
---
yeah, I can't imagine getting 14000 overseer EXP to get the final reward; glowing skeleton outfit.
---
Fuck Fallout 1st.
---
Same thing happens everywhere. 
---
Movie/TV reviewers are all just paid shills or threatened with limited access to early screening if they dont give a positive review - Just look at Rotten Tomatoes.  5 star praise for Batwoman?? Yeah, that's legit.
---
Yeah okay but I am mad at bethesda right now and he said bethesda = bad, and you didn't so I believe him and you are just a shill. 
---
/s if it wasn't obvious.
---
Very easy to enforce.  If against the law then a business can not be legit and hire school kids to do fraud for min wage.
---
yeah i have given up. watching grubby play reforged beta atm lol
---
Maybe it needed to be worded better than. What did you mean?
---
On a related note I wished we could use the scout mask with hats. I wanted to wear one with a military beret.
---
I have yet to give actual criticism of the game. I haven‚Äôt participated in the negative toxic criticism other then taking away the ability to destroy bases when ever one would like. Even then I‚Äôve never made a post because it breads more toxic people jumping on the hate wagon. What does me being a trader have to do with me being tired of the constant criticism that people spew 24/7?

A company exists to make money. Not all the money ever. And they don't have to stomp on their fans and customers to do so.
---
Yikes is right, admitting to shilling then attacking what is basically a whistleblower on shilling calling them a shill.
---
This is some Advanced Bullshit right here, please take my downvote and go back to your 'very famous' company, it's clear you're a sick person who lacks a conscious.  Get help you sociopath and pray your company never gets linked to you, not unless you like the unemployment office.
---
His musket? Pfff my granny used to do drive bys on horseback with a musket just fine...
---
I updated my post to properly provide a response to this exact comment and private messages I've been recieving from people claiming this game is blessed and a masterpiece.
---
 I'm glad you and few others are enjoying your purchase and I hope that the future development suits what you enjoy in the game. Genuinely mean this, never meant to start a huge argument around who supports the game and who doesn't. I enjoy this game in moments but find my overall time unsatisfying personally. Which is a shame to me as I have roughly 700h hours in the game and pre-ordered the power armor addition. My best friend and I only ever wished to be able to enjoy a fallout game together and we got that but with such amounts of disappointment overall. (We have had a fair amount of "good moments"). But again like stated before, I find theres constantly more negative them positive.
---
If you have unlimited scrap space, what are you going to do with the scrap? Sit on 4k lbs of cloth when you'll never use it? I get people wanting camp space expanded from 800 to 1000 (I think that's the general opinion) but most of the junk is either very easy to get so why save it, or it's a little more rare and therefore hard to hang on to in the first place. So really, why would anyone need unlimited scrap space? Again, I'm all about expanding the limit, but scrap is basically data and data takes up hard drive space on the servers.
---
Take your time with the overseers missions, explore and grind. People tell you to scrap, they‚Äôre dumb. Sell everything you don‚Äôt use until you figure out what you like, then scrap for mods. I‚Äôm lvl 149 and haven‚Äôt beat the game yet.
---
Doesn't work, sorry
---
An unspoken weapon, using fans as scapegoats to cover up shill behavior.
---
The entirety of the situation reeks of corruption and fraud.
---
Then what would be the point of it.
---
Brand ambassador account is obvious brand ambassador account. Marked; move onto the next one.
---
Don't think they do, the same bug happens with the vertibot platforms; you can't loot those grenades either
---
Following....i left about 8 months ago.
---
Done it 6 times already havent crashed once
---
Dry bones dude. Clack clack clack clack.
---
Or the functionality will lag like hell (like it does when you press buttons in v94) rendering the elevator potentially useless. People tend to play with marsupial anyway, why bother waiting half a minute for that crap if you can just jump to the next floor?
---
Hey look, this reads like a shill trying to out a whistleblowing shill.
---
Why don't you share some personal information first?
---
I‚Äôve seen it. It looks dumb üòÇ the rounded corners leave gaps in the door frame
---
I would feel bad for them....if it wasn't their job
---
As much as I hate the concept of a subscription for an unfinished game, I agree so long as they promise to allow more customizability with private servers and not to lock any content behind paywalls
---
yes , i am from Egypt , ISP is Orange DSL .also i played the game for awhile before it  had been disconnected , reached lvl 30 i guess
---
Pretty sure people are downvoting my post to keep it at 666? I'm with it lol
---
Weird. I‚Äôve always gotten them within seconds of purchasing
---
Can you even read?
---
The two identifying marks of a shill response in this thread:
---
1) Attacking OP's credibility (negative posts like this one are also shill posts!)
---
2) Citing lack of proof as a defense (these forum rioters will call anything positive a shill post smh)
---
You mean [David S. Pumpkins?](https://youtu.be/rS00xWnqwvI)
---
Good luck. Probably one of the most rare items in game.
---
&gt; At the same time, wouldn't other companies do the same to discredit products from rival companies?
---
No because that would be easily proved libel
---
The patch notes 14 stickied thread has this going on right now, go downvote it, refresh the page immediately, within three seconds the vote count will be back at 0.  Better none than negative, eh Bethesda?
---
Fallout 76 best game ever!
---
lol
---
actually i like the game of late i compare it to the Washington Metro it has MAJOR issues but i like it lol
---
and no one is surprised
---
You got the reference!
---
You should be grateful it‚Äôs a honour to be stolen from by Bethesda
---
It doesn't matter what they say or do. You will all continue to support them anyway. Stop acting like their silence made any difference.
---
Fucking yup.
---
have noticed it does seem there is more lag in regular servers then solo in your own private one.
---
I don't know about that but if it's true good for you however personally I want to play the game without spending money(I mean I already spent enough on it pre-ordering it full price when it first came out) I want to earn items rather than buying them.  It's more satisfying earning them that way. Maybe I'm wrong but I feel a lot of players feel the same way.  To each their own I suppose.  But as far as the topic at hand goes there's an issue with dying and being unable to respawn.  Thankfully it's only happened at the end of the event and I still got the rewards. But it happens a lot.  (On PS4 btw)
---
I've been disconnected 4 out of 6 times
---
I‚Äôm with you brotha
---
I'm glad I backed up menu videos everytime I replaced these with something else like the modded ones from fo4. Now I got both from the release and from WA update to choose from if I get nostalgic of the times when the game was in a community-paid beta state.
---
Oh wait, it never left that state...
---
Kewl
---
Release the server code!
---
Sounds like Marketing's version of MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction.
---
this is intents
---
Does it though? If that were the case wouldn't EA have gone out of business a decade ago?
---
Wearing tinfoil hats and extreme paranoia.  You have no proof whatsoever that there are "shills" making phony posts praising the game.  It's pure conjecture.
---
They've created a community that thinks fallout 1st was a good idea and all the negative press is just a bunch of shills. The denial is unreal and actually concerning.
---
The atom bonus will keep people around
---
Low level workshop/camp turrets also suffer from the same bug now.
---
It must be a hard one for the devs to fix ( for some reason ). From their point of view more trouble than it's worth ( ? ).
---
Maybe Bethseda can get back to me on this one and tell me the reason.
---
And they should because people keep buying it.
---
Warning, fix may not actually fix thing, and may in fact make thing slightly or significantly more broken.... No refunds.
---
She hasn't answered anything in 12 days
---
Great ideal, make it a DLC for another $100. We are asking for this.
---
It's definitely something to see!
---
You better apologize right now or my uncle Todd is gonna remove all the atom from your account and my friends uncle Pete will delete your save files.
---
I'm not being slaughtered. I'm being given caps by toxic poor people who cant afford Fallout 1st.
---
Why wouldn't this be considered false advertising? Many people bought the game under the premise that ant DLC would be added without purchasing them.
---
it's not one sided https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dnhezy/hey_mods_can_we_add_im_salty_about_fallout_1st_to/
---
In English and not abbreviations, what the hell is this bug?
---
Ya man for real dawg
---
Why? So we could never get them?
---
Except that money isn't translating to support and content for the game.
---
That mask is hella rare. You better add a 1 and two 0s in front of that offer.
---
There is one at the ws station. Its really not that far of a walk.
---
No, because there aren't a lot of Halloween rewards from the event, and because some of the items are part of the event so you would assume you'd unlock them via the event. And what do you mean by "never get them" you could get them by doing the event.
---
Oof. Someone's salty.
---
This is a wonderful idea.
---
I've done the same thing the program is called Microsoft rewards. It's pretty good you earn points when you search with Bing, for earning achievements in certain games, buying stuff from the MS/Xbox store and other things. I've gotten 3 years of ultimate and a bunch of games using gift cards from it.
---
I was wearing a Park Ranger uniform!
---
Why would I be salty I‚Äôm a proud member of the fallout 1st community
---
There are two win conditions if previous posts about it are correct. Completing the event in costume will grant the extra reward which gives better stuff.
---
LOL. Everyone is a shill now after that post on shills.
---
fantastic! a (something like this/bbq/fashnacht/mischief) every month would be super duper cool!
---
Reddit is overall filled with shills. Go check the main political/news subs. 99% of the comments are bots/shills.
---
Used to be a lot rarer. But I still have only seen one or 2 out of everyone ive interacted with. No plans avalible makes it even more so. 
---
Im still getting through my extras of the base drops from fasnaught
---
As someone who played fasnacht  almost a hundred times and sheepsquatch about 40. I dont share your optimism for reward drops. Big difference between rare and they just arent dropping. This event so far getting nothing but practice pumpkin plan and civil war hats.
---
True, but the event ends in front of the main entrance, and most people go inside at least once during every nuke run.
---
It would be nice to be able to walk in and scrap/repair/sell/scrip everything in one spot. We can already do 3 out of 4, I'm just asking for the inclusion of the one vendor (as it were) that isn't included inside the building.
---
"The scrap box is just a UI issue. No one is actually losing their junk."
---
Several posts today on it. Jack o lantern skins for 10mm. Combat armor, shotgun, combat rifle. Few others. 1 a day.
---
I was given an impromptu ticker tape parade by an undiscovered tribe of Fallout poors. As I haughtily traipsed through their fields, they all bowed, and proclaimed me their chieftain, for I could afford the $8 a month, that none of those penniless whelps could. 
---
It's good to be king.
---
So instead of earning a rare item through playing the game you want to earn it through a microtransaction shop?

My favorite Reddit post of all time.
---
A fault with private servers I died as I killed the legendary bot when it exploded it glitched me out so I couldn't re spawn so no reward or able to loot body..   It won't let me re join the server I was in it searches a new server.  so a total waist of time and bullets...   Wtf Bethesda can we have some thing that just works for once.. PLEASE
---
I have one I can give you if you're on ps4
---
Fair enough. Just a difference of opinion really. I hardly go in the ws resort anymore. Mainly because I have a majority of the plans. 
---
Guess everyones route is different though
---
Todd Howard runs Bethesda Games Studios, not Bethesda as a whole. If these piss-poor decisions are indeed coming from the top, they are most assuredly not coming from him.
---
Lol. Keep digging bro.
---
Could be worse, for the level up while lists to be lvl 20 and below while at a workshop. They want low lvls to claim workshops so they can be killed in pvp! Also dang I miss the lvl up once for a daily challenge instead of this bs like lvl up while crap.
---
If we take them at their word though that means bethesda would have to ban the remaining 10 people that play the game lol
---
What‚Äôre you on? I‚Äôm on Xbox one x and 4 looks leagues better than 76. I think the characters and textures in 4 have more detail than 76, but it could just be opinion
---
Just the team. And you in any costume apparel.
---
I'll tell you one thing, every camp I visited tonight had a scrap box.
---
There was blame on both sides*does the hand motions*
---
I just want the dang NW rewards, without having to log in every day.
---
Personally would prefer just scrapbox for free or lower subscription to 5 dollars a month and only give 500 atoms.
---
Did they change that or something? I remember back when I first played I built a red rocket tower in my buddies camp and he didnt own it.
---
I'm on PC and can run both completely maxed, there is a noticeable difference between the two
---
Ideally id like them to fix their RNG but thats not happening. So yes because it be the only way i could get it without dedicating 20 hours plus to replaying the same mind numbing event and having no guarantee of getting it.
---
 Im not getting 7500 xp in NW for that skeleton costume. Thats literally a 20+ hour commitment for the average player. Thats batsh*t insane to me.
---
I hope  bethesda waits a few years before releasing loot boxes. If thats what their plan is. I mean i understand why thier doing all this now so they can get all the hate outta the way.
---
No plans for it, and the mask use to be so rare, there was maybe 1 or 2 on each platform. Duping ruined it, at least on XB.
---
People keep buyin' Crack too.
---
Lol criticism and attacking people are different things.
---
Lol where was it promised that subscriptions were free.
---
Tried. Failed.
---
It‚Äôs well duped on Xbox, but you‚Äôd still be hard pressed to find it at 1k only, try Xbox looking for group, you may find it there
---
I really don't like how ppl trying to divide the whole 76 community into "Fallout 1st" and "Fallout 2nd" after last week's update......Why can't we all just have fun and enjoy the game together ? :'(
---
Or that,yeah.
---
Hey Fallout 76 bugs are being fixed at a record rate. You want proof? Fine example of a similar game like Fallout 4 where they still can't reload a single bullet into Lever Action Rifle and instead need to reload all 5 bullets and that game gets quarterly updates to add Creation Club content. I'm glad we got a real game company running Fallout 76 unlike that Fallout 4.
---
That everyone also bitches about so between the two they might make enough to cover everything
---
Yes we are superior
---
At least crack makes you feel good, fallout is just bad for your health.
---
I share the same ideology. So what if they made the items actually obtainable?
---
The upper echelon Fallout 1st members must crush the peasant rebellion!!! 
---
Equip your Ranger Armour and put the plebs back in their place!
---
I cant stand NW even for 1 match, especially on PC where a hacker every match is ordinary
---
Rofl, you fell for that!?
---
Pete Hines literally said all future updates and content would be free, this took things people were literally asking for since launch and puts them behind a paywall.
---
My sarcasm is superior

This is one change I‚Äôm really, really liking. If nothing else it gives me a bunch of new places to add to my legendary farming runs. More importantly, SB fights, with all their minions at least feel a bit unpredictable, less repetitive.
---
Finally the voice of experience. I studied and worked on marketing and while i had a different job from you practices like these were normal and encouraged. Its ridiculous how many people who never studied marketing commenting like they know stuff.
---
We aren't monster but it is a morally grey job, you have to do a lot of lying, i mean we literally have to sell broken products to you.
---
No freakin way. It would take weeks if not months to get all of them
---
Everything‚Äôs been AOK here on PC. Some frame rate drop when everyone blows up every car at once, but that‚Äôs about it.
---
US Government Supply Requisitions. Make it the same drop system as now except it puts out an alert like SBQ and gives you a minute or 2 before it drops in a decent sized circle. Inside the circle pvp is turned on regardless and you have to claim the container like a workshop. People can ignore it or it can be a mini pvp activity on demand.

I actually haven't! God, so much to do, ~~so much to see~~ I'm actually kind of excited. Now to just somehow convince my pals to re-download the game and google what Biv is!
---
I don‚Äôt get it. I really don‚Äôt. As a casual 76 player who doesn‚Äôt want to spend anymore money I just want to play expansions and such. I‚Äôm grateful to the 1sters. You guys are paying for the devs to keep supporting the game. My experience is only gonna be better.
---
Paid the yearly subscription already. Appreciate it, though, brother!
---
Ashamed?
---
I guess your right no one is forcing us to buy the subscription though I‚Äôm just afraid if these pure evil cosmetics enter starfield
---
Any level in particular?
---
How many Rad Ants are you at? I'm only at 230. Was hoping there would be a lot in the Engineering section of Meltdown but I was disappointed.
---
I‚Äôm guessing the other players failed to kill their spawns, so you got your own plus what they left behind.  Long range weapons are pretty vital down there.
---
If you don‚Äôt already know, each scorchbeast will create a little entourage of 5-6 regular Scorched.  Kill those and the creature will land.  If you‚Äôre a VATS fan, you can target a wing and force it down that way.  They seem to take slightly more damage when grounded, probably due to damage drop off at distance.  It‚Äôs not really noticeable as a rifleman, but definitely there when I play my heavy gunner.  You‚Äôre going to want them in your face if your weapon is a shotgun.
---
So only one I have found that works is the classic skeleton mask and Halloween outfit. Whoo hoo atoms nom nom nom
---
This one worked, thanks. Just popped on the radio, took a seat at the bench in front of the door, and two minutes later I was dead.
---
Posted by a shill account that doesn't even post on other subs.
---
Oh the irony. Smells like desperation.
---
Just simply gain the XP needed to complete the challenges. Note that the challenges are unlocked day-by-day until November 5th (so you can't get all the stuff at once unlike the VTU stuff), and after that you have until November 14 (I think) to complete them all and earn the rewards!
---
In daily order, these are the rewards you can get:
---
Earn 250 XP - Pink Bats Assault Rifle Skin
---
Earn 750 XP - Halloween 10mm Pistol Skin
---
Earn 1500 XP - Pink Bats Minigun Skin
---
Earn 3500 XP - Jack O 'Lantern Combat Rifle skin
---
Earn 7000 XP - Jack O" Lantern Combat Armor skin
---
Earn 14000 XP - Glowing Skeleton outfit
---
Remember Runescape drop parties? Similar concept.
---
Thats all i want.
---
You mean like the times Amazon was caught doing it?
---
S
---
You just have to get like 250 xp. One game is you are decent at it.
---
What are you talking about üòÇ
---
Honestly I‚Äôm not worried about any future projects from Bethesda. We knew what 76 was from day 1. An experiment. A side project. This isn‚Äôt Fallout 5. Somehow someway 76 has maintained a base of dedicated players since release, and a lot of those players have been spending real money on atoms for a while. I see 1st as a good deal for those people, and is helping the deva keep the game going. And their DLC expansions are free... I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just having a hard time being upset.
---
Disappointing
---
Are you sure they are available after their original release day? I was thinking you had to unlock them on that day.
---
Arround 14 wins, it's a bit of a stretch.
---
Nope. They stay available until the ultimate deadline
---
Why on earth did I get down voted lol
---
I'm at like 77 lol. I've only really found like a spawn of 5 in washout
---
DeadüòÇ
---
Do you have a source for this info? I tried looking on Bethesdas website and couldn't find it. Thanks.
---
Lmao when I‚Äôm trading with someone and they have the mask I always request (out of fun of course) and they‚Äôre always like never selling this bad boy. I mean good luck to you, but at this point it‚Äôs a lost cause trying to get that mask.
---
yeah they mixed up translations again, having the same on the german translation
---
They also translated the 'light' for lighting the mischief fires as the 'light' ("leicht") in relation to light weight
---
A lot of people. It's the principle of the thing. It's the motive behind the inclusion. You don't care, but anyone who thinks deeper on this can see it's a middle finger, and a transparent act of desperation and/or spite.
---
If you don't care, then why are you arguing?
---
It will be like Brexit, where in the future we announce that it is fixed in a grand ceremony. No one remembers when the tradition started, but we all get online and encircle the looping bot. Chanting "Behold the infinite, in infinity we bask!"
---
Agreed we need 3 star boss.
---
The text is what counts. Not the number.
---
Fallout first is not DLC? All DLC released so far has been free. If they charge money for any DLC then yes, that would fall into the realms of false advertising. The promise they have broken is non-cosmetics being sold. They should be held accountable for that.
---
We tried the event on a private server tonight, just four of us.  The lag was almost as bad as the public server.  No real improvement.
---
You too man, have a good one.
---
Wouldn't be out of the question, that in general they'll only be seeable and interactable with a 1st Membership... as all it needs is essentially setting a flag, works for Quests with multiple stages (so not everyone sees every item/enemy) so the code is there...
---
It took me way too long to realize this...but the ones in the atom store you bought are lit. The ones that are the event rewards are not. They look so much better lit up at night.
---
*Norton Anti-Virus Disliked That*
---
Your last sentence isnt true. They came out and said that scrap was coded differently and does not require any more cpu power depending on its quantity unlike individual items. Scrap literally didnt affect servers.
---
It may have at one point (more likely due to a bug) and thats why they did it the way they started. Now things are ironed out and players shouldmt have to play scrap inventory wars any more id they dont want to. Its not fun in any way , it never was and added realism at the cost of a huge playerbase on release. Everyone i knew that quickly tired of the gane hated dealing with scrap.
---
Its a qol change everyone deserves now that they admitted its non necessity. When there were 50 duping bugs it was important to cap. Now they have that managed. Think with tour head. What you are saying is a devils advocate that advocates making other players feel left out and forgotten in a world they retreat to. Its not healthy, its not good development and its just a murky moral grey area to defend aggressive capitalism.
---
yeah I think they "fixed" that because people were building Atomshop items for others in their camps so now it's working like with the other Atomshop items like skins
---
Oh yeah...all of those people playing other games, who only experience terrible performance in a game made by devs famous for bug riddled code and instability...its their fault?
---
Yeah. Sure buddy. Keep shilling.
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool.
---
I'm not Fred, Brad
---
Well I sure feel special for you to remember me. But yea did buy it for one month and was able to get rid of 12 alts that were for storage of junk but won't be buying another month till a lot of alts fill up or its $5.
---
Because the the collaborators that support Bethesda's attempt at being EA are no better than those siding with the Chinese government.  Free Fallout! Free Hong Kong!
---
So so so many times, just came on here while loading back into husbands server who was miraculously not disconnected as well. I guess we shoulda paid for those stable servers eh? Im sure Bethesda knows how unstable these servers are during highly populated events. Sigh
---
It was on the News tab in the official site, but I can't seem to find it again. 
---
But I can say the deadline is actually November 12th and by November 3rd all of the challenges are unlocked and ready to have the rewards earned
---
Looks like a Jigsaw mask lol
---
7th
---
7Th
---
Good luck with that mask if you're not on Xbox. It's drop rate was STUPID low and is only on Xbox in any meaningful capacity due to dupers.
---
But that's not the point, it's a horrible system regardless.
---
Welcome to the new pvp.
---
Thank you very much for the information!
---
What a bold statement. I completely disagree with your post. Why would someone assume any new feature would be part of the fallout 1st membership? 
---
Ps
---
When you assume, you make an ass out of u and me
---
I'd also like to point out that 99% of the critics of this game have simply moved on from sitting in a subreddit they don't like and talking shit about Bethesda and this game (all deserved by the way).
---
This is why its so EASY to see when suddenly there's a uptick in positivity AFTER an announcement as bad as Fallout 1st.
---
Must have actual pumpkins to craft FYI
---
I see that you know what you're talking about.
---
Hm I wonder how I missed that. Ok thanks.
---
I don‚Äôt see it as horrible at all. It‚Äôs just their design choice. Have you not played other MMOs?  They want you to put more hours into the game, one way to do this is to not be able to finish the main quest until you are a high level. 
---
It might have been better implemented if they added levels to the quests, but that‚Äôs not how they did it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Oh you are a pos. Hurting the industry with this crap
---
I ran it thrice and got disconnected once. It was annoying the first time but I got what I needed the other two times. I‚Äôm like low 35 lvl and don‚Äôt expect to deal serious dAmage. But it‚Äôs fun!
---
Dont think youre looking in the right section. These have their own box seperate from atom shop purchases.
---
I think its 3 tiles below the pumpkin stand, while the atom shop ones are 6.
---
Specifically "Jack o'Lantern" not "Jack o' Lantern"
---
Played a ton today allotting several wins and i didn't unlock a single thing. What gives?
---
We had the sense to make crack illegal.
---
Get damage perks instead of carry weight perks. Focus on one specific class of weapons and get perks for them. And then obviously get legendary weapons and armor that suits said build
---
Good idea
---
Thanks! I do my best to help other people. I don't really get why somebody would like to get bullied but everybody has their niche. :)
---
I've done the event three times so far. First time it completed as normal. Second time was a total crash near the end. Third time it didn't crash, but I never saw the "completed" graphic or reward list, so I can't tell if it actually registered as completed.
---
Ive been getting disconnected on every try, guess ill say goodbye to those rewards..
---
I read that it puts the grenades in your stash. Haven't rebuilt it to test if that is true.
---
You can see them in your friends list, it says theyre in a private world
---
That thing is not rare on Xbox. People were giving those away for free in some player vendor shops. They were heavily duped.
---
The problem is that there's no reason to ever use the creation club when fallout nexus is just a few clicks away and has pretty much everything you could get from creation club in it.
---
Fallout 76 doesn't have mods, so there's no choice but to buy. I can't help but feel like fallout 76 was a deliberate toe in the pond to test if they could use the online environment as a way to forcefully block mods, and therefore be able to *sell* mods like they want to.
---
The upper echelon Fallout 1st class must crush the peasant rebellion!
---
But it's not private servers that people are upset over.  Of course private servers were going to cost people money.  That's fair enough.
---
It's placing functional items behind a paywall that upset people.
---
This has been my thoughts as well. They couldn't monetize mods via creation club because fallout nexus is a few clicks away and you can get anything you could dream of from there for free. Fallout 76 may be them testing the water to see if they can use an online environment to stiff-arm mods and forcibly monetize them via a shop.
---
Now I guess the counter argument to that would be that there are strikebreaker robots about the place, indicating that the police were using them instead
---
Did you maybe pick the perception special first and then select a charisma card after?
---
................wat?
---
r/woosh
---
have fun playing this broken mess while other people are playing superior games for $0 a month.
---
I‚Äôm on PC.  My decorations are Connecticut Shoreline level at the moment, but I‚Äôll definitely go full Staten Island as I get more plans.
---
(CT shore = I hired Martha Stewart to make a tasteful solstice wreath for the door.  System Island = I have fake Italian Renaissance statues in my front yard year round.)
---
that's... pretty obvious. you're telling me you spent all your points into carry weight? AND you're confused as to why your damage output is so low?
---
For just $100 a year you can have your own server!
---
Fair criticism
---
*you're
---
What diseases are you getting? Only thing that gives me diseases is spoiled meat. I wonder if they broke Carnivore for some people.
---
Oh im sure they can make some sort of "guest list"  of who all payed them to use it. Lol. Theyll plop it in game with a little lock next to its option until you buy it.
---
Boooooo
---
I will take a look next time I'm on
---
YESSSS!! When you scroll through build menu, it should show you how many of each item you have placed already, and let you store or scrap from there.
---
how.....
---
That would be really useful.
---
I got dysentery from glowing meat. Still said 0 percent chance of disease too.
---
But then your phone has to be communicating with the server as well as the game.
---
I searched but nothing came up.  Do the new items start after midnight?  I saw I got the pumpkim skin but no notification.  
---
I feel like a wank if i missed these post.
---
Well now your just giving them ideas
---
Elaborate my friend.
---
Nuking now.
---
And you'd better use it! Because if you are caught with it on a public server, you will get bullied. (And i endorse it)
---
Imho pa is not an option when compared to uny. Like absolutly no comparison. And i guess I was more thinking an ideal uny loadout.
---
Similar to uny, powered or +str and sneak. On pretty much everything. 
---
Id definetly say it shines in maintainability. But I would dedinetly argue that its the cheapest to put together.
---
A shame, It's much better.
---
Private server my friend!
---
Do you mean Meat Week for acid?  I only remember scorched, super mutants and toads in Fastnacht. It was a while ago, so my memory may be tricking me.
---
Every one of the three attempts to join that event on XB1.
---
I'll check when I get home, I had a couple but I dont know if I already have them away or not. If I do you can just have it.
---
It seems very glitchey but i think its due to all the action and players.  Mine crashed after it ended.
---
In the honey hause you could hop servers and replenish the hives. Giving pretty much infinite acid. I stocked 1200 units before it left.
---
Everything is going to plan.
---
You are the kind of person that is ruining AAA gaming with your apologetic stance for corporate greed over fun games. Why do you stand up for a multi-billion dollar operation that is clearly designed to suck money out of wallets rather than deliver A FINISHED SOLID FUN GAME??
---
Keep dancing for Bethesda. They don't give a shit about you and you stand up for them. 
---
There is a sucker born everyday.
---
A sheet would be funny, especially if it was calf length, but I don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôd model that as a one piece outfit.
---
how
---
it's a good starter build, though. adrenal reaction, a 1\* bloodied Super Sledge and a protocoled t51b will carry you until you can get better gear.
---
if I could go a year back and tell my younger, less decrepit self something about the game, would be to put together that dirt cheap setup and farm launch WS like there's no tomorrow.
---
7 times, zero crashes
---
7500 xp in NW is as little as 4 or 5 wins, depending upon how many downs/kills you get. I got 2400 tonight in a win match.
---
Do you want to get it fixed? That would be 100 dolars for fallout first and 5 dolars for creation club mod fixing it.
---
if you want a great example of this, go read the reviews for "hero wars" in the Google store. It famously spams videos all over where the only gameplay shown is a puzzle solver, but it turns out the puzzles are just a very small part, and most of the gameplay is not at all like what is advertised.
---
there are hundreds of 1 star reviews all saying this same thing, (and generally also that the actual game is not that great, and heavily pay-to-win) yet the game's overall rating is still 4+ stars because there are many many more positive reviews that are short, lack depth or insight, and most likely are from shill accounts.
---
I got it as a reward and love it. Going to grind some out and see if I can get the hat too
---
And thousands dont agree with what you did. Lol. Its a vicious circle. 
---
"You bought in once. Youll buy in again." - BGS lol
---
Badge of stupidy (player icon) would be enough.
---
You've been playing games since 1999 and you agree with the bullshit that AAA gaming companies are doing now? Specifically this obvious cash grab of a "game"? 
---
RIP AAA gaming.
---
"A sucker is born everyday"
---
Eh honestly this is considered a chargeback and bethesda will take a fee for this, in turn they will most likely ban your account until the payment is restored, this is common practice for every other online transactional game.
---
Check your banking (online if you have it or call) to see if the payment went through. Send those images to Bethesda and Microsoft in your report. What do you mean by you can't log in? I assume you're logged in to the account on console then? Try contacting Bethesda Support on Twitter. They should be able to get in contact with you through the email your account is registered with.
---
That isn't a grey area.... lieing isn't neutral.
---
relevant, but not entirely accurate given how easy it is too skew review averages these days.
---
Be gone bethesda shill thot!
---
I rember the week everyone had one. I was afraid of bans and missed out, lol.
---
The mods you will get will be like the creation club stuff. There's a valid reason for that too, and that is that if the server has mods and you don't, you can't connect because your game doesn't know what the hell its looking at. If you have mods and the server doesn't, you can't connect, because the server doesn't know what the hell its looking at.
---
Anything that exists will exist for everyone, meaning it needs to be something everyone can use and stays within theme. If you were thinking you would get things like CCBE, lighting fixes, weather mods, removal of durability, or other things that affect large portions of the mechanics or environment (Basically anything that isn't just more items or structures), I have bad news.
---
Theyll save that for fallout platinum in march. Lol
---
Well, yeah, obviously. I haven't been under the impression that Bethesda even really cared about the IP other than as a way to make money, so that goes squared for me as a player.
---
Try placing another atomic shop door, then changing it to the bungalow one.
---
Oh no I will but again I'm ok with it but I play other mmos so it's normal for me
---
Yeah, the first time. Crashed every single time after, some twice in one event
---
Editing* it to the bungalow one.
---
The atoms alone should sell it well enough. I do wonder how it affects their overall sales, though.
---
I come across this sub a lot and i can say people come here to say that because yall literally defend this game to no end and try and make out what they do as okay or normal for a Fallout game when it isnt at all normal and not okay. And yall shit here and post about how everything is fine and youre enjoying the game when in fact the game has very shitty business practice implamented
---
I just cant justify another 8 bucms a month on something i already dropped 60 on. That and with how lacking the game is with end game content in its current state, to me, its just throwing away money. I can go get a pre roll for 8 bucks here and feel like i spent my money better. 
---
But youll get no argument from me. If you think its worth it, im glad for you. Just dont be surprised when fallout platinum drops in march a week before wastelanders. Lol.
---
Shill you mean synth?
---
I think I just saw you during the event lol
---
I‚Äôm afraid to even move anywhere every step I take the whole event just glitches out
---
Maybe its just you its not working for

---
To be clear, I like using numbers just because I personally think it helps keep long discussions more organized and focus.
---
1) I love how you completely ignore that these companies straight up proudly admit to lying about developers needing more money to get people to buy more microtransactions. Development costs are not so high that these companies aren't able to make hundreds of millions of dollars in profit(not revenue). They publicly admit this themselves and you still keep buying into it.
---
2) Funny that you mention FF7, since its actually one of the most expensive games ever made. The Witcher 3 costed 81 million dollars to make while FF7 costed 114 million. That's 34 million dollars more than one of the most critically acclaimed and technically advanced games released more than two decades later. Hell on this top 30 list of most expensive games ever made, only 3 of the top 10 were released within the last 5 years:  [https://www.thegamer.com/most-expensive-video-games-ever-made/](https://www.thegamer.com/most-expensive-video-games-ever-made/)  
---
3) No we won't. Development costs aren't that much higher today while the profits have skyrocketed. A $60 game from 10 years ago makes far less money than a $60 game today.
---
4) Yes, two content-rich and expansive DLC developed after the base game had already sold like gangbusters. Even if you ignore that I never said I had anything against DLC, the Witcher 3 did not become a success because it had two DLCs. It became a huge financial success because the base $60 game sold amazing well.
---
5) I don't know where you're getting 6 figures from. Sure, the leading developers can paid that much, but most fully employed developers are paid in the 5 digit salaries, and even the most skilled contract workers can get paid in minimum wage. As a person who is currently getting a degree in game development, I can tell straight up that most developers aren't paid that much. There's literally a saying at my college that goes "If you want to make a good amount money, don't go into game development." If you were to just remove the all the bonuses from the executives running these companies and put it into the salaries of their developers, you could probably increase the salary by at least 50% more than what they're currently getting paid. So even if these companies are dying for money(which they aren't), all they really need to do is lower the pay grade of the executives who are massively overpaid even by other entertainment industries' standards.
---
In conclusion, stop taking what these companies are saying at face value. If you do your research, none of the money from microtransactions goes to paying developers. Hell, Activision, who literally has statistically one of the most overpaid CEOs in the world, made record revenue from microtransactions last year and what did they do? Oh yeah, they FIRED EIGHT HUNDRED EMPLOYEES! They do not need this money. They have publicly said that they do not need this money.  They're doing it out of pure greed and nothing more
---
We can all be though of as shills and not shills simultaneously, it's only when we look at our post history can we find out. In other words, Schrodinger's Shill.

I saw my friends list jimp up from 0 people playing to 6 people pkaying and all 6 were 1st members, i also saw about half of the people playing on the public server with the new 1st exclusive icon
---
I have not heard this but this would be amazing! Not talking about sky high camps but being able to decorate your shop, house and odd and ends. All without maxing your budget. Can I ask where you heard this?
---
The issue is for many, we were delivered a broken product. The compensation for the original wasted investment was supposed to be exactly that, free. Thats what the consumer was told. The other issue is the biggest complaint about the game (storage space) is now hidden behind a paywall after months of telling the customer yet again "it cant be done." 
---
Another issue is the horrible customer support, the countless lost characters, the countless lost items, the broken vault raids deleting everything, the horrible ticket submition system, and so on. Basically all routing back to customer support. Youre telling us, that BSG want us as customers to pay more money and they arent fixing anything. They are buying you off with a bs outfit and some atoms. Oh and dont forget that broken infinate junk storage. They continually ask you to shell out more cash and cant be bothered to fix whats already broken. Thats why peoplw are pissed. Its not about the 8 bucks. Its about what quality experience youre getting for your subscription service. 
---
Like i said in the beginning. Im middle of the road. I could give a shit at this point. This game is dead in the water for endgame players. I might log 2 hours a month at this point, so its worthless from me. 
---
But as a Bethesda customer, personally, im just tired of all the bullshit and lies theyve been spewing since they announced fallout 3.
---
According to Whales feeders like Bethesda, Ubisoft, Activion, etc. Yea, you are :)
---
Well, they are more like bottom feeders.
---
This game was designed for whales.
---
It's a message I think. Perhaps someone else can put it into words...Basically, since you gave your money to a greedy company, they are in turn giving you all their money to show that you yourself are greedy and corrupt for showing this greedy corporation that you support their greedy behavior. ....I think?
---
Excavator PA has more carry weight than regular armour. You also don‚Äôt need to worry about rads.

Happened to me and I had to tick a misc mission to get the marker back up
---
ok now tell the guy I sarcastically replied to.
---
True and you are right. Its more like obscuring the truth
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous. Either crashing or supposedly losing server connection, which never happens to me. Starting to hate the event
---
 
---
&gt;complaining is useless and pointless. No good comes from that.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video\_game\_crash\_of\_1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983)
---
In 1983 people started complaining the current video games sucked and stopped buying them. Which created gaming as you know it by encouraging competition and the need for a better product. All of it started word of mouth with people complaining to each other that the games sucked.
---
Random af but I‚Äôm in meridian lol
---
It really depends on your connection, but the servers or your machine
---
I‚Äôd still add the extra. Some people like outfits, some like building houses, I like giant numbers rolling off my screen.

Lol that‚Äôs pretty funny.
---
Your inability to understand something is not my problem.
---
Great idea.
---
I picked up a month of the premium service, and here‚Äôs my takeaways.
---
Private instances/worlds/whatever are amazing for players that prefer to go solo or have a small group of core friends.
---
The tent should probably have a 1 hour cool down and be unusable in public worlds. It‚Äôs way too easy to abuse. Having a forward operating base is fine, but as it is now, it‚Äôs a pack Brahmin that looks like a tent. There‚Äôs no need to behave intelligently and use forethought when you can plop it down almost anywhere and use it like an arsenal/cover/kitchen.
---
Scrap should have to be broken down at a bench before storing in the premium box. The regular stash should also be removed.  Over-encumbrance doesn‚Äôt exist if you don‚Äôt want it to, and grabbing a whole new set of weapons and armor in the ass end of anywhere is high grade cheese.

I think that BGS erred on the side of generous to entice players toward premium membership, when all they needed was a private world, atoms and a shop discount.  It‚Äôs nice to plop my tent near Dyer Chemical and periodically check for strangler blooms, but a pack mule really hurts the game if you let yourself get lazy.
---
Are you able to do it by yourself my game hasn‚Äôt been crashing but i was thinking of doing it in the private server?
---
I haven't heard of that, all I heard was the items for crafting was to become limitless.  
---
If the budget is to increase if we join the1st , I might think about joining.  I just dont like having to pay 12.99 a month for the choice of using a private server
---
I‚Äôve completed once on a public server and twice on private- private was much more smoother
---
I think it‚Äôs all the explosions lagging the game
---
I tried to solo it, couldn't finish it in time because I am a melee build, but someone with an explosive auto rifle should be able to do it.
---
Yeah I gues I got the trick on this one
---
I'm still subbed because I was looking forward to 76 so much, I'm still secretly hoping it gets better. I was a fallout fanboy and I really don't want to let go of the franchise.
---
That being said, I don't post or comment a lot because everything approaching a negative comment gets blasted back to 2077.
---
Well some countries include VAT on their asking price which is not common in the US
---
I've tried telling people this MULTIPLE times as it happens a lot at events like AWOL that are supposed to have guaranteed three stars and people start killing them at zero to one star anyway.  Get ready to be told it's bullshit, a myth, your opinion etc and that legendary star ranks NEVER change.
---
I am way to casual to prep a silo just to nuke the event but you got admit it‚Äôs kinda funny. 
---
I remember the first time I went to solo a silo- some random person joined me and together we fought there the bots and had each other‚Äôs backs during the prep. 
---
I felt like we bounded.
---
Then he launched the nuke Center on my camp.
---
I'm not positive about this. I've shot enemies well before they gained their green mist but only killed them after the green mist appeared and they would become 2 or 3 stars if appropriate.
---
I would wager the Whitesprings Sentry Bot is hardcoded to be 1 star always, or a vast majority of the time. The goal of the event is not to give you a chance at a free 3 star legendary every hour but for Halloween-themed cosmetics.
---
Fo76 is a free for all.
---
 Looks like you can post what ever you like.
---
A lot of good rng rolls or trading. Bloodied with full unyielding is great. Or explosive or faster fire rate legendary effect. Only way you'll really be one shotting high levels is melee, though.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure in the post about 1st they mentioned in the future addingvlarger camp budgets and larger building area.
---
Talk about being obnoxious
---

Bethesda trying to screw foreigners out of a few more dollars.
---
Make a ticket- I made a ticket for the camo armour not working and they where fast and super nice. Got a full refund and they let me keep the camo armour... and they fixed it a week later haha.
---

For real lets civil war both already tf we waiting for
---
Gues I'm wrong, that's good then
---
Both blind Faith and blind cynicism can sour the fanbase. Every whale in 76 is kind of fucking us all over, and because of blind Faith, the sub is toxic towards criticism. I kinda feel like that's why Bethesda is getting away with this.
---
On the other hand, I do hope that the people who enjoy it, can continue to enjoy it. Just don't believe a word that comes out of bethesda's mouth and enjoy the game as-is.
---
Yeah no, Australia has a 10% tax and by law it has to be displayed. That still doesn‚Äôt make up for the $30 increase
---
If they do ....oh man, imagine building a fortress all for yourself . I have already spent hours on my current C.A.M.P.... I could easily spend days rebuilding it lol
---
Didnt realize a subscription should be free.
---
Thanks.
---
Here's a weird tip
---
"Left wing, Right wing.... I have never seen a bird fly properly with only one wing"
---
  
---
Let me first say I do not have this game (Because to me Fallout 76 althoughi in concept is a great game, the execution is terrible and overmonitzed already). This seems to be quite standard now-a-days in the gaming industryty especially in aAa develop industry.
---
They have had their run for 10-12 years now, of almost unbrindled income... where players have LESS, and are way more controlled, more data gathered, more knowledge of addiction psychology etc.
---
People are getting sick by all the lies, broken promises etc I think they are just generally more paranoid about being fucked in their ass again.
---
It's not a Bethesda thing, it's a aAa industry thing. I can't trust any publisher anymore, with all the rushed releases, lack of creativity, copy-pasta from eachother etc.
---
Theyre both me i have 2 guys. Probably not til friday
---
I think you misunderstand I dont mean server stability I mean in their response they said they are now working on server privacy and giving it an option and when it comes to something the player can control they have been forth coming server issue wise however has always been a totally separate issue that I agree they still struggle with along with several other mmos that gave never properly fixed the issue regardless the server size. 
---
Customer service i cant agree more its dreadful but it's also a case by case basis you know? Their track record isnt the best but every situation has aspects to it that will be unique leaving ample opportunity for a new result, especially when major back lash such as the bag situation came in. Bethesda knows how serious it can go when major money is involved  such as them having lawsuits being filed against them over it so again we would have to wait and see exactly how that goes and if they dont do it freely you better believe the fan base wont have it
---
I came for the Grim Reaper cutout, I stayed for the carpet.
---
Those shill ratfuckss
---
Part of me isn‚Äôt surprised - although Bethesda opened an office here to handle marketing and sales in Australia, so it‚Äôs not like they are chucking $30 extra on because it‚Äôs an unknown market
---
I've had this happen 5 times already in the middle of the event. I don't think Bethesda took into mind that blowing up cars DOES NOT HELP FRAMERATE. It inevitably causes multiple crashes. Not to mention the amount of people that go to the event. It's been confirmed that other players are the source of most of the lag and crashing in game.
---
&gt;which no one (that I know of) actually uses
---
HI, I'm "no one." I use both free mods and Creation Club mods. For Creation Club, I tend to lean toward mods made by people I'm familiar with (like Elianora, for one) so I can send a little money their way as thanks for all their hard work.
---
Do you mean exchange rates?
---
Then we have to agree to disagree I believe at this point I hope it gets better for everyone but that wont happen. At least not for awhile when everyone feels like they just got cheated on by their wife if that analogy works
---
enough people must want to, otherwise they wouldn't sell it.
---
I‚Äôve bought almost all creation club content. I felt really stupid when skins for fallout 4 broke my game. The worst part is that I paid to break it.
---
Yes, they have been safe since day one. There was 3 conformed cases of charecter loss, both under very extreme cercunstanses that were un able to be reproduced. They had their charecter restored, and the glitch that caused it was fixed in patch 13 (pretty sure it was patch 13, might have the number wrong however)
---
My group ran it everyday for the first month and a half with no issues. I'd dive into it, but be warned this week's rai "melt down" is by far the least fun
---
Peer to peer is a shit way to do multiplayer, especially anything with PvP since its vulnerable to hacking with no server authority.
---
Fo76 uses dedicated servers and it was the best decision they made.  A peer to peer 4 player coop like many expected including me would have massive limitations and major problems, mainly for console and lower end PCs which would limit everyone.
---
How easy/hard would the event be while soloing, or playing with a friend or two?
---
Maybe you should play a different game then.
---
Classic modding
---
Oh no, i completely agree. I hope it gets better as well, the difference between you and I, is im not counting on it. Im counting on Bethesda lying like  usual. Im counting on them hiding more "features" behind more paywalls. Im counting on Bethesda "nuking" this entire game at zens request. 
---
What i fear is that it takes the franchise with it. Especially with how well Obsidian has done on The Outer Worlds.
---
Yeah that's exactly what they did with mischief night.  Only available to Fallout first subscribers.
---
Cool, I‚Äôll wait until next week but yeah I know it was only a really low number but just like getting scammed if there‚Äôs even a 1% chance I back off if I lost my inventory I‚Äôd likely have to give up playing as I carry most of my good weapons &amp; such with meüòÇ Which raid version is the most fun in your opinion since you said Meltdown isn‚Äôt fun at all. Want to give my bro a good experience if I‚Äôm gonna get him through one!
---
Or 10 average hide in bushes wins.
---
I haven't bought all the stuff, but am aware the Creation Club mods aren't without their flaws. I've been told Bethesda is pretty decent with refunds though, so if you submit a ticket soon enough after getting the mod and seeing it's busted, you can probably at least get credit back in the store from it.
---
Not really. There are sub rules and reddiqutte that must be followed.
---
bingo..... its a scam...
---
Regional pricing is not a new concept. I mean like it's been on this planet since the dawn of dinosaurs. It's not unique to bethesda in anyway. You have to be legit basement crawler who never buys anything online ever to not know this. Look at steam, even. 99% of the games are not priced the same at all. Sometimes the price difference is mind boggling. 
---
Now, the reasons. It's largely purchasing power, currency and market demand magic. There's probably some fees and add-ups unique to the locales in there but it's mostly marketing thing.
---
Well like I said agree to disagree as I dont believe that will happen only time will tell and it's getting late here so best of luck hope you have a better experience with 76!
---
Seriously amazing games, If you played oblivion or morrowind its within the same art style as there older games but most masterpieces. 2 Very Diffrent Games but both equally amazing. 
---
If your really curious and your a guy with time on your hands, when you get the chance rewatch this video (spoilers but explains shit).

Wrong, an MMORPG is a Roleplaying game that supports many people this is factual, but you don‚Äôt constitute what ‚Äúmany people‚Äù are, 24 players IS many, anything more than 5 is many, anything more than 3 by definition, is many.
---
What truly constitutes an MMORPG is the content. It is a Roleplaying Game that follows clear character progression with a questing system that leads players along a path from beginning of game into clear and concise endgame content.
---
Fallout 76 is listed on the tier list of MMORPG.com, coined as such as it is a company specifically funded and structured to host, rate, and give accurate feedback about MMORPGs.
---
Fallout 76 is included, in Media all over the place as and I quote the following ‚Äúthe worst MMORPG of 2019‚Äù whether you want to slap fake constitutions on it or not, Fallout 76 IS an MMORPG, and it doesn‚Äôt matter how much your vagina bleeds, or you cry about it, that‚Äôs the facts.
---
Was just going to say the same. Its late. Cant stress enough about my appreciation for actual convo instead of rants and raves. Its hard to find nowadays. Enjoy the rest of your 24 hour segment. Lol. Hope all goes well for you too. Unless youre with the enclave. Lol
---
They work as a reminder of the sort of game you're playing.
---
Works perfectly for me every time with normal loading times.
---
Charging a cap per five messages doesn't sound like a bad idea, actually.
---
Then i hope ya dont play any other game that has subscription services.
---
Hi, you will notice that I did not use an absolute "no one", I said no one that I know of. I am aware some people must be using it, just no one that I know.  üëå
---
3'S Just...dumb. "don't use the stuff you paid for".
---
Ummm, again*
---
I can hear the bell sound.
---
FFS Bethesda, there's been a pc mod that fixes this on the Nexus for bloody ages, just steal it already!
---
Don‚Äôt try to be good at everything, you need to pick a specialization and focus on that. Also situational perks like crafting (armorer / super duper / weapon artisan etc) , hacking and picklocking do not need to be equipped at all times. Doing so will only hinder your options elsewhere. Only use them when you are doing that particular task and then switch them out when you are finished. 
---
Also weight reduction perks are ok, but don‚Äôt use every one to its max. I rely on legendary armor effects to fill in what I‚Äôm missing. For example I have 3 pieces of gear that have food / drink / chem weight reduction effects which adds up to 60%. This means I only have to take rank one of traveling pharmacy and thru hiker to be at 90% reduced weight saving 4 total perk cards that I can put somewhere else.
---
I won‚Äôt downvote but it‚Äôs not going to happen even if it‚Äôs a great idea, most have already bought a sub and are enjoying the benefits so I would suggest sucking it up and betting on the house...the house always wins. No doubt Bethesda will tweak it over the coming updates and perhaps make it more beneficial to all but if you want to play the game then why not support it?
---
I shot the sheriff once.
---
Much fewer sales.
---
I'm aware of that. Was meant to be a bit of a joke, but okay.
---
It doesnt work for me :(
---
They can still be a bit laggy but it has improved a lot since launch. Your best bet is to not do it on a server that's been nuked
---
Dead in the water is the one I enjoy the most. Washout can be fun as well. Washout is next week, dead in the water the week after.
---
I'd recommend watching some YouTube vids so you have a bit of an idea what to do as they can be confusing
---
It just works. I mean really it works fine for me. My framerate drops a bit but never once did I get disconnected or crashed
---
Its not the 15 or so "shill" accounts on here that drive my interest nearly as much as the hundreds of upvotes. 
---
Its also why I hate a 1-10 scale of rating. I prefer the alternative of "negative, mostly negative, mostly positive, and positive" review ratings. A game like Outer Worlds is getting positive reviews both professionally and on social media saying it is "a game worth playing," and that rates a whole hell of a lot higher to me than "9.2/10, the flaws are easily overlooked in this otherwise perfect game!" because frankly, that whole sentence reeks of bullshit.
---
You can find the small backpack plan from morgantown airport terminal
---
Cool, will do! I did the raid (Washout I believe) the first week it came out then I saw that one post about the inv glitch &amp; I never hoped in since. But yeah when I did it I did Novice with people who already knew what they were doing. Is there a certain difficulty you have to do it on to get the raid armor? Or is it a higher chance on a higher difficulty?
---
There are 2 possible backpacks in game, you can get a small one form the overseers stash in Morgantown airport.
---
I've only encountered 1 hacker so far (and that was on my team lol). unfortunately the shadowplay recording crapped up. what region are you in?
---
Yes, twice last night, no problems.
---
What platform are you on?
---
(Me: PS4 PRO, EU region, gigabit fibre, no wifi).
---
Thank you.
---
The people buying Fallout 1st are begging for Starfield to be an always-online MTX hellscape.
---
I would recommend just standing at the left of the on top of building if you‚Äôre exiting whitesprings. It sounds boring but only way i can think of you getting rewards for event. I‚Äôm running on two accounts/xboxes and have one just standing there and my other account is actually doing event. My original xbox one I‚Äôve had from 2015 june crashes for anything using my gatling plasma and during scorchbeast queen.
---
Np. For better backpack you can grind the tadpole but that is a grindfest...
---
Np, just fyi you can‚Äôt use atomic shop skins on the small one üëç
---
does the jumpsuit hide the backpack?
---
Yea me and my friend are doing that now. We are way over our head in the east of the map. Its a real shitshow!
---
Lol, community managers. Yeah right.
---
I at first ran a two-handed build with a lot of weight reduction perks. Decided to junk that and went for a build that would require a lot of resource gathering so that I could have a reason to keep playing the game and enjoy it. Went with a Heavy-Explosive PA Gunner build, using ultricite ammo so nuking would be a priority for ammo crafting and better damage against SBs. Almost done with my equipment and weapons.
---
Thanks for the head up.
---
taxes like VAT
---
Callibrate your shocks.
---
Their*
---
It's been like 2 days since they last responded.... They don't need a daily update.
---
I dont know,  but I'm sure the world of fallout would be a whole other beast if they did
---
GST is only 10%
---
25k on Xbox.

Lol. Upgrade your gear or fix your network settings. And thanks for clarifying which platform your on. Really sets the ‚ÄúI want to rant and want no suggestions at all‚Äù tone.

the modding community doesnt support modders,mod users said when they wanted rid of paid mods the last time to replace it with a donation system mod users didnt donate to modders they donated to youtubers instead (some youtubers who cover mods make over 50k a month,most also dont ask can they use modders assets in there videos),why shouldnt beth and modders get somthing
---
Yes! The first time round previews were so small on Xbox I didn't even realise it had glasses. Saw someone wearing them at the first meat week and I've been hoping it would return ever since.
---
Yeah when even at 1am there are enough people with B-FFR-E handmades and whatnot to take out the sentry bot in under 2 seconds I've just resigned myself to being SOL.
---
Oh I'm willing to bet on that. Good ole' Uncle Pete's probably got everyone on lock down.
---
Fewer players
---
I‚Äôm a shotgun medic build heavily focused on vats. Since shotguns fire multiple projectiles in a single shot, perks like four leaf clover allow me to have a full crit bar practically every other shot. When I crit I heal for over 1/3 of my health since the heal is also based on each pellet. With an explosive effect, better criticals, stacking damage bonuses and using concentrated fire for headshot crits I kill enemies very quickly and very rarely need to use stimpaks. 
---
The only issue with this build is that you need to be up close to enemies, using a suppressor makes that even more of a problem. Also adamantium skeleton is pretty much a must so I don‚Äôt cripple myself every time I shoot something less than five feet away. The heal to team mates is also very short range, they have to be practically standing on top of you to get it.
---
So far its actually been the people salty about fallout 1st who are the ones nuking. They openly admit to it as well.
---
&gt; I recommend having Graham sell them
---
most players aren't going to be using hours hunting for him though
---
I've only seen him at a rate of once per 100 hours
---
Yeah, I'm not using headshots, still playing around with my build and working out what works best for me. I'm using some weight reduction perks because I enjoy the building aspect at least as much as the combat, so that's important to me. I'd be interested to see your perk loadout though if you're hitting for 1600
---
Until someone nukes it 1 minute before the event because him and his 14 year old buddies thought it would be funny
---
not everyone uses PA
---
I agree but not to burst your bubble but the more you acknowledge it the more it‚Äôll happen because they know it bothers not only to but a lot of people
---
I'm retaliating with nuking theirs and their friends bases
---
Should be followed, not sure about must
---
Developing a game isn't free you know. They have to keep paying the people who work on it. 13 bucks a month is the least I can do for a game I have put this many hours into.
---
Everyone will openly  admit because the get the quiet kid to do it because they know he doesn't care lmao
---
in Europe VAT can be as high as 25%, maybe there are other taxes too. Doesn't Australia have extra taxes on video games? I believe I've heard of such at some point.
---
I understand. But I wish people wouldn‚Äôt bother with others happiness in a game
---
Why not just, and hear me out... Not have fallout 1st at all?
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound like an actual build, but rather just a preference. Do you receive any actual benefits from this? In the event you are going with a berserker build you can‚Äôt wear a single piece of armor or even had 1 DR otherwise you lose your damage bonus.
---
What a great idea for a Fallout 1st exclusive, I'm sure Bethesda is on board.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm not mad, because I found out which creations do it and just don‚Äôt install them. I really like creation club, though I think Skyrim has better creations. It‚Äôs just that I had forgotten that I had that issue so I relived it a little just now lol
---
Any reply at this moment by the CMs can be extremely tragic. See the most downvoted comment on Reddit.
---
Amen to that. Especially over this fallout 1st crap, like who cares if you have a private server or not? It's pretty cool and every other online game ever has made you pay for private servers. Not only that, you had to pay someone to upkeep that server too. I don't see what all the fuss is about
---
I have played a lot of Fallout since the beginning.  No complaints about this game, but I have only played it for a month.  Had a lot of great experiences meeting people.  My wife thinks I am trying to pick up women LOL.  I work for an airline, (no people going to the highest place in the internet to complain there....) and I ask people what the purpose of an airline is?  They tell you that it is to get people places etc.  No, it is to make money.  Lots of games never see the light of day because developers were bad businessmen.  It was an epic battle last night.  Everything was in your face.  Primary weapon was a AP/limb gatling plasma with focus and rifled barrels to bring them down.  Minigun to finish them off.  I got a 2 shot gatling plasma so a taste test is in order.  I also got a prime receiver, but not sure if it is worth adding.  I had not noticed that the Bravos land when their minions are dead.  I thought it was because their wings were crippled.  I got a cool picture with 3 carcasses and 2 goo pools in the frame.  Too bad I can't get it out of the game.  I could use it as wallpaper.   Funny how there are so many more legendary enemies.  I ran into Graham out on the road.  He is now legendary!  Cheers, Doug
---
What do you even mean? Are people on your server? Do public servers seem less populated? 
---
Clarify.
---
I sell fine
---
I cant really answer you your questions, but they arent offering private Servers. Its a private Session. Means your are likely to share your Server with vorher private and public sessions.
---
We can pickle that.
---
Hahaha creation club yeah right. Mods will be sold for limited times like atom shop shits.
---
try moving the camp, this bug is as old as the game itself
---
Grow up
---
PLEASE be trolling cause I have no words to describe how pathetic this sounds.
---
I didnt do fasnacht as i had a break from the game back then. But this event is the most fun one i played without a doubt
---
Lmao I'll do the event in a hazmat suit just to anger y'all! Can't wait for tomorrow! See you thenüòâ hope you don't nuke my server I'll nuke your base until you buy a private server just to play the game
---
I like that both creation club and "nexus mods" are available for you if you play on XBox or Play Station. I'd be pretty pissed if the only mods available to console users were the ones on Creation Club, but since that's not the case, I don't mind spending a little money in the Creation Club every once in a while. Especially since I get more bang for my buck there than I do with most stuff in the Atom shop. The most irritating thing is the 2gb free mod limit on consoles, but I do mostly understand why it's set up that way.
---
You are weak. There are people in game who take great joy in hunting people like you down. The vision will be clear for all soon enough.
---
Not really no.
---
Bunch of poor salty CUNT‚Äôs who can‚Äôt function in society. 
---
‚ÄúWe want the largest game map of any open world mmorpg but we don‚Äôt want to pay for the enormous cost. We want to have all the good gear and balance and all this shit‚Äù for free.
---
If you have decent prices you still sell. I've sold about 10k this last week &amp; that was just serums, ammo &amp; some stimpaks. Have had lean weeks previously, but this week hasn't been that bad..
---
Lol you have no idea who I am and I'll take joy finding you because I'm no fo1st member but I enjoy this event so you mess with my event I mess with you. Cool? Cool. That's what I though now crawl back into your hole you wannabe Charles Manson

Also people begged for more stuff to throw money at so let's not blame Bethesda only. They're a company looking for money.

Ask and you shall recieve.

Maybe I'll buy it.  Swing by my camp &amp; target away.  It'll be huh-larious.

Guess I didn't wanna believe that a person beyond the age of 12 would write something like this and think it's a good idea to click post.
---
Derogatory? Ha! Good one. Just leave the subreddit already. Maybe leave the internet for a while. Go outside. Take a break. 
---
Poor boy sucker. Can‚Äôt afford First? I feel SO BAD! It‚Äôs not like all multiplayer games have are a paid service. Who could have thunk? Get a job, bums.
---
&gt; Bethesda has nothing to do with the subs. People just still like the game.
---
Shut up shill account, pretty sure you are on of their "pr strategists" or something.
---
They've repeatedly passed on lots of things to the dev that never happened.
---
The last section is purposefully time locked to give us solo artists a big tree branch to go fuck ourselves with.
---
Like I said, I'll be nuking each and every person that hits whitesprings in my server plain and simple.
---
Well played sir, well played indeed.
---
Is your ISP the Telekom by any chance? If yes, there is your answer.

As you should know.

It‚Äôs already there just not assessable. They literally have to flip a binary sketch.

Can dish it out but can't take it, eh.

I guess that after all the time in FO76 I feel comfortable that my thoughts may be of value

None of which my post has violated.

Calling people who don't have 1st "poor" isn't "dishing it out", it just shows an example of poor upbringing.

You'd have to spend several lifetimes studying to even apply for my job, but if thinking that I am poor because you have daddy's credit card and level headed people refuse to blow their money on a shit game makes you happy, so be it. Love in your bubbe where you think yourself to be royalty.
---
Says the person who is digging their grave as they are speaking, what's the gamertag? I'd love to pay you a visit
---
It's not an MMORPG sorry. 
---
"A massively multiplayer online game is an online game with a large number of players, typically from hundreds to thousands, on the same server." 
---
That's the definition of an MMO from wikipedia. Furthermore Fallout 76 is not included in the list of MMOFPS games that it would fall under were it a real MMO. 
---
Sorry but I'm going to go ahead and put more value on what wikipedia says than some random in reddit. 
---
Fallout 76 is not an MMO it is a survival multiplayer game same as Rust and Ark and H1Z1 and all the others. Tough.
---
You not being sure doesn't change the rules.
---
Fu1st! We need you to sell at reasonable prices. Thanks.
---
Bulk plastic, steel, rubbers. Asbestose.
---
I need to buy these to craft then scrap marine armor to learn mods. I like to mod legendary armor and weapons to sell in my vending machine.
---
Imagine using Wikipedia as a source imo
---
You‚Äôre a fucking dunce, this post was evidence enough but thank you for proving it further
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this is true. Ubisoft did it all the time on the Division subreddit.
---
There is something more to it than this. I don't know what, but the amount of Legendaries with green mist around them while showing 3\* says there is more to it. 
---
I've had all of the following happen, recently
---
3\* that held a green mist till it was attacked
---
1\* With a green mist for about 30Secs, while the 3 players all made sure we got hits in.
---
2\* That held the green until it did it's regen.
---
2\* That held the mist through it's regen right down till 40% health.
---
Don't worry about it dude. We're all cool here.
---
I hope you have a better day tomorrow :)
---
Paying for private servers is ok I guess. Paying the same amount as xbox gamepass is not. Paying for servers that aren't private but in reality are being rented out to you until you log off is not.
---
So that's a yikes from me
---
cheers! will check it out
---
I think you‚Äôll find that Fallout 76 is set in West Virginia and I think you‚Äôll also find that the average West Virginia house has a fridge and not a canning station rusting in the front lawn so I want an authentically rusting fridge please
---
Fallout 1st players? People have been nuking Whitesprings from the very beginning, long before a subscription service was added.
---
Hmm... you would think at yet so far 1 in 4 are fine with pay2win items.
---
Admittedly a tiny sample and really doesn't mean that much in the end. Still interesting. Didn't expect it to be that high frankly.
---
No u
---
How about giving the skin away as a "thanks for sticking buy as we fix this broken game" to all players?
---
I do have radshield and you're right that it's better. I always end up with so many diluted rad-x  though so I always end up using them.
---
Hey you too man, you too
---
If we find one it's reported to the admins and deleted
---
that sounds dandy an all. but this kind of practice is illegal in many countries. including the ENTIRE EU.
---
so for your sake i hope you worked in a country where this is legal.
---
Low charisma character and I almost always play solo, but I've thought about making a team focused character. Good advice, thanks.
---
Not the point of the post, read again.
---
"the game is fully playable as a singleplayer game"
---
(but it'll cost ya)
---
- Todd it just works Howard.
---
I always go for a Hacker skilled with Energy Weapons and Melee Weapons in Fallout games.
---
Ok.
---
Have you equipped it in the atom store?
---
I got my jack loot bag last night and it works fine
---
Because Bethesda has done little do deal with the underlying issue that is causing the lag, whatever that is.
---
Honestly don't expect them to until well after Wastelanders releases, if at all.
---
&gt;Legendary weapons that give 250 damage resistance while reloading breaks the first prefix of the legendary effects, unless you crouch while reloading. So it will lose Anti-Armor, Vampire's, Two-Shot etc. until you swap weapons back and forth
---
Copied from u/twoaru above

I was a brand ambassador for a luxury apparel brand. We were carried at Neiman Marcus, Barney's, and Nordstrom. I was in my early 20s, our lowest tier product was a $300 pair of sunglasses. I got promoted and worked from home- I got this job being sharked or headhunted on the shop floor of a British women's boutique I was assistant manager of in 2008. I live in Dallas, Texas. Neiman Marcus's flagship is located in the heart of downtown and I would house training scenarios for sales associates, managers, and visual merchandisers. I would do in depth product knowledge training on repairs and warranty issues-all that jazz and boring stuff. I also covered social media marketing and " brand Development". I was eventually promoted to be the brand Development manager for the Southwest. I don't even know how to properly use commas or punctuation. Fashion is quick and about cash. No one gives a fuck if your assistant can proof read it and fix it- your Golden. No one really cared about Reddit when I left in 2015. They saw it as the proles; a golden promise that was issued but never delivered. Wanna know why,? you can't buy any data from Reddit that you can convert in dollars. Reddit does not accurately display any number of sales or customers who actually buy your product or service. That's why diesel stuck their own app for Android/Google wear in the playstore. Facebook, postmark, hell Untapped( for beer) those are customers and coin. until Reddit can convert to sales or customer data. it's acknowledge for PR but negative PR on Reddit is actually better for any company. Twitter is taken more serious which is sad. Reddit is seen as a bunch of poop socks that are in college and pirate hentai. It's sad but true, I'm a closet nerd
---
 it's my dirty secret. You don't have to believe me but everyone in game is rocking that stupid NCR suit- I hate new Vegas and I bought 1st. Fuck that vanilla school shooter trench coat shit. I like the raider digs. my point is.. I play with a group old guys who think I'm lame cause I sell gear on Reddit sometimes. I've met players who think on Reddit I'm a non lnoob cause I don't have gear sale history ( most of my gear is sold in PS4 communities). Reddit isn't the center of the universe. everyone here thinks it is; once they all realize which they probably won't- there is a whole Galaxy out there old people who think differently. I don't know what will happen... but 76 will still be trucking along or it won't. it will be bought and sold to some Chinese company and then PvP will get put back in only dirtier and more aggressive haha. Reddit.. is the last table in the lunch room that thinks it's the first. I come by to put my name in for DnD night but the drama stinks like some sweaty ass guild chat. From a former corporate shill.
---
from this corporate box we call PlayStation.
---
on a corporate device we call PC or phone.
---
nice post.. not really. no one comes here like that bro. tell us now about pizza gate or Jade earring or whatever tf!
---
Could be the PC makes a difference *shrugs*
---
It's just logical. Allowing non-curated mods for everyone would render the atom shop completely useless because of the reasons Thorner already stated. But F1st members already pay their final share and get atoms on top of that so why not allow it for them? They are already paying constantly.
---
So have I on PC maybe this is an Xbox issue
---
Yes, fire sloppy programmers that don't pay attention to corner case issues, with out pay, hire more experienced programmers. That's the right way to fix these issues.
---
Our dollar is also worth less, and we get more of it when we work. Technically the conversion rate would leave a $60 US game at $87ish. But they probably round it up to $90 or something then add %10 onto that
---
Well, you made it sound like only Fallout 1st players were nuking Whitesprings.
---
Although, personally I tried to do the event three times today and each time a player nuked the place.
---
I don't know. I've played plenty of RPGs.  I like the setting but it lack the huge open world sense of discovery that Bethesda games have given. The dialog tree is good but then again it's not as good as mass effects was. It's a decent first entry into hopefully what becomes a new series. I still have faith in fallout 76 though and it's the reason I decide to give Bethesda more money. It's not free to develop these games after all. I am putting a lot of faith into wastelanders being special. Bethesda has delivered the games i liked for years so I don't mind paying for it.
---
And also your poor cousins in NZ!
---
That rationale should only be imolemented if you release a finished game. What they should've been doing since launch is to repair the community and their good faith. Not milk them for more money.
---
You're talking like they didn't already make millions from the game sales.
---
Hello games turned No Mans Sky around with completely free updates and NO microtransactions. With a fraction of the amount of developers.
---
Anyone have the full details link from bethesdas?
---
it is a private server
---
It's not that close actually. There is more than a whole month break in between Halloween and Christmas. Christmas and New Year are very close together tho so we will probably just get some fancy atom shop items for NY.
---
On ps4 and had no problems
---
I just got the pant suit and I love it üòç
---
&gt;but when some fallout 1st member nukes whitesprings in a public server 1 minute before the event something has gotta change.
---
I see we're still trying real hard to create a fake class struggle.
---
Would be better if it had Indy's skeleton in it, I really miss the Wild Wasteland trait.
---
The same thing happened to me yesterday in Harpers Ferry. Luckily I knew where the paper bag was, approximately. I got the quest marker when I was 2 feet away from the bag, but only the HUD marker, there was still nothing in the compass.
---
Quest markers have been wonky and unreliable for a good long while, probably depending on server load. Has there been a big public event going on at the time?
---
The Sheepsqautch Mascot head and suit did NOT count for my "Trick or Treat" weekly challenge. 
---
The Skull mask and costume did.
---
The Jack o'lantern suit also counted (with skull mask). 
---
Fasnacht masks count as well.
---
Fallout 76 was already shit, and Fallout First just instigated the fumes.
---
As a new player most player shops are just flat out too expensive I don't even bother looking anymore, unless your camp is right next to me.
---
If you have super great 3 star legendaries then sure jack up the price but for things like plans and stimpacks help the new guys out.
---
Now?
---
The bunker is a safe place when you need to take a bathroom break. Assuming there's no player-killer on the server.
---
More non-sense trying to create a divide. Or a troll either way it's lame.
---
I‚Äôve played it a dozen times, have froze on at least 6 of them, as well as almost every other person I know. All these comments about ‚ÄúI never freeze, works fine for me‚Äù, yeah right. It freezes. Constantly. Following his advice and curling up in the fetal position in the corner of an alley in whitesprings is about the only way I can get thru this event now without my game suddenly going brrrrrrrrrr, dashboard
---
Was able to complete 4 times tonight in Xbox One S.
---
Sure, Bethesda was so mindful of the modders they give them majority share of their work right?
---
He paid üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
My sales actually picked up noticeably. Selling a lot more ammo, costumes, magazines, bobbles, etc. 
---
Im also seeing a lot of FO1st people on the public servers, judging by the scrapboxes in a lot of the camps.
---
The divide has already been created. We don‚Äôt want fame, we want change.
---
Keep getting nuked as well. Tried to take part three times. I suspect they were targeting the other players at Whitesprings rather than going for the loot.
---
Yep. 13.90. Oh look I dont cant have an average McDonalds for a day. Oh well, sure does suck I guess.
---
Is Whitesprings no longer a popular target for nuking anymore because of all the ghouls? The way I see it, the place is being nuked by someone who only wants to grind gear instead of the event.
---
So the marketing is working. Good job being an easily led idiot, willing to throw money at a company who create the problems and then sell you the solution.
---
Same. No issues on PS4 for me.
---
I dont have any problems with the game and I've got over 2300+ hours into it. Maybe it's you who has the problem
---
Heh, are they called manager because they manage to paste "We are aware"?
---
More concerned about the fact you can justify supporting this company after trying to scam its player base at every turn.
---
And yet there's nothing drawing me to play the game. I tried to love it, I tried to like it, but the truth is it's just boring... for instance Outer Worlds I can't  wait to play more, and with 76 I've had that feeling only first 2 days or so.
---
&gt; Planting reviews once isn't the same as actively patrolling a nuclear subreddit whenever something "oof" happens to their active game.
---
yeah it is, its the same kind of active mis-information tactics but honestly why bother talking with you, someone who obviously is a shill himself ?
---
I fucking love this game and havent once felt scammed. Maybe you should cut out some of the sodium in your diet before you give yourself a heart attack loool
---
Yep. Every one I've been to has almost the entire server participating. That's a lot to handle in an area already known for poor performance. Add in everyone being hostile to the bots, endlessly spawning bots, and general chaos, it's a true test of the servers.
---
Nope!
---
" We‚Äôve been hard at work on Fallout 76 this year, including our biggest free update yet, Wastelanders. "

---
I will always have love for Bethesda. But sometimes I wonder if I'm a Synth myself. 
---
Why you do this to me Bethesda?!
---
The first thing you must do is select a ‚Äúbuild‚Äù that fits your play style and character image.  Think of what you like - for example:
---
- melee
---
- heavy weapons
---
- sniper / stealth 
---
- automatic weapons 
---
- pistols
---
There are ‚Äúmeta‚Äù builds geared for maximum damage (bloody+unyielding or junkies+vanguard) and some common sense builds (sniper+instigating).
---
If you provide some information on how you like to play, I am sure the community will min/max you within minutes :) 
---
If you are on PC, I can set you up with some legendaries from my stash
---
There is no divide quit pretending there's a problem that doesn't exist.
---
It's kinda ironic. The players that think that greifing and harassing is going to send a message are actually making the subscription look more appealing just to get away from the childish and annoying behavior.
---
2300+ hours? Maybe YOU are the one who has the problem.
---
Yea I don't think so. It might be hard to believe but there are actually people who like this game. Bethesda would be wasting their money going up against the army of Neo nazi pedos from 4chan who have some sort of sick passionate in trying to ruin this game for anyone that likes it. People who makes up fake post about problems that don't exist or those who buy the game only to try to make the servers crash just so people will quit playing have been apart of this game before it was even released. I mean serious what good is it going to do when you are paid to say a game is good when you have 10 others who never played it saying it isn't. People like the freaking game. I'm not sure why that's so hard to understand? We also understand that keeping this gaming running and new content being developed is going to cost money. The people that work on this don't do it for free. The fantasy that some people live where they think it's just some cash grab for Todd Howard really bewilders me but in the world we live in today with a reality TV star running the country it's not surprising. It seems logic and reason checked out from public prospective a long time ago and now everyone is an expert in the fantasy world they created.
---
Bruh, what a shill you are.
---
Public servers are fine, and have been for a year. Don‚Äôt twist my words.  I don‚Äôt want to be part of some salty agenda either way.
---
Private servers offer the luxury of real isolation, or a world filled with a curated group of friends. Aside from eliminating unpleasant drunks, griefers and smoothbrains, the same problems exist when playing with others. I still accidentally kill legendaries and lead scrap is a premium commodity for the entire populace, no matter how small.
---
Where does all this griefing happen? I don't see any of this playing on PC based in Europe.
---
got fallout 1st as well and it is funny to see other people whine about the subscription 24/7 while im enjoying infinite scrap and workshops
---
That's what I've been thinking. It's like reverse pr for 1st. Wanna get away from griefing kids and childish manchildren? 1st. Wanna be left alone at your workshops? 1st. Wanna deal with less bullshit in your down time? 1st.
---
Like damn, it's like they want folks to buy it now.
---
In my opinion, your money, your choice. I already paid for the Tricentennial version of the game, and not in a hurry to pay for a subscription service in any game. However, I find it completely disgusting that Fallout 1st players are being discriminated against by other players. So much for rebuilding America.
---
Why? Gaming is my hobby and I've only played this game for the last year since it released.
---
Lmk what you want and I'll get it for you np free of charge
---
Why weren't all of our 59.99$'s enough?
---
Same here. When I have played I hardly ever seen anyone, except at an event for a few minutes.
---
You are exactly why they released this bullshit. People willing to pay because.... For no other reason then "other games have subscriptions"
---
I'm a shrill for enjoying the game? I guess you dont like folks who dont agree with either. How childish.
---
A quick 2 seconds of research confirms 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-announce
---
That‚Äôs a good question!
---
I play on Xbox One X, so 4K as standard, but I‚Äôve never tried turning it ‚Äòdown‚Äô.
---
I‚Äôm glad they aren‚Äôt getting any slack. 
---
If we continue, Bethesda will have to respond. 
---
Believe it or not, this is how we make this game worth playing.
---
add me on psn: Owl_No 
---
got my own instruments at the entrance of my house, lets get Well Tuned
---
I‚Äôve only attempted one and then halfway through my Xbox did the dududududududu *crash* thing
---
No issues on pc. In fact i get super smooth 60fps with an xbox controller
---
You got the name wrong, js. Perhaps you should lay off the brahim dung yourself mate.
---
Savage
---
Yet you know who I am talking about. Guilty conscience much?
---
Same here, never once witnessed it.
---
Learn to ware PA and stop whining its been a long standing nuke spot for quite some time.
---
Um, it doesnt take much thought to realize what you were talking about since you've been whining about it for a week now. I dont feel any guilt for buying 1st and I fucking love it. It helps me so much in the game.
---
The game is about building a future in a post-apocalyptic America and you're advocating discrimination against other players? That's just wrong.
---
Good. It's bad enough that people were ridiculous enough to pay full price pre-ordering a game that was more red flag that anything worth getting excited about.  
---
It's worse still that people continue to play trash like that when there are much better games out.  
---
Worse still are people who spend money in the dispicable cash shop which now sells play to win items, demonstrating to Bethesda that it's okay to release a worthless piece of crap.  
---
...but the people who actually subscribe to Fallout FU First. Those people deserve to be perpetually grieved.  
---
SO TO ALL YOU MOFOS OUT THERE, TROLLING SUBSCRIBERS: KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
---
Wear* but ya know something crazy? Can't use a DCG in power armor can you? Nahh didn't think so. You guys can wait a week to drop a nuke on the robots
---
Still waiting for what my problem is for having that many hours in the game. You gonna respond or just "play" dumb
---
What companies did you work for and relate that to the context of this game? Did the products you were trying to put a positive spin on have millions of negative reviews against it? Like I said I find it way more likely that there are some really passionate people who enjoy the game going up against a sea of trolls who can't stand it then Bethesda even giving PR in the context you are speaking of a second took. If anything it's obvious that Bethesda is pretty bad at PR to begin with.
---
maybe I should add a /s, you guys are thick as ***
---
Ps4 pro and 1 in 3 times something catastrophic happens to my game during the event.
---
Doesn't work for me as well.
---
I've tried to equip both death &amp; drop bag in the atomic shop but it still look like the vanilla paper bag in game.
---
The wheels are already in motion boy. Groypers are in charge now
---
Free salt here everyone, come get your free salt. Op is providing us by the pound- just wait for the tears to dry up.
---
Oh I could care less about that and all this bs drama, but if you have a private server, why you dropping a nuke on a public event in a public server? Go to your private and drop a nuke there if you don't want the event
---
Wow. Someone needs to get out more üòÇ
---
So lol...you really just want to be playing a fucking fallout game. When the whole fucking point of 76 was fallout online
---
It was so worth it
---
You couldn't have made that sound any less evil?
---
Change your little icon to the fallout first one
---
Suggestions like this are why Fallout 1st exists
---
You almost got me there. Nice :)
---
I am to lazy to do it- but it‚Äôs kinda funny.
---
No issues here, works fine - Xbox
---
Sounds good
---
I've got no problem with the multiplayer aspect but if you're going like a child and try to make the game unenjoyable, why should I subjugate myself to it?
---
I have really sold anything because I don't have anything for sale. Though my Stash is stuffed with Stimpaks and RadAway...ü§î
---
Also, I've gotten 2300+ hours in 76. If I wanted to just play a single player game, I dont think I'd have that many hours.
---
majority share,modders currently get nothing (my latest has cost me 300 to make) so getting a percentage would be good
---
üòÇ
---
So yea you and the thousands of people who follow this subreddit for no other reason then to trash the game are just assholes and it would be nice to those of us who actually do enjoy it if you would go away. You can believe your conspiracy all you want but obviously the game hasn't died like so many predicted. The community just keep chugging along despite the hate from those who don't even play the game. So do the math buddy stop with this crazy BS and endless whining that not everyone is on your side.
---
If your buying a pc prebuilt pc of any kind, just reinstall windows with the  default windows image, windows 10 keys are dirt cheap and work fine on multiple machines at once.
---
If you are a student you probably have a dreamspark account or whatever Microsoft call it these days and can get a key for every version of Windows for free.
---
MDMA can make anything enjoyable
---
They also aren‚Äôt going to adjust daily for Fx rates. Also there are a lot of weird things going on in the government right now with tarriffs or expected additional taxes levied on foreign imports (including software). This doesn‚Äôt come down to greed but more companies trying to manage the uncertainty going on politically that will affect how they sell their product. If they needed to increase prices by 20% 3 months from now it would cause even bigger outrage.
---
It gets lonely at the top
---
NZ is really just a state of Australia. 
---
We send all the good rugby players there and half the good netballers.
---
Multiplayer may play a huge part for others but isn't required to enjoy or play that game. I paid so I could  finally take workshops and do my favorite events again without being bothered by others.
---
If you are ever helping a low level out? Personally it weighs like nothing so I don‚Äôt see the point in dropping something and forever blocking off an area on the map. And what if they ever decide to expand that faction in future DLC?
---
So, I've put probably about 700 hours into the game by this point, this mad screaming about a 9$ monthly subscription isn't because of the price. People are upset, and rightfully so, at the principle. It's well known that the gaming industry as a whole lately has been moving towards less friendly forms of generating steady revenue post launch. People are angry that the game they purchased, whether it be day 1 or months down the line, is still unstable, and lacking significant content updates. It was also some really, really bad timing to delay one of those aforementioned updates, but right after release the subscription service. People are also mad that what you get with the service are things people have asked for since day 1. There's also the fact of the matter that Bethesda(And seemingly any other company that said this) had promised cosmetic only microtransactions. Not only was that promise(won't lie, expected it to happen) broken, but one of the features that had been highly requested consistently was lied about as to why it couldn't be done before.  
---
TL:DR Yeah, I don't blame people for being mad, and without reaction to an action, there's no chance for anything to change.(though I doubt anything will change anyway)  
---
Some like, idk, afterthoughts or some shit.  
---
What I would've done(aside from releasing a game that wasn't broken) was also delay the release of the subscription service, and made the Wastelanders update top priority, make it the update that legitimately makes people happy. Then, I would've released the service alongside the update, with a few differences to what you get from it. I would've kept the monthly Atoms you get the same, but I would've also allowed the holders to earn double the Atoms they would normally get from the weekly/daily challenges. The scrapbox would've been free(and worked), included within the Wastelanders update. The private server would be the same(and work. The same because, they do cost money), however, it would've been announced that servers able to be ran by players using their own hardware were coming(and work). I really don't know what I'd do with the tent thing, seems silly and tacked on honestly. I would've also not included re-hashed content from older games as exclusive benefits, it would be brand new cosmetics instead. I mean, that all seems fine, right? Not a bad option, if it were done properly, on a game that worked properly, and had content, and just... had like 5 more years to finish baking in the oven. Fuck I tried hard to not get super toxic, cuz I really could've lmao but yeah, idk.   
---
TL:DR on afterthoughts, subscription wouldn't include things that a majority wanted free from day 1, and would've been also delayed with the major content update that should've taken its place.  
---
TL TL DR DR Bethesda deserves the criticism 100%, maybe in some cases more creative, but they're not immune to their products being reviewed by customers.(Kinda comes with y'know, putting products out there in general)
---
Well this got long eh? Hope it didn't suck at least
---
I don‚Äôt know, I just hear a lot of people experiencing similar issues with Other games. I don‚Äôt own one personally so I probably shouldn‚Äôt even be commenting, but this is why i hear.

---
I figure they're doing the event and its just more fun with more players?
---
About 25% of camps seem to be FO1st. Maybe 15-20%. But its a lot more than I thought it would be based on my last few days of camp jumping.
---
The motive is to make money like they do on all their outfits. They are a business. They want to sell outfits that are appealing. They sold something people want. How is this any different than the mechanist outfit or anything else? Getting this upset over a video game is ridiculous.
---
Looks like it‚Äôs not in yet but will be later.
---
Define a ‚Äúfinished game‚Äù?
---
In fact i am pretty certain it does the reverse
---
I was seeing like 50% at least myself. The event is much easier to run on a private sever but I guess it would depend if you have people to play it with- I play with a player faction and we will doing it with the three of us. Every time we tried public it would crash (I would assume because so many people and all the explosions)
---
I've noticed roofing taking up quite a chunk of budget and I think the conduits are quite heavy on it too.
---
I had to scrap the entire upper floor of my camp last night in an effort to reclaim space and the rewiring job is on the cards for tonight.
---
Is there any product in the world with thisucj negative spin against it? We have a health insurance system in the United States that kills people everyday but even putting a positive spin on that seem easier than doing it for fallout 76. If there are people paid for PR they certainly aren't going to be the ones defending it on reddit. It's going to be those with a platform to promote the game, not some kid with a BA in business for Indiana state.
---
Yup sounds like it
---
Per fridge, and you can build more the one. I have three fridges fulllll of mothman cup cakes
---
Whaaat
---
So your argument is not well thought through basically is what I'm trying to say.
---
Never bought this trash :D
---
Yeah haha. 
---
Another tip! The scrapping robot is one per camp/workshop. 
---
If you have a private server def built a scrap bot per workshop for all that wonderful junk!
---
performance optimisation 
---
invite friends to your server 
---
NPCs (with factions)
---
being able to join factions 
---
more pvp options (turf war between factions)
---
proper economy
---
The exchange rates have been quite stable for a long time now, so sorry but that is not a good enough excuse. And for some reason only Bethesda is charging this much more. So either all the other companies are too stupid to see that they have to be more expensive or Bethesda is calculating wrong... And no making something more expensive with a good reason.. like higher taxes/ tariffs is something we are used too and we dont blame the innocent party for raising the prices.
---
Clearly you have no idea what you are talking about, I‚Äôm sorry but exchange rates haven‚Äôt been this volatile in 30 years.
---
Not everyone.
---
Way to many itchy trigger fingers. It‚Äôs all about getting a hit in before everyone else kills what ever enemy. We can‚Äôt stop everyone but we all need to get a confirmed hit in and step back and watch the world burn hahahaha
---
Exactly. They are playing themselves only, and I can‚Äôt wait to see the egg on their faces
---
So you‚Äôve averaged almost 6.5 hours of daily play to play a multiplayer game to pay to play alone.
---
To be fair you seem like a nice person if you like the game that‚Äôs fine I own it too cause I wanted to give it a shot and didn‚Äôt like it personally
---
You see the point here is one Bethesda did not care to fix the game before putting in monetary systems, they did not care to help the modders before helping themselves.
---
I'm all for modders getting paid and I'd praise Bethesda to high heaven if they gave you a fair share, but they do the opposite.
---
Modders not getting paid is one thing, but that doesn't mean Bethesda is the good guy here because they take advantage of a bad situation for modders, in order to enrich themselves and add nothing to the loyal player base.
---
Also downvote all you want, not criticising Bethesda is how we end up here. And you people deserve fo76.
---
But remimber at the end there is a legendary bot you have to hit a few times to get its loot
---
We don‚Äôt need slack- we have unlimited stash space and a cool tent we can pop anywhere.
---
It was pretty fun! I just ran around with my laser gat only stopping to load haha
---
In the CAMP build menu there are 5 different pumpkin racks. After comparing the reward photos with the options in the camp build menu, the "Empty Rack" does not appear to be there. Did perhaps the empty rack plan wasn't added to the list provided or can this be obtained from a different source? Wondering if maybe it just didn't get added at all.
---
i wasnt the person who down/up vote your post
---
Fallout First players deserve every bit of pushback for buying a shitty product as they can. I'd give you the same shit for buying a modern day Konami or EA product. Glad to see people who wasted their money and telling Bethesda its ok to continue shitty anti consumer practices getting pissy when they get ganged up on online
---
and they certainly dont have any kind of track record of going back on what they said...
---
I know, I'm not addressing you in that paragraph, sorry for not being clear
---
Yeah exactly. Just hold the fire button your bound to help the event succeed hahaha
---
The scrapbox will NEVER be free, it is the driving force behind a subscription.  Inventory management in free to play games is the biggest draw card in terms of cash shop spend.  Make no mistake, Fallout 76 is employing a free to play model just like one of their other games you may have heard of called Elder Scrolls Online.  
---
I will give you one guess what the most desired item is in that Elder Scrolls Online, yep, an unlimited crating bag.  I'll give you another guess on how you obtain the unlimited crafting bag, yep, by paying a subscription.  ESO players have been asking for the crafting bag to be able to be purchased in the cash shop (or its version of an Atom Shop), nope, players have suggested they'd pay $30, $40, $50 dollars for a one time purchase the crafting bag.  Nope.  
---
Inventory management, cash shop 101.  Introduce a tonne of items or materials in the game, many of which are used for crafting, etc.  Limit what the player can carry, via bags, weight, etc.  Introduce an 'unlimited' carry bag!  Put it behind a subscription and ONLY a subscription.  
---
Profit.
---
or jelly can be that ingredient...
---
My green laser blended well as well with the event :)
---
*raises glass of champagne in your direction
---
*tips white wolf fedora*
---
Seems lie most costumes count for the event. You only need to wear the outfit or the headgear. The event tells you to pick up one from the box if it doesnt count.
---
For the challenge its more specific. Says mask and costume but doesnt include common sense stuff like skull outfit with the pint size slasher mask. So im stuck with all skullies
---
Is it worth it when those features are broken anyway? I cant comment, I usually pay for fully functioning services
---
Ahh I figured it was a rare reward and didn't ready the whole list. 
---
It's a bad habit of skimming information.
---
Thank you friend.
---
Surely such price gouging is criminal??
---
Gg Bethesda
---
I don‚Äôt know. They aren‚Äôt the only ones doing it from what I see. If you think it‚Äôs too expensive, don‚Äôt buy it. That‚Äôs how these things should work. That‚Äôs capitalism. Demand should drive pricing. If nobody buys they would have to adjust prices.
---
Same reason people dropped nukes on the Purveyor when she first came out. It's human nature not FO1st players. 
---
Hell if Grahm wasn't hiding at V76 he'd have been nuked as well. I also bet the next new group event will be nuked.
---
Out of curiosity how fast of leveling is this?
---
If you insist, but this sub would lead people to belive that 5 people in total have fallout 1st, where as it looks closer to about 40% of the entire playerbase
---
I play alone now cause most of my friends moved on to other games which I dont have.
---
downvoting happened to me on the skyrim mods forum i had -50 comment karma and couldnt comment untill approved because i said hopefully enai can get into creation club,most mod users dont like modders getting paid for some reason they like youtubers getting money (they might think they make the mods lol)
---
Holy sh\*\* that is a lot. Is that kinda thing normal for game pricing?
---
I dont get ganged up on tho lool
---
I dont use usd either I use euro, but being aware of why a thing is priced a certain is always good right?
---
Thank You!
---
I made a few thousand in sales yesterday mostly in ammo and a tenderizer mod plan
---
That's what I'm talking about. The group event that is up right now for a week. The people nuking are the same people I'll sell the items for 40k+ to tho, and it was a fo1st player, it was an observation, not an indictment. Just doesn't make a lot of sense, but I'll happily drop nukes on their bases or grief or whatever
---
Yes, it's worth it.
---
None of the features are broken tho? Soooooo
---
Because it is FREE DLC. **NOTHING THAT IS FREE WILL EVER WORK PROPERLY** in this game. They don't care putting out broken shit, especially when it's free.   
---
THIS WILL NEVER CHANGE. They had a year to turn the boat around, they didn't. Please, for your own well being, do not expect them to make something that "just works" in the future. Nothing we'll get will be properly working. The sooner you realize this, the lesser you'll raise your blood pressure. This game will remain broken until they abandon it. Do not expect improvement.
---
Dude I just played a guy was snoring on his mic.
---
At least get rid of that Raider tag.
---
This would be fun, but I'd rather they keep to Canon as much as possible
---
They have said over and over again wastelanders will be free. Yea yea repair kits blah blah. It‚Äôs going to be free. Guaranteed. 
---
And you aren‚Äôt required to additional money to play the game so I don‚Äôt really understand your point. It more sounds like this game just isn‚Äôt really anymore fun for your crew. That‚Äôs cool, hope you find something else you can enjoy.
---
Can we just all get along when I post fallout 76 roasts I‚Äôm mostly just making memes but you guys are hating on eachother
---
No? I love the raiders in the fallout series, why should I get rid of my favorite tag for my favorite faction?
---
tis a sad tale indeed
---
Because players have always used The Whitespring to generate nuked fauna, flux and higher level/glowing/legendary enemies. Maybe better to ask Bethesda why they decided to stick the event at the games most popular nuke zone instead of doing one at Pumpkin House where it might have made a bit more sense.
---
But I wanted it and I like financially supporting my favorite game?
---
Yeah man. Fuck this guy
---
I also believe it will be free but it could very well be released a week or two earlier for F1st members.. Or killing NPC only has consequences on private worlds etc. something like that isn't too unlikely.
---
And yet you keep getting upset over my criticism. So upset that you downvoted me when I said to put it in the friggin' cash shop! I mean, are you for real? I guess you're ridiculous too. Your counter arguments certainly are. I'm all for them making money.
---
It's locking it behind an expensive service they knew wouldn't be popular.
---
Let me put it in perspective. Marvel Heroes, before it launched put out a preorder pack that contained all the characters. It was over $100. They then took the Black Symbiote Spider-Man costume, and locked it behind this package. Because it wasn't enough to just sell the costume. They needed to put it in the most expensive package to push those sales.
---
What this should tell you, is that Bethesda knew this deal was crap, so they finally pulled out that costume they had refused to touch, and put it in the package so that people who wanted it would have to plunk down the extra money. It's skeazy. You know it is. Or maybe you really don't. Either way you refuse to learn.
---
If you are good at hiding you should be able to get at least 400xp each match so you can do the match for each skin to see what‚Äôs required. That one isn‚Äôt out yet. I can‚Äôt look up now which order it is but they‚Äôll all be available to earn by nov 3 and you‚Äôll have until the 12 I believe to earn them.
---
[This is an example of what OP is talking about.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/500304724?t=04h23m49s)
---
However it is not 100%.
---
Could definitely be earlier for 1st (might explain the 1st name, and I honestly don‚Äôt have a problem with that). Totally agree there. I don‚Äôt think gameplay will be any different.
---
But it feels good playing on my private server while I'm wearing my baby seal fur pyjamas and sipping shark fin soup.
---
Sorry, but I'm straight. Not my type
---
I did not downvote you
---
I was supporting you?
---
Really!? I missed that, hilarious üòÇ
---
How much you get for selling to vendor bots for the serums?
---
Breh, I had no way of telling which "this guy" you were talking about.
---
So you like supporting greed and lies then.  
---
I can't believe what I'm reading.
---
Yeah some people just can't grasp the concept of buying something you want and can afford, if you can't or don't want to... Don't... Pretty simple really.
---
I've never once felt lied to? And I mean, I'm a greedy cunt on occasion so yeah I guess I would support it.
---
Stop telling people how to spend their money, you come across like an idiot when you do. Fallout 1st does NOT affect YOUR ability to enjoy the game, it doesn't put any gameplay behind a paywall so if you don't like it don't get it.
---
And this is coming from someone who doesn't have the sub btw but I know not to police what people want to buy with their own hard earned cash.
---
I just bought it and it worked, didn‚Äôt equip it or anything.
---
The problem is you. PC is literally the most elitist, toxic gaming-platform community known and you just proved that in one sentence.
---
How is the deal crap? You get twice as many atoms as you would by not buying the sub with annual subscription pricing. A 1 month subscription gives more atoms +the outfit than the mechanist bundle lol. It‚Äôs $13 for 1650 atoms isn‚Äôt a bad deal for people who buy atoms. 
---
I personally didn‚Äôt buy it‚Äôs just a video game dude
---
See, I understand that. I wasnt sure if you misunderstood me or I you. Moral of the story, I'm with you. Fuck OP.
---
i usually have issues with the quick swap button (left arrow), it causes the game to freeze and when the lag is over, im usually surrounded by ghouls..
---
general fps drops as well, especially in whitesprings, but i believe it is a render issue
---
Completed it 8 times on old ps4. A bit of lag, especially when lighting pyres, but no crashes.
---
Make sure to take some royal jelly with you for lubricant purposes.
---
Ok Megamind take it down a notch
---
I have a problem with it because of the inevitable spoilers that will come with it...
---
we don't need to buy anything cause we can just make it ourselves with all this storage
---
There is way too much stuff exploding during the event to sleep!
---
I kept forgetting that I can't run through the WS garden because the game will freeze, regardless of the event, this is why I have stopped going there in the first place. I now have 1 of 4 attempts successfull and am disencuraged to try this event any more. I am sure I will try again, but for now I just can't be bothered to be let down over and over again having to restart the game. I am on Xbox fyi.
---
Yess! I can't change weapons or I will die. I've had this problem for over 4 months. My low level characters don't have this problem tho. Not sure on the jet pack, I don't use it much anymore üò¢
---
Germany has high prices for a lot of things. I cant really compare it to the states since I haven't been there since 2002. But in Germany it is also very important where you are and what you want to buy.
---
8 times, no crashes.
---
Shut up
---
I‚Äôm going to quit Reddit for awhile when it‚Äôs released.
---
It seemed like everything was absurdly expensive. I couldn‚Äôt believe what they charged for Xbox games, it was like 70‚Ç¨ or so new. I forget exactly
---
RPG‚Äôs are all I play man, but the outer worlds was very reminiscent of games like fallout new Vegas, dragon age origins, deus ex.
---
It‚Äôs not a huge open world, but the smaller areas are more intricate and detailed, and what there is to explore is so great.
---
Characters are actually cool, dialogue tree like you said is really awesome.
---
For some reason The Outer Worlds really resonated with me, and again, I actually get into it all at the beginning, but that‚Äôs because I was so used to new age RPG‚Äôs and looter shooters.
---
Fallout 76 I am in love with, but it runs poorly on my PS4. I‚Äôm level 116, but I‚Äôve taken a massive break from it. Like you, I am really hoping Wastelanders is special, I‚Äôve dedicated a lot of time and had a lot of great moments on Fallout 76, some of which has been the best gaming experiences I‚Äôve had in gaming period.
---
About 750 xp for the first 2, the rest aren't out yet.
---
There are some pretty insane chain explosions in this event from cars and the mines. Add into the fact that everyone is so into it right now it makes sense your machine is chugging. I would put down your gattling laser for something else. They can be super harsh in queen battles and can often personally disconnect you even on a xbox x, this event is way more intense. 
---
I only had one disconnect in the 8 times I tried it today. I was able to stagger it to get multiple ones in. I only disconnect once when three people were using gattling explosive lasers around me.
---
mfw eso+ is cheaper than Fallout 1st (at least in my country)
---
i got it on at leat 10 chars so llooks like its common drop
---
So the infinite Scrapbox, Survival Tent, monthly Atoms to possibly buy other ease of life gamplay changes and any potential future mods being put behind an overpriced server has absolutely no effect on gameplay?
---
Care to explain how?
---
that i did. set it as dropped loot.
---
what are you talking about? I'm slaughtering and doing dance emote over the proles.  I wasted two groups of 4 last night. one guy stayed behind and called me a racial slur and tried to say he was doing it for plans and didn't know I was there. put a rail in his brain after he hid in a truck from so the rads my quad gamma was throwing. I melted his two buddies with a plasma. Bring it man.. PS4 is like a giant daycare. I'm anti bloody and anti stealth. I wish those two t coat cancelling sub school shooters would come for me.
---
i'm on ps4.
---
Explain how this statement doesn't make you a moron
---
Thank you sir for the list
---
which bethesda game in the past 10 years was improved/fixed by bethesda itself? 
---
it was all community work that fixed those games - and that you cant mod a MMORPG, bethesda is stuck on its own 
---
and bethesda is not well versed at fixing bugs on its own.
---
Can you explain how a subscription service that can't be obtained through the mtx shop violates the statement that the mtx shop will only contain cosmetics?
---
I live in Germany. I just haven't been in the US since 2002
---
If you want to buy Games in Germany you have to know where to get them. The wrong sore can make 30-40 Euro difference for example
---
Haven‚Äôt noticed the stash issue but didn‚Äôt get any from dross toss even though the targets were ticked off as hit through.
---
Perk card loadouts
---
The ability to see a persons level when hovering over their camp.  (So I don‚Äôt fast travel to find 57 identical hats for sale)
---
4 and 5 star legendarys
---
Higher level enemies
---
Quick question (hist returning after several months away), does the collector bot collect from the extractors or just around the general area at a workshop?
---
I would really like to see that
---
No
---
Yearly/monthly.
---
I'm sure it'll give you a date of subscription billing. Usually after you pay. Just take a peek. Good luck.
---
No issues on my private server. And if you have other friends that have servers you can jump to them and do the event again. We just did 5 in a row till we wanted a 5 min break.
---
It collects from a general area but not really- I‚Äôve locked mine into a dark corner by its self and the box still fills up. You can let it run around like a free range hen or cage it like I do and it still produces. It doesn‚Äôt need to be built over a resource like a extractor does. 
---
:)
---
Not unless you are a  overly sensitive pedantic ragemaster with a superskill in twisting and turning words all kinds of crazy ways.
---
Thanking you kindly
---
Idk why ppl are down voting you anyway.
---
No problem, and welcome back! It‚Äôs a great time to play.. it‚Äôs only going to get better!
---
Did they say it would have unique sounds?
---
How many of the "survival" perks are you using all the time? Pack Rat, Good With Salt, Green Thumb, Butchers Bounty, Thru Hiker, Traveling Pharmacy etc? How many crafting or looting perks do you always have on; hacking, lockpicking, weapon/armor crafting or repair? 
---
Do you have a build: pistols, shotguns, melee, big guns, rifles? Do you have points invested in these perks to increase damage? Do you have legendary weapons that suit your build? If you use VATS a lot, have you invested in VATS or critical damage perks?
---
Can't remember the last time I had that happen
---
i did my 250 yesterday before the 750 was added, i had to start from 0 in this scenario.
---
tonight once the 1.5k becomes available im doing the 750 to see if it will start at 750 or 0
---
I thought people could use a safe space to rant about how 76 has timed their entire lives, a support group if you will.
---
All the things you listed are either cosmetic (like most stuff in the atom shop) or doesn't affect gameplay like the tent (which is just a portable camp, who cares). The only thing that could make gameplay somewhat easier is the scrap box but speaking for myself I manage *ok* with the stash limit.
---
Ease of life things like the fridge and the scrap station I got from the atom shop with the atoms I earned in game without paying a single penny, and I'm not interested in the cosmetic skins or private servers since my friends are not really interested in video games so I don't need a server to play exclusively with them.
---
As for the mods who know how those will or won't be supported or how they're implemented.
---
But seriously dude chill, it's a video game. Go outside and enjoy the sunshine or something.
---
afaik nobody has it yet because of ants, we were grinding them after our raid clears in the last washout but only got about 100. (i think im at 14x total)
---
Great build guide right here folks.
---
Looking forward to seeing your other build guides.
---
What did the deleted tweet say he was responding to?
---
Unsolicited advice- if you don‚Äôt have the $12.99/mo available in the bank or can‚Äôt afford $100 for the year you should not be buying the service.
---
It‚Äôs a fun game, I like it. Works well on my end.
---
Leaving techie stuff like server stability aside:
---
The often mentioned account bank.
---
A reforge legendary option. You can pick one modifier to reroll but doing so prevents you from rerolling the other 2 to hold the system in check.
---
In a similar vein, an upgrade legendary option so if you had a level 30 one, you could keep it and make it end game level.
---
The addition of legendary power armour. I know we can do it via the raid, but it would nice if the scrip kits could be applied to any type of armour so you could take your chances.
---
A rejoin your last server option.
---
Couple of others - allow challenges tone viewable from the title screen and make a progress screen for NW that shows all upcoming rewards up to level 100 so you can see at a glance. (A bit like the way Fortnite shows the battle pass rewards)
---
A bit of fluff this one - change the character select screen to display the character model itself and allow the appearance change to.be used while not logged into a server.
---
dupers used them to dupe so they are broken as of now. Dupers couldn't resist putting items in there and duping them by a method I won't explain.
---
Absolutely, I love both.
---
You can‚Äôt switch weapons or you die? Wtf is wrong with ps4. Lol
---
How about both? You can play the event and maybe grab any missing ones from the atom store? Though this could incentivise lower drop rates.
---
tons
---
Maybe they do care about fallout which is why they are paying so you don‚Äôt have to.
---
Synth, the word is synth.
---
WS is a nuke hot spot the reality is it was dumb to even put the event there. They could've used Grafton or Watoga.
---
People actually use different.bank accounts for different things, grow a little will you?
---
&gt;Drops in water make ripples
---
But whales make waves
---
One advice to avoid the bug, don't rush to the scrap box until everything is well loaded
---
I sold 5k in a couple hours before. all my ammo is 1c and bulks are never more than 15c. I keep plans cheap. hell last week someone bought my 35 bottles whiskey...lol...well hopefully it was just a dead night of sales yesterday
---
I don't know who that is but I support your use of the word cunt. Now for us aussies are you referring too him as a good cunt or a shit cunt?
---
It's also laggy as fuck for my potato PC
---
It specifically asked if you could buy a legendary mini gun in the shop. His response was no, only cosmetic. I don‚Äôt know why people keep pulling this out of context.
---
You make a good point, sadly the idiots can't see that, they are like mindless sheep.
---
Most people go inside to vandalize it too? Robots have aggro
---
I just got a halloween paint. It popped out so fast i couldnt see what paint its for.
---
I enjoyed it immensely when I did it (and didnt crash out, anyway). Couldnt see much through all the explosions, fending off ghouls when trying to trick or treat and had great fun shooting the robots knowing I wasnt going to get chased through the resort by a hoard of angry bots afterwards!
---
Pity it is a bit laggy though.
---
looked fine to me. saw lots of players on map. my prices are always good. I was just worried the unlimited storage for 1st players is affecting sales.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know why the fuck this is being downvoted. I‚Äôm having the exact same experience and I‚Äôve almost had enough.
---
It‚Äôs a game.  It isn‚Äôt the Alamo.  It isn‚Äôt even Occupy Wall Street.  It‚Äôs people mad at the monetization of a game.  I get it, but why linger on something that amounts to literally no real impact?  Say your peace and move on.
---
Speak with the only thing corporations care about, your wallet.  The only thing these redditors are doing is turning people away from their ideals by abusing them for no reason other than buying something in a game.
---
good, I hope to move some stuff. I generally sell well. I don't charge a lot for stuff which is why my stuff moves usually quickly.
---
It‚Äôs $12.99. Seriously lol. If money isn‚Äôt a problem just put more in the account. Being at risk of overdraft is never smart.  If I was living paycheck to paycheck the last thing I would ever do is buy something like this. I fully support people who buy the sub but really...
---
my stuff always sells cause I don't ask for a ton. 1 cap all ammo and bulks at no more than 15caps. most plans are 25caps to 75. recipes I sell at 12 caps. I sell lots of drinks. someone bought all bottles whiskey I had last week. im just worried about 1st affecting sales. its a fun part of the game for me anyway.
---
There is a 4 to 6 second lag after changing weapons. Don't know what causes it, but only my higher level character has it.
---
Because it's clearly named Fallout 1st because those features are gonna come **1st** to the non-paying ~~leeches~~ customers.

So you can crouch/stealth on the roof and never be endangered?

---
Honestly, some people here on reddit are also really close to being a shill or either complete fanboys, not only in this sub.
---
I have on my main account atleast 4 different people that always post the same glowing and positive EGS stuff in every post on the big "gaming" sub here, its obvious thanks to RES that they have hundreds of downvotes from me and many others, but also many upvotes, their comments are always "controversial" in terms of upvoting and downvoting but the content is almost always the same.
---
In that sub that shall not be named, i was banned on 3 different accounts each for life, because i called them out and said word for word on one occasion "dude, you sound like a shill, you disregard everything OP said and just play it like its the perfect store... either you are paid for, blind or just a huge Epic fanboy..." 
---
Sure it wasnt my nicest comment, but i got immediately banned for life from that sub, for "harassment and threats" because i used the two worst words you can use in that sub... "shill" and "fanboy" both get you banned immediately if you used them and banned for life if you were banned atleast once before in that sub...
---
Its fucking ridiculous how hard some moderators are against anyone calling out people that seem to be shilling, sure i cant prove it, but if you check their history its ridiculously suspicious... especially with OPs post and experience in mind.
---
Thats exactly my reasoning, it yields a lot of xp and potential legendaries. Not tryna be an ass to those who want to do the event.
---
That‚Äôs an easy one. They. Don‚Äôt. Give. A. Tiny. Fuck.
---
Amen.
---
Buying a year seems like the best bet. Even without the scrap box and such it's basically $8.25 usd for 1650 Atoms a month. Which isn't bad or basically $0.27 a day.
---
yep me too, I visited camps. lots of scrapboxes. well hopefully I just hadoff day. my prices are good and I normally rake in 1,000 caps and sometimes 5k with moving ammo and materials bulks. I even sell drinks and meds. sold all my whiskey last week. like over 30 bottles
---
the weapon switch lag is definitely the worst, its so irritating!
---
The fridge is such a disappointment, I wish I hadn't got it. It's nice expensive decoration tho.
---
Well yeah I mean that's kinda the entire point of this game. Do the same content 300 times in hopes of getting the drop you want lol
---
My 155 lbs fat ass self
---
that's what I worry about. I normally atleast sell ammo. all my stuff generally moves well. hopefully it was just one slow day. I rather enjoy farming whiskey and stuff and someone at some point buys it up that week.
---
Did 3 events OK then the one this morning froze and crashed.  Weak sauce
---
It's called a xbox one. It has nothing to do with network setting idiot, as this has happened to plenty of people. The cars causing disconnects is nothing brand new. As for the suggestions, you can at least figure out with a ounce of common sense that having it in whitesprings isn't the best place to have it. If you are going to comment, at least try using a brain maybe?
---
Doesn't mean they can't do the same thing with the CoA, albeit a more primitive version.
---
Why are you blaming people for playing the game?
---
Seems like another giant oversight on Bethesda's part. Shouldn't be possible to ruin the event so easily in the first place.
---

---
That armor thoughüò≠
---
If a player is spending more than $9 a month on Atoms buying FO1st is a no brainer. If a player wants a private server same logic.
---
I'll be buying Fallout First when Wastelanders comes out. It'll be nice to have a private server for the new content. Right now it's pointless to me as I'm already in my end game and have been for some time.

Thank you ! Next on the agenda is a heavy weapons/PA build

Got through it 3 times without issue last night then this morning - boom crash

Right, either Hummingarrow is a liar, delusional, or wants to brag about his 5000 dollar pc that it would take to run this mess of a game.
---
The tent does not affect gameplay?
---
Can you explain your reasoning how portable workbenches that have no building cost does not impact gameplay, when you also have the scrapbox at every point you need to lighten your load?
---
It really is, Im stuck with shite unyielding combat armor ü§£

I‚Äôm experiencing this as well

I‚Äôm sure the private servers have no problem at all

over 40% of their expenses go to management &amp; salaries, and though they're not technically a charity, if they were that'd give them a horrid score/rating by organisations that rank/watch charities.
---
I just uninstalled it the other night. i could have 3 or more games installed and it would take less than f76.
---
i'm not trying to poke fun at people but seriously why would anyone still play this game? I came on the reddit to read what the current state is before i trade it in for less than 4$ to buy the outer worlds lol.
---
Great idea. Will never happen though, because there is no money to be made. We'll be very lucky if we get a broken mess of a Christmas event as free DLC.
---
Someone hasn't been paying attention.
---
The Aussie, euro and UK prices are similar when accounting for current conversion. The US prices are much cheaper than the rest.

You are literally the gaming equivalent of the lumpenproletariat

Please take your ignorance out of here. Sadly "I think this" funnily enough doesn't actually count for much when you're some random lol take care troll!
---
I participated in the Mischief Night event about 10 times, but the Sentry bot was always 1star.  
---
Will the Sentry bot appearing at this event be 1star or higher? I wasn't able to confirm that the star of the sentry bot changed because most of the players were attacking towards the sentry bot.
---
To end up with a half full match on pc...
---
I've waited long enough for them to fix this game.  Move on.  Coming to this reddit thread about the game not working right and being a laggy pile of shit has done nothing at this point but you can pay some monies for Fallout 1st!  To those still playing the game your just going to have to deal with it pretty much I would assume.
---
Something being the norm doesn't mean it's not unfair and we shouldn't complain about it.

ITT: people not realizing that they shouldn‚Äôt have to pay $12/mo so they can play a multiplayer game that probably should have been a single player game in the first place as a single player game...
---
I mean wasn‚Äôt the multiplayer the whole point in the first place? But it‚Äôs so badly implemented that people are spending $100/yr just to escape the supposed main feature of the game...
---
Don‚Äôt spend your money on that garbage, you‚Äôre only encouraging their behavior.
---
I always thought prices in the shop should be at least 50% less and that they'd sell more Atoms if that were the case... 
---
Getting 1650 for $8.33 works for me
---
This is indubitably the best advice I've seen all day. It's indubitably indubitable that Fallout first players heed your fine advice.

*tips top hat in op's direction*

Not gonna lie, that's really fucking funny.

not that my runs mean anything in total, but 11/11 of mine were all 1 star
---
&gt;You're losing me now on the whole death button because before you wouldn't blame the players, but now you would?
---
Ehrm, no... That's not at all what I said but okay.
---
By survival sandbox games standards its not too buggy. Thats my guess.
---
I'm not playing single player tho? My friends do get on and I do talk to others in the game, so your point is invalid.
---
There used to be 3 business models:
---
* Buy the game at regular price, giving you all the content. Extra DLC's would be sold separately.
---
* Buy the game at a lower price point (usually less than half of regular AA game price) and pay a subscription fee between 10/20 dollars.
---
* Play a limited version of the game for free, unlock other features (full version) with a subscription fee between 10/20 dollars.
---
What we see today however, is companies pushing the limits of what they can charge customers for.  
---
In the case of Fallout 76, they've even changed their monetization strategy post release. You can compare this to buying a car, and being told all the options are included. The GPS doesn't work yet, but they'll be fixing that with a free update after your first maintenance round, the salesman told you, and he put it in the contract aswell.  
---
Fast forward a year later, you get maintenance done, and you find the GPS is now turning on, but asking for an authorization code. Your car radio is no longer functional and asking for a code aswell.  
---
So you call your dealer, asking him what that is all about. He replies that they did indeed fix the GPS issue, as the contract stated, but both the GPS and the car radio are now a subscription service, that will be $ 50 per month please.
---
That is what they're doing here, selling a game at full price, explicitly stating that any future content would be included in the price, and then turning around and putting content behind a paywall a year later.  
---
Had they been upfront about this, it would have been a different story, and in the past you always knew what you got into when you bought a game, they were either clearly buy to play, free to play or subscribe to play, and the business model was always clearly communicated.  
---
But today we have this thing called "live service" instead, which seems to mean  "let's see how much money we can shake out of people's pockets, and how often we can change "the rules" for our mediocre service without losing the whales."
---
I can agree with that. Someone has not.
---
&gt;reasoning how portable workbenches 
---
It's a cooking pot (Found all over in the wild) , and the ability to scrap, scrap, not weapons/ armour. Your ignorance on this is enlightening.
---
last couple of times i played it either the server crashed or the game crashed. only thing i noticed that worked ok in the short amount of time i played was the battle royale mode which i have no care for.
---
Zenimax was created by Bethesda... the Tail literally wags the dog in this scenario.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeniMax\_Media#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeniMax_Media#History)
---
&gt;ZeniMax was founded in 1999 by Bethesda Softworks founder Christopher Weaver and Robert A. Altman. It was established as a successor to Media Technology Limited, Bethesda's parent company at the time.
---
I didn‚Äôt even think of that! Good tip!
---
Maybe, but playing solo resuces the.incentives to.buy skins, so maybe it evens.it out.
---
yeah, imagine if everyone demanded that their brand new car actually has 4 wheels. I mean, the nerve that some ~~peasants~~ people have is just mind-boggling.
---
Reread your condescending posts which essentially just criticize or judge other people for having fun with a video game (yes a video game). Right, they are too dumb to realize they are being taken advantage of or thet must be fools to like this game. And wonder if people are sorry to see you go.
---
Thats how this company became that big. First a Horse Armor Dlc, now a Subscription for a Buy2Play Game. People buy everything if the marketing is kinda logical. Thats exactly how the Vaults in Fallout btw got their test objects lol.
---
I was holding off give the game another try when they add the NPCs...
---
I've since noped the hell away from that notion.
---
That's how I view it. Also, wastelanders being delayed is good for me (sucks for everyone else) because I have a huge backlog of games I want to play if Wastelanders had come out I'd have bought a year and wouldn't get a chance to play BL3 or any of the many unopened games I have right now.
---
Work benches are literally everywhere, just learn to manage your inventory or use items that increase your weight limit temporarily... and it having no cost is not significant because caps are VERY EASY to obtain. Have you played the game?
---
my wife and i use 4 accounts (main, her fun, my fun, and an internet purchase)  we keep a $5 balance on the internet purchase account and only transfer money in right before we make a purchase or a subscription continues.  we do it for saftey reasons because some sub services are impossible to get out of without closing the account.  so if we ever have that happen to us again the rest of our accounts dont get fucked over, and we dont keep losing money while fighting it.

---
it works now.
---
While I don't think there's anything they could say to completely fix their pr nightmare, some kind of an apology or action to fix things is still better than doing nothing.
---
Yeah good point. At this point there definitely seems to be a lot of better options out there
---
You do realize that people buying the game altering atomic shop/fo1 items fucks over everyone else that wants to experience the full game they payed for. Your wrong they are specifically putting gameplay behind paywalls and have been since the unstoppables buff. If you cant understand that then you come off as an idiot as well.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been doing that but one account is afk and the other is actually doing event after 3-4 hours being in same server it was left with 2 people so i left 5 mins before it started
---
Are we supposed to know who that is?
---
I mean I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre having fun for you and I bought it for about 20 bucks. I do feel for people who bought the full retail version and sort of got hung to dry over the subscription and the wastelanders dlc being delayed only for them to drop a subscription system that is almost more than Netflix
---
Are you replying to the wrong post?
---
It doesn't affect gameplay, but it affects every future content this company is delievering. By buying into their shit, their statistics say "What we did was awesome and good, people love it. Lets make more, instead of putting in actual playable content". Wastelanders got delayed just because they programmed features for your subscription stuff. Stuff that was wanted for a long time and expected by many that its going to be "free" (buy2pay content) Of Course People are angry about that, no need to white knight a cash grab company. Stealing feedback of your community and selling it, is a real shady business.
---
I guess that's the truth of the situation. They screwed up so badly that there isn't anyway to fix things other than getting rid of the subscription all together.
---
Like previously mentioned you'd be suprised at how much xp you can rack up by just hiding. I hide most of the match and try to get to the final circle before I even attempt my first kill. It's easy to finish in the top 5 like this.
---
And the last post in that thread sums it up pretty well, right?
---
If 100% of a donation goes to my chosen hospital, and the charity discloses the hospital is able to use that money however they see fit... What is the issue?
---
I honestly think because the empire Bethesda has made out of fallout we some times put unrealistic expectations On what fallout should be .I let the game entertain me and right now it's doing just that.i still have alot to learn and challenges to complete and hopefully I can get involved with more teamlike events . despite Bethesda's shortcomings they've still managed to bring the fallout community together in a way that was probably unimaginable only a few years ago.i got the game a year ago and after finishing a game I bought at the same time I just started 76 a few months ago so I've missed most of what everyone has complained about.you can always find ways to rejuvenate your experience or simply take some time off to explore other games out there. Maybe by the time you get back on Bethesda will have had time to catch up.just a thought
---
Oh no, how dare people be mad at greedy anti-consumer practices!
---
I've made my peace with it. Everything they put out is a broken mess and that will never change with this game. BGS will never really make an effort to improve this mess or put in effort to make something that "just works".   
---
Maybe they will release some stuff for FU 1st members that actually works, but do not expect them to release free stuff that is not garbage. This will continue until they abandon the game. Do you actually think wastelanders will be different? I have VERY LOW expectations for it.   
---
I'm not ranting, I have made my peace with it. I crash daily and do not expect it to get better. I do not understand that this has not sunk in with everybody. **IT WILL NOT CHANGE**
---
Funny, because that attitude caused Ubisoft to lose 20% of their stock
---
Yeah ok, go on with your crusade then. Your attitude of policing how people spend their money will make everyone's experience better, my bad.
---
Yeah... was hoping to use the 3D glasses to change up my normal sunglasses look.
---
FO1st is worth the cost for anyone who spends at least $10 on Atoms a month. Which is a lot of people they didn't add the stuff you hate.
---
So people hating being overly milked by Bethesda is a bad thing?
---
üèÖhere's my poor mans gold.
---
Sad to say but you don‚Äôt get much exp for kills

&gt; I'd like to see what's new.
---
Mischief week is fun.
---
because you voted to leave the EU, we can't afford them anymore
---
Wrong person smart guy
---
Yeah NW puts more XP into the amount of time you stay alive.
---
i feel like the game is the equivalent of trying to make a high performance race car from parts in a scrap yard, no matter how much talent or work is put in it they will never be able to put out a quality product with their Frankenstein game engine.
---
If you don't like it just don't get it. It's fine. Just enjoy the game the way you always have and don't worry about other people.
---
Events kind of fun. But causes a lot of lag or even crashes.
---
A couple of the rewards are alright, but pretty underwhelming as Halloween is such an easy opportunity to have some cool creative rewards. But instead it's ugly pumpkins that are just world assets and a pirate costume and suit with pumpkin print.
---
You are already bug proofing.
---
It's called the public release. Now with extra subscription
---
You still don't get enough atoms to buy the color blue for power armor. So yeah, its still a rip off
---
&gt; You do realize that people buying the game altering atomic shop/fo1 items fucks over everyone else that wants to experience the full game they payed for.
---
No it doesn't. They can just keep on playing like they always have.
---
Yeah that's a great thought. Crazy how all the negativity adds up and you forget about the positives. 
---
I really hope that's the case. Some time off until wastelanders or some other updates come out and maybe getting back into it then could do some good
---
Oh thank You , didn't saw that :D
---
Does anyone know if they will have another event night?I had just logged in and I spawned into white spring with s&amp;-t blowing up ,I got killed multiple times about 20 ppl spaying bullets everywhere and cars blowing up ,it was Awesome!! I totally wasn't prepared for that.
---
"You do realize that people buying the game altering atomic shop/fo1 items fucks over everyone else that wants to experience the full game they payed for"
---
Not a guy and as far as I know you're the one who said that so I was addressing you... you think people buying cosmetic items and items that doesn't affect gameplay imo is fu*king you over and imo it doesn't affect you (or me since I didn't buy the sub and probably never will).
---
I stand up for companies who give me products I enjoy and value. Like Bethesda.
---
If you don't like FO76, spend your time and money somewhere else.
---
Stop whining on about how I shouldn't enjoy it, just because you don't. It's not rational.
---
What are the new rewards?
---
Dude you're a dumbass. Enjoy buying legendaries out of the shop in a year.
---
https://youtu.be/QlBmOj4tUiY?t=640
---
Of course everybody is experiencing crashes. What did you expect? That they put out free DLC that is not total garbage? **This level of poor programming is what we can expect for all FREE DLC from now on.** They focus on what makes money. The devs that are making these free events probably do not get the time to do it right. Seriously people, this is how it will be until the end of the game. Only stuff you pay for will be acceptable.   
---
Even with the postponing of wastelanders, I can garantee you that is will also be a broken mess OR locked behind a paywall. It might be a bit better than this event, but not much.
---
What do you mean "gave to retailers"? Retailers buy the game and resell it to their customers at a markup don't they? That's why so many places were desperate to sell their physical copies of fallout 76 sitting in their inventory, it's not like they can send the unsold ones back to Bethesda so they discount it to at least make some money back on the investment they made by buying the copies of 76 they thought would sell in their retail store.
---
&gt;I did not realize exactly how toxic people are in this game, and I've been around since the old griefing days of destroying bases, slap damage, and killing folks across the map by taking their workshops. 
---
To be fair this is the least toxic game I've ever played. Most players are super helpful and yes I've been around since day 1. 
---
What we have on this sub lately is just people trying to stir up shit over what they see as an unfair advantage for FO1st members. Basically they can't afford $0.27 cents a day.
---
Anyone who vuys Atoms is getting a deal with FO1st they had no control over the extra content and currently the "Salt de Jour" is to act like there is a class battle in the game. Spoiler there isn't.
---
I'll be joining FO1st when Wastelanders comes out. Not for the scrap box or the mobile camp but so I may enjoy Wastelanders as Fallout has always been intended to be. That is to say playing solo with no distractions or lag.
---
this is normal on wednesdays. as i remember they do this every wednesday. atleast where i live, Denmark
---
imo don‚Äôt try to pull off hybrid builds , just find the class you‚Äôre best at and then make your build solely about that class.
---
&gt;
---
It‚Äôs like being mediocre at 2 classes as opposed great at one class.
---
Yea I‚Äôm not clicking on some mystery YouTube link
---
Sad. But i can feel you. Happen nearly the same with my best mate.
---
its because you shoot it too fast. let it be in the begining and it will start to "generate" stars. ive tried one where i was 3 stars.
---
its not sure every time. but in all my runs, it had 2. and one where it had 3
---
Well, it won't be that easy when there are at least 5 people everytime ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt you keep a healthy balance and then adjust when you cancel an account? Wouldn‚Äôt that be easier to manage? Seems silly
---
&gt;40% of what goes in does not go out, so statistically, all ins and outs considered, only &lt;60% of donation's value goes through

Goes until the 5th.  Event is at the beginning of every hour.

all the bugs have been solved.
---
and to be fair, it was only a handfull of people that experienced any bugs or issues in the beginning
---
Agreed
---
This isn't a story DLC, and you don't get it from the Atom shop...
---
It‚Äôs just been a one off thing for me so far, but they‚Äôre also happy to do it for the challenges that just won‚Äôt register, like the collect three silo code pieces. Best of luck!
---
true. just hope that people know about this. or try and tell them using mic when playing the event
---
Gameplay alternating mods.,.. might work per instance, loot altering mods... won't.. since loot is global

A better title would be don't be a dick. Personal threats make you look like the POS you are.

It's sad the only thing people who do this have in thier lives is a game. They're just pathetic little cellar dwellers who have no life.

Well crap maybe put in ticket

Anyone who was into the Amazon review scams can back you up on read the negative reviews first.

*  get friends - as I said only 1 plays fo76     
---
*  get courier  -  rely on a paid stranger     
---
*  drop / relog - very risky with high amounts of ammo and aid,  no?     
---
*  weight management - what you actually mean is throw things away a fo 1st member doesn't have to. Nice.       
---
*  get a 2nd copy for $10 (or free with many players threatening to quit)  - and a 2nd PS4 for 350 dollars, easy peasy.     
---
*  get FO1st - why not just pay. to. win.     
---
See how this works? Create a problem and sell the solution. You can't tell me it's little effort. I didn't say it's impossible. There's a lot of ground in between little effort and impossibility.
---
Yup. The games guna keep working so long as they keep the servers up. Good observation bud. That has nothing to do with what I said though. I paid to have a game that sells strictly cosmetics. That's what the developers promised and delivered. Now they have added gameplay mechanics behind a paywall. This is what's known as a slippery slope. Now that we the players have given them the green light to add whatever game changing items they want in behind a paywall, they will continue to do so. Do you notice how the candy bowl is 500 atoms? Well we have a punch bowl that is the exact same thing for liquids.... but it was free, because it had a use and wasnt purely cosmetic. Yes we can always enjoy the game f2p and have a blast doing it. But more and more of the game will become inaccessible while people keep buying into this shit.
---
Well don't you just sound like a cool guy.
---
Ad Victoriam.
---
Not possible XD
---
I have a Character that can use every Weapon class... It is possible
---
Except you SHOULD be against fallout 1st because it‚Äôs the epitome of blatant corporate greed slapping the player base in the face. 100$ a year for some atoms and private servers is an abysmal deal, in fact fallout 1st as is is STILL an abysmal deal, and anyone who actually buys into the shit that Bethesda is pulling either has way too much apathy and spending money or is just plain stupid
---
I think the problem is Todd wanting too much out of it and giving it off to some other Bethesda branch in Dallas

3 times I've done the event and just stood there lighting the fire when prompted and got rewards .maybe shoot legendary robot if u want a legendary . I've also done nothing at all and got rewarded .
---
Well so far we have the current one which is based off of the NCR Ranger Combat Armor. There was also a datamined one of the Desert Ranger combat armor which in its last form sported a greener jacket, tan pants, green visor goggles for the helmet instead of red, and a rusted chest plate. Finally there was one listed as Riot Gear. Now although may have a general idea of which appearance this means, there are three forms of it that we may see: 
---
\- basic riot gear which has light shoulder plating, arm guards, and a bullet bandolier
---
\- advanced riot gear which has what i'd call "medium" shoulder plating, arm guards, the bullet bandolier, and a helmet which sports a dual filter system
---
\- Elite riot gear which has heavy shoulder plating, the arm guards, a bullet bandolier, the ammo pouches, the canteen on the waist, the knee guards, the helmet with dual air filters and additional hoses, and a built in helmet radio.
---
Now then, although these Riot Gear and Desert Ranger were mentioned in a datamine, I don't recall if they were listed as being Fallout 1st exclusive, so we may be seeing those two in the atom shop.
---
What did you buy??
---
No loot to be gained if you're referring to loot bags. Mischief Night is a public event so you don't drop anything on death.
---
No, slander is a legal term. Disseminating factually incorrect information as factually correct information for the purpose of defamation of another via spoken word is slander. Publishing said information in printed form is libel. An opinion, whether expressed by a private individual or a rep of a company, is completely subjective and cannot be objectively verified and thus is not a fact. Because it is not a fact it does not meet the necessary standard of libel or slander. An Oblivion rep can announce that they think Bethesda sucks and makes shitty games, but it‚Äôs not slander or libel against Bethesda because it‚Äôs an opinion and not a fact. Their status as a rep for another company doesn‚Äôt give their opinions any more factual standing than that of a random person on the street.

In ESO though you have plenty of storage for free for crafting supplies. It doesn't effect gameplay much in ESO. Ive pretty much never passed up crafting materials i'll actually use and never run out of space. In 76... you can't carry much at all
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
Working as intended to push you to buy private stable server

I have a Junkies/explosive heavy guns build. Maxed out in heavy guns, and related perks, rank 5 demo expert, and grenadier perks as well. I don't use grenades the way I'd hoped to. They are just a lot of effort for little return tbh. You rarely, if ever, find a group of more than 2 mobs within blast distance of a grenade out in the open even with the perks. I honestly find it hard to hit 1 target sometimes. They're more just for fun, and actually are more effective in PvP situations than PvE because PvP targets tent to hold position more than a monster who runs towards you every time. Over all it's a very fun build though. I have a junkies explosive .50 cal (main weapon), Gatling Gun, Harpoon Gun, Minigun, and LMG. With Rank 5 demo expert the explosive damage is actually worth it because all of these weapons shoot so fast. I also have a Junkies/FFR Cryolator, Flamer, Gatling Laser, m79 grenade launcher, auto grenade launcher, fat man, missile launcher and an AAE Gatling Plasma. With Bear Arms rank 3 all of these weapons weight 3 lbs or less each, some under 1 lb. Full health with Vanguard Sentinel Armor, and I switch out a few perks when I get into Power Armor. This character by FAR out DPS my sneak commando, and the rate at with which I can clear out West Tek is probably about as quick as anyone can.
---
I had issues with my game crashing every time I try to log in at the game start-up. Having to reinstall it.
---
That doesn't help me. I have a friend that calls me a whale. And I got to thinking about it, and it would be a cool costume.
---
A ghoul costume would be awesome too, for when I'm shopping at other players canps. üòà
---
So, players can't run the Vault Raid because their characters are getting deleted due to a glitch. You guys don't have the time to fix that, but you do have the time to release a bullshit, unfair, overpriced, middle finger of a subscription service? Hmmm......
---
It's always 1 star like the sloth in fantashan.
---
Same here, was so close to finally getting the dam outfit...i give up
---
That is a crock of shit. In order to get more storage you either have to pay for it or create more mule accounts and they all share one bank space.
---
I took a picture of one of those too üòÇ
---
Were personal threats made? üò≥
---
Good lord, don't give any other money to those idiots üò∞üò®üëé
---
Thats exactly whats happened here. Opening up a new branch with hired Art and Programm Students that dont know anything, while the real company is working on their singleplayer games right now. Its not a bad idea and a great opportunity for youngerst to show what they can do, but Zenimax/Beth policy is tellling them that they need to generate money out of every inch and content they create.
---
The answer is that they are indeed the fourth word of your question
---
Aren't down times usually Tuesdays?
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve picked up three or four of them so far. Except for the shrink ray they appear to be reskins of existing guns and aren‚Äôt really that interesting. They seem significantly weaker than weapons I can tinker and modify myself.
---
Woah chill down dude, did you wrote that out of your own basement? Watch your own attitude you silly Grafton Monster.
---
Sometimes u sell nothing.  Sometimes you sell everything.  Thats business.
---
In all fairness, they also said cosmetic only atomic shop items as well as no subscription model for this game... I'm hoping for the best, preparing for the worst.
---
Well...if you do stupid shit over and over again, you have to expect that stupid shit is going back to you eventually.
---
Anywho is in Fallout Besthesda administration can go F themselves for a change instead of doing it to their fans, my 2 cents.
---
I don't kill the robots because I don't want to have the wrath of a robot army come down on me...however you can do every other task (light fires, graffiti walls, trick or treat and if placed right, blow up the cars without pissing the robots off) without them aggroing. So it's possible for low levels to do this event passively. Just make sure you have some high levels nearby to kill the ghouls lol.
---
Holy crud people definitely over price, heck some charge more then the normal vendors!
---
Buy fallout 1st
---
That's what she said
---
Can confirm up and running on PS4 in Ireland
---
Lol, I can't lie I like the use of "silly Grafton Monster" as a comeback enjoy an updoot.
---
Well played.
---
Ye, that BR mode was the only game adition that Bethesda put some effort into, I liked it but the pc population stopped supporting full games like 3 weeks after it was released, so I stopped playing too.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a game. People‚Äôs lives must be pretty great if this is what they choose to get mad about.
---
Works fine for me...yeah it's pretty laggy but I think that's just Bugthesda and my shitty internet. But it's not crashing/freezing up for me...then again I have a pretty beefy PC.
---
same issues with weapons wheel, but worse - 10 to 20 seconds sometimes.
---
Lag and stuttering, spinning and general control issues have, for the most part gone , since changing the ps4 controller settings to 'wired'. Still an occational heartbeat stop, but way better (problem only evident in fo76, and included controller disconnect and with 3 controllers). Perhaps someone could verify this ?
---
I sold some stuff just a few hours ago. Plans and magazines.
---
So that post you linked to seems butfhurt that a portion of donations might go to pay doctors?
---
I'm sorry but that is deplorable. I only use free range junk because it's the humane thing to do. You are supporting the subjugation of an entire species of junk and treating them like GARBAGE!
---
Shaaaame, shaaaame.
---
it was working the whole day yesterday for me, but now its down
---
How was the ammo economy with this build? Feel like getting 40, 308, 5mm in large quantities would eventually collapse the build. 
---
Thanks for confirming my suspicions on the grenades I have grenadier and fire in the hole but it rarely pays off. I AM curious how effective nuke mines would be. Hate mines but don't know of any grenades better than a nuka grenade.
---
A sense of pride and accomplishment is one credit card and bank loan away.
---

---
I
---
Also the Fallout 4 engine was not really built for multiplayer.
---
Strange. I did a lot of brand ambassador work across the years and I have never come across a job that involved rating products online.
---
Because of the word with the hard R at the end of it.
---
Id like to focus on a single class I just meant I changed my melee build into a rifleman build around lvl 30 and spent another 30 level moving perks and cards around. There are too many cards I think to do like two handed and rifleman and do enough damage to high res enemies like the queen.
---
Ohhhhh, I see. So it would only be different if they tried to make some stuff up that wasn‚Äôt necessarily true?
---
That would be even worse than the current situation. This thread seems to be full of people trying to find a way to get rid of the divide between the haves and the have nots.
---
Making the scrap box and tent for everyone and just private servers behind the paywall the playing ground is even again.
---
Allowing people to buy an extra account wide stash would create even more issues
---
I'd say they're winding the development down, probably aware that this game was a failed experiment, and will be moving swiftly on to the next title.
---
well the "\&gt;" sign ended up making the comment look like a quote, not intended
---
anyway, no, salaries for a charity (program in this case) mean management and such, anything spent before the endpoint has nothing to do with what value reaches the endpoint except for meaning that less gets to the endpoint
---
&gt; I think the problem is Todd wanting too much out of it and giving it off to some other Bethesda branch in Dallas 
---
In Austin, not Dallas. 
---
Don't drag Dallas' name through the mud. Dallas were responsible for one of the few genuine gems of Fallout 76 - the Nuclear Winter battle royale mode.
---
The general management of the game and almost all the bad things associated with game are exclusively the work of BGS Austin. You can't even attribute the good questlines to Austin. That was BGS Maryland's work.
---
&gt;it's hard to see how fallout fans have been let down and taken advantage of with this game.
---
You're right it is hard to see that because no one is being taken advantage of.
---
FO1st is a good deal based on the 1650 monthly Atoms alone. The other stuff is just gravy. Also, you don't need it to play the game. It's a win win the complaining is just salt and jealousy because EveRy ThINg sHoUlD Be FrEe.
---
Go up to the paint spot between the buildings and click it, and select one of the options.
---
The service entrance takes you pretty close to that part!
---
You're gonna be holding off indefinitely.
---
It‚Äôs an optional premium sub. You can still play game same as before without it.
---
I mean Fallout 1st is paid and still buggy
---
No twists and turns necessary, addict.
---
Patch 5.31: Patch notes available to Fallout 1st members only.
---
Server stability has just gotten worse since launch!
---
It's a hardware/software issue from the ps4, don't remember exactly. But it happened to me frequently 3 years ago with GTA and fallout 4
---
that's been fixed for a while now....its called a nexus mod
---
&gt;\[...\] don't be a dick. Personal threats make you look like the POS you are \[...\] They're just pathetic little cellar dwellers who have no life.
---
Your projection is showing. Hypocrisy much?
---
You might want to take your own advice about not being a dick.
---
Is it worth your self respect? That's up to you
---
Good for him for knowing the nuke codes already haha
---
Your right down the road then.  I live in laurel.
---
It will be for console most likely going forward. And they might make some good cash off of that.
---
Well that's how they choose to play their game. So you are saying that you're not allowed to attack other players in a shooting game ?
---
I honestly don't know. But I don't think it's the PlayStation. That sounds a lot like what happens to me. It's only happened once during the Halloween event for me tho. I was playing in 3rd person. If you're playing in 3rd person, switch to first for the event, and see how that goes.
---
Also, there are some in the Morgantown Airport garden.  On the north side of the Corn.
---
Well it's a shooting game. They get to choose who are they going to shoot.
---
&gt;Bethesda claims this is all what we wanted. All I want is the ability to play a game that doesn't bug out or crash every two seconds; that doesn't need either a bunch of grinding or money to play 
---
Doesn't bug out or crash every two seconds
---
FO1st Private servers have this
---
Doesn't need a bunch of grinding or money to play
---
Whoa guess what FO1st has this Scrap boxes reduce grinding along with the convenient mobile camp. All for the low low cost of $0.27 cents a day!!!
---
So buy 1 less coffee a week and enjoy FO1st because it actually has everything you just asked for.
---
Battle royale is trash and should have never been in a fallout game. So I think gem is the wrong term.
---
They are attacking them in-game.In an MMORPG shooting game. It's not like they attached OP irl.
---
This is my thought as well. They are probably aware enough that they know this game didn't go down well with anybody. Wastelanders will probably be the last big content drop and then as development winds down they'll be moving onto their next project.
---
Exactly.
---
The thought has crossed my mind several times. Just two guys in a janitors closet throwing back monster energy drinks with machines still on Windows 7.
---
Get the canning station today! Exclusive to Fallout 1st members.
---
So shooting somebody in a shooting game is a harassment now. What a world
---
Go gweef some atoms off an excavator boy
---
Steel is the easiest to get lead is more difficult, u don't get lead from enemies weapons when u break them down, u clear out just Morgantown airport and train yard and ur walking away with a bit of steel, u can repeat this on a single server over and over. Just saying
---
A year since release of Fallout 76, and the game is still broken, unstable and buggy mess. New and old bugs keep appearing again and again and it seems that people's patience has run out. At this point, I doubt this game can ever be stable (or at least better). By the time Wastelanders comes out, there will be nobody left to play the game.
---
Run a commando sneak build.
---
Server stability has gotten worse since launch!
---
Then your character should not be able to fully utilize some of them due to the fact that you couldn't possibly have enough special for all level 3 damage perks and other useful utilities.
---
My character can use everything as well but he is best at melee/heavy weapons/shotguns.
---
Because they don‚Äôt want you to get the rewards maybe?
---
Lol. You can do that on public servers also. It runs at the same time each hour but sometimes you can finish faster on one and hop
---
Yes, but it becomes withdraw only, you will not be able to place any more scrap in it.
---
Yes but that relies on chance whether you get into the right server. This is the server reloading and letting you go through the whole event as if it was just started.
---
American?
---
Some parts of the world's Tuesdays are other parts of the world's Wednesdays.
---
TBH after the first month I only took workshops for the defense events and free building mats to experiment with n√©e base BP's.  Mostly the events though.as they tended to be level appropriate.
---
Man I would hate to be a moderator for a place like this.
---
&gt; Battle royale is trash and should have never been in a fallout game.
---
General reception would say otherwise. Though, you're free to have your own opinion.
---
What's wrong with being named Dick?
---
The new mischief event is unstable for me, sometimes during it and after finishing it my game just lags and lags and lags.
---
Saying that people are mad over FO1st because they ‚Äòcan‚Äôt afford it‚Äô is wilful ignorance at this point. Sure, you can disagree with their reasoning, but that blanket dismissal is lazy and inaccurate.
---
https://support.activision.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/PlayStation-Error-Code-CE-34878-0
---
Basically could be either make check for an update.
---
Also right now because of private servers, i am holding all the workshops and collecting resources non stop now, my bottomless scrap box is crazy full of resources just within a few days..i spend more time now defending the workshops and clearing a few places for xp, legendaries and other resources. Thats my life now finding out how much i can put into that scrap box...lol
---
Then you die of radiation poisoning, you need a full suit for rad resistance!
---
You don‚Äôt have to play the game to get angry about the state the gaming industry is in. 
---
Plus you‚Äôre surprised they don‚Äôt play game which released as a broken piece of shit, where devs constantly keep lying, like they did when they said all things in the shop will be purely cosmetic, and inventing new ways how to monetize a full priced game. I‚Äôm really not. Fuck FO76.
---
Frankly you would have to be a mindless fanboy to still keep supporting scummy company like Bethesda.
---
Yeah because majority of the posts on this sub pertaining to it doesn‚Äôt talk about how low the NW population is...
---
Same here. Little lag but overall very fun experience.
---
its easier on us, especially after we had the cancel thing happen to us.  lotus leggings that my wife signed up for tried to charge a closed account 3 times after refusing to cancel twice, then threatened to report us to the credit bureau's for non payment which we had to fight.  
---
ever since then we pretty much use it as a safegaurd, since our local bank is pretty good about removing overdrafts in that type of situation if we didnt close it fast enough.
---
European. 10 am EDT is about 18 pm in most pf Europe, and all downtimes except patch 14 and a couple if special hotfixes have been on a Tuesday, at least since I bought the game during the free week
---
Haven‚Äôt played since yesterday‚Äôs update, I live behind the pro shop, can confirm the damn machine gun sound never ends. It. Never. Ends. I don‚Äôt want to stay at camp longer than I have to.
---
Yeah, the carpet gets 'em every time.
---
Hey if the OP thinks playing 76 will help them stay in touch woth old friends what's $0.27 cents a day in hindsight. My friendships are worth way more than this. 
---
So yes this is a valid argument for this particular example. It's not a blanket dismissal as you so called it.
---
Well, to go fuck themselves is essentially what Bethesda has been telling their customers with this game so... Maybe they deserve to hear it back.
---
TBH the ammo economy for this is fine. You do have to occasionally farm mats for ammo but you can make thousands of rounds at a time easily. Its better on mats than 5.56 and when you're making 180 rounds per click vs like 30, super duper pays off in an even higher way. I limit my .308 usage to what I find as LMG is simply not sustainable. It's just for fun. .50 Cal, and the Gatling Gun are my mains, and everything else is just for a bit of fun.
---
It's mad cheap
---
And Simon demands you press E
---
Are you referring to the private servers?
---
Nope. They will not. it does not create revenue. This game will stay a broken mess forever. you might be lucky that this is one of ten bugs they manage to solve within the next year, but I wouldn't get my hopes up. In fact, it's pretty obvious to me that you shouldn't hope for anything at this point.
---
... they are free rewards for completing the event on a costume.
---
I don‚Äôt and still buy the plans because they dump my caps and people buy them up pretty quickly.
---
You know what? I bought it too!
---
This game really doesn't like it when you run fast, quickly switch weapons or kill enemies in few shots. You should wait few minutes before killing every legendary creature in the game, because otherwise it fails to run the required script. What a joke!
---
Sound like all the bean counters I worked for.   Try remodeling the camp for no apparent reason.  That's what retail does: let's more everything in the store so you won't know where anything is again.
---
Lol down voted for having a private server I guess. Lol the salt is real
---
TBH if you put 3 points into every weapon class and had them equipt at all times you could probably get by, especially if you're a bloodied build. I have a Junkies Lever Action I utilize on my heavy gunner just because sometimes I like to take it a bit slower and I still have 1 shot lvl 62 ghouls with a headshot with 0 perks in rifleman or tank killer if I'm crouched.
---
European? Oh, my apologies. Didn't mean to insult you by insinuating that you were American :)
---
Frame rate super drops, no disconnect for me, but several teammates have, and loading into sever and into event at the same time is like 2 or 3 x as long, even without a disconnect.
---
Huh, guess that's kinda mixed.  I suppose owning all workshops for an afternoon or two would make needing to farm not a thing anymore though.  Still a shame, scrap shouldn't cause DB issues since it's almost certainly an integer counter instead.of distinct records.
---
I'm certain this is the case here. If they had enough people they would have released Wastelanders by now.
---
A perfect example of how this game is P2W.
---
Popped over in the middle of it.  Totally confused about what to do.  Jumped up on a bus and shot robots.
---
You have to wait untill it starts so everone has to leave and no one gets rewards üñí
---
No idea why he was that crass, I did the same thing at launch. nukesdragons is the name of a website (I think) I used to use to make my builds, very nice for planning if you want to check that out
---
Apparently If a legendarie is glowing green they have a chance to 'charge' into a 3 star slowly if it doesn't get attacked.
---
Juicehead has
---
It is not only PS4. It is happening across all platforms. The game is simply meant to be played in a much slower pace. Even my grandpa will find it slow and tedious. He is 93 years old.
---
Todd said it was the biggest team they had ever had on any Bethesda game. I find that pretty hard to believe, but that's what he said. In front of everyone at E3.
---
Fo 76 didn't sold well in first place and Fallout players are not used to buy stuff in atom shop, so the available financial resources are limited. Yeah it's like a big loop.  
---
We should be thankful with who buy stuff in atom shop and purchase the first: they are who keep the game alive.
---
Definitely better to hide as placement and time survived are always the largest portion of exp. I think it's 10 points per kill? Wtf? A battle Royale that doesn't reward battling? This makes NW to grindy for the level locked rewards. It is still a super fun mode though.
---
People tease you a lot...? You share a nickname with one of the most criminal presidents of the US...?
---
Anyhow, it was little 'd' dick. Judging from that person's comment, it seems to be something that they're very familiar with.
---
question; how much does one bot actually collect? becuase i cant see any difference. and i cant find anywhere that it says how much it actually collect.
---
It‚Äôs not the person I least expect. Nor is it the person I suspect the most. It‚Äôs always the person I most medium suspect. Which is why I know the killer to be.... Beatrix bourbon. A.k.a Phyllis!
---
Good for you
---
Yeah, last night I crashed 4 times during events. :/
---
Pay to win what? Plans that are already in the game?
---
Don't buy it
---
I remember when Fallout used to be a role playing game.
---
Odd, now that the crusader population is shrinking; there is a curious number of people who have no problems with 1st in direct contrast to crusader claims about the community
---
If they were free what would be the selling point for the subscription other than some atoms? Extra or endless storage is a selling point for subscriptions on most online games/MMO‚Äôs
---
I did the event 5 times and several friends got DC'd, some multiple times, and it seemed to be a regional issue (Xbox related), the game was lagging for everyone, in the first 4 events on Public Servers, we did the last one on a Private world with 6 players and it ran very smooth, although there were many more robots to deal with.
---
At one point shortly after we got to the Courtyard, 7 Assaultrons spawned in all at once, it was a helluva good battle, glad I have some tough friends.
---
It's not that bad when Bethesda doesn't fuck up
---
I hear what you're saying though I disagree with part of your premise. I, also, am a Day 1 beta player. I grant you, I'm probably a lot more of a 'grindy' player than many. 6 years of mostly vanilla Skyrim before ever starting to mod and very little play of anything else during that time period and, until 76 came out I was STILL mostly playing Skyrim with a smattering of FO4. So. No, for me, the game does not lack content to stay interested in.  
---
Another factor that keeps the game fresh for me is that I have a lot of different builds where I mess with different configurations of Specials, some plain, some that are focused like Junkies, then there's the Herd Mentality/Charisma team oriented build I'm experimenting with... so, yep, I spend a ridiculous amount of time in this game on 2 PC accounts and 2 Xbox accounts
---
I'm good with 76 up to this point. By the same token, am I ready for Wastelanders? You bet!
---
*He said it again!*
---
I've been disconnected from the server for trying to fast travel to it.
---
Oh, look. Someone learned a new word in school this week. You‚Äôre a bit off in your equivalency, though. I can assure you I am bourgeois.
---
Legendary glowing ghoul. F uuuuuuuuuu!
---
If you get mad doing something that‚Äôs supposed to be fun, best to go find different fun.  If you like the angry stuff try boxing or martial arts
---
It starts on the hour, how are you switching servers to do it again ü§î
---
And that's thier right to do so. In fact it is the proper way to fight something like this. Put your wallet where your mouth is. Stop playing and move on. 
---
However for many players FO1st is a good deal perceived value lies in the perception of value to any given individual.
---
Can you rule out rival gaming companies to Bethesda encouraging and bolstering drama in the interest of helping any of their post apocalyptic game settings out? For any other title out there with a Post Apoc angle, Fallout is a mighty big fish gobbling up all the food
---
I don‚Äôt see how he could of done. If he left his private server and relogged back in, he‚Äôd be back in the same private server he left. Theres a cool down before it creates a new world so there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôd get a new world and new event.
---
If you are interested in a support class I run a shotgun medic build. I actually just posted something about this a few hours ago in a different topic. I play primarily solo, but it could be very helpful with a group that communicates well. 
---
For starters I use a medics / explosive combat shotgun, this helps add a little more damage to my shots. This is heavily focused on vats and is best done without a suppressor to avoid faster damage drop off. The following perks are necessary to the build:
---
Blocker - reduce damage from melee attacks, important since we‚Äôll be close to most enemies. 
---
Concentrated fire - use torso shots to build crit and headshots when crit is full for even more damage. 
---
Adamantium skeleton - only necessary for explosive effect as you will get crippled easily by the splash damage in close range. 
---
Action boy - you‚Äôll want as much AP regen as possible to keep those crits going. 
---
Enforcer - great perk for shotguns, cripples most limbs in one shot since each pellet receives the chance to proc. 
---
 Better criticals - nothing wrong with some extra damage for crits. 
---
Four leaf clover - the most important perk for this build. Like enforcer, the chance to fill the crit bar on hit is applied to each pellet. You will have a full crit bar practically every other shot with this perk. This also works the same way for the medic prefix which typically only recovers a small amount of health, but with a shotgun that amount is multiplied for each pellet. 
---
I don‚Äôt really use many charisma perks, mine is only at 5. Team medic should not be necessary since you‚Äôll be healing just as much with a medics shotgun, but without needing to use a stimpak. Just make sure you are close to your teammates, hence why communication is important. Anything that removes rads will only piss off people who use bloodied builds and revival perks are situational at best.
---
I think just the sheepsquatch stuff got added, along with maybe project paradise and the vault raids. Pretty underwhelming stuff, imo if you haven‚Äôt explored the whole map id recommend doing that, I had a lot more fun than any of the new content, it just kind of seemed to fall flat
---
Magic
---
The selling point would be cheaper atoms and private servers
---
Try dropping your prices. I look in on every vendor I come across and some people try to sell their stuff for prices that are insultingly high. It's like someone coming up to you and saying 'Hey, want to buy this level 10 pipegun for 5,000 caps? It suuuure is valuable.' Not that I'm saying your stuff is overpriced - I have no idea - but something to think about.
---
They were here before the crusaders brought their cry fest from fallout to here
---
I‚Äôm sorry did you not read this at all?
---
Nah, I have a server too. But they are falsely claiming to be able to do the event back to back..which isn't possible because it's on a timer that goes off at the start of an hour on the clock, not that specific server like other events can.
---
Fansnacht event had people dropping nukes on the area quite often. Well before Fallout First was a glimmer in Todd‚Äôs eye.
---
your favorite game is fallout 76? really?
---
Did you reach max caps? Because it sounds like you did.
---
The first thing you did wrong here is trust Bethesda. The second thing you did wrong is to fall into buying that worthless subscription. Bethesda can eat a dick
---
Is this Fallout game was as good as 3, NV, or 4, and there‚Äôs a weird batch of nitpicky critiques (the canvas bag nonsense), then yeah I could see that being a reasonable thought. But as it stands 76 is not a good game, at best it‚Äôs average or ok and people only care/play because it‚Äôs named Fallout. Like I said previously, no one needs to make up reasons to shit on 76, there‚Äôs plenty of real reasons to do so.
---
The subscription is NOT the problem. 
---
The problem is the ability to go back and forth between adventure and private worlds. The full consequences of this will only be obvious once modding drops. I bet heads will really start exploding then.
---
Just wait for it
---
Join a friend on a private server that's fresh and if it's before the end of countdown you can keep doing it by hopping. The most we've gotten in a row is 5 so far
---
Contact support and ask. It's a pain but you'll mostly just get salt on here.
---
You are asking for something that does not create revenue. It will not happen. BGS is now only focussed on money.
---
The Data Miners claim it's the rarest of the drops, but still a decent chance to get, out of 5 runs I got 3 Clean Space Helmets, 1 Pirate Hat, and the Jack O Lantern Pant Suit, on Xbox, it's the only one any of my friends know of so far, and I was playing with 11 others last night, and a few had been doing every event since it started.
---
I can sleep anywhere. It‚Äôs my one superpower.
---
Ahh the joys of max caps. Lmk if you need help transferring some of those caps to a secondary character so you can start saving them.
---
I feel like the only ppl hating on the 1st membership are the ones that can't afford it.
---
Never had any trouble with my standard gat laser. Explosive weapons are the real bane of the servers
---
When I'm shopping for products I make the Spacer's  Choice. It's not the best choice, it's Spacer's Choice‚Ñ¢
---
Sucks to suck.  Spend your money on something better.
---
Totes gonna let some random person on the internet tell me how to spend my money.
---
I did 5 runs last night. Got the fireman helmet on the first run.
---
A list posted a few days ago shows 25 outfit rewards with equal chances.  if the statement is accurate, "odds" are 1 in 25
---
For the people that were on open mic talking about rewards, I didn't hear anyone saying they got the fireman outfit.  
---
Most amusing comment was "Resort signs?  What the $#%# is that???"
---
To my knowledge it always been like that if a vendor has 179 caps left you can‚Äôt sell a item worth 180.
---
A way around this is buy something from him worth 1 cap or whatever the cap difference is in your case.
---
Fallout 76 will end up being Bethesda's most profitable game ever and that means you'll get no wonderful single player games anymore, they can just make trash like this and make out like bandits.
---
Skyrim 76, Morrowind 76 cause why not?
---
Bethesdas fanbase are their own worse enemies.
---
You can literally do the event infinite times, how do you not see that as pay to win?
---
I deleted the game then reinstalled. Took forever to download but it worked. Too many folks having issues this week!
---
Like I said, it‚Äôs not fully tested, but it appears to act that way.
---
I‚Äôm in UK and was playing for last 3 hours, log out just now there was no maintenance for me
---
Talking about that! I totally forgot to mention it. 
---
5- Sad about thee weight bug, that I need to reequip my "armor weight less perk". :( Makes a pain to fast travel some times.
---
I wouldn't make it up. I have nothing to gain by lying or misleading anyone. I don't get off on that shit.
---
The only weapon I find worth are Perfect Storm and All Rise, maybe the summerset sp√©cialspecial too. But when you'll start farming legendary, you'll be able to find much better.
---
Oh it very much still is a role playing game. 
---
You have multiple factions like the Fanboys and their sub-faction the Fallout 1st subscribers. There's a group made up of former Fanboys called The Railroaded, a splinter group who felt betrayed by or didn't buy into the Fanboy way of life. 
---
There are a few gangs as well that act as antagonists - the Griefers, the Dupers and the Trolls.
---
You can choose to be a voiced or unvoiced protagonist too, depending on whether or not your own a mic and intend to use it. The dialog system is a little weak though and there isn't much true choice and consequence. Pretty much the only consequence you suffer is a loss of some money and time.
---
I don't think the multiplayer is actually that badly implemented, most people just don't invest in mics or get into character.
---
A lot of people bought this game for $15-20 and get free DLC/ seasonal events and all that. That's why they added the subscription.
---
That‚Äôs what I experienced, maybe it glitched for me, idk
---
With the outrage here lately I‚Äôm surprised there isn‚Äôt any talk of this (that I‚Äôve seen) it‚Äôs good pitchfork material
---
Because it's fun. The questions is, why is nuking Whitesprings during the event even possible?
---
It‚Äôs a alien pumpkin in English I believe
---
I have had no issues so far.
---
Mods have been deleting most shit posts. Seems any post which is created to stir up hate doesn't last too long. Whether it's for or against FO1st.
---
Convinced him to get f76
---
Right, but that wouldn‚Äôt be enough to get the number of subscribers they need. So what else could they offer as an alternative in addition to those things? The biggest selling point for subscriptions with most online games is additional inventory storage, this isn‚Äôt a new concept or move on their part in any way whatsoever. Giving that away for free would be suicidal from a marketing standpoint.
---
I might try it and see if it works but that would be really unfair if it did. I know server hoping on public you can if you finish early but still not guaranteed to get another.
---
"you post on the--" wait, wrong thing.
---
Lmao right! Well looks like I'll be unequipping my flaming pitchfork mod then.
---
Wow.. Really you guys are even glorifying that clusterfuck? You guys really are something.
---
YOU SHOULDN'T BE GIVING THEM YOUR MONEY!!!!
---
OK, srs tho, just submit a ticket and select text, someone will text you pretty quick and work it out. Had me fixed up in like 3 mins.
---
Accidentally shoot them? Don't interact with people much. Worst thing I did for a player recently was get myself downed so they could revive me for a quest they were doing
---
Are you on PS4?  I‚Äôm going to run it on private server tonight, it works much better.
---
We had 2 private servers and are on PC just as an extra detail.
---
You can only hold 30k in caps have u reached the limit?
---
This sub is like Diamond City and the PR shill account posters are the synths.
---
I understand your points as I was in a similar situation until adapting a solution.  Though I‚Äôm on PC and solutions on PS4 may be different.
---
At present, I have a mule for Junk (from the days I thought it may be important) that I haven‚Äôt loaded in months.  Having tons of junk does not make me (or anyone) a better player.
---
Not liking an existing solution or not wanting to use a solution doesn‚Äôt invalidate it.
---
No it‚Äôs definitely not
---
I never said that the discount will happen every week. it is just that you will get a discount on sweet items. It can happen any time and most likely will put it in the atomic store update notes when it happens
---
Oh right, So you swap from one to another. Yeah now that‚Äôs different than just being in 1 server and logging out as they‚Äôre 2 different worlds.
---
Wrong again, go check out beef_curtians AMA he did in this zubreddit a couple months ago. They are able to "create" guns to use in NW like he likes to use a quad western evolver that gives him 24 shots.
---
Yeah, but when they switched back to the first it reset
---
I am always in the market for magazines and bobble heads and .556 ammo.  I cleaned a guy out this morning (4000) because he priced the .556 ammo at 1 cap each.  
---
I sell all of my ammo (including ultracite) at 1 cap each. 
---
A basic 3 star legendary I priced between 500-800 caps and if it‚Äôs decent I will go higher.  I sold a quad gauss with FFR for 4K.  
---
People pricing junk legendaries for 5K need to rethink their strategy
---
so what is the advantage of a cosmetic that does absolutely nothing outside of sitting still in a camp?
---
1A: no benefit over other players, as it does nothing but sit there and look ok.
---
1b: only arguable thing is that you desire its looks
---
2: no benifits or gains from it, the objects dont do anything
---

No, it heals them, go to WS Club house while low levels are there, stand on the bus and heal the ghouls while they try to kill them, it's hilarious.
---
lol probably
---
Is this possible?
---
Pvp in this is hugely unbalanced and it's a waste of time trying to have a balanced fight with other players when aimbot is part of the situation.
---
It's messed up that people who post around this time who ask perfectly reasonable questions could get downvoted to hell.
---
Having said that though, whatever got you to stop a little while back, the event isn't really going to change that all that much.
---
If you like the rewards, play, if not, don't bother.
---
Personally I don't think it's worth it but whether or not it's worth it for you is up to you.
---
I would happily pay for a private server (albeit with a little more control than you currently get) the tent and scrap box mean nothing to me really and havibg that sort of stuff free would bring in more players overall instead of giving the "you have to pay extra for everything" vibe that the game currently gives out
---
&gt; the Griefers, the Dupers and the Trolls. 
---
Bethesda added those? Cool.
---
"What turns a man neutral?"
---
You mean pay to playtest?
---
As a plague walker, I like this glitch
---
Yes really. Fallout 76 is one favorite games right now and has been for over a year now.
---
Exactly.  I am playing on PC on EU and there is 0  griefing
---
They are based on your intelligence instead of perception/dexterity like other weapons. They are made for "scientist" type of play through.
---
No, they can‚Äôt; and no, no ones bothered to realize this yet
---
Why don't they just automatically deposit it into your inventory so you don't even have to work for it !
---
üòî
---
Not happen to me yet. I swear slot of these big ppl post about I don‚Äôt get.
---
Funny how 2 days later your posts are +8 mine -5 when we literally say the same thing. reddit is dumb af.
---
I got the pirate outfit - would agree that‚Äôs the best so far
---
Rogueaov nice to meet you last night and thank you for remembering i needed help.  Someone else assisted me the night before.  Sorry for poor communication, not sure what is wrong but I could barely make out what you were saying(even though my voice volume settings is set on max).
---
I'm not sure why it effects you what I enjoy playing or like. Some of you folks are hugely confusing.
---
Despite being over level 100 at the time, I shot a wanted level 5 player. It was in Flatwoods and was an accident as my aim was totally off that night. I didn't finish them off though. Instead I stimpacked them and it counted for my revive a player in the backpack quest, so it worked out to be a happy accident.
---
Worst intentional thing was abandoning someone to an ambush squad back in the early days. He was a  bit gung-ho with PvP, I thought it was a setup, so of he went and I retreated back. Didn't end well for him.
---
I kited a scorchbeast over to someone's vendor base that I had fast traveled to. Doors were locked, no window accessible benches. So I stood in front of a wall until it got knocked down. So much for that locked door.  Didnt even have anything good in the vendor.
---
Dont leave your vendor on with locked doors.
---
Playing the game to shit talk the game. Genius! /s
---
It's easier for you to get the plan. *That* is the advantage.
---
Breh I spent 5 hours this morning soloing the event. But hey, if you want some back up, my psn is my reddit name.
---
I think the game is solid it obviously has major bugs and issues, but the world its self is enthralling to me and I want to keep exploring it. One thing I said months ago is that I would buy my own server if they would let me and I would play the ever living shit out of it. Seen the membership announcement last week and got super hyped gonna try it out like next year when I get some time and they iron out some of the kinks.
---
The pyre lighting lag is server-side.  The lag from multiple simultaneous explosions is client-side.
---
The never said there wouldn't be a subscription model - on the contrary they said there would be a subscription model for the private servers back in the span of August to October. 
---
It's very hard to get exact wording since most news sites have updated their original articles and nothing is on wayback.
---
Here's a tweet from Pete (he apparently was getting mad at answering the same question for the 1000th time): [https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1044559913735925760?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1044559913735925760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
---
Here's a clip I got - it's the original post from the PCGamer article that has now been updated:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk](https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk)
---
I also remember a youtube interview or two somewhere but that's not as easy of a search, and to be blunt I don't care enough to go listenting to old youtube videos to get more evidence, I think the two above is enough.
---
I help 80% of the time and take workshops the other 20%. I remember a few months back, taking a workshop from a level 14. (My character was 150ish with sentinel vanguard and a tse handmade) after I took it he tries to get it back. I inst kill him, he had a shit load of junk. He comes back like 25 times trying to retake it. No chance. Then he says over the mic that he‚Äôs out of caps can he have his junk back. I shot him in the face......
---
It‚Äôs unlimited storage for scrap, not guns, armor or plans. I could see it affecting ammo sales but other than that, I don‚Äôt see it messing with sales. The biggest problem is vendor pricing.
---
It is very likely that only a small number of people work on the public version of the game at least since around the summer. Hopefully that is because almost everyone is on the Wastelanders project, but we will see in a few months (unless it is delayed more).
---
I dashboarded last night as I was trying to load into another server. When I was trying to load back in I was stuck on a loading screen for over a minute then I froze again on a black screen with the Vault Tec logo. Luckily I was able to finish the even from the server I‚Äôd been on (scored a sweet pirate outfit). Running on Xbox One X. I did the even 2-3 times last night and it was incredibly laggy.
---
I fought once a 1* sheepS that became a 2* after it's regen and its "furious mode" (when he become red and attack faster)
---
Download speed is not related to the number of cars exploding all at once
---
I caught the tale emd of one last night but was still there long enough to qualify for a reward. For a moment I thought I was back on my old Pentium 75 with a 56k modem as it was lagging and freezing so badly.
---
What did you expect?   Honestly, my salt has nothing to do with the pay for play concept or those that want to pay as I‚Äôve spent real $$$ on atoms to purchase things in game like scrap kits. 
---
I‚Äôm pissed because I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay more for the goddamn game to work normally and not glitch or freeze or disconnect.  System instability didn‚Äôt just start with this event; it‚Äôs been a fucking mess for months now.
---
I play on ps4 and havent experienced a crash yet and I play on satnet. But I also only mainly on mine or my friends private servers. So is saying, perhaps it's not the game so much as it could be your ps4
---
Wow, edgy you're kewl.
---
I had no idea what I was doing until level 50ish when I decided I was going to go full sneaky sniper.  From that point on I was moving special points until around 70 and then started getting proper perks for my build.  
---
I didn't really consider it "decent" until around level 90 and then I concentrated on perks so I could change things up (use a heavy weapon for queen fights, be better at building,etc).  Probably really felt comfortable around 110 - 115.  Granted if I did it right from the beginning I could have been done by like level 80 but whats the fun in that.
---
Sure they should.
---
Same in German. All the translations are wrong. 
---
Also the button to activate those fires are all wrong translated. Like they used Google Translate. The button says "leicht", which is translated "light". To light up a fire it should be translated "anz√ºnden" in German.
---
Is that our Australian price??
---
Also you're more than welcome to join my server and run it with me, I typically just chill at my tent and play the banjo in between event times
---
Lol no
---
Yeah, you have to do it on standerd n expert
---
Well this one time in band camp....
---
I honestly really wanted the empty one, was gonna use it as stairs
---
And cucumber
---
This zone should not be nukeable during the event. Blame Bethesda.
---
Lol yes
---
I have a good instigating setup (sneaky sniper) and my backup gun is a non-automatic furious ffr handmade (to still get the rifleman perks).  I do just fine after that first shot when I need to.
---
6 times one total crash. A little laggy when things are exploding but that‚Äôs the norm for the Whitespring environment (for me)
---
Calling them idiots and mindless sheep doesn't win anyone onto your side.
---
Can do two in an hour if you have a private server and your fast enough
---
You may want a screenshot? That' not the first time strings are messed up in translations. I was called Alien Laser Plan, and gave me a basic jack'o lantern after using it.
---
I agree 100% but unless you're the one down voting anyone for having a membership, then I wasn't directing it at you bro. I want them to fix their game so I have no problem sharing any exploits I know. I want them to fix it, I want them to get MAD and do something about even if it means I lose my account.
---
It is true if you compare the credits of [Fallout 4](https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/fallout-4/credits) and [Fallout 76](https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/fallout-76/credits), there are like twice as many people listed. But 76 was also made in a shorter amount of time, and released only about 2 years after the Nuka World DLC. And much of the extra manpower was spent on converting the Creation engine to multiplayer, as you can see from the large number of people credited with programming, which does not bring visible improvements to the player - the best case is things work like before in Fallout 4.
---
This weekend sales were a little light on regular stuff, but legendaries still sold fine.  Last night it was back to normal, sold ammo, stims, bulk, bobbles, even a couple plans.  I think I did about 18k in sales the last few days.
---
I'm not trying to win anyone onto my side, i'm simply making a point.
---
You do realize he was talking about you, right? Like your ego isn‚Äôt to big to see that? They lied multiple times about the way they would do things since before launch, but you keep sucking BGS dick. Maybe you‚Äôll get a free membership.
---
Cool! You should go share that on the Outer Worlds sub‚Äô
---
The job postings for an online brand ambassador were just as common a decade ago when I graduated from college.  "Astroturfing" isnt new and done correctly is impossible to identify.  The term comes from the goal being: create the appearance of a grassroots movement.  Both political parties do this, foreign governments do this, every large company with a corporate twitter/facebook/instagram does this, smaller companies tend to hire a firm specializing in "digital marketing" to do this.  One local marketing firm sells their service to small business as a way to "protect your online reputation" as a couple bad reviews can kill a small business in their first 6 months.
---
It's really not as simple as you think to enforce because there is so much gray area.  
---
Couldn't the companies engaging in this practice simply say they seek out their "biggest fans" and hire them as brand ambassadors?  "The people are going to be pro-company anyway and we want to reward our fans" 
---
What about a company offering a discount for giving them a positive review online? 
---
You cant just call out the "fraudulent" good reviews so  the disgruntled 0 star review people will clog up the legal system worse than the astroturf marketers.
---
In the beta a friend started a war with some people, I had a good gun so I kept killing them and sort of tuck there camp for my own. Killing them when they came back and broke a lot of there stuff in the process
---
Ikr and I thought it's just my potato computer
---
Haha thank you!
---
Thanks! The wendigos are my favorite part!
---
Most of the non-standard spawns have straight Damage Reduction that Armor Penetration doesn't negate. The Queen has something ridiculous like 70-85% DR, most of the rarer spawns that can spawn level 60+ have straight 20-50% DR.
---
I'd suggest a Sneak/Crit/VATS ranged build. You can get away without using a lot of damage optimizations that the ADS Bloodied/Junkie meta builds have to have. For Example, I use Level 1 Rifle/Commando perks, and pop 2000 damage head shot cticals.
---
Leave
---
&gt; Be better than this. I know you can. 
---
The sad truth is, that just isn't the case. For a decent number, sure but the number that buy into these anti-consumer practices reward Bethesda for doing so. Some do so knowingly. 
---
Some make up excuses or lie to themselves. Much like people defending utility items as not pay2win, until some of these people later admitted to being wrong that it really was.
---
While we can try and push Bethesda and try to shame them into being better in terms of fair and reasonable monetisation practices, there's no point focusing on the players. They're already lost. They just don't care so long as they benefit from it.
---
Yes. Could you stop fucking lying jesus fuck.
---
It's funny how you can't read the stickied post.
---
Agree. But I thought it was datamined for 14000 xp for that glowing skeleton costume? but then 7500xp is quite insane too for a casual player lol I barely ever win in NW. If I got super lucky I could get to the big 10 final contestants but that's it.
---
The engine cannot handle this.
---
Caps will always be useful because of player vending
---
That's what I thought 76 was though.
---
Once I was in grafton and a player joined the event too late, then I move to the parking with my cham' armor, my gf came to talk, we had to leave for something in town. I saw that player standing on a car with bloodied health, I told my gf "do you want to see something fun?" I shot the car and the player was instakilled -,- -karma
---
I've seen that once, it's pretty hilarious.
---
When you get there, for to the gazebo and look in the red trunk.  any of the items there are acceptable...and you may find something you don't have.
---
What are you talking about? Try running around Boston in FO4 and get into a big fight, trying using that horde mode that Creation club added or trying using mods to add more NPC encounters. The game fucking implodes, the engine cannot handle multiple things going on in a small area.
---
No it's a true test to the engine.
---
On PC here and had no issues. Maybe like 5 or 6 runs so far?
---
Thanks. I'll bring that one up too.
---
Saw some poor soul die to a Yao Guai. Stole their springs and screws from the loot baggie.
---
Completed it 6 times last night with only a little lag on lighting bonfires and forking the lawn. PC
---
Was chilling at a train station being invisible (chameleon armor). Saw this level 300+ drop a bag on the floor without seeing me and then disappeared. Bag had 6000+ throwing knives so I took it and crouched again. A few seconds later a level 10- came looking for the bag. Wish I could have seen his/her face. The steel lasted me two weeks. Thank you duper dude!
---
Along with what others have replied, this is only possible during the specific event phase.
---
Possible though I think the fact people spend a lot if money on the game adds to the fact, bug fixes cost money and if the player base is spending then there's no business sense to it
---
Thanks! Anything to help!
---
I got an old one, from back when I fancied myself a detective. It's nothing special. One time someone assassinated the traveling responder bot while people were trying for the rare outfits. Sick bastard. I didn't see a name because he was crouched, and because I don't eat or drink unless I'm fast traveling, I had no AP to catch up to him before he ducked behind one of the houses and fast traveled.
---
 I was only able to make out his clothing just before, aside his general appearance. Caucasian male, pink fringed dress, low level of character. Particular, easy to spot. I thought back to the character names that had already fast traveled away before, five people. Hrrn, could be a search. It only took three three hops before I caught up with him.
---
 I found him, trading with a high level down by the old disposal yard. Must have gotten his, wanted to wipe out competition. This was before the suits rigged the game against PvP, so as soon as I knew I had my man, I opened fire on him and his partner. The fella he was with had a good few levels on me, almost fifty. But he looked like a trader, so no big pushback. As he lay dying, his friend wondered why he had been griefed so and asked me. So I had to tell him he doesn't choose his friends well
---
If you complete mischief night and are awarded something but don't read it immediately, is there a way to go back and see what you got?
---
Mostly because most of the people doing the big drama were people who never tried 1st and stopped playing (even way before 1st for some).
---
I though the discount applies to selected items. But that would be nice if you get a bigger discount on discounted items, or something like perma 10% that stack with other discounts. I mean, they don't loose things since it's virtual and you paid your atoms.
---
She did she did
---
Maybe so. I routinely hit max caps with my other character and I don't remember seeing that pop-up, but that has been a while.
---
No, I was around level 90 when i launched my first nuke. Think you need to enjoy the world a bit more.
---
My junk is more plump
---
I can't see them getting to any kind of high level like the other games you mentioned. The endgame for many is gambling scrip for legendaries or building houses over and over
---
100% this. Spent a week collecting silo codes, game crashed half way through mainframe busting, game crashed and froze. 
---
My third attempt was last night, it‚Äôs rare I have a three hour window to myself, and collected all the silo codes, completed the Death from above, transported back to my camp, game froze and disconnected. By the time I got back into FO76, the nuked red zone had cleared. Have no main story mission to follow and don‚Äôt know what happened after the nuke dropped. 
---
Have gone through all regular steps to power cycle and clear memory but this game is just slightly buggy. I don‚Äôt want invest time in buggy games because it ends in disappointment.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a limit- I have picked up lots of junk when I have ignored the bot
---
Probably because anyone can farm it enough in the event time to unlock more than everything.
---
I tried Mischief Night 5 times last night. 0 for 5, record. I had the "is this just me" feeling. The game crashed out (the screen just froze) of 3 servers during the event. The fourth time I died because the event was so laggy frames were dropping like Bethesda's credibility. I had the respawn screen but pressing X (PS4) did nothing. The camera was just spinning around my dead body. The last time I tried it, "you have been disconnected from the server."
---
He's okay in my book... Reminds me of Bender.
---
I doult that, not a hater but Fallout 76 is far from a mmo and people do spend a lot of money on it. Met a lot of people who buy atoms, intact more than who don't.
---
Its more likely the fact team being new and the fact it makes no business sense to fix a game people spend money on
---
Definitely a little low, but that is based on the fact you found the enclave stuff super early. Go back and continue the Wendigo thing and the quests after until you have no more (this means the enclave one would have started here) then you can try the nuke out.
---
Especially that ‚Äòa whale‚Äô in gaming meant someone buying A LOT or even everything that‚Äôs available for purchase, 12¬£ a month is hardly even a little fish.
---
7 times,no crashes. Also im out of town using 15mb hotel wifi.
---
Good luck if you can make it through some of the actual ending parts of the game. Going to be tough doing it as such low level.
---
That‚Äôs probably a good idea, I‚Äôll do all of those missions. Then I will the nuke
---
Why even try? Server hop and do it on another server. Same happened with the Fastnutz event. Immediately people are like *'NuKe It LoLz'* when something new comes out.
---
I get why people on this post are saying we shouldn't be able to nuke an event but I'd rather Bethesda didn't start restricting our actions. Some players are just twats.
---
I agree with you, but also in the terms of other events, like One Violent Night, the point of  timed events is to spend all the time before finnishing. The longer time you use, the more enemies spawn and thus the amount of loot. I also belive, in One Violent Night speciffic, the longer it last, the more legendarys spawn.
---
Everyone can also farm a WhiteSprings Nuke zone infinite number of times by logging off and relogging to a friend on the server.  Been that way from the start
---
It does though. The problem in my eyes is infinite scrap storage in my eyes is infinite storage for ammo. Just leave it broken down and craft whatever you need for you session. It frees up your players inventory, and frees up your regular stash for way more items to be sold on you vendor, meaning you earn way more caps, get to keep guns to mess around with I'd have to toss in the scrip bin cause I have no room, etc. Freeing up your players inventory or ammo means you can have extra perk cards to play with, carry more chems, carry more food, which in fact do make you a better player. If our builds were exactly the same but you can carry 100 more stimpacks than me, guess what that makes you better.    
---
These things your saying remind me of a shitty boss who you would call in the morning to tell them your car won't start and the answer you'd get it "no excuses you better start walking."      
---
Your journey shouldn't be any easier than mine due to something you pay real life cash for in this game. All you should get is stupid dance moves, and cooler outfits than me. Not a better performing character.
---
There's a legendary? LOL never have seen it yet
---
I gotcha, I'm going to try it out today on mine and my buddy's servers and see if we are lucky enough to pull it off too.
---
I killed a mutant that was stuck half in the wall. The last couple times I've been inside of fort defiance there's always one ghoul that you can look in his inventory but he's just spinning in circles in the room and does not react to hits. Maybe fallout 76 has a ghost in the machine? Lol
---
Thanks! I figured that was probably how it worked. Otherwise they wouldn't use this stuff in the Atomic Shop; it would get much too expensive.
---
When half of your "talking to with me" is calling me a shill, it would appear you haven't really tried making a point or any progression in conversation.
---
I'm level 40 and I'm just doing finishing off the content in the coal mining area in the southwest corner of the map.
---
Clearly you're only doing the main quest and skipping everything else.
---
Ya, pumpkin house makes sense from a halloween point of view, but not much open space/places to create mayhem etc unless you backtrack to red rocket and blowing it up.  
---
  Then there's those pesky SBs that would be popping out from the fissure across the street...
---
Same. Tried three times, crashed each time. Can‚Äôt see the point carrying on. Think I completed the main story last night. I don‚Äôt know though. Game kept crashing during and now there‚Äôs no main story.
---
I mean, the way the game is supposed to be played is *how you want to*.
---
You can start the enclave stuff at level 1 if you happen to stumble across the cave. Do whatever makes you feel happy and have fun.
---
I know people who have never even done the airport stuff for the responders, but they have launched tons of nukes and are level 300+.
---
However, you get a lot of good stuff throughout the campaign and it is def worth doing.
---
Also it picks up right after the Wendigo stuff tbh.
---
Point is do what makes you enjoy the game, but you should get the rest of the campaign done.
---
I agree with the tent but not the scrap box. Why would anyone want to play on easy mode with that thing? I personally think it's wack.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôll need to start finishing my side quests and doing all the main quests for Rose
---
Wtf? Infinite time? Dude... The event starts every hours but if nobody join after some time it doesn't happens/fail. Maybe you have something like 15 or 20 minutes before it cancel. You can do it a plenty of time but that's far from "infinite".
---
What you're talking about is basically the purpose of server hopping, nothing to do with 1st. You hop many times to find the same event on different servers. If this event wasn't happening every hours, it would make no difference with other events.
---
It's an event about having fun for Halloween, just enjoy it and let all that 1st and p2w drama in a cupboard.
---
&gt;fantashan
---
Close enough
---
Likewise but after crashing out the bots were still shooting at me when I returned to the area.
---
(Ps4 Pro) I did a couple events, had minor lag but that was probably due to the entire server being in a small area. Somehow I get more lag when walking through barren areas.
---
It's the engine they use, They could fix it but it would take a bit of work.
---
All those things you mentioned are pre patch 13... I never managed to it rank 3 because thing stop spawning.... there is always only one alpha and animals have always walked around habitats...
---
Accidentally killed their pet Brahmin
---
Ah cheers!
---
In the future if their single player games are about to feature paid mods without the option of modding yourself, this company will be dead to me.
---
[Todd Howard disliked that]
---
My brother and I run bloodied builds and one of our pet peeves is people who build Rad Showers into their entrances.  We visit some guy's camp and he has both the door and rad shower attached to a pressure plate, making the only way in through the shower.  At this point, we'd had enough.  After much debate about what kind of justice this person deserved, he fast traveled away, leaving us in his camp alone.  This base was on the south end of Whitespring, with no bots around, but we managed to bait two Mr. Handys down to slowly shoot at this guy's base.  The problem is, it was covered in turrets, so we did what any irrationally pissed off person would do.  We stood in front of the turrets, blocking the gunfire while the bots slowly took them out.  After the turrets were gone, we got most of his camp destroyed, including that damned Rad Shower.  It took a long time, and the gentleman finally came back and started shooting at me, even though we both had pacifist on.  I can't for the life of me figure out why he didn't suspect my brother.  
---
Please don't force people to walk through Rad Showers.
---
if you join my server you wont crash 
---
add me on psn: Owl_No
---
Then there would be no point in doing the event, I think it's great that Events like this one Meat Week, &amp; Fasnacht have Unique rewards, and the whole point of the Atom Shop is to generate revenue to support the continued development of the game, it's just basic business.
---
Probably the same ones crying cause everything isn‚Äôt free. Sub after sub is crying lately and while others let the tears flow, I‚Äôm enjoying my private server with my friends and laughing all the way to my scrap box. War, war never changes and either does those constantly expecting handouts in life.
---
If you really want to you can hang around Residential in novice Washout. We‚Äôve consistently gotten over 10 ants each time we do that. Unfortunately you have to get through babysitting the robots each time but we comfort ourselves with all the acid we pick up.
---
I'll guess Bethesda isnt the only thing that's broken
---
Bethesda seems to be completely oblivious to how laggy certain parts of the map are. I mean Boston was super laggy in FO4 and they never once tried to fix it. 
---
This coupled with Bethesda notion of the only way to make things hard is to add as many enemies as possible. 
---
These two things put together make for a rather complicated time trying to complete events.
---
Some people are acting like crazy religious people with this 1st drama... Server hop was always a thing. Even sometime you can hope in a new server alone.
---
To get storage in your bank or bag you literally pay with gold which you earn in game. And ive never had a problem with storage in eso. Ive always had more than enough space for whatever crafting i wanted to do on every character. Not really sure what you're doing with your inventory space tbh. The crafting bag doesn't change much it saves you 1 to maybe 7 slots in your inventory unless you're dumb enough to walk around with every single racial material and gem.
---
Think it depends on what you mean by finish the game. Maybe shoot for 100% game completion, complete all events, badges etc. will take awhile
---
Yesterday I did 1000 points in NW will I get the skin automaticly today?
---
I do 2-3 events each hour
---
Oh ok
---
PS4, I ran it 5x last night
---
Logged off between runs to take care of IRL stuff.  
---
No issues during any of the runs.
---
\- its all simple, just dont buy fallout 1st.
---
\* come on fallout 1st owners, give me all your downvotes, im not afraid of you !
---
No it's the engine.
---
Once the sentry bot is killed the event ends. Theme other robots were not shooting at me so I left alone. Others kept on killing them, though so who knows. 
---
Or they just took pity on me after my last escapade shooting one - I took refuge in the hotel  and that didnt go too well!
---
I bought the game for full price. They fucked me after 2 weeks because the price dropped like 50%... the game has almost no content. Just an empty world with tapes. The patches were shit and never adressed the bugs. If there is a bug with the shop... they wil fix that in 24h. But every other bug bethesda is like who cares... we don't play that shit. 
---
 And now they ask for a monthly sub to play alone? Sorry, but no way in hell I would even pay 1$ for that.
---
I'm level 176 and I've never done a single story mission. I have no idea what's going on around me, but damn if my CAMP isn't cool
---
Lol typical of Bethesda
---
One alpha per room or one alpha per event? 
---
Yes the friendly animals do walk and run around the room but for us they are running from one habitat to another ie habitat A to habitat C. Is that what they are meant to do or were doing before patch 13/14?
---
... The Grafotn Mayor! (Who still gave me that quest as soon as I logged in- in the forest- yesterday)
---
Thats why you afk the events. During double exp weekend I just afked for 3 days, fuck em. üòÅ
---
Personally loving fallout 1st
---
1. Happens frequently, depending on the spawn of enemy creatures, they tend to flee when they see them
---
2. Only 1 alpha will spawn, it's been always like this
---
3. If someone shoots at the alpha very early and it takes enough damage, the creature will lose its legendary effect, so be patient
---
4. They tend to spawn in waves, however the server lag could delay the spawn 
---
5. Servers were extremely good, but looks like this latest patch to fix the 1st sub bugs brought them back to its previous state
---
6. The plans are the rarest reward items, and to have a chance to spawn you need the 3 creatures alive
---
hope this helps
---
Strange, I normally kill the legendary before they even have a chance to regenerate. They still drop 3 starred loot. Probably just the inconstant drops.
---
Is it daily only? Meaning if I didn‚Äôt do it yesterday did the 29th reward get removed?
---
Most popular for some. Flora spot can be cranberry bog, Harpers Ferry and the forest. Legendary‚Äôs Prime, the Burrows and a few other spots we hit. But I do agree that Jacks fits the theme better.
---
Happened to me at a time. I tried almost everything but re-downloading the game (shitty connection). It fixed by itself after a patch. Then it happened in NW a lot, then it fixed by itself after a patch again.
---
Same as for dross toss. But additionally, I had 143 tokens in my stash and now I‚Äôm somehow down to 68?
---
Steal their scrap and purified water in their camps when their stuff ain't locked
---
Outfits/plans are your rewards, mostly. You already own the game, login for 10 minutes at the top of the hour and decide for yourself.
---
What was yesterdays award?
---
I never said that. I‚Äôm well aware there‚Äôs bugs. I‚Äôm well aware that Bethesda isn‚Äôt the greatest company. But you should expect both bugs and non-user friendly stuff from Bethesda games at this point, and neither of those take away from the fact that I can still enjoy the game. But hey, thanks for trying to start another argument that revolves around opinions and circle jerking on both sides. You‚Äôre sure showing me who‚Äôs boss!
---
if you shot the bots during the event, then the ones inside the resort will start shooting at you as soon as you walk in...that includes the ceiling mounted turrets.
---
Makes the WS station scrip machine a 'safer' option
---
People who don't have jobs or a social life are able to the event more times than me, seeing as I only get 2-3 hours max to game every day.
---
It's not fair, why do they get the unfair advantage to run the event every time it comes up?
---
yay, its easier to get useless things, that do nothing, that will just be dropped. 
---
much benifit, so op
---
I walked in on two players with a paper bag between them and stole the two purified waters it contained.  Literally didn't realise they were swapping stuff.
---
Well, you're a Raider. Balanced fight is definitely not their MO.
---
&gt;I hate how Fallout 1st has created two tiers of player, and it absolutely has. I just didn't want to be in the tier that didn't have these advantages, especially now that I've seen the difference it makes. 
---
That's your TL;DR right there.
---
Man, props for saying this! One Violent Night i think is one of the more awesome events if played right. Wave after wave of mobs with a chance at a legendary with each wave! it boggles my mind why people don't see this, and wish to get the event done as soon as possible.
---
I try to counter this by constantly trying to turn off the jukebox when peeps activate it.
---
If you can't figure it out, pm me and I'll see if I can fill in the blanks for you.
---
my missile turrets killed a player, guy was griefing me so i ran to my camp and shot him do my turrets could get him 
---
i died as well tho, he got me but then i spawned on my camp and took both loot
---
You should stream yourself deleting all your items, uninstalling the app and quit posting about games that make you upset.
---
I would play NW but fps drops are no fun in a pvp enviorment. My PC just barely makes it through the Halloween event. It blows that fo76 still has performance issues.
---
Anyone get to finish a nuked event? One almost successful try, got the bonfire at the end with seconds left (bar is harder to fill without costumes), but it failed for no reason.
---
Roughly, how quickly are you getting the event completed each time?
---
Hey mon, it be iree.
---
Felt like a Michael Bay film haha
---
&gt; Good observation bud.
---
Right. It has to be a provable falsehood. It also has to be causing harm for the courts to care, but that's neither here nor there. But even with things that *are* slander/libel, you'll often not see charges brought simply because it's a pain in the ass to deal with.
---
If, for example, someone is going around posting comments of "Bethesda is bribing people for good reviews!" and Bethesda wants to go to the trouble of charging them with slander (or, more technically, libel as commenting in a forum like Reddit is a form of published word), Bethesda would have to prove, first, that the person is, indeed, lying. Typically that would be done by furnishing proof to the contrary. They would also need to show the court where the false information had been published or told to a third party - in this case, Reddit. *Then* they would have to prove that the person posting the lie did so either *intentionally* - basically that they knew it was a lie when they posted it *and* that they posted it with the express purpose of making others believe it as truth to harm Bethesda - or unintentionally, but with malice aforethought - aka that they didn't know for sure it was a lie, but they still posted it in order to make others believe it in order to harm Bethesda. And *then* Bethesda would have to prove that the lie actually caused them damages.
---
Personally, I dislike the burden of proof being put on the victim of slander, but I do understand that it is that way in order to keep people from charging others with slander or libel just to shut folks up from saying things they don't like, whether true or not. If you want to read more on the subject, [this](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defamation) is a decent link.
---
I don‚Äôt want to set the world on fire. 
---
I just want to start, a flame in your heart!
---
I know I be broken. Blame ex wife.
---
Owl_No 
---
pls add me
---
Works fine for me on Xbox X but then again probably reason is all the action for event like explosions every few feet does make me lag but never crash. Would recommend lowering various settings to improve performance as this game is absolutely horrible in optimization.
---
May i ask what happened
---
Thank you for answering the one question I had. Didn‚Äôt know if they where a daily thing where if you missed out the one day it‚Äôs gone for good. (Minus the end of Nov 12th)
---
AFAIK, no.  as long as all the conditions are met, everyone in the event zone gets the appropriate rewards.
---
In each run, there was at least one task I did not manage to do.  
---
Worst case is you don't get a legendary item if you don't get any hits on the boss...which happened 2x b/c of the higher levels with godroll weapons.
---
Still got the full set of rewards, to include the special for wearing a costume.
---
Is it bad i have over 100k .50?
---
About 6 min or so
---
For the Benefits I‚Äôm getting outta first It‚Äôs worth every dollar. Being able to hold 25000 in steel and lead is great not counting 1000 stims and no lag. The atoms are a bonus. All the guys I play with are enjoying it and reaping the rewards. Griefing is a thing of the past not that it worked to begin with, that‚Äôs why you go pacifist and ignore them also don‚Äôt except request from ppl you don‚Äôt know. Win win situation.
---
I never saw more them 1 alpha per event
---
Most likely lol
---
I'm pretty sure you won't. You'll have to grind 750 EXP.
---
How did you get it? Didn‚Äôt see it in the shop.
---
nope.
---

Psychological ....
---
One example out of the many.
---
No, you can still get yesterday's reward. You have time until November 12th.
---
Yes! We do that too, even send messages but often they either leave or dgaf/dont read it.
---
Its not pay to win because the game is not realy pvp so i dont care if people have an advantage because if it does not effect me it just makes it easyer for the player who has it
---
Well this is kinda silly since the last one is 14000...
---
That will happen when the first discount actually hits the Atomic Chop.  "Wtf, Bethesda??  That skin should have been 200 atoms anyway!!"
---
The Bats paint for Assault Rifle.
---
Can you provide any proof of this at all? I beleive you but just because i trust my gut on what youre saying.
---
Theres been downvote bots and salty twats somve the sub was created. Don't worry about it.
---
Yep, after the last patch I am crashing a lot more often.
---
They unlock one day at a time then we get till Nov 12th to get them all.
---
With fallout or my ex wife?
---
yeah I thought as much, and that does sound hilarious, I think I got a gamma stashed around somewhere
---
Its all events. Go try doing any event with more than a few people. I don't know what they did wit this patch, but my poor Xbox One X has been having a ton of issues for the past few days.
---
This works, I do this... After nuke have hit üòÑ
---
Are you surprised? All free DLC will from now on will be garbage like this. Only the paid stuff will be acceptable. They won't spend any time or resources on free DLC. If the free stuff barely works, that's good enough for BGS.  
---
If wastelanders isn't FU 1st-only, it will be the same garbage. Doesn't matter they postponed the release, it will be buggy AF.  
---
I might sound bitter, but it is best you accept this, to keep your blood pressure low. I still play but with absolutely no hope for improvement. The fact that they can't even get the PAID subscriptions stuff working correctly/as promised is a HUGE indicator on how shitty the free stuff will be put out. They will not change their mindset over this.
---
1. You can wear the hat actually while in PA and it counts
---
2. Glowing ones make the event more fun and challenging.
---
No, I'm the farthest thing from a raider. I'm too nice and giving and helpful. I love like raider factions.
---
You are wrong. It just works! /s
---
Useless or not is subjective. The advantage is that you can get it easier than others by paying. Hence P2W.
---
Ex wife
---
I like this personally. You should want to survive until the end, by any means possible.
---
Private servers should be free or work.
---
&gt;think they're having a great time, since they just don't know any better.
---
Son, I've been "gaming", almost certainly,  longer than you've been alive. I was old when FO1 came out..I'm pretty sure I know when, and when not, I'm having a good time. This is the problem with the hating crowd, you get so damn condescending.  You don't like it, for whatever reason,  and you cannot even fathom that someone else may. It's a serious flaw and blindspot you may want to self examine on because it is going to limit you in life.
---
Snip snap snip snap.
---
Yet, you still play it lol
---
I was wondering the same thing.  I hope it just counts all you build I suck at nw just want the sweet rewards.
---
Ive crashed 4 of 6 events yesterday.  Remind me why would I pay a hundred a year for this game?
---
agree tho, you described it well 
---
should be free, but the unlimited scrap is gg
---
Here's how this thread is gonna go.    
---
Humble Braggers: "Worst thing that I ever did to another player is drop him some ammo and chems and then suck his dick" - UPVOTES    
---
Real Players: "I like to take workshops from people - a completely acceptable aspect of this game" DOWNVOTES
---
I was honestly surprised that they've tweaked the cottage spawns. A bunch of spawns in the cottages can now spawn as 2\* and 3\* ghouls. prior to the update only a single spawn in the club house and maintenance parking lot had a chance to spawn as a legendary.
---
they make it lag intentionally so you gotta pay a subscription for preimu- I mean private servers.
---
Take Rad x and use Rad away
---
Chances are if it's not locked they don't mind if you take it.
---
I felt screwed too after that sale. I bought Tricentenniel Edition for 80. But I disagree with your opinion on the content.  I enjoyed all of my 700 hours in the game. And I never even touched the raid (mostly because people said it was shit).  Theres a lot to do in this game. And they did ok for a while fixing bugs and listening. I was willing to forgive the lingering minor bugs cause this game really was ambitious. And huge. And well worth $80.  But this game is nowhere near worth a subscription of any sort, unless it was free to play.  
---
So my issues lie with their sales and mtx strategies leaning into pay to win and utility items they claim people wanted. Nobody asked "hey give me a fridge, I'll pay for it!".  They said "we should have a fridge!" Then Bethesda said "ok but you have to pay for it." Then peeps got mad they're like "well, you wanted it!"  Terrible marketing and customer relation practices. Even the people defending fridge, junk robot, and unlimited stash, simply say they dont care. They think its worth it to them. They never say they WANT to pay cash for these items. They're just willing to accept it for what it is. And because people are, these practices wont stop. 
---
It really is a fantastic game. Great world. Great content. Interesting lore. Promising future of world development. Seasonal events. Multiple end game boss fights. Huge amount of legendary loot possibilities. It just stinks that Zenimax profits come before customers. They should take care of customer first, and doing so will bring the profits. They have their business model backwards right now.
---
This. 
---
So what if I can place MY Atom shop item in a friend's camp? They are overpriced anyway, and once purchased, should be placable by the owner in other camps. We bought the item, why can't we place it anywhere we want?
---
Oh thank you for the clarity on that I thought you had a day to get a skin.  Thats much better.  Really appreciatte it.  I tried looking stuff up and it didnt give me any results I sought.
---
Sent the request
---
I have my camp at The Whitespring and sometimes I will log on and get both ‚ÄúThis is GRAFTON‚ÄôS MAYOR!‚Äù and the sentry bots going off at the same time and I‚Äôll just sigh and silently pray for the fate of Elder Scrolls 6 üò≠
---
Deserved it. Door lockers are not your friend. When I'm not in a good mood I skip their vendors if I see their locked workshop
---
I think the fact that Private Servers only allow 8 people tells me everything I need to know.. I'm betting they realized eight is actually the sweet spot for this game to keep it somewhat stable... I here people have no issues at all when they do it on a private server with some friends..
---
Skyrim will be very difficult to top
---
Because I want to.
---
The real question
---
Im trying her, but... what?
---
I usually run into a 2\* Queen roaming the bog, so could be one of those joined in the fun.
---
I should have prefaced that all of my ammo is also 1 cap each. I usually keep a small bit of .38 and .308 for the lowbies, I keep 10mm and 5mm in stock, sell all of my shotgun and fusion cells, and sometimes have .556 depending on how my personal stock of it looks.
---
My mags I recently price dropped because I wasn't moving enough of them, but they were still like 45-65 caps each. Bobbleheads are typically 89 caps, but I'll drop some of the less useful ones to 59 caps.
---
I'm about the same as you on basic legendaries. Bloodied, Junkies, instigating sniper-type rifles, Vampire FFR's, and other more useable stuff is obviously higher, but I think the most expensive one I have left is like 2.5k. Sold all of my vendor-able legendaries last night (only had a couple).
---
Sounds like I could use someone with your abilities, ty, sent request
---
"We removed poor people."
---
I did to, Firemen uniform on 2 try and WS Jumpsuit on 3 try
---
It happened to me a while back. Cleaning my inventory reduced the lag, I was collecting all notes and holotapes, now I avoid it. Then eventually the lag disappeared after an update, I never collected all holo and notes possible again.
---
I upvoted you. Good comment.
---
Be an uneducated fresh out of college person like me. It‚Äôs a predatory job like multi level marketing. I just got so excited I took an offer that I shouldn‚Äôt have
---
Maybe some people have fun in a different way. With all these NCR rangers running around it's not like anything in the game world makes sense anyway.
---
They stay hostile after the event ends. I ran into several trying to leave and got attacked.
---
Im sporting the Fauchsnaut (sp?) man head with the witch dress.
---
same rule as with "Why can't I sell the skins I bought?" because the others should still buy it so Bethesda makes more profit, basically 76's purpose of existence, profit for Bethesda
---
I wouldn‚Äôt doubt this at all.
---
lol I love shooting cars while people are near them they act so panicked.
---
&gt;wouldn‚Äôt you shell out some hourly money at entry level employees to possibly make thousands in the long run for your troubled company? 
---
No. I would put that money into making a better product people like and want to buy, not on trying to manipulate them into thinking they already got what they wanted.
---
‚ÄúThere is no war in Ba Sing Se.‚Äù
---
What weapons?
---
I know he meant me...... but i did not ;)
---
Accidentally took a newbie's dropped junk while adding stimpack, radways etc. And since I've done it while they were coming back, no amount of emotes and calling via mic, helped.
---
I guess my apparel didn't help either.
---
Clown suit with fassnacht man head ..
---
Yeah. I love the glasses but I want to wear my Pamela with them :(
---
It's fun when someone cries about people crying.
---
They are never going to fix this, it doesn't create revenue. Simple as that. BGS doesn't care the game is broken, only about money. Mark my words, it will stay like this until the game has died off.   
---
Do not expect any "free" stuff to improve or "just work". Everything that is not atom shop or FU 1st related will come out broken AF. If Wastelanders is not FU 1st-exclusive, it will be the same broken mess, delayed or not. Do yourself a favor and stop hoping for improvement, it is only frustrating.
---
Did the spawns change just during the event or all the time?
---
It just works.
---
I haven‚Äôt been on in a couple days, and I was wondering about the costumes. What counts as a costume? Any old outfit and headgear? Does it have to be the headgear that matches/ goes with the outfit? 
---
I ask because my in-game ‚ÄúHalloween Costume‚Äù is a steel worker uniform, sack hood and chainsaw/multi-purpose axe.
---
Enough! With all these people crying and complaining about people crying and complaining

 Here's a list of what addictions do what do you. Pick the 5 that will affect you least.  Other than that it's just a regular build. Nothing special with perk cars unless you wanna lean into the addict lifestyle and spec into party boy, and thing that make chems last longer. 
---
* Alcohol \[-1chr//-1Agi\]
---
* Buffout \[-1Str//-1End\]
---
* Calmex \[-2Per//-2Agi\]
---
* Daddy-O \[-1Per//-1Int\]
---
* Daytripper \[-1Chr//-1Luck\]
---
* Fury \[-1Str//-1Per\]

it's lagging on PC private servers also
---
This is the dumbest thing I‚Äôve read so far today, it‚Äôs still early but I think it‚Äôll win the day.
---
Recommended the game.     
---
Totally joking, I couldn‚Äôt help it.  I love the game, but you have to have a sense of humor.
---
You‚Äôre the problem you hope to eradicate
---
The first step is admitting you have a problem. Seek help.
---
The negative effects are only suppressed for an hour.
---
Lol... liked the comparison to the boss )
---
I understand what you are saying.  Possibly our playing styles differ.  There was a time when I thought that stuff was valuable and would help with the end-game.  At that time I set up several mules: junk, aid, weapons/armour, and ammo.  ... Haven‚Äôt touched them in months.  They also all have 30k caps
---
Though having all that ‚Äústuff‚Äù gives me emotional comfort, but that‚Äôs my weakness to hoarding.  There‚Äôs no practical benefit to it at present - nowhere to use the materials and nothing to spend caps on.  
---
I think that the importance of the junk storage is overexaggerated.  Most of the stuff in the existing stash is not needed (I am usually around 550-600lbs ‚Äì and that for a heavy gunner build).  Of course, it took some time to reach the understanding of what‚Äôs needed and what not to waste time on.
---
Also, I can‚Äôt agree with the argument that having more stuff to carry gives an advantage.  The comfortable running weight for a character is 150-200 lbs without weight reduction perks (that‚Äôs with chems, stims, food, 3-4 weapons approx. 3000 ammo rounds, 2 Power Armour sets and full set of armour).
---
I suppose we have different playstyles and what‚Äôs comfortable for me is not comfortable for you.  FO-1st does provide convenience (and may save some time).  It doesn‚Äôt provide an advantage (at least not to players familiar with game mechanics).
---
PS. Thank you for this conversation‚Ä¶ it is interesting and did make me understand your point of view better.
---
Have some knuckles,radium rifle, minigun, and lmg all 3*. I have a few others as well. Juat cant remember atm
---
Remember that Bethesda has tried to monetize mods in the past. Its always been met with harsh resistance. But, if they can just force the issue with an online environment, you have no choice: No pay, no mods.
---
I get the feeling Fallout 76 is Bethesda (Or, more realistically, Zenimax, because lets not forget which devil is pulling the strings here) testing to see how much people will pay for water when they've bolted shut every well but their own.
---
Seek help for what? Playing a game I like? That's extremely silly
---
yup, having a decoration that is completly useless and is completly cosmetic is clearly p2w.  totally winning the game with this amazing useless pumpkin decorating my camp /s
---
you actually can wear a costume in a nuke zone.
---
You get 1 hour of no negative effects. After that there are negative effects. Serums just have less negative effects than getting them via rads. There‚Äôs a perk under Luck called ‚Äúclass freak‚Äù max it out and the negative effects are close to none. It‚Äôs also worth having starch genes maxed and just leave it on all the time. Both perks are must have
---
Fuck what about idk the free tab on the PlayStation store or the entirety of iOS google play stores. Free dosen‚Äôt mean we get crap content and need to lower our expectations.
---
lol its like that dude in freeside in NV that makes you pay to use the pump, what a prick
---
I had the same experience crashing repeatedly within this event (1/3-1/2 through).  What makes it egregious is that it was just one person in the event on a private server.
---
Clearly there are performance/stability problems that 
---
prevent running this event even without any other players on the server.
---
The irony
---
How is it solo?
---
I found both Fastnacht and the Meat Week one achievable solo but I haven't had the chance with this one yet.
---
What level are you? Is it hard to do alone?
---
From what I've heard you can get all of them until 12th November, the last reward will be unlocked at November 3rd, that will leave you a 9 days window to get 14000 points, you will have to win around 1600 EXP per day, which is aroun 3 matchs in top 5 players...
---
Head on over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals for a pure salt free experience. Only posts talking about enjoying the game are allowed.
---
If you actually want a salt free sub filthy casuals is the place to go. Otherwise buckle up and deal with the ride it's quite bumpy right now.
---
Glad to know it can be done solo. Looking forward to mischief tonight.   At least claim the ammo plant, ya lazy bum!  Lol
---
I always leave "You have been insulted" notes from the insult bot in the loot bags of my kills.
---
The unlimited scrap box should NEVER have been locked behind such a pay wall. it definitely changes the way everyone plays who has it. Here's hoping it gets added to the Atom store in the future (or something)
---
Very well stated my friend.  Well worded and thought out.
---
I love your sarcasm!  I hear you.  I guess I need to check and see if I have the skeleton costume. I know I have the skull mask.  It is so stupid costumes count for the Halloween event but not the weekly challenge!  Bethesda!!!!!
---
I paid 60 dollars a year ago and I should get free content!
---
Whitesprings is the best spot for hardened / glowing mass and high rad fluids, so yeah, I can see it.
---
Got a glimpse of it this morning, legendary sentry bot, got put down in a couple seconds.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, and I wait until after engine blows up the cars. I look down and wait it out. Seems to be working so far!
---
Ah ok that makes sense.  I hope thats how they do it lol.
---
This game needs more unique rewards more often. There isn't much to motivate me other that the usual exploring OCD that fallout gives me.
---
We are here if you need someone to talk to.
---
It's a reward from the new seasonal event.
---
If you never shoot the robots until like the very end, they won't ever aggro you unless they get caught in car blast. And I run a junkies explosive prime combat rifle and auto stim pieces to keep me going.
---
Not that I'm aware of.  best thing is just to look through your inventory and see if there are things there that weren't before.
---
Because some dumbass asked people not to and now more people are making posts about bringing more attention to nuking the place.
---
Im pretty sure they are full charged as ultracite
---
Got killed from lag, was ready to grab my stuff and the game completely stopped.  Turned it off for the night.  So pissed.
---
"Millions" of people have already done just that. Keep telling the rest to just go away. It's working great!
---
Way to make us feel like we got what we payed for. Buy a game and then get promised content locked behind paywalls. Mad disappointment, i used to be excited for wastelanders but i‚Äôm pretty sure any content added thats actually worth while is going to be behind paywalls.
---
Did you die during a public event like the Halloween one at the WS? If so then you do not drop your junk.
---
Or place a block on nuking over event area for the week
---
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody‚Äôs giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
---
I'm buying some...what's this?...Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
---
Thanks I need to grind it later then.
---
I believe my half full plasma cores filled all the way when I made them ultracite.  Haven‚Äôt done fusion cores though.
---
You do realize this stuff is planned 6 months to a year out right?
---
Serums and 'naturally acquired' mutations have exactly the dame effects both positive and negative.
---
The two differences are the fact that with serums you can choose which mutations you would like to acquire and that serums suppress the negative effects for an hour.
---
the game works great on private servers
---
I know that if you have a normal fusion core and and make it an ultracite it will over charge it and if you have power user maxed out it will give you 999 shots in your gatling laser. I don't know if a used core gets fully charged when making it an ultracite one but I think it does.
---
Level 281. The hardest part is the end when the assualtrons and the sentry bot gang up on you.
---
To justify the downvote I gave you.
---
Your win condition does not equal my win condition. And since scrap and inventory management are integral part of the game, this advantages do make it pay to win. Because PvP is actually benefits of your inability to stash your junk or you are forced to use weight reduction perks due to the cap on the stash.
---
I keep thinking of that. I guess I can take and the acid joint while I'm afkiing inbetwee. Events
---
Thanks for the info
---
p2w is not limited to pvp you know.
---
So you found being able to fulfil the objectives on your own in the given time achievable?
---
\#popcorn from a retired fo76 player
---
As consumers it‚Äôs our job to vocalize what we want from a company, otherwise the company will produce things we don‚Äôt want and their sales will drop, it‚Äôs in both the consumers and the producers best interest for us to say what we want and what we don‚Äôt like, it leads to maximizing profits and and happier customers
---
Other than looks, I don't think there are benefits, and that's kind of the idea.  It's a relatively easy game.  While some will try to max out their damage, I'm about how can I do more with less.  Showing up like this, when everyone else is in Power Armor, is fun.
---
The actual build is a Bloodied Unarmed melee and I'm sure it's not terribly unique in that respect.
---
So you're trolling now. Okay.
---
Oh yeah. I typically end the event with about 3 minutes to spare.
---
Once you know what to do, I can confirm it can be done solo.  Only bad part is since you are by yourself you go through a lot of ammo and need to complete first and second parts ASAP to leave time for final battle.  The first time I soloed the event I didn't leave enough time and it failed right before Sentry Bot.  That sucked.  The event will not crash at all solo.  I was blowing up everything and using explosive weapons.
---
I'm assuming it's not for every item but they will have exclusive discount events just for them
---
Yeah taking out the first two quickly great helps. But I found once you pull that legendary sentry bot, kill him fast as possible and mop up the rest. The event ends when he is killed.
---
Wow RNG loves you. Grats.
---
Love private servers willing to pay for that. But give scrapebox and Fast travel tent to everybody
---
Agreed - i got caught out with that last night and barely made it out alive
---
Yet another person making claims without actually knowing what they're talking about. I love it. This game is so rife with it.
---
Surprised your only thought wasn't "give me my money back"
---
Recently I used a grenade at a train station, aimed at a corner because I just wanted to scare a player , the guy reaction was priceless xD
---
There‚Äôs always going to be new content, changes in the game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way it‚Äôs all free after launch - all our content‚Ä¶-Pete Hines. So, where‚Äôs my free fridge, free repair kit, and free scrap box? Cosmetic-only is something I‚Äôll support, but not this. I‚Äôll still play 76, but won‚Äôt spend anymore on it. If someone can actually say how the fridge, repair kits, infinite carry weight, and protectrons aren‚Äôt non-cosmetic items aren‚Äôt non-cosmetic, I‚Äôll applaud them. But they are non-cosmetic.
---
I came upon two guys just standing around chatting in survival mode. One had a bounty. I had gone to survival mode purely to kill people. They were inside one of their camps, but the door was open. Being the coward that I am, I whipped out my BFFR Tesla Rifle and bounced a full clip of fusion cells from the front door... directly into both of them. Instant death for both players, they never even saw me coming. 
---
I then proceeded to kill them over and over. They were just level 40 noobs. I took their stuff after each kill too. I didn't need it. I have thousands of stimpacks, even like 500+ super stims, and as a bloodied build I only ever use diluted ones, which are dirt cheap.They logged off of survival and I felt kind of bad. I didn't enjoy it at all. I didn't understand why people do this. It gave me no satisfaction, no thrill. I added both of them to my friends list but they never added me back. I had planned to give them their stuff back, but I have a feeling they just never wanted to see me again.
---
To this day, I still don't understand the mentality of people that enjoy that kind of gameplay. You're literally just ruining someone elses experience, and junk / aid items are already so stupidly plentiful that there are far better ways to spend your time. If I want the thrill of PvP I'll do Nuclear Winter, where I know I won't be ruining someone elses night - they signed up for that.
---
Oh I can understand that, I‚Äôm pretty big on appearance in this game. I‚Äôve spent quite a bit of caps and time putting together my current urban scout armor, but it looks awesome. And yeah bloodied is really common among people who know the game well and want to min-max. Though it‚Äôs probably still only a small portion of the entire player base that use it.
---
Amen
---
I've noticed a lot of people killing the Legendary before it even becomes Legendary.  I don't need to point out how silly it is that they can't look up at the health bar and notice this because they are so busy shooting their explosive pew-pews.
---
It depends a lot on server stability too. Since in mischief night everybody shot the cars and the bots sometimes explode like crazy, it doesn't help imo.
---
No, not at all but and reporting it will do as much as posting about it here... on the flip side reporting someone who used a bad word especially in that context... sounds like a lil beotch Anyways...lol
---
I'm the dude complaining about a dude complaining about another dude!
---
I found that using the large grenade launcher was great for blowing up multiple car fast.
---
Not when you‚Äôd like to get it for a full year but also have to pay for your console‚Äôs online subscription to play the game at all.
---
Because it is not Bethesda and not Fallout 76. That's the HUGE difference. Also, you pay for your "free" playstation store download with your PSN subscription.
---
I strongly suspect that Fo76 is not creating enough revenue. Their people need to get paid so they concentrate more on Atom Shop, FU 1st and Wastelanders (WL because they made such a fuzz about it OR it will also be paid).  
---
The devs CAN fix anything and CAN produce good free DLC but I'm 99% sure their managers just do not give them enough time to make a quality free DLC. If the free DLC barely works, that is good enough for the managers. If paid content (like the scrap box) doesn't work, that is a different story because that creates revenue. But one-week events like this?? Nah, that isn't worth their time (or so they see it). If it was a permanent event, they might give a dev a few more hours to fix it. But even that is a stretch.   
---
I also think the financial situation is so bad that they need to create revenue NOW. The playerbase has diminished so hard that they really depend on FU1st and atom shop for getting money. Fixing bugs and creating DLC that actually works would do the overall opinion of the game much good, but the effect will be felt too late to be able to pay their employees until game sales pick up again. They're past that point. They need to create revenue with the devs they have on hand.
---
Haha no problem. I've been trying to keep an eye on the problems people are having so we can spread the knowledge around. With time limited events, I want to make the most of them.
---
And here all I've had was a guy blasting death metal so loud it was distorting my audio
---
Found Todd
---
Makes sense. I just dont have one or the ammo to use for it.
---
I vote that Tom Hanks be so named, Tommy Pumpkins, the entire month of October every year.
---
Inbefore "ITS ONLY 1 STAR AND LEGENDARY NEVER GAIN MORE STAR".
---
Thx for your post, need more people telling this.
---
Why?
---
Whale is actually an industry term that just refers to people who buy a lot of premium items. It's not meant to unperson or imply that they can't think for themselves.
---
No, the charge level of your fusion cores doesn't matter when converting it to ultracite fusion core. This is the best thing you can do with your nearly used up fusion cores. 
---
Another tip - get as much Intelligence as you can when crafting. I think 20 is the max, but get as much as possible just to be safe. This will overcharge your cores by 25%, so you get 25% more shots out of it.
---
Probably because you were working for a more credible company. This was my first job out of college and I was very naive in my job searching, I would say it was a predatory job like MLM. I got out quick and couldn‚Äôt be better now thankfully lol
---
Got the Grim Reaper Vault-Boy Cutout: https://i.imgur.com/jvP9T8r.png
---
Not me. I don't want to set the world on fire...
---
Never have the problem on pc. Xbox seems to be the only one majority effected by it id complain at microsoft.
---
I‚Äôve had the same thought. It‚Äôd be interesting if 76 is just an experiment.
---
Lets see if I get Pirate on the forth! :D
---
So - by that logic selling weapon in the shop/as part of fallout 1st  would be ok  - because it can never be p2w anyway.    Maybe you are cool with that - personally i dont really care - but i dont think most people would like that
---
But if someone likes the way it is, and doesn't want things to change, the only thing that can be done is to silence the people who don't agree with you.
---
Politics, even here.
---
Or we could be safely trick or treating inside WS like they do at malls with all of the vendors handing out ‚Äòcandy‚Äô.
---
The problem is you want one thing. The next guy wants something different.  OP wants another thing.  It‚Äôs a constant moving of the goalposts.  That‚Äôs not helpful. 
---
And when all else fails people drop back to the all inclusive ‚Äúwe just want it to work‚Äù.  Well it plays, maybe not the way you wanted it to, but it plays, so that‚Äôs not what you meant. 
---
This whole god damn outrage isn‚Äôt to better the industry.  It‚Äôs to be angry about something, looking for inclusion amongst the negativity.  Otherwise there would be no reason to even be on Reddit about this.  
---
It‚Äôs herd mentality plain and simple masquerading as some kind of self-righteous correction of the video game industry.
---
Anyone else remember WoW early raid days?  40 people showed up and the only way to reduce lag was to look at the ground, so your view wouldn't attempt to load so much at once.  Or turn graphics waaay down..
---
Also coming from a WoW community.. I recall early days when servers crashed, random maintenance might occur, losing items, gold, or progress due to a server problem..  I feel like many issues being faced in fo76 are common MMO feats.  There is a constant balance to uphold and it took blizzard yeeears to figure it out and provide something smooth and stable.  Give it time..
---
You're already paying for the consoles Online subscription.
---
That was not the point I was making. I was just saying they've gone back on their word before.
---
Oh that's a great idea, I didn't even think about that
---
Yup! Same goes for all events like uranium fever, campfire tales... 
---
Better suggestion would be to give feedback to Bethesda about this to nerf weapons and give them a weapon cap at events.
---
You're asking asshats to stop being asshats. If you figure out how to do that, please let us know.  It would be wonderful information to have.
---
PSN subscription? Destiny 2 ,battle royals, warframe,dauntless are free to all players and provide more content/stable servers than 76 ever has.
---
My team and I have let the robot sit until it stops glowing and then some multiple times. Never anything more then the 1* we've seen.
---
I will admit that I have never even heard of this. I am a BA who is signed up with multiple companies and I receive emails for jobs from all of them. I have been doing BA since I was in college and I never came across anything related or even remotely close providing fake reviews or posts. But then again, I haven‚Äôt been doing BA work for a bit now. Maybe things have changed.
---
Waving hello to people after helping them defend their workshop, contest it, shoot them in the back and steal their junk...
---
I definitely haven't been visiting this sub as often because of it. It's tiring and repetitive now. I think Bethesda knows what's up by now.
---
I see your point but to a lot of players who love to build and rebuild bases/houses the scrap box alone is worth the subscription.
---
No just walk to the train station right next door
---
Key word being was. Most games do this though - they have a huge initial development team, and then a small crew that supports it. It was even true of WoW - developing the initial game took a massive amount of work compared to just making expansions. They had to make their own engine, which itself is a huge undertaking.
---
A few Google searches should help you out. Amazon frowns upon this, so if I post how he is doing it, I may get him on trouble.
---
Not if you choose to get Fallout 1st for a year with the online subscription because those things run out.
---
But it takes longer to get to the store than it does the whitesprings trainstation
---
It happened with a patch a while back.
---
Damn synths
---
Thanks, much appreciated.
---
All the power armor parts were removed from the chassis. So you get the weight of each peice plus the chassis.  Whe  you put them back on it weighs 10 pounds again.
---
Same issue. I almost thought it was slow internet but I'm showing a solid 70+ mbps when I test it.
---
Platform?  Region?  Connection?  Wifi?
---
They did a patch to a PA bug a few months back and it did that to some people. Just put it all back together and it will work normal.
---
Had a guy bullying one of our female players so we all teamed up and killed him repeatedly.
---
I brought him to his knees 4 times and ate him.
---
It was delicious.
---
You're a piece of SCRAP.
---
They patched some PA related issues a while back and one of the consequences was all the pieces were removed from their frames.  
---
Your best bet would be to crawl to the nearest box and basically reapply your inventory.
---
Yeah, like your not going to renew your PS Plus or live.
---
Value is in the eye of the beholder I think it's cheap other not so much. We're all entitled to our own views when it comes to money.
---
I saw a lvl 200+ at the Red Rocket workshop, jumped over there for some pvp on my lvl 100, thought it would be more than a fair fight.  I walk in the workshop and instantly start capping it, I sit with my chameleon armor making me invisible, and the guy basically walks right up to me and I kill him.
---
Turns out that guy had 30 or more randomly assorted flux on his body, plus 50 or more ballistic fiber, and 200 pounds or more of other random junk.  I instantly took the bag and stood outside the workshop just to have the guy come back and say "WOW DUDE I WAS JUST TAKING A PICTURE OF THE RED ROCKET GAS STATION FOR MY DAILY, GIVE ME MY SHIT BACK"
---
My response: "Nah dude, it's your own fault for walking in a PvP zone with 20k worth of shit in your backpack."  And leave like a bandit.
---
To this day I'm still living off that man's junk.
---
And bad decisions in general, and bugs, and lack of content...
---
I'm up for that, mcpoyle82
---
Get the following perks:
---
nerd rage
---
serendipity
---
dodgy
---
adrenaline
---
bloody mess
---
starched genes
---
\+ the adrenal reaction mutation
---
On top of those, try finding a bloodied legendary weapon to increase your damage output even further. Use an Assaultron head laser to increase your rads and lower your health until you see nerd rage activate. When you're at sub-20% health, you'll deal insane amounts of damage. Another piece of advice is to craft yourself some diluted stimpaks as they're more efficient at low health.
---
If you find yourself dying a lot with this build, you can try using a vampire's legendary gun to keep regenerating health. They're especially useful as a heavy gunner.
---
Platform?  Region? Connection?  Wifi?
---
Convenience is an advantage. They're very similar in definition even.
---
What emote?
---
Did we find out if the XP resets each day or if it is cumulative for the event?
---
Where can I sign up? I want to be a paid shill as well
---
We‚Äôll give you a second...
---
My brother in law has been selling fine. Picking up, even. The other one, who just trades overpriced legendaries in a constant loop, also has been selling fine.
---
Sounds like a bad night of sales. I only ever bother selling ammo, plans, and a few odds and ends here and there and I've never had a consistent stream of customers. The few times I have were jusr people buying my few weapons to resell them in their own vendors.
---
i crashed once, but my friend crashed all throughout the night, but only at the event.  She was pretty discouraged form playing for a while after all that
---
How does it feel to be in an abusive relationship?
---
Your a jerk.
---
Sentry bot glicth isn't even fixed lol
---
exactly
---
That could be the case. Thanks!
---
r/vore_irl
---
It does. I wasn't aware of that. Thanks!
---
its all still there, but you have to drag it all out and re-assemble, and put it all back in your stash. they had us all at a train station at log in to sort all out. was to do with duping and bugs.
---
Whitespring has always been a hotbed of crashes for me, event or not. There's something about the area that just doesn't work all the time.
---
Or you could stop giving them money.
---
Also check mainframe cores
---
I never clued into that as I'm relatively new to FO76. Thank you for the clarification!
---
For what?  Not coddling the guy when he did something very stupid?  Workshops are pvp zones and should be respected as such, especially when bethesda took out the only way to pvp and not have crybaby's like you complain about it.
---
It's their own fault for walking in a pvp zone with 200+ pounds of junk.
---
This one seems particularly bad - the exploding cars and the ‚Äúfixed‚Äù sentry bot gunfire noise does a number.
---
I missed the one hour bit initially thank you! I'm also in the process of a character respec so my luck is only at 3 and I constantly have to swap cards around when looking for raw materials
---
Same here half the time the cars and robots don‚Äôt load, it sounds like scorched earth and runs like it to.
---
Zero problems/lag doing the event on both public and private servers, and I must have done at least 4-5 runs.  Core i7 w 32GB of RAM and GTX 1070...  maybe your computer/console is just shit and can‚Äôt keep up with that many explosions, particle effects, etc?
---
The bugs, lack of more content, etc. are pretty standard for a first year online game.
---
You aren‚Äôt, but holy crap if you look at YouTube, the civil war really kicks off there, but me I‚Äôm like Switzerland for both world wars just sitting back eating my popcorn while the caos issues
---
You raise a good point lol, I see him a bit more than that but I take Charleston junkyard a lot and its one of his stops
---
It'd be funny to have him sell them but yeah, not very efficient lmao
---
You're the problem not us. I bet you would pay 40 dollars to eat their shit.
---
How is having a reward from an event completion just handing you items?
---
jesus  they are not done yet
---
hey guys we have another circle jerk!!
---
Y‚Äôall choose to still play this is the real thing making you an idiot
---
Never saw it as three star, weird. I've done the event alot too.
---
Or it could be that people are sick of being charged full price for an unfinished product and don't share your slavish devotion to brand loyalty.
---
The internet is going to internet. Tis a blessing
---
the cabins n/w of flatwoods. You wont need to build anything, its spooky enough as it is.
---
I graduated in 2016 so idk. But indeed.com is FULL of predatory companies. I had better luck on LinkedIn after I left that company. It was a learning experience for sure
---
Thanks a ton for the fast responses! Yeah I found all the parts in my inventory and 1 frame on me, crawled to a nearby train station and fixed it!
---
That's not what this is about.  'Cap sinks' are what high levels need to dump their money into.  
---
With the ability to farm unmolested, there will be a glut of supply on the market.  Our 'market' has a controlled limit to both income and inventory.  1st creates a positive feedback loop in supply without any way to counter it with demand, unless people just stop selling stuff.   It's bad enough that we have a 30k caps/1,000 scrip limit to our characters and a stash weight limit for items like legendaries, so creating the inability to dump some of that so we can properly sell items in our own vendors makes this a very difficult economic situation.  
---
Example:    
---
Jack is a legenday widget farmer.  Jack sells legendary widgets for 500 caps each and they sell ok because there are a limited supply of those widgets out there.  Suddenly the Chinese enter the market, begin dumping legendary widgets and the price tanks (because they've been farming them on 1st).  Suddenly Jack is either selling legendary widgets at a heavily reduced price or he isn't getting regular business and his inventory fills up.  Simple supply and demand you'd think. 
---
But it gets worse.  
---
Buyers are simply not buying large numbers of legendary widgets because they only need a few at a shot, so Jack needs to dump some inventory.  Jack can only dump a limited amount of his inventory for legendary script (150 daily), which means he has a full inventory and no reason to farm/play until he can dump more.  
---
Keith is a legendary widget buyer, but likes to sell non-legendary widgets at his store.  
---
Keith has 30k in caps he wants to burn so he can sell some stuff at his store.  Unfortunately, the legendary widgets he normally buys to dump some cash into are suddenly stupid cheap.  He just has no use for the number of legendary widgets he would need to buy so he has cap room to open his store.   Keith either has to find another way to dump his caps, or he might as well not bother opening his vendor today (or bother playing either).  
---
While it's more complex than this, it really boils down to the artificial limits placed on what we can have versus what is available.  
---
Once you hit max, you're essentially done playing.
---
?
---
Ps4 especially is like this. Probably because of server lag due to carrying 500 cores of varying charge that probably all count as separate items for the server to manage
---
I don't think they are, son.
---
&gt; My brother and I run bloodied builds and one of our pet peeves is people who build Rad Showers into their entrances.

This literally never occurred to me before now. I'll have to move my rad shower when I next log in. (Or at least add a switch.)

As an aside, I found the amazon plugin ReviewMeta.com Analyzer to be really fascinating. When you're on an Amazon product, it scans through all the reviews and deletes the ones from new accounts or that have a weird pattern of reviews or use similar suspicious phrasing to give you an average score of all the rest of the reviews. I promise this is not a shill account ;)

I did this morning. Got a costume and a pumpkin grenade. That is the first one I have attended, so not sure what to expect in the way of prizes. BTW, the robots will hurt you bad if your only in a hazmat suit. :-)

also if you don't like the mire, the huntmasters lodge up in the toxic valley should have a bunch of parts.

How? I want the items to move away from monetization and be unlocked through an event

---
It‚Äôs not to send a message. It‚Äôs just funny
---
It still doesn't change the fact that this game launched buggy and still is buggy as ever.
---
 No amount of good PR or Marketing would've saved this game from the backlash it's gotten, they just needed to make an actual game that worked without too many bugs in the first place.
---
I truly think of they had started out saying there will be a year of free service, and then after that a monthly subscription no one would have batted an eye. The same with the AS, if they had said we will slowly be adding utility items no one would have cared. It's a great game despite the bugs. But they keep lying and messing up.
---
My PS4 slim was able to do it without crashes. Some events were really laggy but still completed. I even server hopped into another active one without meaning two without problems.
---
Pleasure.
---
If you want to use multiple mutations and not treat the serums as consumables - as in: drink serums, when the 'grace period' expires 'take a shower', remove the mutations then consume the serums again; it is entirely possible to do so, I did that for a while until I got tired of being enslaved to min-maxing - it can get rough without Class Freak... You may want to invest a few more points on Luck to make your life easier.
---
You haven‚Äôt played many MMO‚Äôs from launch then. As my post stated if you hold this game to the standards of a single player game or compare it to other titles in the series it‚Äôs a complete dumpster fire. If you compare it to other online games/MMO‚Äôs it‚Äôs about on par with its problems lack of content.  The point of my post was that because of how Bethesda marketed the game people are justifiably holding it to the standards of the type of game that it just isn‚Äôt.
---
I agree these babies have been crying for so long. its getting annoying.
---
they are so butthurt that someone wants to fund a game that is loved by more than its hated by.
---
and in this case the minority that hates on the game feel frustrated because they know they are a minority and that no one will listen or take them serious, and no one should to be clear.
---
I for one has gotten used to them by now, seeing their salty asses. and enjoying their salty tears is actually making  my otherwise boring day at work alot more fun
---
Pretty much most of the 1st features are broken or actually hurting players, so I think people are just mostly talking about those.
---
Yea, I may get it eventually but right now I'm mostly playing fortnite battlepasses so my subscription funds are currently being used elsewhere
---
Whitespring.  Spring.  Singular.
---
And the same ones just with lights you can pay for!
---
And now people act shocked lol
---
Yea, um I can definitely afford it, so calling people poor instead of informed isn't a good idea. 
---
Not me because I know what you mean, but as an example I'm into LP's (shout out to r/vinyl), got the Doom LP, and about to buy Fallout 4 soundtrack to frame around my PC. The cost of that is about $150, and this is music I can get anywhere, and yes I have enough LP's to go on the wall but I wanted the Fallout theme because I have a fallout NZXT case. Not anymore. 
---
Cost isn't even the biggest factor here for me, it's the lying and stealing. Now I'm going to rant for a sec.
---
They sold us a game that wasn't totally ready and we tried to help and instead we are told they need more money. This is all because they sold a game half baked, they knew it but my guess is that this all takes money and this game made none. Maybe I'm wrong and I really don't want to give them any ideas on how to lie their way out of this.
---
I'm done, yes I can afford it, but I also understand what you mean. But it's not that.
---
Different forum... Wow, you stalking me... Must be one lonely fucker. Want my home address too? You pervert.
---
That‚Äôs a very good point as well and another colossal failure on PR/Marketing‚Äôs shoulders. The only question is whether they knew this from the start.
---
You just gotta be quick. The hope is that more people realize this and do it instead of saying ‚Äúwell nobody shares with me so I‚Äôm gunna kill it myself‚Äù as like a revenge thing against the other players.
---
Every Uranium Fever event I have ever done, players stuff the enemy in the spawn before most people can get to it.
---
One time, and one time only, i had a guy wave at me to show me where it was hiding.
---
People like him probably make up &lt;1% of the population, but their service will be remembered.
---
We sing songs about them in Sovngarde!
---
I mean, you‚Äôre not wrong! 
---
I imagine if things were more reasonably priced on there more people would actually want to spend real money on atoms
---
It's not really all that lore breaking.     
---

---
Dont want to actually work for it?
---
I guess I just assumed there would be something up there since it was advertised
---
Because if the cool cosmetics aren‚Äôt in the atom shop, then how else can they fund future content?
---
Thanks for contributing to the problem.
---
I killed a lvl 3 at a workshop, killed plenty of lowbies and taken all they're junk. Taken so junk I've filled 2 full lvl 1 junk weight characters all the way up and take every workshop i see no matter the level. I also go around hitting people with a shovel 2 see if they're stupid enough 2 attack back.
---
Is it really?
---
The game was in development for 5 years and likely cost them a pretty penny (a workforce of 100 employees each paid 60k/y is $30m over that period,  and I'm sure it they employed over 100, as previous Fallouts had the staff between 160-300). You can see that they may have as well spent e.g. $100m, so to break it even, you need to sell 1.5m copies at $60  (probably closer to 2.5m considering distribution fees etc.). It doesn't seem like much, but my cost estimations might be off, so you in turn need more copies.
---
The game was 50% off 2 weeks after release so it's already telling you it wasn't selling great. I bought it for $12 only 6 weeks after release so there were some massive discounts involved.
---
It's entirely possible they barely broke even, and the studio needs money to cover the budget of their current operations, so it's very much not a ridiculous notion that they would be using Online Marketing to mitigate the outrage we are all expressing.
---
What system?  I know I completed the event a few times when it crashed and all I got was a headgear item and pumpkin grenade when I should have received much more!  I find to avoid crashes towards the end just take it easy.  Avoid explosive weapons and take a back seat.  If you rock TSE and run around like crazy you will probably get stuck in a loop etc.
---
TLDR - you wasted your time because no one fucking cares what you think.
---
This
---
Because if the cool cosmetics aren‚Äôt in the atom shop, there‚Äôs only one other possible revenue source, things like repair kits, scavenger bots and Fallout 1st
---
Final fantasy xiv... Starwars battlefield 2... Destiny 1. Sims 4... Street fighter 5... 
---
It's not that you don't remember that these lacked content its that your trying to forget.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong, my point though is that they could have set expectations differently and sold the game for what it was actually going to be. The amount of bugs didn‚Äôt and don‚Äôt surprise me for an online game.
---
Yeah i have. Ypu just dont like the answer. Use the infinite scrap for whatever the fuck i need across all my alts. Also, i dont believe you.
---
Plasma grenade plans only drop from Battle Bot event in Ash Heap, at a rate of 0.04% (roughly, last number I saw for it)
---
I played for two hours yesterday. Went from 6000 caps to 15000 caps. People were buying everything. Legendary weapons, plans, mods, ammo, junk. Hadn‚Äôt had much in the way of sales the week before (figure the market was flooded with stuff after the purveyor sale)
---
Well you will have 10 days to get that for what it‚Äôs worth.
---
For them to do it for 4 and leave it out on 76 messed me up. My gameplay revolved around using it in fallout 4
---
Yeah unlimied scrap box is the definition of pay to win is it not? I don't see how this is anything BUT a pay to win system here. Unlimited scrap space is a gamechanging feature, locked behind a paywall.
---
You don't have to defend them after the first time. Just build the workshop in a way 1 mob gets "stuck" and the "defend xxx" will never complete, which means no new defend quests will start in that workshop.
---
You can bug out a mob at each workshop and then never need to defend them.
---
no, you not right
---
it can also drop from crates with low chance
---
Do u know how many times i completed the damn event?
---
I think at least some of the people who do that just don‚Äôt know about bloodied builds etc. 
---
I have a friend who is level 90 or so but doesn‚Äôt browse reddit (or any Fallout forums), he built his in his doorway and I had to explain why I couldn‚Äôt come in his house. He thought it was a cool idea and he was doing something nice. 
---
If someone does that, don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôs just to be a dick to you, or that everybody should be walking encyclopedias of Fallout builds. Just, you know, don‚Äôt go in their camp.
---
Keep playing. The rest of us have to

I‚Äôm on Xbox. I try to avoid blowing up the cars and looking away cuz that seems to help the lag a tiny bit. And I‚Äôll spray paint walls and light the fires. Towards the end I trick or treat and fork the lawn until the final robot comes out. I use the unstoppable monster for that so no explosive weapons during that event for me.
---
Haven't played any of those. But for each one I can find another game that wasn't lacking content at all.
---
It's not something "standard". It's you wanting it to be to justify a crappy game.
---
The original Gambryo engines with slight modifications*
---
Oooooooo
---
One of my gripes is that what they're selling now isn't the same as what they were selling at the start.  Nothing (outside of cosmetics) were locked behind a subscription when I ordered, but today that is no longer the case.
---
I enjoy the game, but I don't think I'd purchase it today with the changes they've made.
---
I was thinking last night. They said they were going to add free fast travel to events on the world map. They‚Äôre totally going to make that a fallout 1st feature.
---
I joined "One Violent Night" and there was one other guy doing the event who had the "noise" bar already about 80% of the way done. 
---
I posted myself up on the rafters to take head shot ghouls on as they came through the door. 
---
When the Legendary Wendigo spawned I thought to myself "I'll crit him to knock him into health regen, because it'll make the fight quicker." I hit VATS, queued the crit, and fired.
---
Forgot I was targeting heads. Killed the Wendigo in one hit, totally screwing that other guy out of the legendary drop loot.
---
I'm pretty sure he literally yelled at his screen, because he proceeded to unload at least one full clip of his minigun into me. (Which did no damage, of course, so he was denied even the satisfaction of killing me.)
---
I felt like an asshole. This game REALLY needs a "My bad" emote.
---
Just because you don't enjoy it doesn't me somebody else can't enjoy it either.  And the two lvl 40 people you killed sound like they were pve boys trying to get a free %20 xp boost in a world made for PvP...
---
There's times in survival where I've ran up to a massive firefight of 6 or more people at a train station, just to jump in and kill a few myself, get killed a few times, and generally just join in on the fun of the pvp that everybody there was enjoying.
---
Since they fucked up and took survival out, all I can do now to have some fun PvP every once in a while is look out for workshops, and even that is considered "toxic" when it's got a big warning sign that says "You're opening yourself up to pvp, workshops are a pvp zone" that EVERYBODY THAT OWNS A WORKSHOP has to say "yes" to.
---
But yeah, I'm the bad guy for killing somebody in a pvp zone, literally exactly as the game was intended.
---
&gt;To a large portion your hardcore single player Fallout series fan base, this game is a complete dumpster fire compared to other titles in the series. To your avid everyday Online gamers and hardcore MMO gamers there is nothing too bad or out of the ordinary for where FO76 is currently at other than a lack of dedicated open PVP space.
---
This is hilarious. I happen to be an avid fan of both the Fallout series, as well as a number of MMO's (EverQuest, Guild Wars, Star Wars the Old Republic, The Secret World, and FFXIV, to name but a few), and *Fallout 76* does not qualify as even a *passable* entry in either one of those spaces.
---
You already conceded that it doesn't hold up as a *Fallout* game, so I won't go there. But as an MMO it potentially falls even shorter, in that it doesn't have well-structured loot progression, enjoyable (or even functional) group content (dungeons, raids, world bosses, etc.), or PVP outside of their trend-chasing and forgettable Battle Royale mode. 
---
Even more shamefully, all of the MMO's I listed above (with the possible exception of EverQuest) obliterate *Fallout 76* when it comes to questing‚Äîsomething that should have been a cinch for Bethesda. 
---
If anything, *Fallout 76* has more DNA in common with the likes of *RUST* and whatever that Conan game was called. Does it even compete on their level? I really don't know, since I loathe and completely avoid those games, and perhaps that is why I dislike *Fallout 76* so much: I find it, like those games, boring and barren... And that has nothing to do with incompetent PR‚Äîthough there's plenty of that‚Äîthat's just my experience of the game. 
---
Which isn't to say that there weren't highlights along the way: I found enough to enjoy that I only jumped ship after being repeatedly disappointed by the content drops, with the final nail in the coffin being the wretched vault 'raid.' But that enjoyment derived *solely* from what the game shares in common with previous *Fallout* entries. At no point did I think to myself "heck yeah, this game is totally scratching my MMO itch." Coming from the likes of *FFXIV*, that would be laughable. 
---
It's just a bad game. Time to stop making excuses.
---
Shill account
---
I‚Äôm guessing it will be heavily discounted items every once and a while, probably ones with high demand rather than a constant savings.
---
I‚Äôve accidentally one-shot legendaries a couple times when I got overzealous and forgot to switch to my tagging pistol. Feels bad.
---
I mean, if it happens all the time, it's no longer a bug, it's a feature.
---
That‚Äôs a big part of what I‚Äôm saying.
---
Player was AFK on the roof of a car (group of 3 cars). Boom.
---
I completed the Meat Week event almost 100 times during both offerings and never received the Tenderizer weapon, got plenty of mods but never the weapon itself.  I feel your pain, I just bought the damn weapon from Reddit for 5k.  RNG at its finest!
---
Theres a bunch of other shit in there that isnt Halloween and is cool
---
Xbox one X here. I completed it about 4 times with a little lag, but that was probably because most of the server showed up.
---
I still believe all the dlcs will be free for everyone. Theh are already dancing with getting sued by foriegn nation digital laws and such. Now there will be specific in game skins and such for 1st players which makes sense but hopefully this stops them from paid extra stash and such
---
I've played 10 times on public servers and haven't had a single crash.
---
between loading times, the event going slideshow, and everyone's overpowered weaponry nuking the last guy in 4 seconds before i can even get a bead on him the event is extremely not an exercise in frustration
---
You know this would take just as long to arrive right?
---
I respect your opinion but I think you're wrong good day sir.
---
It's about time. These people need an intervention and get out of this abusive relationship.
---
Played it 3 times now crashed all 3 of those times first one was right as the event finished,got the rewards, other two times had to restart the game and get into a new event
---
My superhuman powers of summarization are still intact!
---
Tbh the value of the subscription exceeds its cost...
---
If, and only if you where already dropping 10-20 bucks on atoms a month and view the atoms to USD exchange as a fair rate. Not going to get into other countries because I don‚Äôt know enough about them, their tax laws or anything like that. 
---
If you, like me do not purchase atoms regularly then it‚Äôs not a good deal.
---
Your post really doesn't prove anything though.
---
Just curious, how much do you sell magazines for?
---
Skip the defends and do the retake or recapture or whatever it‚Äôs called. You won‚Äôt get the rewards or as much xp but when farming it doesn‚Äôt matter. You‚Äôll only have one wave and it‚Äôs quick.
---
If it is like ESO+ then it will be an item or two once a month or so for a week-ish.
---
i can lower the price on the bolt action to 1,450 caps
---
Whats the first prefix on the 10mm?
---
Maybe I just had a different experience, I just remember both were playable.  The worst that could happen is you couldn‚Äôt log on, but they did not crash completely in game.
---
They didn't even care if we liked the game just if we liked the TV commercial
---
Same answer as from me as it has been less than 24 hours, thus less than 24 events.  But come November 4th if you don't get want you want, nothing wrong with spending caps of trading for something you want.  Free market.
---
Pc or console.
---
Thx for the tipp. I did not do this because i wasn't sure if i could come back to my current server and I hoped for an eventual respawn
---
I don't disagree with you. I just see alot of ppl hating on it without even giving it the 1st month to test out. The only real advantage I have over the ones who don't have it is that I can go farm whatever I want and know no one's hit that spot yet. I can't keep enough scrap around for the box to matter anyway. The plus side that I saw was that I was spending 10 or 20$ a month on atoms anyway so why not get the 1650 plus a server plus a box for scrap for what I normally spend anyway. Yes it does send Bethesda the wrong message about what we want for the game but they probably won't change their pace weather I bought the membership or not.
---
That would‚Äôve been cool, I played the Beta and I don‚Äôt remember them being in but I probably was too focused on just trying to accomplish the first couple quests than building my Camp. Yeah it‚Äôd be nice for it to make a comeback and the creators only make it able to be placed on a floor or hard location
---
Helmet is a available for sale by Cap'n in the whitesprings
---
the level?
---
Its why im on ESO more atm cause there is like a butt ton to gain farming the event. Dremora motif is just so hot.
---
Cap‚Äôn? Ok

I'm here mostly to see what reasoning people will come up with to defend this utter fuckery.
---
Now with the mischief event its even worse

---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking, who knows maybe they‚Äôll add it back in
---
I believe the solution is to log off your private server and log right back in.  My understanding is that the bomb kills the creatures that exist there at the time - if you are the only one on the server left then the script can't run to spawn the new creatures, but leaving and comping back will place them

Bunch of consoles screaming out for mercy I guess
---
You will get a notification on your left side thw event picture will show up and make a sound. Thats how you know you got a outfit/headpieces that works. As of everything in game we ofc need to find this out without the help of bethesda.
---
And people are talking about headpiece in power armor and yes you only need a headpiece. So take off the helmet the dmg energy and rad resistance will only go down the amount thats on the helmet. You will have no light but thats no gamebreaker, in this case. (Damn mist!)
---
But aren't the people who assume without any kind of verification the ACTUAL morons? Think about it.
---
I haven‚Äôt tried it yet so just going off what was posted. 2 people said and there‚Äôs also a video of mass amounts of ghouls, so be ready!...lol

Is that what we did? Or did we intorduce to predominantly colored inner cities and make the penalties a hundred times worse than powdered cocaine?
---
Some guy built ontop of my house once, so I had to move it, which clashed with the terrain. I lost three turrents, and eight crops, so I was mad. I bombed his house for an hour. Nothing, no damage, so I lock picked his door, and just played his instruments until he came home.
---
All of them PlayStation.  Maybe that was my problem with FO76, because the others really ran seemless compared to FO76
---
I don't play any MMOs so I can't comment from that aspect but you sound right to me otherwise.
---
The communication has been poor, and the follow-up on that communication has been even poorer.  For example, even before the game launched, Todd Howard was saying a lot of things like, *"We're trying something new"* and *"We're not sure where we'll end up.  The game will evolve as people get their hands on it and give us feedback."*  
---
Even the "cosmetic only" thing is a huge blunder on their part.  Because as far as I have seen they never ever promised "cosmetic only" in the Atomic Shop.  There was a Pete Hines quote about miniguns that was taken out of context.  That's what started this whole thing.  People ran with it, and Bethesda never corrected that impression.  They never got out ahead of it and said, *"Pete was just talking about minigun skins specifically, he did not mean that all items we ever add will only be cosmetic.  We're still feeling out this whole thing and haven't come to a long-term decision on that yet."*  They did go public with wishy-washy vague messaging about the Atomic Shop that amounted to "We'll see...we're still figuring out and we don't want to go too far in a bad direction."  People took that to mean "cosmetic only" but it's not what they were saying.  What they were saying was more nuanced.  They bear the blame here for not correcting public impressions in a swift and clear fashion.
---
Managing expectations is a huge thing with keeping customers happy.  My first steady job was as a pizza delivery driver.  I learned pretty quickly that people will happily wait an hour if you tell them it'll take an hour.  But if you tell them 30 minutes, they're going to be pissed off when you show up in 60.  
---
With this game, they said from the start that it's a big risk, it's a big experiment, and they would change it a lot based on how players reacted to it.  If they had shouted that message more loudly from the rooftops, I think people would've been more forgiving.  If they had had a six month (or a year) BETA to get player feedback, fix the early bugs, and understand where they needed to go with it before charging people money, I think people would've been more forgiving.  But the game was released too soon in an unfocused state, and players didn't really hear the messaging about it being a work in progress.
---
I'm sure they would change some things if they had it to go back and do over again.
---
Oh god oh fuck what have I done
---
I can only assume it will happen down the road like starting after the halloween even and will probably be something outside holiday events like exclusive items that have been vaulted or pre existing if we are lucky it will be new stuff
---
Because the people that bought our "representatives" are profiting from it. The sooner the common people realize we, regardless of political ideology, have *no* friends in federal and much of state government, the better.
---
Legality is not based on morality; it's rules for the working class, written by the ruling class.
---
It's all the plants and trees I think that all try to render at once.
---
Don't even need to do that, just "trap" one mob from the first defend, and keep them alive but in a place they can't attack the workshops workbench, then the defend will never complete, meaning no new ones will ever start.
---
No, exposive is a secondary modifier. I want to know what the prefix is (Vampire, Medic's, Bloodied, Berserker, etc)
---
Not so sure about that, after all, there was plenty of outrage back in 2018 even over the originally announced business model, now imagine talking about a monthly subscription.
---
I am amazed people still ‚Äúplay‚Äù this garbage and are willing to pay Bethesda $100 a year on top of that. Open your eyes people. Bethesda is a terrible company that does not deserve your money. They also don‚Äôt give a fuck about you. Just how much money they can squeeze out of you. Play The Outer Worlds, an actual GOOD game by a GOOD developer. Fuck Bethesda and fuck Fallout 76.
---
Oooh, I love this idea!
---
I don't sell or trade shit too often unless it's to people in my discord that I help out.  So I honestly have no clue, but that's the most flux I've had drop off of anybody in a workshop before.
---
I even tried to recommend to the guy "Hey dude, in the future it's probably a better idea to put this stuff in your stash box rather than walk into a pvp area with it."  And all he said was "WELL YOU DONT HAVE TO BE A DICK ABOUT IT" lmao...
---
I did the same thing last night except I claimed the converted munitions factory and Grafton steel yard. The defend workshop events are a good reminder to go clear out the resources once it's full though, and I was able to do the Mischief Night three times without having to defend my workshop at the same time.
---
"If you‚Äôre comparing FO76 and holding it to the same standards as other Fallout titles you‚Äôre way off base"
---
You're right, we should be holding Fallout 76 to a different standard. SIXTEEN TIMES the standard, in fact.
---
exactly so wouldn‚Äôt that give the hackers the advantage they need
---
All good until they place the mat in a way to trap you or force you to pick a lock or on a ledge...lol
---
Go to the Freakshow
---
"You have contracted ghoul mouth" -5 charisma
---
That‚Äôs awful
---
Junkies Mini is fantastic if you can keep from being crowded, like Minis in general. I'm particularly fond of Junkies shotguns, Plasma Gats and .50 cals
---
I know, the game engine has its bugs.  I have completed probably almost 50 events in my time since last November in which loot doesn't register.  Better luck next time. :(  If you want to run this on a private session in the next day or so shoot me a message.  I'll be on latter most night.  EST time zone for me.
---
People have got to make their own fun in this shell of a game.
---
PSn Id FritoZ, Ill be on tonight after work!
---
https://youtu.be/S_7_urh2pcg
---
Saw this recently, thought this might answer what you asked.
---
ESO in comparison was absolutely not the case , hell aside from cimstant fixes and improvments we got a entire new zone .
---
It's gobs of fun when it works. Had a really good run with a quite few folks earlier in the evening, but a teammate crashed later on, and that was that. Hopefully there's a way to re-tune what's happening just outside of an active zone while the event plays out to reduce the disconnects some.
---
Everyday
---
I have 3 of my merchants right at whitesprings so after each event I had alot of customers and sales
---
10-20 bucks a month.. 
---
And people wonder why the industry is turning into a microtransaction shitshow. Why develop a million dollar game for 60 bucks when you can make a skin and sell it at 10-20?
---
Ah ya console genraly fairs better vs game crashes. PC had a lot of it. I didnt botger with F76 on pan as I had a new gaming rig at the time. But SWBF crashed a lot for me. üòû
---
For real, it was happening just long enough to where I literally thought Bethesda selected players in the game to over time just evolve into Ghouls, and unfortunately for me, I was on that list lol
---
the 10mm pistol is a nocturnal i dont use these guns alot so i dont know the exacts starts but i know there either level 45 or 50 
---
but i wont be on until 4pm or 3pm central time
---
Thx for the reply. I will try again soon
---
Yeah, you're right. There should be a legendary vendor too, just to keep in the spirit of it being awesome and having it all- in fact fucking mmmmmurrrgh should mole mine his happy ass over there himself. The restaraunt upstairs has changed my game.
---
That‚Äôs very kind! Does it run smoother on private sessions?
---
I can‚Äôt wait to try it in an older FX CPU with half the RAM and half the GPU only to find that it runs fine on my rig ü§£
---
Yeah, enjoy returning your banjo, gold statue guy
---
Right so as I said, it‚Äôs got all of the problems and monetary practices of an MMO but is running on a single player engine with those limitations. Many many many other MMO‚Äôs and online titles suffered from lack of content during phase one of release.
---
ahhhh now if they could only be nice enough to die in some water...
---
\*This\* right here is what I was wondering. Are we on the road to be the new ESO? I think we are.
---
Yes you go back to the same server. It's great to transfer items between characters.
---
I‚Äôve solo‚Äôd PP about a dozen times since the new patch. 
---
The alpha at the end 50% of the time was just a plain ol crowned alpha. 
---
I‚Äôve had 100‚Äôs of sickly radstags and only a handful
---
The damn friendly always wanders off to god knows where.
---
Haha, that would be a pretty sweet addition. Probably a little too creative for them though. üòÇ
---
Yeah i have so many junkies weapons that didnt sell on the market. So i said screw lets make a mule account and make a junkie build. It will be my first time actually sticking to a certain build. So hopefully ill enjoy it
---
Not talking about the bear arm, but the plan to make them
---
This is one of those instances where the backlash will be worth the monetary gain for them. I‚Äôm not arguing that your points are not valid or good, just that from a marketing standpoint these things will never be free (except a free trial here and there) and enough people will buy it to justify the backlash.
---
I solo this event on my private world. 
---
If anyone wants a lag free, no bug experience I‚Äôll be on later.
---
So releasing broken games at full AAA price being the norm makes it ok?
---
I would see a psychologist if I were paying for Fallout First üòÇ
---
Yeah I've done it like 10 times and I've yet to get it past 1 star
---
I have literally never noticed that there was no s at the end. Kind of just had my mind blown here and feel like a jerk for spelling it wrong dozens and dozens of times. Thanks.
---
Don't worry, "someday" we will get that QOL upgrade they (Bethesda) keeps talking about and then you wont have to tell players that anymore.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm just bored of the game at this point
---
So you think people who jump to conclusions with no information are....smart? Just trying to understand here.
---
Buncha twats really.  Nukes should be disabled from hitting Whitesprings during this event.
---
Damn dude. I was playing last night and had to pay caps. I don‚Äôt have 1st
---
or the other church nearby, up the road from boomer, with the organ playing.
---
People even back when adventure was out, still went in there expecting to not experience a single bit of PVP and get their free 20% xp boost.
---
Thats what it seems like to me. 1st sub is a cash grab, but its that or pack it up and shut it down to pappy zenimax, their q4 needs to be good or theyll have some closures, reassignments. This may be why wastelanders was delayed, low staffing or output compared to 6 mos ago, devs probably spread super thin. 
---
The wheels are starting to wobble.
---
Everywhere on here is saying they still have the issues on pc and private servers. You are the first to say private servers don‚Äôt have issues
---
Interesting...  
---
Usual Keybinding, pardon the question, but is there a specific reason you use T vs W?
---
My team i play with have a no nuke policy on whitesprings during this event. But this is on private servers though.
---
Thanks, will try to replicate
---
I've crashed once out if the two times I done the event. This is why I'm NOT paying for the subscription.
---
What are the links associated with "here and here"?
---
I went in there for the weapons with full intention of probably getting killed. I never really cared for the do boost though it was more some stupid .44 pistol that took me a whole day to get lol.
---
Hard drive will slow things down some, but the network speed/latency will make much more of a difference.  If they're really taking 5 minutes to load a zone, it's unlikely that a HDD is the (only) issue.
---
I wanted to try it out for a month, get the outfit, atoms, etc. I don't want to to auto-renew, though.
---
When you "cancel" you just prevent it from auto-renewing. You still have all the features until your subscription period ends.
---
Half of the weapons i have to refavorate just about everytime i load the game.
---
How is the scrap box any different than the craft bag in ESO?
---
Well said
---
:(
---
Of course!  I'm not assuming they're being a dick to me, but this was a thread about the worst things I've done to another player, which is just that.  While this particular situation is definitely a dick move, it can potentially encourage them to put their Rad Showers in a less vulnerable place.  When I first got my shower plans, I protected mine because I was terrified of the scrap cost of rebuilding it.  
---
I'm definitely not blaming the guy for doing it because some people just don't know, but it wears you down when every other camp you visit forces you through a shower to go shopping.
---
The Uranium Fever event is an excellent example and I am happy to report that more than once i have had people share. So either I am very fortunate or maybe we can raise that &lt;1% up to 5 or maybe even 10%?
---
The event steps lag to update a bit but I've had nothing as bad as most peeps here bloody hell.
---
you're the one with the problem, you're the one who need to pick up their pitchfork
---
Apparently you're suppose to be able to take your helmet off PA and wear a mask. That was what Lady said when they announced it.
---
But how else will Bethesda be able to milk their fans for more money?
---
Overall most think it should have been available to all and just "skins" for it in the Atomic Shop, it's widely debated but still an unresolved issue inside the community.
---
wow.
---
My bet is all these ‚Äúpaywall‚Äù features will be available to everyone via atomic shop in a couple months. Hence the name Fallout ‚Äú1st‚Äù. First to get/try new stuff is the way I look at it. Scrap bot and fridge were a test and they saw they could get even more out of it with the sub and other new paid features. Camp size will be next ‚Äúfirst‚Äù.
---
Not at all, and I never said that. Quite the opposite.
---
Same here. Sometimes i get the impression we should NOT be able to like them both.
---
haha, don't forget, when u do pull out the weapon u want, it'll be magically unloaded
---
I run almost this exact same combo of junkies weapons. Explosive shotgun for crippling, Minigun &amp; Gat Plasma for queen, .50 cal for general play and a suppressed +33 vats handmade for sneaking.
---
it depends on what genre you're looking at. 
---
When you compare FO76 to RPGs - yes there's a severe lack of content
---
Compare FO76 to Open World, Multiplayer, Online Survival games - such as minecraft, and the all the quests and a path of progression is actually a breath of fresh air.
---
Same on Xbox. The lag after switching weapons is unbearable, I barely switch weapons mid combat anymore.
---
Mine loads slow and I have an SSD.
---
So spending money is consider more work than completely special quests and challenges?
---
I was wonder about that.  So if character "A" puts a weapon in an empty crate, logs off. Character "B" immediately logs in to same private session and retrieves the weapon.  That works?  If so, praise Todd!
---
They Nerfed the ability to respawn the NPC's inside the WhiteSprings Exterior Cell, so it's no longer viable to "grind" there.  
---
In Watago they put those Robots on a FormID List that excludes them from spawning as a Legendary
---
Sorry, edited. PC user so I didn't notice those links.
---
ya, the one at the end. I've done this about four times now and he's always right at the end, at the main doors. 3* Legendary Sentinel, like clockwork.
---
That feature is coming soon (TM). But hey, pay for the service now. Lots more features to come. Eventually. BSG promises.
---
No. World of Warcrsft was a full priced game that had expensive DLCs. As of right now the DLCs are free in Fallout 76. Also the game isn't full price if you haven't noticed and hasn't been since 2 weeks after launch. You can be delusional all you want I don't care but that doesn't get around the fact that games cost money to develop.
---
So.
---
The subscription gives you Pay 2 Win features.
---
Yup.  They aren't even pretending anymore.
---
I support it because I want Bethesda to keep making new content and keep supporting the game and the IP‚Äôs future.  I can see how without revenue at some point they can‚Äôt keep burning money on it. 
---
It‚Äôs a live service after all, I don‚Äôt mind if they go full war frame or something as long as they do keep pouring in the love and dedication into it, 
---
The engine is a dinosaur but it‚Äôs their dinosaur and I‚Äôm sure they can really make it‚Äôs ass go places and I‚Äôm game to keep supporting them to keep enjoying this game and keep funding their ability to keep adding to it.  I don‚Äôt care about your grievance with them but I suppose my support of them may support your ability to keep playing it and complaining about it hopefully for years to come. 
---
I just wish they had the hundreds of developers like war frame on it to get much more updates, fixes, etc, and hopefully with more stable revenue they can, but obviously war frame had a unique advantage there on many experienced staff.  
---
Admittedly I‚Äôm taking a leap of faith with giving them money to do the right thing for us just like when I take a leap of faith and buy a plane ticket hoping I‚Äôm going to get to my destination and return home safely, but come on this is not some unknown startup with their first game.  This is Bethesda and I have been enjoying their games for like decades now. I can take that leap of faith with them and easily look past their challenges as their first major game foray live service, shits hard.
---
So far I‚Äôm digging all the new stuff and look forward to more good shit.  
---
Times are changing with live services going mainstream, adapt or get left behind.  Clearly they are taking steps to still be in the developer business and afford to keep making us games by diversifying. 
---
Ultimately if you cannot accept reality, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs still a settlement or two under attack that you can go back to saving.
---
you do know youre gonna loose all the stuff except for the atoms right?
---
I think if anyone can find in the game by any means then that's a minor miracle. I couldn't anymore, so I left. As for 'running a server,' I'd take up with the Bethesda: who have constantly ruined and re-ruined this ruin of a game.
---
I must just try that, because uninstalling and and reinstalling only deleted my photomode pics lol.
---
Ok I play fallout simplify for the fact that it‚Äôs fallout,  most of play fallout for the experience and the lore behind it. If we sticking around for a gameplay type game like COD it‚Äôd have been dead by now.  You‚Äôre opinion is yours but stop trying to attack people who just want to play a game hey like however they want.
---
You gotta leave server and come back
---
OK calm down, I was making a point about the game.
---
Yes, yes it does. I've done the event whilst riding around in a suit of power armor with the devil vault girl mask on instead of a helmet.
---
Could be. But just of the 3 star variety. I wasn‚Äôt aware they just casually roamed I always thought it required a nuke.
---
So you want the ONLY option to be buying them instead?
---
Read a post on Bethesda's forums about a group of people doing on a private server and having better performance. Haven't tried myself but On PC I haven't had a DC yet during the event .. Have had some lag but I fully expected it lol
---
No, you can find them throughout the world, and if you do the monster mash event you can get a ton of candy there as well.
---
Sorry for the delayed response, I get spammed to hell when I put up bug pages.  
---
I did several dozen different variants, but it happened most commonly after putting scrap in the box and force crashing the game while switching servers.
---
Shortly before they acknowledged the bug someone on Xbox recorded one of the ways I figured out, start to finish, proving it beyond a shadow of a doubt.
---
Ok this is an FO76 subreddit so leave then
---
Was helping a low level friend level up by having them tag things and I‚Äôd kill the stuff. Got a big group of high level feral ghouls going and teleported away thanks to my having drank Nukashine. My friend was not so amused at the instant mauling they got.
---
You guys are still playing?
---
Yep , did this last night. First event ended quick, hopped and got into it again.
---
Also something that i noticed, Tents being placed at popular build sites (ex: Whitesprings station). Hasn't happened to me yet but i can't imagine that feeling good when logging in as non-first player and your base cant be place because of a tent.
---
For me my frames just drop to nothing during the event, it‚Äôs aweful
---
Haha.  Once I noticed it, I could never not notice it.  Every time I see it ended with an *s* I twitch a little.
---
So, having more unique and interesting items in the event makes the event pointless? wtf?
---
no it's because the game is trash and you guys are supporting the death of gaming and the ripping off of customers.
---
Lmao
---
Key phrase in the post. You deserve it
---
Oddly, "Fallout 1st" players (and those joining them) seem to be having better performance overall, however it could just be linked to the reduced number of players on each server.
---
Well no shit...
---
Does that count for the weekly?
---
&gt; I just didn't want to be in the tier that didn't have these advantages, especially now that I've seen the difference it makes. 
---
This was the entire point, people. Its always the entire point of this type of thing. Create two different experiences: The normal experience, and the good experience you have to pay for. Its the scummiest shit ever. If you're still defending Bethesda, sit down and have a conversation with yourself.
---
I would agree, but even the private servers are having the same issues. Had a friend purchase it, and while we were playing last night all 3 of us on the server were lagging, doing no damage and even freezing out of the game. It's not amount of people, its crappy game management. I would assume there are specific data resources in each server that should be occasionally "cleaned" but are neglected to the point of server failure.
---
Just sent the friend request üëç
---
It‚Äôs actually pretty cool, like you can approach conversation like that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about your life or story, just tell me what I need to do‚Äù or you can just kill anybody you come across, it‚Äôs great!
---
Thanks for the trophy bro.
---
I'll put it on my shelf as a good reminder of how snowflakes can bitch about anything, even if the game gives them a whole paragraph to read warning them about pvp, gets them to sign "yes" to it, and still complain when they die lmao.  You and all the people like you are why this game is full of care bear deadbeats.
---
it's not worth it and it effects everyone because it effects gaming in a negative manner.
---
They didn't stay angry at me, I have played the event 4 maybe 5 times so far
---
Bethesda's actions speak for themselves. They have repeatedly lied to their fanbase and even gone so far as to false advertise their products(remember the bad controversy?). They barely deserve any benefit of doubt at this point.
---
Why? This train wreck is too good not to watch up close.
---
I knew it! This is why I haven‚Äôt bothered even logging in to participate. I‚Äôve just been playing Outer Worlds. It‚Äôs so disheartening spending tons of time with firing up a game, waiting to load into a server, putting in a bunch of effort just to have tons of lag and then a crash. I hate having my time wasted more than anything.
---
that's the dumbest thing I've heard so far today
---
You know it‚Äôs bad when you choose weapons based on how well the server can handle their fire rate
---
Bethesda's on track record is all the information they need
---
I have also found that most people share during UF. Usually when I see the legendary, I hit the "follow me" emote to let folks know where it is. Even then, there's usually a level 28 that doesn't know what they're doing and they miss out.
---
I agree I wish it was just skins in the atomic shop, but he is so useless people would probably complain about him even if he was a reward from a quest. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúhurting the community‚Äù though and certainly not a ‚Äúbait and switch‚Äù.
---
Thats funny. When i got on my server only had like 10 people and no one was doing the event. So i decided to just turn off the game.
---
you are the problem with gaming today
---
You'll keep forward tent (placed at the last location), stashbox (withdrawal only), armor, icons, emotes, atoms... If you ask for refund, you might even get those things literally for free.
---
Just go hang out in the courtyard and let all the others blow shit up, jump up on something, go afk make a coffee. Pointless trying to compete with all the heavy gunners, they kill everything in a second, I never get to tag anything so gave up, just wait for the reward and go do something else.
---
you need a life
---
no
---
hahahahahahahahaha you paid for it? what a tool. todd howard thanks you for being a dumbass
---
The inventory management in ESO is slot based and not based on weight, which makes it easier to stack all your materials. Their are also slot of ways to store your items in like the bank, guild banks, and 8+ mules. It is easier to store things in general in ESO compared to FO76 with or without the subscription.
---
As a level 50ish I killed a lvl 20ish that stole from my supply crate.  Was going to let him get his stuff but for some reason he was carrying 20+ bulk lead, 15+ bulk steel, just a bunch of stuff I could use at the time.  So I grabbed most of it.  He respawned and started shooting me.  I slowly ran away overencumbered by all the sweet loot and he eventually gave up.
---
You can't wear the fallout first ranger armour either. It's a necesary cost.
---
False
---
You can also pay companies in China to do this sort of thing. They‚Äôll swarm with fake accounts and leave positive/negative reviews (whichever you prefer). It‚Äôs getting to the point where I don‚Äôt believe anything I read online.
---
LOL, just a peen feast of who can shoot everything first with the biggest gun. Boring and annoying, I just go to the courtyard wait for reward and leave.
---
I dunno all I see is you inventing new reasons to bitch and whine. Theres plenty already to bitch and whine about without blaming stupid people's wrong assumptions on Bethesda. Remember what your kindergarten teacher said about ASSuming?
---
Thanks for this strategy. I was just blast, blast away, and I would get swamped by the bots. Good thinking.
---
I was able to turn off auto-renewal on Xbox's website.
---
Try ‚ÄúBraxtons Quality Medical Supplies‚Äù - they produced skeletons
---
I don‚Äôt know what half of this stuff means, but a HUGE THANK YOU for watching out for all of us!!
---
White springs is still the best place to Nuke after all this time? Smh
---
No problem sorry for delay.
---
It has already been said that you keep the scrap box, you can pull stuff out of the scrap box but you can't put anything in it.
---
I switched my main from a bloodied build to junkie's about a month ago just because of the headaches of the low HP.   It's nice having full HP in vanguard sentinel armor and not having to worry so much about one shots or mobs.  Also, having the high capacity backpack and all the perks for increased strength will help make up for the loss in stats when switching from unyielding to vanguard.
---
The base world data is all stored locally, so its not like it has to look to the internet on what to load. If it is just camps and workshops, etc, then yeah, network may be the issue, but general loading, most likely its the hard drive.
---
Smear feces?
---
Malachi 2:3 anyone?!
---
Don't get me wrong, I hate the pay to expidite and fallout 1st as much as the next guy, but only the last, buggy, unfinished, and old engine has anything to do with the topic.
---
All the other ones are pr issues. If they would have advertised the game so that we should expect these things, instead of saying that they will never come, then people reactions would be completely different.
---
I think the practice is scummy, but I never would have bought the game and wouldn't be subscribed to this sub if those things were advertised instead of denied.
---
Those are pr issues.
---
It really is simple and not as complex as you make it out to be.
---
Samezies.
---
If I still have mine you are welcome to them. I will check this evening.
---
Sure, get a new one. Otherwise, no, be more careful next time.
---
If you've marsupial stay on on roofs and avoid hitting robots. Follow the crowd or wait in the courtyard, just hide and wait for reward.
---
You might be onto something there, like how their "limited time offers" in the shop come back every few months
---
Lol I've posted it before - [https://imgur.com/gallery/YNbfsyH](https://imgur.com/gallery/YNbfsyH)
---
Bravo!!!
---
yeah then you are part of the problem and what's worse is you are proud to be a part of the down fall of gaming. pathetic
---
Thank you. Bruh I didnt even realize how fast I was moving.
---
M'lady
---
Twice as much competition for places now
---
can you explain what a bloodied build is? I'm level 52ish but I don't have a shower
---
Yeah and?
---
I don‚Äôt think there is anything in my post that contradicts the points you made. The reason the title is what it is, is because if they knew these problems were going to exist they shouldn‚Äôt have promoted, marketed, and sold the game like they weren‚Äôt. Had they not done that the backlash would be far less severe if people had known what they were buying and getting themselves into. 
---
That being said, I still think that personally for me there is a lot to enjoy about this game but everyone is different and different things irk people in different ways. I fully understand and respect you being done with it and I‚Äôm not arguing that you shouldn‚Äôt be. I‚Äôm saying that if Bethesda has been more open and honest (if they even knew) what this game was going to be and how long it was going to take for it to be in a smooth state with content a lot of people wouldn‚Äôt be as angry and not felt like they were sold the game through false advertising. They are basically shoving an MMO type system, monetization practices, bugs, and timeline onto their single player engine.
---
I've never managed to tag the boss once, so gave up trying, just wait for the rewards. Too many try hard sweaty players comparing the size or their junk with heavy god role guns. LOL!
---
ü§´
---
Exactly.  I'm trying it with crap stuff first to make sure this works.  But, if this does work, no more butt clenching hoping I can load into the same world again stress.  LOL
---
How they approach lag has to be a bit different than a lot of other games as well. A lot of other games can lag/stutter/freeze and "catch up" and you can keep playing. (Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I understood) Fo76 has a system put in place to auto-disconnect to prevent (as best as possible) dupers from having two different inventories at the same time and rubber banding to the original because of the stutter/lag. IE player forces game to lag, offloads equipment, server resets to original position with original gear while maintaining new gear. So while it might not be the best or most efficient system in place, at least it sort of deals with the malicious duping. Mine/cleaver duping deals with a whole other bag of problems. Any exploit meant to bypass checks in places causes game issues though, sometimes intentionally causing lag.

Lots of MMO‚Äôs, a lot of them. Even some online FPS do this.
---
Included in one of my bug roundups, thanks for this!
---
The Collectron isn't a FO1st feature, but this is a good point. Next time I take a workshop I'll build one and leave it unlocked. I got it as soon as I earned 800 atoms from challenges. I've been fairly happy with it. It's not Pay to Win but it augments my scavenging, usually by giving me a couple bits of harder to get scrap like black titanium or screws.
---
Im amazed you took the time to get on a reddit for this "garbage", to comment. What a time waster for you... Kinda sad actually. You have nothing better to do with yourself but get on a reddit for a game you hate, to comment. Thats really sad... Well... troll... heres a cookie. Enjoy it. Its chocolate chip. Eat it up, who knows where you'll get the next one.
---
That‚Äôs part of the point I was making in my post.
---
That‚Äôs a start, but you can look at other behaviors that will tell you whether someone is a shill.
---
I like to experiment with analyzing the posting history of revealed sock puppets to see what makes them fraudulent, like focusing on one sub or taking a stance on a subject but never really going into detail why they like what they like.
---
I just got two in a row! Had never seen one before.
---
You could just role play as leaving the vault after having a stroke
---
You should be able to blow up a safe if you have demoliton expert instead of only being able to lock pick it
---
great~! thanks!
---
Whats the best approach for this? i wanted to try it in private but didnt think i could do it
---
I hope your right but I seriously can't see it, maybe some items in the future but deffo not the scrap box. Of anything that is an incentive by Bethesda to keep it's subbed players those are it and it'll keep it behind it's paywall
---
Much more tame for most of the other stories...
---
But whenever I find a player wearing the space suit, I bombard them with gestures and get aggressively close to them. Following them, never attacking, but also never leaving them alone. 
---
That is until they fast travel away. If they stick around I like to give them things for indulging me.
---
Silence
---
Something about silence makes me sick
---
'Cause silence can be violent
---
Sorta like a slit wrist
---
Not really.
---
You run into the issue that even when people were paying for items in the past - they always had a chance of not working. Example - that damn playground animal. It took them time to fix that.
---
So not only would it be nice if items were ever reasonably priced, it'd be nice if they actually worked half the time.
---
If people put in the work and help during the event, then yeah, share, but if you turn up at the last second and do fuck all for free rewards, then no way I'm sharing.
---
I posted about this too but some bs about my title had it removed. Been on 2 hours. 3 crashes already. Last time was seconds before the end of the event so I was ripped off of the rewards. Of course. I dont know if this is to push people to want to purchase fallout 1st or because of the event but its bullshit either way. This game could be so amazing and draw in millions of more players if it werent for stupid glitches, flaws and unstable servers. I really like this game. Fallout 4 turned me into a gamer. Then I liked Skyrim and now this. That's all I play. But more could be done with it.

You can get a decent amount of Violet Flux when ever someone nukes the Queen. Getting the other materials needed to craft flux is a bit more difficult there though.
---
Now thats just griefing plain and simple
---
Pretending Fallout 76 is perfect and all problems are because of other reasons is the most delusional thing I've ever heard.
---
üëçüèª
---
Sold a pacifist player 12k worth of flux, got the caps, forced pvp by attacking his teammate, killed both, took all the flux back and put the flux up for sale again. That was a good day.
---
And people dying and respawning constantly
---
This was a really interesting read, and as someone who went into this with a single player mindset it really helped me understand why I was getting so angry about they new things they were implementing. Having played WoW myself for years, if they had said from the start it was a fallout mmo, nothing now would be surprising to me. Thanks for taking the time to explain it in detail like that.
---
As a 1st sub, I can tell you that inventory management is no less a thing. The box helps a bit, the 2nd fast travel point helps a good deal more, but you'll still have to be on top of those mats - especially if you're an OCD hoarder like me, who nevertheless still tries to offload excess, non-essential mats here &amp; there. xD
---
If you don't like this sub go to another one.
---
That's an option in The Outer Worlds
---
People have had the most luck with Battle Bot &amp; Breach &amp; Clear, both Ash Heap events.  A couple people have said it came from a body at the end of the glassed caverns.  
---
I have yet to see someone say they got it from a crate but I have seen screenshots on multiple times it coming from Battle Bot, at least three times now.
---
I usually go without meaning three.
---
I could see this format working in a few places.
---
Tye definition of a cult.
---
Gotta get them private servers brudda
---
So if it's "scummy" and "gross", why on earth did you pay them for it?!  The last couple paragraphs of your post are insanely hypocritical.  Bethesda WILL be listening.  And what you are telling them is that their greed is okay, because people will still spend money anyways.
---
I take it you didn‚Äôt play Guild War 2? FO76 was quite similar in launching at a $60 price but GW2 worked and didn‚Äôt heavily monetize, despite ongoing server costs. That approach is probably what many expected given Bethesda‚Äôs assurances.
---
Nice I tried to solo it myself on the first try but couldn‚Äôt get past stage 2. Granted it was my first attempt. 
---
So far doing it on public servers wasn‚Äôt bad.
---
I wish it was in ac odyssey lmao, the game is wonderful but damn
---
What do they even do
---
I prefer Morgantown for that. All the low level scorched also drop mass/fluid and they are not a threat.
---
Sounds like a winning long term strategy
---
Better binoculars
---
No problem! Glad it helps.
---
Lmao dude stop acting like it's the end of the world
---
I certainly agree that a big chunk of the issues with this game have to do with community expectations and Bethesda's communication (e.g. the subscription model probably wouldn't have gone down so badly if it didn't appear to directly contradict promises they made before the game's launch).
---
As one of those single player gamers (76 was actually my first - and at present only - multiplayer experience), this part of your post drew my attention:
---
&gt; To your play everyday online/MMO gamer all of the above is normal, expected, and standard practice for a new title. For your gamer that only or mostly plays single player titles the above is absolutely unforgivable and completely ridiculous. 
---
My question is this: why the heck do MMO gamers put up with this crap?
---
You got the subscription? What a sucker
---
I would suggest getting you addictions closer to the level of your weapon , I did the same exact thing you are with my mule . The reason being as I was leveling I felt that any stat decrease wasn‚Äôt nesecary with only a hand full of perks . I myself waiters to lvl 40
---
I accidentally stole from them.
---
Hanlon‚Äôs Razor then?
---
Well, OP, sorry - but people like you, who are still paying Bethesda (just imaging, you now spent 160$ on this game!) are the reason, why they are doing all these crap
---
Ive been playing PC, Westcoast Canada since Beta. I met one fella who I‚Äôm still not sure if he was griefing or just goofy. Everyone that actually plays the game is pretty cool, the only toxicity I‚Äôve seen is on Reddit or fb.
---
The vampire costume is coming up for 800c under the 1st section. Is it also in the standard atomic shop?
---
I always use lower dmg weapon in events :) feel free to add GhoulMutagen. No mic tho, so just chill on the same server.
---
Get a Tesla rifle for tagging, tho in this particular event its super weak due to robots resi.
---
"the ‚Äúwin‚Äù is determined individually by each player."     
---
Then you can argue there's no such thing as pay to win, in any game ever. When you're purchasing the innevitable +"25% damage against scorched for 24 hours" buff from the atomic shop in 6 months, tell me again that there's no pay to win in PvE games.      
---
You keep talking about transfering items to a mule, as if finding the time to coincide schedules with a stranger, and paying to transfer items, that in order to get back I would have to do again, possibly multiple times in a play session if I end up having to make enough ammo to say, buy a gun for 100k 5.56 rounds.
---
^ I found Bethesda PR
---
Lol that made me laugh so hard.
---
What if these features are coming to Fallout 1st as a limited beta test, and then made available to everyone one they can confirm stability. What if Fallout 1st is just a way to get features first while helping support development, like Plex has PlexPass?
---
Makes no difference, I can do all that is required but have never tagged to boss, to much heavy weapons fire, boss gone in a second, too much lag also.
---
They most certainly do. Please don‚Äôt take my statement as a defense of the practice or of the game because it‚Äôs not. My post to the contrary is very critical of the company and it‚Äôs parent along with all the others who do this. 
---
What I‚Äôm saying is that they are engaging in the practice of doing this, while they marketed the game as if it was going to be different. They marketed it more like a single player game but have all the problems, monetization practices, and timelines of an MMO. If they would have been up front and honest about that the backlash wouldn‚Äôt have been nearly as severe.
---
That must be it! Thank you. Ok, then I'll just suck it up and use my stims.
---
Nevermind, I was going to ask what you what you thought of the crashing, glitching, onslaught of bugs, delays of content, and a subscription service that deleted scrap and lied about private servers, but considering everything you post here is dismissing any complaint as whining and crying at poor Bethesda, you definitely have nothing worth talking about.
---
I requested a full refund from Beth due to manufacturers defect. The game has way too many bugs to excuse.
---
Never had that happen to me enough to bother me. Feels like you're just trying to justify the absence of NPC's.
---
All I can figure is either they don't know what they're doing and think that the loot is shared among all users so they're just trying to get theirs, or they do know what they're doing and they're just assholes. I could believe either, and try not to assume the worst. It's not like the game mechanics are documented in-game somehow (hell, most of them aren't documented outside the game either).
---
Or a third, I guess, is they're still new to being able to one- or two-shot everything and think it's an impressive display.
---
causing more lag...... we don‚Äôt really need that rn
---
That‚Äôs not what I said in any way whatsoever and in fact said the opposite.
---
You‚Äôre confusing it with the riot gear outfit, the NCR ranger is in the base game.
---
That would be a good alternative, although i would put 0 doubt that private servers will always be paid (since theyll be needed when mod support comes and mods will kill the atom shop)
---
It's not the regenerating part, by then it have the stars. I have witnessed this myself elsewhere, it goes from one to three stars. I have also killed a no-star legendary only to discover it was a three star when I loot it. It's something strange going on with them anyway....
---
I get the hesitation but hear me out. The ‚Äúfirst‚Äù has to reference something. I think of get and try it first. They then throw in a bunch of atoms and exclusive outfits (which I believe will stay exclusive) as well. Those atoms alone cost more than the sub on their own. You also get your own server, which also doubles as a test server for Bethesda. Case in point: scrap box was eating scrap. 1st members got to play guinea pig. Now it‚Äôs fixed and can go out to everybody eventually.
---
Look at the scrap bot and fridge. They probably would‚Äôve released that stuff on 1st ‚Äúfirst‚Äù if it existed back then. They had a whole inside the vault about changing the way they do atomic shop stuff. Now they can deploy these things to 1st members, see the demand, and choose to push them out.
---
But it all goes back to the name. What are sub members ‚Äúfirst‚Äù at?  Well that‚Äôs what I can think of. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but don‚Äôt be surprised if everybody gets to buy the scrap box and second tent in the shop for 700 atoms each at some point.
---
Ok, glad I'm not the only one. I used to go a whole SBQ fight with not a scratch and after the patch I was downed 4 times as a non-bloodied.
---
Nah just saying I appreciate it lol, idc how other people feel about it, want NPCs or don't, no difference to me :)
---
Dude!
---
It is a bit of a hp sponge, should be ample time to get a shot in.
---
And it being a 1\*, it's not a great loss to be honest.
---
Its 30k now
---
30k
---
And you down voted into oblivion, we can guess by whom.
---
I have two pairs, can give u one :) PC ign GhoulMutagen
---
............  
---
Neither of us can see the backend, of course it's likely that having 8 people vs 16 in the event is significantly effecting the performance, but no need for hostility.
---
Its 30k but 25k for transactions I think.
---
Doing what I can, thanks for the comment!
---
Xbox :(
---
Indeed. I just wanted to throw it in there. Completely agreed.
---
Simply put, they shouldn't have promised what they could not deliver.
---
Aw
---
More often than not, there's about 30 various robots kicking the shit out of the player squad. Not really the best time to make sure everyone gets a tag in. Also, I've only ever seen the boss as a 1*, so it's not like these are game-changing drops.
---
It's (poorly) designed this way, like Bethesda couldn't figure out an alternate way to divvy up event rewards. üôÑ
---
Aw...gl then
---
This event is seriously pushing me to getting the sub, just didn't want another subscription to pay for.
---
Holy vagueness Batman!! 
---
How about you elaborate?
---
Did you look at the Featured tab? Right now you get an exclusive outfit and emotes.
---
Because if you don‚Äôt you will get melted by assaultrons. Happened to me last night. It wasn‚Äôt fun.
---
Exactly, and thank you for taking the time to read my post. If you look at this game for what it actually is as opposed to what they tried to market it as, it‚Äôs not surprising at all.
---
With the way this has been going, I wouldn't be surprised if the "discount" was the free atom money every month.
---
Run it as fast as possible, dont waste time attacking the robots cause they'd aggro on you eventually but you can push through the first two parts without ever shooting the robots and then the last push as quickly towards the legendary spawning then kill him as fast possible
---
Will be interesting if I‚Äôm right and then everybody paying some atoms for those 1st ‚Äúevils‚Äù when they show up on the shop in a month or so.
---
Your character needs the exercise üòâ
---
Medical supply in the mire, east side of the map. Braxson's Quality Medical Supplies. Just south of Thunder Mountain
---
Neat!
---
Oh damn, that's one of the best cameras out there right now. Good job!
---
Definitely worth $60 + $12.99 a month eh?
---
I usually look at 4's also...because most companies won't even accept a 4 as an acceptable form of positive feedback: with corporate it's a max score or no score.
---
That also means most of my reviews I make are 4's...it's only a 5 if there's absolutely nothing wrong and I've had nothing but positive past experiences with it...so very few make the mark, if any.
---
I gave 50 stimpacks to a level 2, then watched as he crawled.
---
I can‚Äôt remember exactly but I think it‚Äôs between 29,999 and 30,001. I would have to log on for the exact number.
---
They will.
---
I've already uninstalled and stopped posting negatively in here. And as you can see, the tide has already turned with the positive/helpful/themed posts returning to the top. I'm staying subbed for now, to see what happens over the next little while, but will probably unsub eventually
---
It has merit, maybe 1st members get the new shit first to play test it and it gets released later to everyone.
---
Well, first and foremost hello there fellow vault dwellers! I know I may get downvoted to hell for responding here, BUT i'm going to answer OP's question and anyone who wants to read or ask about other things i've done is welcome to.  
---
It started when me and the boys we're out bounty baiting as usual, this involves one person having a bounty in adventure mode and the rest on the team being hidden nearby. A kid in power armor spawned in and took a shot at our team member that had the bounty, we killed him close to instantly before he re-spawned and we killed him a few more times. Each time he rag-dolled we rushed the body to break his armor (you can still damage/break power armor even if they are dead) and by this point all his armor was broken. Now you may think this is the end of it but it continues.   
---
After breaking his armor I spoke up and told him he needed better gear, that his power armor needed to be strangler and his weapons needed to be legacy to keep up with the meta of a heavy guns build, he was down for talking trade so we hopped back to my camp just me and him. I spun a tale or two about rare items, glitches, meta, and did my whole presentation/skit, it's seriously just the same lines I repeat over and over to different people because they work. He was sold on it and he was convinced he needed what I have, I told him it wasn't cheap and that he may have too give up all he has right now, he told me he knew but that he would be getting something much much better so it was worth it. He handed over a legacy (TSE laser rifle) an ideal weapon (VE .50 cal) and all other legendary weapons of any value that had. I'm sure you see where I'm going with this, I robbed him, it's what I do. He attacked us and I lifted the weapons he used against us, nothing changed from when he first attacked us to when we talked trade later, we were still enemies.  
---
After robbing him of his weapons he was attacking us with just 10 minutes ago he realized what was happening pretty quick. He apologized for what felt like almost 5 minutes straight, almost nothing but "dude im sorry" "im sorry" "SORRY" "I shouldnt of attacked you im sorry" "please man" "please im sorry" "can you just give me my stuff back im sorry". I told him he needed to make a clearer argument for why i should give him those things, that i forgave him but he needed to make an actual point for why he should get those things back and not just beg. Kid got his mom on the mic, she said It was awful what I was doing in a kids game, I told her it's not a kids game and that it's rated M, that her kid couldn't even legally buy it if what she's saying about her kid being a minor is true and that him even playing it was against ToS. I haven't disregarded the kid yet, he sounded maybe 15, just told em I'd give him all that stuff if he could make a good argument for why he should get it back and that's what i'm still waiting for from em. That's probably the worst one I dealt with.
---
TL;DR: The worst thing I've ever done was rob a kid of his whole inventory. everything of remote value.   
---
I'm grushnak  this is what I do. I don't do it for the items I do it for the fun of it, I've collected every outfit, I'm loaded with legacies, dev room stuff, ideal weapons and armor sets (there's nothing that i legitimately need and almost nothing that don't already have). The kid I mentioned above was done the other night, he was number 257 of the people I've done that to (I keep a list). If you have any doubt's or concerns about the legitimacy of my claims feel free to look me up on M 76 or other trade sub reddits. So long as you are mindful and not a pushover when it comes to trading there's nothing i can do to effect you. If you have any questions about who else i've done this to, other experiences, or feel like stopping by ingame feel free to (PC).   
---

I'm Grushnak, and I'm the closest thing to a raider that anyone ingame is ever going to get.
---
Those things are complete bastards
---
&gt;And it being a 1\*, it's not a great loss to be honest.
---
Well there is that I suppose, just scrip junk then anyway. I'll just hang out for the reward.
---
Welcome back to the wasteland my friend, it's obviously been a while. Come on in, the water is fine.
---
Go troll elsewhere I doubt you even play 76.
---
Exactly lol
---
I did but guild wars 2 also had a much longer development cycle, was honest about what it was, didn‚Äôt try to market itself as anything that it wasn‚Äôt and tbh wasn‚Äôt completely problem free at launch. It also didn‚Äôt have a world as ambitious as a lot of other online games/MMO‚Äôs.
---
I think some of the Vault 94 challenges are a good start - but they require running possibly the most performance intensive (both hardware / player)  mission an insane amount of times and on their own seem lacking without ones for every other mission.
---
I think at this point the captains of the F76 ship need to take a good look at the Destiny 2 turnaround story and rip a few pages out of that book. 
---
**The problem is essentially the same - how do you keep people interested once they've 'gone around the block' a few times to buy yourself time to pave the next few km of roadmap?**
---
First idea is that We need 'legendary quest rewards' by that I mean we need rewards for specifically re-running the same missions over and over again. We are doing it anyways and it would go along way.
---
These should come in two forms - a legendary re-roll and some cosmetic rewards EG:
---
* **THE BURROWS / WASTE MANAGEMENT**
---
   * Run the 'Legendary' version of the quest - get a chance to get a 3\* Gutter
---
   * Run the any version of the quest 30 times?
---
      * Gun or helmet should slight legendary aura / crown when you do it for the 31st time. 
---
      * *Something to show this mission is your jam and you've ran it so many times.*
---
* **IMPOSTER SHEEPSQUATCH / ENCRYPTID**
---
   * Run the 'Legendary' version of the quest - get a chance to get a 3\* Fixer
---
      * Emissive cosmetic for quest
---
      * Get the blackboard plans for your CAMP for the Imposter
---
      * Get Imposter Prototype chassis decoration for your CAMP
---
* **SBQ / Scorched Earth**
---
   * Once the PA rewards are done
---
      * Should have Bat / SBQ Armor plans that you can grind up for. 
---
      * Something that requires like 50 SB wings to craft for a full set. 
---
      * Give meaning to collecting junk again
---
The second thing is that there should be a way to upgrade the Quest legendaries you get. 
---
People don't care about them because they are woefully underpowered compared to the gambling addiction generator that is the purveyor.  
---
Thinking of things like All Rise, Last Stand etc. The Storm could be the best SMG in the game if it had any additional perks.
---
&gt;GhoulMutagen
---
No mic either, thanks for the offer, not on for a while, my ign is as my reddit :)
---
I just want them to put the Red Rocket jumpsuit back in there. Alone. I‚Äôm not paying 1400 Atoms or more for it lol. I understand it was probably just a 4th of July thing but still, they keep bringing all this other crap back out of the vault lol.
---
Buy to Play can work if they aren't completely stupid about it. It worked for Monster Hunter World, THE example that Live Service games can work if the company behind it actually gives a fuck. Sadly Bethesda does not give a fuck.
---
Half the crowd I was in was over 200 and other half was 50-75. We tried to let them get hits in. Worst idea ever. Within 3 seconds of respawning again you were melted by 5 assaultrons instantly.
---
It‚Äôs not even 8v16 the far more likely 1-4v16 of course performance will be better
---
Fair enough then.
---
the water is radiated, nice try
---
Which if that is the case, cue the complaints from the 1st members for not being exclusive and extra hate from the non-1st who now get those things. Even though 1st members got the bugs out for others.  Either way the civil war will continue lol.
---
Honey Beast cave in the north Mire?
---
We do have a crappy internet connection and my computer is older but I‚Äôve never had an issue with any of the previous events. I was in lag city last night when I tried this one. Every explosion froze my screen.
---
It was kinda payback, but a while ago this guy started griefing my little base of wood, and so I had some high level friends repeatedly hunt him down, he fought back every time so he constantly got wrecked, but after a while I felt bad, because this dispute ended in one of my friends nuking his base
---
It will probably happen once per month, just to entice people to renew their subscription for another month.
---
Reminds me of the "blackface" bug in fallout 4.
---
Just the boss, is that not always last and in the porch area?
---
I‚Äôm a 1st member, at least for a month for the private servers for people I have on my friends list, I would welcome the scrapbox being available to non subs after the first month, being play testers in a sort of way is interesting
---
&gt; The fact that anyone out there is still defending this flaming mound of garbage is astounding. At this point, anyone still saying Fallout 76 is great and Zenimax loves us is either on the damage control team payroll or is a raving lunatic. 
---
A perfect example of an ad hominem fallacy. Well done sir.
---
I find the legendary at the end always appears by the entrance to the main building so I hang there at the end
---
I would say that's only true about the people that support the game and have hundreds of hours logged on a scam
---
Unfortunately they cannot drop from crates. There were some unsubstantiated reports of this but no evidence. The datamine confirms events only battle bot, lode bearing and breach n clear. Sometimes people mis-remember plasma grenade as pulse mine.
---
If you really want to farm for plasma grenade plans - the easiest way is to farm battle bot by jumping servers since it is location triggered and quick to complete.
---
I never said i was against pvp lol i just said you was a jerk.
---
I've been killed in my camp and had to wait 30 seconds just to respawn like 6ft to the left of where I died.
---
I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel with my CPU specs, but I did it twice last night. It was a laggy mess, but no crashes or bugs.
---
https://youtu.be/rS00xWnqwvI 
---
This is that outfit
---
No, I‚Äôm good
---
It has everything to do with first, this isn‚Äôt server hopping multiple servers, this is the event resetting from joining and leaving the server
---
It's not marked on the map, but there's a cave in the north part of the Mire where honey beasts spawn. It also has a large tree growing out of the top. In the back of the cave is a pool of water with like dead Brahmin and things you can loot for leather every so often. A pretty cool place for a camp, if you ask me. I built like a pub into the cave where I sell booze and steaks, and above I made a tree house-like kids restaurant where I sell like pop and juice and sweet treats. I also made a top floor where I live that's full tree house
---
&gt; inventory management is no less a thing
---
this is patently false.
---
sorry, but unless you are one of the tiny percent of players who only gather junk when you absolutely need it, and dont store any at all regularly (honestly that percent might be zero), then removing all junk from your stash is definitely going to have an effect, probably a BIG one.  for most players junk represents hundreds of pounds of their stash.  that space being free'd is more room for guns / armor / meds / what ever.
---
Yes, certainly there will still be inventory management, but the scrap box represents a HUGE change to it. and like i said, there are other consequences that can/will show up down the line.
---
and thats not to mention the there's a 100% chance that Bethesda is going to slowly adjust weights for junk, to try and push people towards 1st.
---
Easiest way I found to do that is not following the eyebot to the courtyard.  (you can outrun the eyebot)
---
Head over to the courtyard when the cottage mayhem bars are about 90-95%. Find a spot where you have clear line of sight to the main door.  
---
Once the courtyard segment starts, take out what you can hit from your vantage point, and you should also be able to get a few hits the legendary when it appears.
---
Between cars blowing and legacy lasers this event is a lag fest
---
What other game makes you pay full price then a subscription fee.
---
There‚Äôs a competitive ‚Äúwin‚Äù component in PVP settings.  That‚Äôs what Pay-to-Win generally refers to.  Or in if FO76 had unlimited building opportunities where you could actually put all the resources to use.
---
Presently, after a players finishes his build around level 80 the content is not hard.  There‚Äôs no difficulty in 1-2-shotting most mobs (except SBQ and SB and more lurk Queen).  What competitive advantage would a gun for 100k provide?
---
I've heard the max is 60 intelligence (from people who craft power armor)
---
Yeah, sounds annoying. Good thing Bethesda got rid of them and replaced them all with robots and computer screens instead.
---
I think Bloodied, or at least certain aspects of it like the damage avoidance through Serendipity/Dodgy/Lone Wanderer and Unyielding armor, allows you to get away with somewhat impractical setups.  And I think that's ultimately a good thing.  It would be boring if every high-tier player rolled around in Power Armor or BoS Combat Armor because it was objectively "the best."  My alt rolls in nothing but Wood Armor and it's pretty fun.
---
I really hope the hot to crazy ratio works out in this case. Otherwise that poor bastard gonna be castrated for looking at a cow cross eyed while its licking an electric fence before the first wedding anniversary.
---
Yeah, and now it‚Äôs basically that way with the Halloween event except you need a private server
---
Yup and any betting person would put money on the likelihood there won't actually be any discounts and if there are it'll be so minimal. The people who bought the subscription are utter fools. 
---
And inb4 "bUt iT's mY mOnEy" (even thought it's probably actually your parents' money), people are rewarding the worst practices in the gaming industry and contributing to the death of a franchise. Every warning has been ignored and the worse it gets, the more drones just say "it is what it is."
---
coming soon, $9.99/mo lag reduction pack, comes with some atoms and an outfit.
---
pathetic. get a life and stop supporting a scam
---
*Fasnickelback
---
Same here. Not so much with friends but enjoy going private when needed to do whatever without interruption. I can‚Äôt see them building these features into the game and blocking them off completely. Sure people will still pay for them in some way. And when they add it up they could‚Äôve just got the sub. We‚Äôll always have the server and atoms and exclusive outfits. I see us testing out camp budget increases next which they made slight mention of.
---
Really? Games fills really fast on Xbox
---
Not the deputy?
---
Not sure it‚Äôs that way - will need to try
---
I was doing campfire last week with a group and one guy unloads on the boss in full auto. 
---
His buddy says...."I don't think everyone tagged it."
---
Guy shoots an explosive round at my feet and says..."I was worried about this guy."
---
Well I wasn't there for the legendary anyhow but this guy decided to be the asshole at the even because he was worried that I was going to be the asshole?????
---
Well done dumbass......well done.
---
actually, Battle Bot, Lode Bearing, Breach and Clear, Dirt Mover (a 30 minute repeatable from taking the rockhound and starting it up) and a very low chance (so probably like 0.01%) from Hordes, Hunter/Hunted and some other things.
---
The issue here is a lot of people confuse the plasma grenade and pulse -  and there have been no screenshots to prove plasma grenade recipes found in boxes (plasma grenades themselves, yes, but not the plan) 
---
I've been living in Ashheap 6 months right where Battlebot spawns and had no luck, several hundred in.
---
I always had trouble getting into the game because of looking over my shoulder for other players, nice to go about my business without that worry and events are easier to play since no one else is doing them.
---
Honestly yeah, except for rose the robots barely talk, and I can get the needed info reading a terminal in half or less the time of one of the conversations in ac odyssey
---
If you don‚Äôt kill all the assaultrons no.
---
To be fair it‚Äôs probably a bug, but it‚Äôs still unacceptable, normal people can do the event about 160 something times, however first members can triple that at least
---
Still trolling I see
---
Go ahead and test it, like I said I haven‚Äôt tried it since I‚Äôm not a first member, however my friends who are say it works like that
---
Mutters in Fireproof, "What was that"
---
What tipe are the rewards ? Are they like skins or Just XP?
---
&gt;If anything, Fallout 76 has more DNA in common with the likes of RUST and whatever that Conan game was called. Does it even compete on their level?
---
If you compare building then nope, not even close. I had about 200 hours of fun on private server with just a single friend, and some more on official ones. In FO76 we spent like 30 hours at most and left because of poor coop experience. The first striking difference is that we can work together on our base in CE and store whatever we gathered, in FO76 not so much. And going onto official (or other) servers? It's beyond amazing to see what people built there. Massive structures here and there. 
---
But exploration and quests in FO76 is way above CE.
---
Exactly!  Case in point. Was doing public all day yesterday due to the event. Was trying to build stuff in my camp that I earned. People show up to buy stuff and ignore the super mutants they spawned in. Thanks you the best!
---
Not justifying it, but it's common practise on the net, especially for site memberships. I'm in the UK and it's not unusual for sterling prices to be the same as the dollar price, as is the case with FO1st. $100usd is about ¬£76 but we're being charged ¬£100. You're right that the US price is before tax, but that varies from state to state, some have zero sales tax, some have quite a lot. For digital sales it gets even more complicated I believe (something about a company having to have some sort of physical presence in a state to be able to charge tax on a purchase made in that state). I'm sure someone more versed in that stuff can elucidate. Plus of course exchange rates fluctuate; presumably they have a look at an average over a period of time before deciding their prices, rather than that specific day's rate (ours for instance has been all over the place since the Brexit process kicked off).   
---
Basically they can either go to the time and effort of setting their store to adjust prices to take into account the day to day fluctuations of exchange rates or they can charge whatever they think they can get, which is obviously what Bethesda have done.
---
UPDATE:  Never found it until I created a new character and played till I could deploy a camp.  Then I could see the fog machine on the new and old characters.  Someone mentioned a reset but I never found out what they meant or any mention of reset in any menu.
---
WHERE: Found it under Appliances just under a radio or clock at the 4th or 5th item down.   (After starting and playing a new character.)
---
You realise this kind of stuff should be in the base game and not in a dlc one year later right ? And stop saying $0,27 cents a day, you can only pay 12$ a month or 99$ a month, which show it as it is, a robbery.
---
My characters name was JimmyHoffa. You killed him!
---
I've never come across this place.  It sounds pretty interesting.  If you had to judge where it was on the map, what's like the nearest thing to it and where do I head from there?
---
I've only explored the northern Mire (i.e. NE of Freddy Fear's) maybe once or twice.  I know you can make it all the way to the corner of the compass on the map, and there's quite a lake system up there.
---
For a second you understood the point I was making, and then you keep repeating the same irrelevant nonsense again.
---
Like I said, it's not about the value of the item because that value is subjective. It's about how you can retrieve it. If paying makes it easier to retrieve it, it is by definition "P2W".
---
so my proof will be first then
---
It's amazing really, I half expect to read "I didn't hold the door for someone".
---
Very well put together. I appreciate this.
---
I went ahead and downvoted just for the 'probably actually your parent's money' because that's just such a shitty thing to do.  You know who has a lot of disposable income to spend?  Adults. Most people playing this are probably adults with decent paying jobs.  Don't be a douche.
---
That said, I hate the subscription service, but if I wanted to reward them for their continued degradation of service I wouldn't have a problem with the cost because you get Atoms worth the cost anyway, so you're effectively paying nothing as you keep getting Atom shop content free at the 1650 or whatever rate.
---
That‚Äôs a good question, firstly It‚Äôs just the way it‚Äôs always been. Secondly from a developer standpoint live games are very different and far more problematic than single player games are, thirdly an online game is usually far riskier of an investment, it‚Äôs going to take a constant team/studio you have to fund and pay for, never ending content creation, monitoring, updating etc. it‚Äôs a long term investment so there is a bigger push to release and self-fund through monetization as you fix things and go from an investor standpoint. 
---
A single player game you make a final and finished packaged product that you release for pure profit returns into your pocket and once it‚Äôs out it‚Äôs done with the exception of a patch or two and some DLC made the same way. With an MMO you are releasing a living organism that has to be able to survive on its own and make enough revenue to support itself. Most of the money the game makes has to go right back into it to pay for all the studio, staff, updates, fixes, future content involved. It‚Äôs like being in a state of never ending development.
---
Hemlock hole maintenance and the converted muninations factory.
---
Correct!  We just snapped.  Usually if someone pisses us off we launch a nuke at their base so they switch servers.  I‚Äôm sure the Overseer would be horrified.
---
You realise that's *literally what the atomic shop was for right.* There is no entitlement.
---
You had it coming for buying fallout 1st, you practically threw money away to a company that are now total shit suckers, I hunt 1st players because they literally are making the game worse with each addition they make to the game cause of their greedy practices.
---
The only issue is you cant build until the enemies have been dealt with.
---
no thats not the problem. you are helping ruin gaming
---
Thanks for the thanks ;)
---
you need help then
---
How is OW? I've seen reviews which love it, and some which say it looks great but the playthrough is meh.
---
Naw
---
I mean, you are aware its their camp right and they choose where everything goes that is convenient for them, you are choosing to visit that camp
---
the only way that i have found to not get crashed to desktop (XB1 tho), is to just hide by where the sentry spawns and stare at the ground until its time two fork a little bit and tag the sentry.
---
I fell like that is not how the event is meant to be played.
---
Honestly kinda disappointed in this batch of rewards. The only thing I find cool is the pirate outfit; I was hoping for more stuff than just... pumpkins and a couple non-spooky costumes.
---
I‚Äôm down. Krawlmck86
---
I would say, in comparison to other Bethesda games, yes.
---
I mean, the dialog system in Fallout 4 was so limiting, the NPCs so stilted, and the philosphical arguments so basic that they might as well be robots.
---
LMAO Not how I experience it. Plenty of enemies to kill for everyone but now I mostly try to blow up all the cars.
---
Yes it does, I just completed that weekly task
---
Week? Make it a month!
---
We have to download a patch to add these new features in though, right? Unless I am mistaken, which I very well could be, but thats downloadable content.
---
Yeah so private servers should be free? 
---
sometimes its not even that many....   I will crash when theres like 8 people playing.  and they really need to have the servers able to handle all 24..
---
Yet more proof that Bethesda is scamming the fuck out of everyone who spends money on this game.
---
I'm not saying the game can't be enjoyable, because it can be amazing. But that's in spite of Bethesda, not because of them. Any fun you can have in this game is made by you and your friends / teammates, making adventures and fighting together. Bethesda doesn't care about quality, just milking the people who enjoy the game for even more cash.
---
You just build it before the defend comes up. Hell, you can even use the indestrucble tent you get from fallout 1st to "cover" the workshops workbench and make it inaccessible for anyone but yourself. While completely ignoring defend quests due to the tent being indestructible.
---
This is my farming spot.
---
We did a team nuke of the event on a buddies private server. While the glowing ones were a nice touch even with just about 5 or 6 of us it was still really laggy and the robots didnt seem to respawn at a decent rate. We managed to finish it but myself and one other teammate  bluescreened on the cottage section. He was able to get in before the event finished and got rewards but i wasnt able too. It was fun but for optimal runs its best to run with no nuke.
---
in the years to come you will regret being so ignorant but by then the hole you dug will be too deep to get out of.
---
I had to switch servers after run of the event, if I tried to run the event more than once on the same server my game would buzz crash
---
I think they should get rid of the robots and terminals too, and just have a window popup on the screen instead. Saves time having to walk to the location and press buttons on my keyboard.
---
I'm pretty sure it means that there will ultimately be items that *can only be bought by members*
---
I built like 5 artillery pieces and server hopped with friends finding someones house in the Bog, bombing it, killing them if they resisted. Stealing junk and the like along the way. We did this almost every day until they got rid of player damage to CAMPs.
---
Absolutely, but advertising their shop and then restricting access to it sucks.  I‚Äôm not justifying what I did, just answering the post‚Äôs question.  Camps are so cheap to repair, it‚Äôs mostly just a statement anyway.
---
I ran by several after doing it several times and every time they had a problem with me just being there. Maybe it's a case by case basis?
---
Yeah yeah calm yourself. I am less butt hurt by being ‚Äúscrewed over‚Äù by Bethesda. As far as I know people bought a broken product and just can‚Äôt move on and it‚Äôs fucking sick and pathetic.
---
Firstly, please do not take that statement as me defending the game or the practice because I‚Äôm not. I know there is a lot of anger out there (including with myself) and it‚Äôs easy to react to neutral statements as if they are defending or attacking something when they really aren‚Äôt. Most MMO‚Äôs that are not free to play make you purchase the game and also offer a subscription service that‚Äôs not required just like FO76 additionally even games like battlefield make you buy the game and then offer you bonus content through a subscription service. It‚Äôs common practice with online games. Some of them even require you to pay a subscription to even play, such as ESO in its first year.
---
because the whole game is a scam. They are whale hunting
---
lol, well no games hold a candle to the fallout universe, not for me anyways. but you can go enjoy whatever games you want for whatever price you want, does not bother me in the least
---
You said games, plural. What about their other games?
---
Yes Fallout 4 was a step back in terms of interactivity, but atleast having characters in a story based game is hell of a lot more fun than walking from computer screen to computer screen.
---
I did 3 on xbox last night, there was definitely lag, but no crashes. a lot of people where using explosive shotguns and gatlings guns. And after the event I found someone duping mines in the Whitespring train station, then my server disconnected. I loaded a new server and there was still some lag, but it quite a bit better.
---
And you only called me a jerk because you have your panties in a wad about something that I said.  And what else did I talk about other than killing somebody in a workshop?  Anybody with a braincell knows that's why you're butthurt.
---
Every new feature better be behind a paywall or I'm quitting.
---
To get the location, just start the Stings and Things quest withou bloatfly gland in your inventory. The circle on the map is the approximate location.
---
Yeah, maybe every 30
---
Fair enough
---
I told them to buy fallout 76.
---
Yeah it should encourage pvp interactions instead of encouraging even MORE grinding on a server that's supposedly meant for only pvp.
---
^ I found borderlands PR
---
Yeah fallout 4 had good graphics on release but 76 is decent. You can tell the difference if you play both.
---
LOL  That sucks.  I'm sure the crafted version would still suck too anyway.
---
i believe that thats because people are killing it too fast.
---
supposedly the green mist thing around it is it powering up, so its probably being killed before it can even become a 3 star.
---
kind of a tragedy of the commons situation.   everyone needs to, as a group, let it charge up.  but then you run the risk of getting nothing if other people kill it too fast, so everybody just immediately dumps bullets into it.
---
Sigh
---
Bloodied is a legendary weapon effect that amplifies your damage based on missing health.  This is combined with the Nerd Rage perk and Adrenal Reaction mutation to maximize damage when you‚Äôre at 19% health (when Nerd Rage triggers).  Eating and drinking will heal you, so to counteract that, players with this build will irradiate themselves to reduce their maximum health to 19%, so the effect is always active and you can‚Äôt heal past it.  There are some other cool interactions with other perks and the radiation, but those are the basics. Sometimes it‚Äôs annoying to dial in the exact 19%.
---
Nice go at being pedantic there buddy...
---
Nothing has been addes to the game. Everything that become a new event etc os already in game, just not unlocked for use. A patch is not DLC.
---
If wastelanders was chargeable, then you have a point.
---
There are studies that show kids with their parents' credit cards are the ones who download all this stuff and it encourages bad gaming behavior. And if you are paying an extra $100 for content that should've been in the launch game that costed $60 (after the company said there wouldn't be a paid subscription), you're the douche. 
---
&gt;so you're effectively paying nothing
---
This is perhaps one of the most irrational rationalization a consumer can ever make. You're paying extra for things that should have been free and should have been in the base game and that the company PROMISED would not be behind a pay wall. You're not getting a deal in any sense. You're rewarding a shitty game that can't run for more than 45 minutes without crashing and whose entire development team has deliberately lied about features for a year. Have fun with your imaginary Todd Dollars.
---
I already planned on bringing it up to 5 at least to throw tormentor on there but now it's probably going to be class freak instead
---
ive got brain damage! purpleberry punch, all day everyday!
---
whoah, whoah, whoah...its- who are you again? purpleberry puffs! every day!
---
The only time the event froze on me was when I was running around like crazy the first time I did it. Slowing down on the next couple resulted in finishing both with no problems.
---
Great post. You'd hope that more people were aware of this. It's the same information that helps people avoid being tricked by commercials by reading the fine-print. Mouthwash commercials that wipe away what looks like all germs, but you still see a few small ones so they can avoid suggesting they are "100%". Same with house cleaners, and car companies and phone companies claiming "the best X (in its class)", "The fastest Y, as measured on a Tuesday during a rainstorm in East Harrisburg, PA."
---
It's the reason why in Olympic competitions like ice skating, they throw out the highest and lowest scores. If you love something too much, or you hate it too much, you're likely not going to properly influence the undecided folks...
---
this is 100% wrong
---
Wrong game.
---
You don't think Todd Howard has any input on Fallout 76?  I think he has a proven track record and has enough influence within Bethesda as a whole to change some of the greedy decisions made.  After all, Fallout 76 was developed by multiple studios including his.
---
I just hope Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6 don't turn out to be greedy cash grabs.
---
They don't seem to know how to program events to reward participation it seems. And by that I mean actually contributing not just hiding at an event.
---
I was only able to hold 25K on a new character yesterday. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
"I'm David S. Pumpkins.   Any questions?"
---
One other thing:
---
*Please please please* look at the Sentry Bot's health bar before you open fire.  It doesn't always spawn with its Legendary status.  You are cheating yourself, and everyone else, if you kill it before the game catches up and upgrades it.
---
i wish someone with a programming back ground would chime in on exactly how hard it would be to make legendary enemies (atleast during public events) drop loot for everyone.   I have no clue, but i feel like its easy enough that it should have already happened.
---
Well that‚Äôs your opinion, I personally like the gladiator outfit tbh.
---
the things are claimed in the atom shop, and upon cancelation of the sub, you will no longer have them claimed. which means you will lose them.
---
believe it or not freeloaders hoping to get free stuff.
---
shame
---
.....atoms are earned in game. No one forced you to spend money ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I did it at 11, it's now 12. It started again, in which I did it. Again. 
---
It's every hour. Til 5th.
---
Yeah you can see on the map like a ridge in the northern Mire, if you head straight north from the power plant until you hit that ridge you should be pretty close. If you don't see it right away keep exploring along that ridge. I have to rekill the honey beasts every time I sign in but they drop good loot, I use the honey to make blackberry honey crisps which I sell at the kids restaurant
---
It‚Äôs the only Legion looking armor in the game so I still kind of want to get it.
---
I‚Äôm alright with the survival exp but you should also be rewarded for killing right now the exp for killing isn‚Äôt worth the risk.
---
K
---
Here‚Äôs the problem 
---
The sentry bot boss dishes out a lot of damage (unlike Uranium Fever) so I won‚Äôt be waiting around for others to join in while I get smoked
---
And unlimited stash space that deletes all you shit and a stupid tent you have to pay 13 dollars to use
---
I copied that text from the Bethesda site: https://bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-launch
---
I guess I'll see for sure in a couple weeks but for now I'm trusting bethesda.net.
---
I didn't say that. OP is implying it should be given out as free rewards for participating in the event. Sure. But how is it different from earning atoms in game anyway and buying them ?
---
Never crashed for me, I'm on PC. Did notice it gets very laggy. Which is most likely caused by 16 people in the same exact spot and the sever needing to render between all the explosions and enemies. Just like SBQ lag.
---
I put them in my vendor booth for 100 caps for unsuspecting new players. I've sold 3.
---
Nw out of the country atm so won't be for few weeks yet but will let you know thx
---
Guys cmon this is a simple fix, just get Fallout 1st so you can play the event on your private, less populated and equally dogshit server. It just works
---
I agree with everything you are saying with some caveats. I too went into eso as an MMO and I wasn't shocked at all by the teething probls, wow had them as well which people seem to have forgotten. Eso hands down one of my favorites MMO spaces to be in. I don't blame Zenimax, they made eso work despite a hostile crowd. I went into fo76 with no expectations and loved it up until now...but it's not the marketing team making these horrendous design decisions. It's amateurish. I feel like Zenimax is more experienced than this. If anyone's followed eso development cycle compared to FO76... The PR and marketing is indeed off. Eso is direct and forthcoming compared to FO76.
---
Umm yeah that is not it at all. It was lack of human NPC that killed it for me. None of the other stuff bugged me about it.
---
I think it looks good. 
---
Really, all we have to wait for is a wolf head hat to be put out. Or use the Sheepsquash head. Throw on some shades and boom, you‚Äôre good to go.
---
low level = low level legendary would be my issue. Nuked WS is a gold mine, especially if you farm it properly. Get a friend, nuke it, clear it using a specific route, one friend exits server and rejoins, ghouls respawn when he gets close to their spawn points. Lots of legendary enemies, and the best spot for flux. For the min/maxed power gamers doing this kind of thing, nothing in the game is a threat, so may as well get easy exp / best possible legendaries. It was a bone head move on BGS part to make it at the whitesprings.
---
you need to chill out, there friend. what you need, is a nice drag from a Stoagie Slim(tm). with 100% more nicotine in EVERY drag. guaranteed. we just spray our patented nicotine onto some scrap paper we found, roll it up, and sell it to you! why bother with all the mess with tobacco when its the nicotine you crave!
---
honestly, at this point, we dont even know what tobacco even LOOKS like, outside of whats in the history books. 
---
but have a stoagie slim, friend, and your mood will brighten right up. for five minutes at least, guaranteed.
---
oooh so edgy
---
Nope you are wrong, I love how confident you are though
---
Putting that blame solely on PR and marketing makes your argument contradictory to the comment you just replied to.
---
The problem with this game lies solely with greed set forth by unrealistic expectations. Everything else is a part of that sum.
---
Couple people looked like they were duping. I ran over grabbed everything, and gtdo'd.  Full set of upgraded power armour parts.
---
did you even read his post? it outlines why he is actually enjoying it...?
---
but by all means, let the hate fill you, give in to anger and fear, let he dark side flow through you
---
I'm on PS4, did the Mischief Night event 4 times last time. Every, single, time, my game crashed when the event reward was being provided. Also, twice, even if I shot multiple times at the last legendary boss from up close, I got nothing when trying to loot him.
---
Seriously, one year after the game is out and these basic bugs are not fixed but it's not important, They had better fish to fry. They needed to allocate all ressources for fake private servers and bugged scrap lootboxes. This is what matters.
---
The time it crashed on me (this morning) we were at the end of the event!  I mean literally shooting at the legendary sentry bot and the damn server crashed.
---
I‚Äôm not annoyed I got disconnected I‚Äôm annoyed because I probably burned up 500-600 .556 ammo in the event and got nothing out of it.
---
Thanks for putting a detailed buglist together again,good man!
---
Only sad to know most (if not all) of this stuff will probably never be fixed.
---
Maybe the "Empty Pumpkin Rack" was supposed to be similar to the rare Fastnacht masks but they again forgot to add it to the list of rewards
---
It exceeds the cost if you actually use Bethesda‚Äôs measure for the value of their shitty currency... which nobody who isn‚Äôt insane shouldn‚Äôt use that metric.
---
Back when TSE weapons and Sentinel Assassin Armor were God-tier, me and a group of friends were a menace. We made it our lifestyle mission to grief peoples bases by any means necessary. We likely destroyed close to 2k bases before we took a break from the game. That was the most fun period of the game.
---
OK, I have no idea what I'm doing then will try again.
---
Skyrim was quite repetitive as well.  We all know the memes.  The arrow to the knee.  Whether or not we got to the Cloud District.  Plus, Skyrim weirdly seemed to have far fewer distinct voice actors than NV or 4.  I played Skyrim for many hours, but I couldn't tell you the names of most of the characters in it.
---
It's not that I don't want to see human NPCs in 76, but if we're going to do this, I want them to not come across like automatons.  For what it's worth, what stories we get from holotapes and notes are, in my mind, a lot better written than the stuff in 4, so I think there's hope.
---
it can drop from breach and clear, battle bot, and crates. try actually doing research and reading reddit post.
---
Given the job listings coming and going like a race track for the Austin studio I don‚Äôt disagree with your caveat.
---
Hey, the 1-star executioner's pipe revolver I got last night is a valuable piece of equipment for my level 90 rifleman/heavy gunner. I totally didn't turn it right in for scrip.
---
I'll try that, may work :)
---
Nobody can fault you for that. But the issues are much larger than just a poor storyline decision imo.
---
Bruh the first time I tried the event I nearly finished the event, But guess what? SERVER CRASH.
---
Glad I was able to log back in and join another public server at the last minute and get rewarded with some decent experience and plans and such, nothing too exceptional.
---
I‚Äôm on a base ps4 and outside of actually loading into a map nothing takes longer than 30-45 seconds maybe to load into buildings that take you out of the main map.
---
Or maybe go the other route and make it a level 500 that NEEDS everyone to kill it. 
---
Also ....Some kind of proximity "sweep" to knock away player that run up to it, stand one foot away and empty their gun clip. Maybe some kind of blast radius where it sweeps and knocks everyone away?
---
So you did what you wanted with your money? See no problem here.
---
Tldr op comments as they appeared to be trying to mimic moral superiority on a golden pedestal way above me.
---
close, just missing orange in between the pumpkins too
---
Yet you‚Äôre still here on this sub lol
---
Once a player has contribute with x % of event requirement is guaranteed full rewards, but like you say probably expecting too much.
---
To get posts like this
---
I cannot see him spawning in enemies, structures or anything that can only be done serverside.
---
They dont want to give Bethesda peace.
---
I'd wait for wastelanders launch and avoid any media reviews to make your own picture.
---
PR and marketing could use more work, but you're insane if you think that's the \*only\* thing wrong with this game. xD  It has many very real technical problems and some more arguable design problems, and those are what get most of the focus from intelligence critics. 
---
PR and marketing are only a problem in the sense that Bethesda seems largely unable to predict, control, and compensate for these moments of extreme criticism.
---
I don't think they've introduced a whole lot to the ATX since First dropped so maybe they just haven't hit one of their scheduled discounts yet. Weird that they wouldn't have one on the launch of First, but not their worst marketing failure.
---
I just grief and kill the F01 people (just kidding).  If someone wants to spend their money on it more power to them.  I don‚Äôt think I will but that doesn‚Äôt make me better or smarter than someone that does.  I just want my survival mode back!
---
yeah its easy saying K feller when you're relying on a clickbait title like
---
&gt;The problem with this game lies solely with bad PR, and awful marketing.
---
You know whats the problem?
---
* crippling amount of bugs that I've never ever seen in a AAA game before especially a year after release
---
* awful endgame content
---
* terrible design and paid content choices
---
* gameplay breaking bugs that deserve a special category (perks, legendary prefixes, weapon classes like shotguns do not work at all)
---
* awful performance
---
* lackluster dlc road map for the past and the next four (total of eight) months 
---
etc I could go on but yeah, you spin the story by revving up flat out wrong threads like this my man. solely pr issue my ass.
---
TBH it's not that much like fallout it's more like borderlands with dialogue.
---
There‚Äôs a little thing called ‚Äòcover‚Äô
---
I believe you need to download, print out, fill out, and mail in a rebate form. Expect 6 to 8 weeks to receive your discount.
---
But im quite enjoying it since July. Quit shortly after launch as well, around lvl 39. Now im 158 xd
---
I still think it's better to have some NPCs than none, even if they are repetitive. I mean repetition vs nothing at all... I'll take repetition in that case. Atleast it would be fun for a while until it starts to get repetitive.
---
I think it‚Äôs best to leave it. Play some other games. The Outer Worlds is far better. Also, happy cake day
---
So true. It's already too late if you bought everything they wanted you to buy. Every dollar people give them at this point makes the situation worse.
---
I've noticed today that comments critical of Bethesda are getting heavily downvoted on new posts, despite greatly outnumbering comments supporting them, which are getting lots of upvotes. Am I just crazy or are they legit doing that?
---
I've been playing since Beta as well, and I am starting to get bored, especially since patch 12 when the events slowed down. They said they fixed the clock: it is still rare to see One Violent Night (the best remaining event for farming level 50 legendaries) and Uranium Fever (best source for scrip). And I am at the door. I was furious when Wastelanders was delayed and Fallout Fist (as in they are Fisting us) was given as the alternative.
---
I agree about bases. I can easily be √¨n the Zone for 4 hours building a base. But I was forced to move my camp on the last patch because Bethesda turned my location (across the street from the green valley motel in Flatwoods) into a no-build zone for no apparent reason A YEAR AFTER LAUNCHING THE GAME!!!!!. I loved that base and my new one is, and simply cannot be, as good. So the guy implying (I think) that the dude is a shill just has different interests. Though I can see where it might be seen as a subtle sales job. Maybe that\`s not intentional but clearly the message is ignore the taste and swallow the medicine.
---
I bought  a month. I agree with the observations about the scrapbox and tent. I also found the fridge useless since I have a refrigerated backpack which is 10% better and easier to monitor. The collectron is useful but hardly a game a changer. I use repair kits all the time, but only the ones I earn killing the Queen since they repair to 1.5x as opposed to 1x for the bought variety. I used the scrap boxes once, i wouldn\`t buy them as there are better solutions. 
---
Private Worlds are useful only to keep demented dogs like Liquid Blade 2000 (who I guess cant find enough flies to pull the wings off of) from PVPing you while you are defending a workshop. Also you can do events like One Violent Night and Uranium Fever solo without idiots one-shotting legendaries or speeding the clock when you are trying to stretch the time. Not worth it though because the events are now too rare.
---
The best two events, now rare, project paradise, death blossoms and dogwood dieoff runs frequently EMPTY! 
---
My point is none of this crap gives a real advantage. You can easily play without it. Scrap is for repairs and building. Whether you have a budget limit or not, you STILL HAVE TO GO GET THE SCRAP. When they start selling legendary weapons and armour you can call it \`\` pay to win\`\`  (though win what?). But then if they did that what are you playing for? The main goal is finding the perfect set of armor and weapons and if you can just buy it then it will kill the game.
---
Personally it would take a hell of a lot to persuade me to buy another month. I would NEVER buy a year. In a year this game will be obsolete (more so). IT IS NOT GETTING BETTER. Don't get me wrong, I love the game, for all it's flaws at it's core it is set in a time where you get to use firearms instead of magic. You get to launch nukes! You are not an agent for a government or organization. The setting is great. The monsters are cool. You get to build cool bases. 
---
Maybe if you get to accelerate events then I might buy another month, though I acknowledge this would not be fair. I don't care about fair. Or if I could demolish and level areas anywhere on the map for my base. Or if I could run mods. If none of this happens I cancel in December after one last blast of filling the scrapbox until I am broke.
---
Honestly there are so many things to tear fallout 76 apart for, the nylon bag, the glitches, the lies they told at their press conference, delaying wastelanders, and a million other things, that honestly I think they have enough pitchfork material lol
---
This is brilliant and I wanna start doing that now.
---
Hahaha... have you met this sub before? It's probably the same people who've claimed to have uninstalled too. :) 
---
This event is great! Two or three people on a private server easily completed and everyone get's a few shots on the legendary.
---
Damn Bethesda PR trying to cleverly make what they are doing seem less bad by either fabricating or modifying a true story /s
---
I didn‚Äôt read the whole thing, but as far as the main issue with this game being a pr disaster I kind of agree with. 
---
For some(myself included) the initial idea of it being the main next fallout, but online, was amazing(although I was a lil skeptical it came out a lil closer to fo4 than Bethesda‚Äôs usual sequels do). 
---
Execution is where it fell, and proper marketing would of cushioned that fall immensely
---
Agreed on waiting until wastelanders. Chances are the fallout 1st price will drop by then too.
---
Simply owning it as a collectors item could be a win in my eyes.
---
It makes me angry to hear people blame the engine.
---
The engine is bad because the company does not want to spend time investing to improve the engine, or create a new one, when the higher ups view it as perfectly useable.
---
The engine is failing by design - it was underdeveloped to suit the needs of a more story driven game, which helps distract from gameplay flaws by engrossing you in other things.
---
Stop blaming the engine. It's entirely Bethesda's economic choice for it being the state that it is in.
---
I was looking forward to playing yesterday. Between the new Mischief Night events and teaming up with an xbox friend I haven't played with since the summer, it should have been a great time. But I had nothing but problems trying to play 76 yesterday. Crashes, lag, and even my character dying endlessly from seemingly taking much more damage than usual (wondering if that was a bug, coincidence or what), it just because really aggravating. After the game crashing for the 3rd or 4th time, I finally gave up and went to play The Outer Worlds. 
---
This is not how you keep people active in this game!
---
Hey there, the team is aware of this issue and working towards a fix.

You're not getting how absurd my point was and how it's the same argument you're trying to make.
---
Server hopping was always a thing. No life-ing a game has always been a thing.
---
Are there advantages to fo1st? Yes, yes there are. Is *this* something that can be considered an unfair advantage? No, it's not.
---
Believe it or not, multiplayer is the core reason why I picked up 76, so as good as Outer Worlds looks, it's not my cup of tea atm.
---
Thanks! I got a really good deal on Black Friday!
---
I managed to wait 15 minutes for it to load and got to whitespring right as the event ended. Somehow I still got xp and rewards for the event though. I guess I'll count myself lucky.
---
I posted a thread on this same topic:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/douzmv/mischief_night_halloween_event_unplayable/
---
It would be a fun quest, but it isn't functional for me.  Everything freezes constantly.  I am guessing that the game just can't handle the non stop explosions.
---
Maybe some people are so sour about 1st that this is one of their ways of lashing out?
---
You wrote the truth. I should cry if I could care anymore...
---
Enough!
---
Respectfully, I don‚Äôt see how it does, yes there are problems with the game but PR and Marketing exacerbated the issues 100 fold by trying to sell the game as something it wasn‚Äôt and created said unrealistic expectations. 
---
If you step back, they are not engaging in any monetization practices other online titles don‚Äôt also do and some of them are far worse. Besides a paid subscription offer, and shop with clear pay to win items ESO also has a gambling system you have to use if you want certain items where your paying money with no guarantee of getting the item you want. There‚Äôs even more greed there but not nearly the amount of backlash. Why? Because ESO was honest about what it was and what it was doing from the start.
---
When you‚Äôre so socially inept that you can‚Äôt handle human introduction in video games
---
Sadly you are bang on the money. I once thought they were all 14 years old  living in Mommy's basement until I started meeting more and more people. Turns out most 14 year old players I have met are decent, sensible. ethical people. So??? Maybe it's the 30 and 40 year old "bitter bus" failures living angrily alone in the basement. Maybe? I honestly have no idea what would make an ordinary person into an asshat. I have had tragedy and disappointment running through my life like .... well just like the players in the event but I would like to think I am still kind so I really don't know what makes people go sour,
---
In challenges under combat there's a vault 94 emote that you can unlock
---
You already got 100h out of it, I would call that good and pick up Outer Worlds, much better game.
---
I just want private servers. Would do a 1 time payment of like $25. Locking that behind a sub is lame sauce, and I am currently a subscriber.
---
The weapon he is using he spawns in himself, it just spawns in his inventory.
---
 Og Xbox one also ...  I've complete six out of seven so far.  All have had lots of lag and stuttering, but i was able to stay in world by essentially standing still to prevent crashing.  Trying to move around drops the frame rate into the low single digits. Throw the explosions and density of players in and it's a recipe for disaster
---
 Additionally, outside of the event I'm also noticing a ton of random stuttering that only started with the most recent update
---
Not possible unless they change them to a permanent fixture or a rental type deal.
---
Even better make it free.
---
That‚Äôs crazy! Inspiring me to go try it again for the third time haha
---
Today! Mischief Night is fun!
---
So you keep track of what every person is doing the entire time? Nobody is saying let everyone on the server get their shot in, just let the encounter last more than 2 seconds. The first time I did the event I had no idea where it would spawn and two people destroyed it the second it spawned. That's bullshit.
---
Any non-static information has to be *checked* (not always loaded, as assets *can* be stored locally), but a surprising number of things are considered non-static by the game.  And, while it doesn't take a lot of bandwidth to load location data, that isn't usually stored as a chunk (or a file), and when loading a large area, a lot of information has to be queried.  Even if it's a simple 'yes, that thing is still here' answer, the questions all have to get asked and answered before the space can finish loading.
---
This can be simplified by segregating the world into bite-sized chunks, which 76 does do, but the total space required to be updated before the world loads is a lot bigger than you might expect (partly to lump all of the load-lag together when you load into an area, so you feel less of it as you move around).  All of the yes/no checks can be done as a group (really a number of groups).  Then you add all of the things that doesn't have a yes/no answer (containers, anything with a count, etc.) the all have to be done pretty much individually.  It's a lot of back and forth.
---
I have a newer gen SSD, and a pretty spiffy rig.  It seems to take *forever* to load into the new event.  It's not 5 minutes (and I have no idea how much OP might be exaggerating), but it is definitely a lot longer than you'd think it would take.
---
For real. It‚Äôs no coincidence that they put out a Roman-styled outfit just right after the riot gear. Two of the best known factions in the franchise, probably right after the Brotherhood.
---
Is this a daily thing? If I don‚Äôt play 1 day will I miss out?
---
Sure mate, but why not just having private servers for free?
---
Shit...
---
I do mean this in the nicest possible way sir. I‚Äôm not going to tell you how to spend your money, but are you really surprised that something in fallout 76 isn‚Äôt working? Lol. If the money is worth it to you I understand, you‚Äôre allowed to like the game, but at the same time the writing has been all over the walls for a year now.
---
You paid tax on this? I was just charged 12.99. To me its worth it because of the atoms you get as well. I subscribed to ESO for a couple of years and it really made my experience a lot better and it cost more. 14.99/month I think it was. Pretty much the same benifits. To each his own.
---
Dont post this dumbass
---
Chasing low levels with a chainsaw( ripper) while wearing a leather hood.
---
I even killed fews that tried to fight back
---
Yes this patch has seriously impacted the games stability and optimization, im hoping they'll give us a hotfix in the next few days.
---
Incorrect. She posted yesterday and just now on this thread.
---
never?
---
It does indeed work, but you have to use a world container to store the gear - even one of the static corpses like the responder outside V76 will do - if you drop stuff straight from your inventory into your loot bag and log off, the bag will persist but the stuff inside it will disappear.
---
Ngl, so do I lol
---
It‚Äôs almost like Bethesda are trying not to comply with their promises? Hmm, haven‚Äôt seen them do that before. It just works.
---
I'm 0/2 right now. Since both tries I crashed in the first minute, I was able to reload (painfully slowly) to catch the end. So I've been rewarded twice without doing anything more than being present. Smooth one, Bethesda.
---
Most skins are already over priced already. I mean what idiot though people would pay almost 20 bucks for a power armor skin?
---
30k if you are a fallout 1st member, 25k if you‚Äôre not
---
My game glitched &amp; froze probably about half the times I tried it... luckily I was on a team for 2 times and i was able to restart the game and rejoin the event. I got the pirate outfit 2nd try though! üòÅ
---
My honest answer here    
---
Sometimes I tag an enemy and the other person is so slow to come get it. I simply will not allow myself to be possibly killed and have armor broken for someone else who can't keep up.    
---
That being said I do not simply gun something down instantly, I do try. But I'm not dying for someone.
---
I guess I just prefer a more stealthy, kind of combat vs everyone running out guns blazing just to get the most kills. I think of it like the hunger games, ultimate reward is really to live. Doesn‚Äôt matter how many people you take down.
---
Seems to be the way online games always go. Nuke zones used to be fun and people rarely one shot enemies. Now you get people that will sprint from place to place trying to now everything down.
---
Yeah the activities I do the most is scavenging for scrap, scavenging food ingredients to make the stuff I sell, and taking over/defending Workshops, which is great for getting scrap but also great for exp. If people start contesting my workshops I just server hop and start over. If the point is the quest rewards and exp, taking them all over again is just fine
---
That‚Äôs fixed
---
You know what Henry Huckum would say?

Destiny 2 is free to play without expansions, it's not so much open world but much more polished.
---
Plus camps! I've had so many different camps in so many areas. That's probably what's the most fun to me

Sales are about normal. I even moved from near WS to Devils Backbone. Still get good traffic. I sell mainly legendary weapons and armor but some clothing and plans too. Little ammo as well, al‚Äù selling normally. No chems or serums though.
---
&gt; And it being a 1*, it's not a great loss to be honest.
---
I get better legendaries from the random glowing one's before getting to the courtyard than the the special event's boss, that's poor design.
---
You must be on acid because you aren't being coherrent. You can have a brand new Xbox One S system and the game will crash. Server crashes don't discrimnate.
---
I'm going to go ahead and say no.
---
Fair. I suppose I‚Äôm a bit biased because I prefer single player
---
I‚Äôm using the game on two ps4s since my old one lives for the time being and am realizing with only 76 installed it runs way faster. If you have a bunch of games downloaded and mix that with public servers it can be a pain. On a private server load times are decreased big time tho
---
Yea because many younsters started with fallout 3...
---
Dude whales are smarter than humans, watch blackfish.
---
Had a player walk into my trap base and buy 70 screws for 5 caps each only to roast him alive and collect my screws.
---
It was never promised private servers would be free. Over a year ago they said it would be a paid service.
---
Fucking everything is broken in this game. I assume they don't even try to fix anything because the whole game is fundamentally fucked.
---
) ok - fair point
---
In the present economy of having to pay over 100k caps/ammo for an item and if that‚Äôs your ‚Äúwin‚Äù there would be a convenience of having unlimited junk stash space.  Or, you could accumulate it on a mule.
---
That is also single player, not open world...
---
Same.  Mine crashes all the time.  Xbox
---
Holo and notes are weightless, so I just keep all of them in my stashbox.
---
I sold 25k worth of weapons in 20 minutes yesterday, and they're all 1500-3000 cap range.  My machines are right next to WS, which is getting a lot of attention right now due to the mischief event.
---
Gotta defend that 100 dollar investment! Lmfao!
---
I believe he holds up to 10lbs in his storage box. If you set it to scrap it's a ton of stuff, but if you set it to junk you have to collect every 20-30 minutes or it'll cap out.
---
cr-in-gey
---
Yes, after the second month comes due or the third, will be interesting.
---
This is probably due to the excessive load in and the shear volume of players and players using automatic explosive weapons, each "explosion" requires a significant amount of processing power to display, and even on higher end PC's it lags like heck when they use them.
---
If Bethesda can't fix this issue - they need to really consider removing "explosive' from any "automatic" weapon. (TBH it's overpowered nonsense as it is anyway, so I wouldn't mind some shift in balance that makes gameplay more diverse)
---
Tip?  Probably show up early.  It's "on the hour" or so - so showing up 10 mins early and loading in, then waiting for the event to start is your best bet.  Then try not to hang around large groups too much, you can still participate and help without being the 'super aggressive force' shooting all the robots.
---
This thread is horrifying. Oof. Kind of makes me.want that fallout 1st for the private server. Me and all of my none friends can play on it.
---
So what set the standards and expectations of the game that people are mad about? Who set the price? What brought about the backlash of people feeling like they were lied to and sold a false product? Who told everyone what the game was going to be and how it was going to function? Who said the atomic shop was going to be cosmetic only? If the only thing people were mad about was the bugs and technical problems and Bethesda PR had been honest about the timeline and issues they expected up front and took the time to explain exactly what the game was going to be you don‚Äôt think the backlash would be waaaayyy less severe? People have always been patient with Bethesda regarding bugs and technical issues because of the scope and scale of their games but those are the straws not the anvils on the camel‚Äôs back.
---
And  you can play all by yourself making the experience completely meaningless and a waste of time, how grand.
---
You people are hilarious :)
---
It doesn't feel like the content added over the last few months would be enough to play again, so this is good feedback.
---
wastelanders is going to be a minor DLC similar to scope with the other ones, the idea it's a secret game 2.0 is not a real thing.
---
Looks like West Virginia to me..
---
Assuming your assumption is correct, I assume you'll end up assuming the position of a 1st member?
---
Did you read my post?
---
Had this exact scenario on my first attempt. I died right before the end of the event, lagged out and was burnt to a crisp by an assaultron, and was stuck at the respawn screen where i got to watch others enjoy their winnings as my lifeless corpse laid there. I had to restart the game.
---
Poor grammar on my part I guess, what I mean is that you should not be able to buy the same items from the Atom Shop that you get as event rewards.
---
Before the Halloween thing, I put on a tophat, suit and monocle
---
I mean, it's just a RP, my guy. I don't legitimately think anyone is better or worse for having FO1st. It's just a good vehicle for conflict in the game, which is severely lacking one right now without a survival mode.
---
Murdered them repeatedly in PvP with the Cannibal perk.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôd love that. I‚Äôd probably even take pacifist mode off if that became a thing.
---
Now that, is class. I should get a whole squad in that getup and start painting all the workshops in the 1st icon to try to start a fight.
---
I'll be trying to leave myself afk when not playing the next few days since I'm a stay at home mom, so hopefully you can swing by. Feel free to add me, I'll accept when I can. :)
---
But, it hasn't been the games most popular nuke event. Not since they patched out the 'totally-legendary-but-not-intended-to-be-legendary' mobs.
---
Fissure Site Prime has pretty much been the only nuke site since that patch.
---
What the hell are you doing to crash every hour? What system are you on? Do you live in the middle of nowhere?
---
Wow! Neat! Thanks for the info I did not know that.
---
It does say on ‚Äúsome‚Äù sweet items.
---
yup. gotta shift off the "carry more" and into the "do more damage' at some point - and all the loot RNG is terrible so good luck with that.   Junkie's was made better so if your ok dealing with penalties from being in withdrawals all the time you can dish out some serious damage now - without relying on low HP like bloodied/unyeilding combo do.
---
the tattered dress gives +1 PER so if your not in power armor it can help a tiny smidge with rifles.  
---
Welcome to the real grind part of the game : Getting loot that makes the game actually function or slightly enjoyable instead of pumping a few thousand bullets into common enemies.
---
Agreed. People loved/love Bethesda. If they had been honest about what exactly this game was and what it was going to be and the problems they expected to have and not marketed it as a AAA next in title game the community would have been much more forgiving  and understanding.
---
Can you use the private server all by yourself or does it require you to have friends to do it?
---
Nah once the stars are up it doesn't change. All three times I done event been 1 star as well. And none of us killed it while it was green and smokey.
---
i wish the outer worlds sub had this rule for 76
---
I've taken to calling my version of the NCR in Appalachia the New Appalachian Commonwealth. I'd love to see the Ceasar's Legion of Appalachia sprout up
---
They promised all future updates would be free. Fallout 1st is an update.
---
I guess so, because I played ESO since day one and all this ‚Äúproblems‚Äù seem okay to me like you put it, except human npc.
---
I'm the only one of my 3 brothers that can consistently play through it because I'm the only one with an xbox one x. In my mind it has to be a hardware issue because I can watch it in real time when I bring my xbox over to their place.
---
Fallout 1st is not an update. All expansions are free.
---
*You fool you fell for one of the oldest blunders*
---
I might shell out 5 to try it
---
I don't have a second human on standby to be my permanent mule courier. I don't know what you don't understand about it being hard to have a mule on console?
---
You can use it by yourself, but I feel it's still a better experience with a few friends.
---
I get lag when I first load into the area but after about 20 seconds everything calms down and runs just fine. I'm on a Xbox one x.
---
Nah I just want to grind whitesprings not my fault Bethesda didn‚Äôt think two steps ahead of themselves
---
Xbox and I live in the US
---
I‚Äôd spend 5$ for it
---
The nw limited rewards are releasing 1 per day. Tuesday was bats AR skin and today's is the Halloween skin for 10mm pistol. The challenge timer seems a bit early tho as it seems you can get the nw reward for the next day after 8pm EST
---
Because Bethesda nerfed the legendary spawns there several months back and it's pretty worthless now, unless you're only trying to farm mats.
---
wow awesome. thanks for the info :)
---
With Dogmeat following you, the Prydwen up in the sky, raiders attacking, the Museum of Freedom etc? It is clearly Fallout 4.
---
During this week you can be nuked at WS while you try to do the Halloween event or maybe you prefer to get a 1st account to be griefed and hated. Enjoy !
---
So long story short: don't trust anyone you don't know personally.
---
There are 14 year old jerks and 40 year old jerks.  It transcends almost everything...age, sex, race, financial status, pretty much no group is immune from it.  It's something you eventually grow to accept.  Hell, I had one of the biggest asshat encounters this morning that I've seen in many months, and all I did was shake my head almost imperceptibly and go back to looking at my phone.
---
You can't change them (well, not most of them, and it's a long slog to get there even if you could), so the best you can do is mitigate the annoyance.  Keep your expectations low, but do your best to be thoughtful yourself.  If you're in the mood, you can point out the behavior to them, since it's always possible to be an accidental asshat, but again expect things to go badly and don't be disappointed if you don't elicit an epiphany.
---

It is like that for ESO too, why should it be different here? And why the player base is upset about it I really don‚Äôt get it. But to each their own.
---
Last night I was in Summerville looking for bones when I thought I heard a super mutant coming around a corner. I shot one of the flammable canisters but it was a player and I blew it up in his face. 
---
Sorry guy.
---
Not NCR ranger armor it‚Äôs riot armor which is prewar not like anything on the atomic shop can really be considered canon.
---
Update, expansion, content, CHANGE to the game. Call it whatever you want. They said that it would be free and that's the point.
---
Love this idea!!
---
Southernmost part of the divide is the highest flux density area, though it's all yellow.
---
You get apparel,  most of which is in game, with a chance at a few rarer items. Also pumpkin plans. In all, meat week, in my opinion,  had better, more original rewards. The loot pool this time is mostly disposable junk.
---
2020
---
February 21st maybe that day wastelanders will come out or Bethesda would add more stuff at that time.
---
I would love this
---
Huh I‚Äôd also like to see what it looks like
---
Yeah, not sure how that got mixed up, but the links are for FO4 mods (and I may have missed it, but I don't remember seeing the prydwen flying around 76 anywhere :P )
---
Maybe you were standing in water when you ate it. I catch diseases now by just getting close to enemies, not even been hit by them. I eat disease cures like Pez candy
---
I'm guessing we'll get them next month in the Fallout st section that currently contains the Stash Box and what not. Probably start next month since this month we got the Armor, Tent, and Stash.
---
Also, the big Bear hat for PA counts as a costume.
---
I also had the thought when I woke up this morning that they'll probably have monthly new exclusive costumes/outfits/skins because I doubt the appeal of the FONV cover armor will last forever.
---
I am waiting for the bear helmet from far harbor. The one on the super mutant at the plane crash.

Just wait, there will be 5 youtubers right now creating another hate video based on this.

Low level tagalong north of Watoga, not helping, just shoot once to loot. Got overencumbered and wanted me to wait.

I waited until I heard the mirelurk kings coming from around the ranger station. Then I left the world.

It's not the best choice, it's spacers choice
---
One of my biggest hopes for wastelanders is more interaction with the factions they already established. Even if they don't add people into the mix, new NPCs give new people for Cryptos to send us to protect. My survival character was an order of mysteries character who was actually surprisingly viable before they nerfed my favorite spot to farm mk3 stealthboys. 6 minutes of invisibility plus 100 armor pen on that sword melted bloody builds.
---
Wait for wastelanders. I came back recently and it's much better but still needs something and I think that update will help
---
More people blowing things out of proportion, creating their own things to fuel anger.

Its not unheard of. I literally cant open the special menu in whitesprings after the the event otherwise I crash. If I die, I have about a 50% chance of crashing. If I have the leg sentrybot blow up in specific locations, I crash. 
---
Honestly, now. If I hit a standstill frame for over half a minute, I just reset with hopes of cathching the end of the event on the next server.
---
Just collecting outfits too sell later on, can find 3* legendaries anywhere.
---
Same. Im away for the whole duration of the event. Sent a support ticket to Bethesda to see if any exception can be made - that was a nope. 
---
I can buy the plans for Mischief event, but not Nuclear Winter :(
---
Stop giving them ideas wtf!
---
But crypto‚Äôs never made the quests, the quests were all done by the mistress. And it doesn‚Äôt have the AI or connections to satellites like the enclave do.
---
D1 Xbox - 12 events completed, 12 rewards.  I haven't crashed yet, but I have had 2 explosion freezes, one at the end of the event - I stayed logged in as I still heard sounds, waited until rewards were given out and then closed the game (got that reward), and once at the beginning to where when I reloaded the game it was right before the finish.  I did notice the two times I froze, I was on for \~30 minutes without logging out, while overtime I logged in only for the event I didn't have any problems (other then the game assets taking forever to load).
---
i‚Äôm not even fully confident that f76 will still be online in a year, why would i commit to paying for it for a year. 
---
they roadmap hasn‚Äôt been updated which seems to hint there won‚Äôt be anything else
---
One should be quite sure of their language and grammar accuracy before attempting the higher ground. 
---
Awfully buttsore over a video game, ain‚Äôt ya?
---
wait collect?? i didnt know i had to collect? i just assumed it would automatically put it in the storage
---
I know exactly the issue, you spent money on a broken game.
---
Fuck um lol I keep getting fucked with as well but regret that decision fairly quickly lol
---
How rural are you?  I think is what theyre asking.
---
How about we meet in the middle let's say $8.25 a month but you have to buy a year or no deal.
---
yer supposed to fail fast!
---
If you left and haven't returned, why would you?
---
Absolutely will :)
---
What is this crap? Clearly intended features. Everyone loves performance issues üòã
---
Do you just shoot them in the back when they're busy doing stuff? There are a few of you around. PvP servers aren't meant solely for that, it's just a realism option. You probably just lack character or intellectual complexity, so being a wet blanket is the best you can do in life. That's ok. You were probably mistreated in your youth or something. Do you kick puppies when you can as well? Lol
---
Think for yourself and play it if/when you want. You have this thing called a brain and independent thought for a reason
---
GWEEFA!!
---
I killed someone in a workshop who was carrying at least 1500+ pounds of junk on him. Not a joke. Why he was carrying his life savings of junk on him in a PvP zone was beyond me. He was walking around because he couldn't run. I killed him multiple times, took the junk, then left.
---
By precaution I thrown it away even from my stash.
---
Yeah, his charging pod thing collects the junk and has to be emptied, it doesn't go straight into your stash.
---
Yes, several.
---
Lol you guys are intelligent with your response to his!!!! Something along the lines of irony or complaining about complaining. If someones view doesnt fit your own we act like grade schoolers with our "comebacks"? I feel i have identified Bethesda's real problem. It is you guys. If half you even play.
---
Okay, I found it.
---
It's basically due north of the sunflower on the map, that's to the east of Freddy Fear's House of Scares, by about the same distance northward.
---
This right here, as an avid ESO subscriber as it stand fallout first is just quality improvement and if it is not worth it to you, you don‚Äôt get it. I don‚Äôt see all the fuss.
---
If that's how you got your kicks that's good and all but fishing for kudos by posting it here is a little lame.
---
Do it for shits and giggles but don't try to impress me with it.
---
Not gonna lie, I‚Äôve been playing since launch, the game has gotten better for me as time has progressed, dunno if I‚Äôm in the minority with that opinion or not
---
I‚Äôm not being an apologist or a fan boy, but at launch the bugs were sooo numerous that I‚Äôd rage quit on the reg, I can‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôve done that 
---
I think every Bethesda game I‚Äôve played has been a ridiculously buggy piece of shit by today‚Äôs very high standards, can‚Äôt help myself though, they know how to keep me suckered, I just love the game world and lore
---
To farm glowing ones
---
I read that ppl who leave ‚Äúgood‚Äù items at your camp think your camp looks great!
---
Also the goofy glasses, whilst ok they can't be worn with any helmet unlike every other pair of glasses in the game
---
I actually got to complete one event and got a plan for 1/2 a pumpkin stand. Whaaaaa? Am I missing something here? I thought, oh a shorter pumpkin stand. Not finding it to build. So do I need to complete again for the other half? So confused. And from what I hear the prizes aren't all that great. I just want to be able to go back into Whitesprings so I can trade with vendors again. So far this event is more trick than treat.
---
After this SHalloweeen event, I guess the only thing left this year is X-mas which will probably be copy/paste of last year x-mas.... then Q1 for Wastelander which since Bethesda has always taken a long holiday off - probably not until Feb.
---
Yup... totally worth $100/year considering the first 3 months or so of the membership will have jack squat done to fix the base game - which is the biggest thing that needs attention.  Loot system, Grind loop, RNG everything, damage balance, condition loss balance,  heck even the stupid 'survival lite' aspects of food and drink need re-balancing.
---
I can go anywhere in this game.. and point out mistakes and flaws. From floating rocks to incredibly unbalanced systems... yet.. hey.. more atom shop items than ever - still over priced and not enticing to buy. (Pro Tip:  1/4 the cost and more than 4x the people will buy -just to "own" them)
---
Wait. Yeah I have been living in a closed dumpster for months....  there is a premium paid service now with FO76?  Is this a joke?  Wtf did I pay for the game for then?
---
This makes sense, not to mention having a sub in another game.. it's fighting for space in my monthly game sub budget of 15$.
---
Nope. The reality is that Bethesda said the game would never be pay-to-win. Then came the repair kits. Now we have Fallout First. *That* is the reality.
---
I've had minor issues with lag when doing it. It's very subtle, but can be bad in a sticky situation
---
Multiple games.
---
Over the course of multiple. Last challenge for a glowing Skeleton costume is 14küòü
---
I can't wait for the Bethesda die-hards to say that +25% damage to scorched for 24 hours isn't pay to win because "it's like, not even a competition!"
---
Seems like others have you covered.  I see people selling them in vendors for cheap sometimes so buy them because I almost scrapped mine a few times.  I favorite them for safety.
---
I'm trying to build a stash of them for people like you who I can just give them to.  They should be craftable once we've completed the quest imo.
---
damn i have to check, there must be alot of stuff, ive had it running for days now and never did anything
---
Oops, I‚Äôm PS4. Sorry
---
Sell them as a player vendor?
---
You could summarize that as 100% P2W.
---
The texture detail seemed lacking in-game, at least from the video I saw. I haven't seen anyone in-game with it to know if the guy's graphic settings were just pewp.
---
Dont know why they didn't just do their version of the battle pass ¬£10 a month extra challenges unlocks outfits atoms emotes n things like that with private servers thrown in private servers were never gonna be free I think ppl can accept that but for 12.99 theres no value in it the atoms you get maybe but the atom shop is 90% garbage anyway crazily overpriced garbage I might add
---
Battlefield has a subscription? I'm fairly sure it doesn't. Your kind of dodging the question. What game that you know of makes you pay 60 bucks for a game then asks you to pay more per month? The reason people are angry isn't because of marketing. It's because nobody has charged for a game like this before. If they would have advertised it before they offered it I doudt it would have had a better reception. I doudt bethy themselves even knew they were going to do a subscription when first developing the game.
---
So has graffiti in my neighborhood.. Doesn't mean I'm gonna start buying weed from some kid named Anders.
---
I don't care about most of the reviews I see either, but there are still some gamers who are fans of fallout and similar games (eg. Juicehead on YouTube) that give their opinions without undue criticism or hype, and are still more than a little surprised at why Bethesda chose to release Fallout 1st now, rather than wait, use the next few months to fix a lot of the bugs and server performance issues, so that Wastelanders will run smoothly once it launches, then start charging for a monthly/yearly subscription on private servers.
---
I also see some scrap boxes out there but my question is why couldn't they do this for everybody, not just the subscribers? I think it must be feasible as there are only a limited amount of junk types (and therefore a *relatively* small amount of data to handle). Give subscribers more Atoms instead, enough to cover 2-3 months subscription cost, Bethesda would still be making plenty of cash (Atom Store prices sure aren't cheap!)
---
Plus I know the Refrigerator and Junk Collectron are great but why not charge for re-skins instead of charging for the items themselves, keeping just cosmetic stuff in the Atom Store is what they promised, so why can't they stick to it? I'd like an Ammo Converter too, but having to buy one for 1500 Atoms is just going to alienate more players. Where does it stop?
---
I see this a lot. Why doesn't anyone just use the ammo? When i start hoarding a type of ammo i craft or pick up a gun that does. Use it while doing dailies or lower level events. No need to be doing max damage at all times.
---
If we can craft the ammo it could be interesting if there are some auto barrel too.
---
I have come to agree with you in all aspects but one. I will continue to assume people are good and decent and are inclined towards doing good. It's the only way I can stay on this planet and I'm a bit short on travel points these days. :)
---
The never said there wouldn't be a subscription model - on the contrary they said there would be a subscription model for the private servers back in the span of August to October 2018.  The game didn't come out until end of October for Beta.
---
It's very hard to get exact wording since most news sites have updated their original articles and nothing is on wayback, and tweets have since been deleted.
---
Sorry if I seem a bit slow in asking this, but who is Henry Huckum?
---
Never.
---
Invest in better, non-P2W games.
---
Ok thanks, but is a new item released everyday?
---
&gt; I got cheated.
---
That feeling FO76 gives.
---
That's crazy, but I'm gonna try to get it
---
That's great! Thank you!
---
Take over the WS. Nothing says I‚Äôm rich than living in a fancy hotel in the middle of everything. 
---
Everyone wears good clean outfits and fights with walking canes revolvers and when things get rough punch them in the face and duel them in fisticuffs. Or ole time sword duels. 
---
Nothing say I‚Äôm snobby than ‚Äúhave at thee, you rapscallion!‚Äù
---
Now I‚Äôm going to make a post and complain about a dude complaining about a dude about complaining about another dude complaining about some random dude!
---
oyu get 4-5 items from these categories: pumkin grenades, various pumpkin plans, WS centric stuff/plans, normal outfits,  potentially 4 new/unique special outfits, and a vampire vaultboy cutout.
---
there's a few posts with complete rewards lists.
---
Plan drops that rare?
---
Not all SSD's perform the same, give me the exact brand you're using.
---
They can‚Äôt milk money out of a free server.
---
Yeah but I don't get anyone at my camp and I can't sell things T another players camp and I hate dropping ammo it seams wasteful
---
I just don't understand why we can't sell it at a robot vendor
---
The more they get away with, the more they‚Äôll try to get away with. It‚Äôs unfortunate, but nothing can really be done. Suckers are born every minute.
---
As Victoriam Brother
---
They're effectively selling solutions to problems that should have fixed before the base game released, and new ones they're actively creating.  Bad vault performance?   
---
 Trouble with public events loading?  PVP workshop trolling because they closed survival servers?  Not to worry, for $10 a month you can avoid all that hassle!  A shared account-wide stash is probably coming next to really grind in the salt.
---
If they had sold it just as a discounted way to get atoms, with private server instances that don't outperform against public ones, no one would bat an eye.
---
Giving them money for this service encourages them to continue a line of development that doesn't really fix the core problems with the game, and it divides the player base.  I don't want to be a part of that, so I spent my money on new games instead.
---
The question is what are you doing to NOT crash. The servers are unstable for everyone and crashes happen frequently, why act like they're not?
---
Way too many double negatives.
---
Drop em bruh
---
&gt;&gt;Since it was advertised. 
---
Ooh boy that's a good joke.
---
Silence on all the issues and then you comment on a problem with the atom shop? Good way to let everyone know your priorities
---
Imo, it's better to add an ammo station, no exactly like NV but you got the idea. It would break the caps economy if you're able to sell it :/ Maybe it could work if we can pack ammo like we do for junks to sell it.
---
Sounds good to me, similar to Patron from Archeage
---
Most ammo should sell for 1 cap per round in your player vending machine at your CAMP, although missiles and mini nukes rarely sell due to their impracticability
---
On acid are the deniers that the game doesnt crash, that its our consoles/pcs that have the problem.
---
I‚Äôve played countless hrs of RDR2 and crashed once every blue moon, same ps4 pro, different game.
---
And no one is going to convince me fo76 is more demanding than rdr2 graphics wise.
---
And the PR bots are in full force on the downvote button
---
3 attempts, 1 finish for me. 1 crashed halfway through, the other as it completed.
---
I agree, it might not make too much sense given the current state of the world in game, but i REALLY hope thy expand on Order of Mysteries (and the other Unstoppables) with Wastelanders.  I think a faction of people donning the costumes of fictional heroes of past would be a great storyline.
---
Your right there as well but I need caps and I hate it when I head to a vender just to find out I can't sell it and have to drop it
---
Bethesda is trying to get you to buy private servers.
---
Death to the Fallout First!
---
Class waaaaar!
---
Ok, so maybe they said there would be a subscription model for private servers. Now what about the other benefits that come with Fallout 1st? Let's talk about the unlimited storage space for example.
---
Everybody who is defending this crap is doing so by saying "but it's not an *update*". I guess they don't know what the English word *update* means, and instead \* I \* get accused of bending reality to my will. Wow.
---
But it seams wasteful
---
Like anyone gives a shit what other people are "winning" in PvE? How is it affecting you? I can see the grumble about P2W in a PvP environment because it's literally giving you an advantage over another player meaning they can't compete. What's your complaint about PvE? Oh no, this guy in my group is making this content too easy to beat with his epic junk stash?
---
Yeah true
---
Shitty choices or not, you have no right to determine how people spend their own hard earned money, Comrade.
---
I‚Äôve only crashed once last night in adventure mode. Joined my private world and everything the event  worked ok.
---
Was vendor shopping and a cargo bot was cruising around. I decided i needed a keycard. Next thing i know, the vertibots are exploding all over the place and i turn around and the guys camp was demolished with vertibot pieces in it's place. I tried fixing what i could, but then eventually just traveled away when i ran out of mats.
---
How the heck you able to do pp? I keep wanting to do it for the fixer plan but every time it pops nobody in the lobbies join it.
---
You're better off leaving those  nukes and missiles in a brown baggie. Theres no market for them. Not even in game vendors want to purchase them, they serve no purpose. We are able to sell ammo in our personal vendors. All ammo should go for about 1 cap per with the exception of .38. You should place all .38 in the same brown baggie as the missiles and nukes.
---
So they obviously havent put any 1st exclusive sales yet.....
---
REALLY great post buddy. Not pointless at all!
---
I don‚Äôt know how you keep going. With all this blatant silence and already present mistrust between the players and bugthesda, I would have given up ages ago thinking bug reporting was a moot endeavor. 
---
But you didn‚Äôt, and I‚Äôm sure you know that if the game is to get any better, posts like yours can help the devs to fix it. 
---
Thank you for your efforts, even if your reports possibly fall on deaf ears.
---
Bad post op
---
Uh no.
---
The bad programming, buggy features that keep getting reintroduced, and bad decision making of development is more critical than their bad PR.
---

Tbh it‚Äôs mostly because they can. I was an event last night/morning and one guy on mic says ‚Äúyeah dude I‚Äôm hitting for just over 11,000, watch this‚Äù and then walks up and one bangs the poor bot. And then walked away to the train station like an asshat. 
---
It‚Äôs typical to see in any instance of the game. A lot of people are still in that solo player mind and don‚Äôt care if others are trying to get some pie. 
---
What should have been done by BGSA was add in some limited currency like candy corn or WS branded candy that people can collect and trade in for legendary stuff. That way even if you didn‚Äôt get to hit the boss your not screwed over by One Punch over there.
---
No on gives a fuck that you didn't get your 1 star.
---
Its the guy who bought Fallout 1st! GeT hIm!!!! But yea noticed a lot of people getting mad if you even imply you bought Fallout 1st option and rather surprised you got currently 145 karma for this post instead of negative but looks like the wave of hate dying down.
---
Y‚Äôall lucky.
---
In Canada it is $17.99 before tax.
---
Mind you there is the dollar difference and such but I don‚Äôt think it is that much of a difference...
---
Never said I didnt but great strawman dude
---
Why bother fixing them, when they are an incentive to buy a private server to play with MY FRIENDS WHO QUIT PLAYING THIS SHITSHOW OF A CASH-COW YOU HAVE TURNED 76 INTO, TODD
---
Just because one game does this, doesn‚Äôt mean this game should have it.
---
And don't forget to equip the Contractor perk under Intelligence when you're repairing and building your uncontested workshops. Don't want to waste any of that sweet sweet unlimited junk!
---
Bethesda put it in a place that's commonly nuked to drum up more inn fighting between us. That's my conspiracy theory.
---
It's not the scream, it's the adds
---
Idea: let‚Äôs call Halloween a day of peace. And just trick or treat.
---
Your all true I guess thanks for your feedback
---
I got for the last 3 4 days (i don't count) whan fallout first came to exist 2 to 3 disconnects per day.
---
And yeah not enoigh content also the forum all forums ain't 30% of what it wver whas even a certain market redit who still thinks it's more then 30%.
---
And sure you have a good day to. üòå‚ù§
---
How about replying to a fuckton of posts regarding the atrocious state of your Fallout 1st subscription?
---
Imagine still playing this shit game üòÇ
---
Well you know what 
---
I dont believe you
---
Just like you are implying that you don't believe what others are saying
---
"... you are fucking everyone out of the good rewards."
---
That's why
---
I did it 4 times last night and although I never crashed it was pretty laggy, inputs would take forever (i.e. lighting the pyres). I on PC which I guess we can handle more with all the explosions and everything else going on.
---
OK, but  tell me, what exactly are you "overseeing" now?  
---
You and I both know that talking about OW has been the only good moment you had in this sub.  
---
Infact, you actually just did.  
---
Just give it up man. Go do something useful with your life (I'm bein sincere)  
---
Stop backing these backstabbers...
---
They already announced and listed per month of subscription you be given around the amount the plan costs in atoms, if I recall correctly its 1,650 in atoms so great deal if you buy atoms.
---
Zero disconnects, I did rubber band the other night,  but that has happened in wow and. Arma as well
---
I think that's why the majority is pissed. They took out a key factor of balance. Survival should've never been touched.
---
So far this seems to be Xbox only?
---
Wonder why.
---
That actually sounds like a graphical asset may be corrupted in a local file somewhere.  Not that it can't be a game problem, but it's also possible that it's an issue with the file system on whatever it is you're running the game on.
---
its wednesday, ITV's are thursdays
---
Avatar lets chat, I'm here to embarrass you non-sensical idiocy. First stop making claims without evidence, more specifically evidence regarding FO76. He based his claim monthly while you try and deceptively show the highest-paid yearly rate. Should of would of could of, a company exists to make money. What you want and a business plan are two different topics, don't confuse your desires with that of the company. Once again your bottom statement is a stupid rationalization of your own desires. What did they promise wouldn't be behind a paywall (evidence please) and lastly, my game doesn't crash must be either your poor system or you don't even play the game.
---
It's usually posted on Thursdays.
---
Oh thanks, my bad
---
Thanks again.
---
Hey, are you on Xbox by any chance? I am having a lot of performance issues since the patch and am on Xbox One X.
---
Sorry, but no. This game has had far more problems than past Fallout games, and PR/marketing alone can't stop that from angering people.
---
Would there be less, maybe even much less backlash with better PR? Sure. But that in no way means PR is the SOLE problem, as per the OP's post.
---
You can't just act like what's happened with 76 is normal. FO4 had NOWHERE NEAR the amount of issues and that game had barely any PR at all.
---
Pff you just jealous now that if you pvp him you will be crushed by the mountain of scrap stored in his scrap box. Or maybe the private servers to jump into Adventure mode and beat you up or worse crash into you.
---
Haha
---
it's the same base logic behind cheaters and/or rmt. it's not an even playing field. there's no console in this game.
---
people also spend several thousands of dollars to get avatars in mobile games that don't even have multiplayer modes.
---
I do see your point that it would not be exactly in line with how Cyptos was used in the original story, so what about an additional quest added to the Order of Mysteries story line to increase the IA of Cyptos to the level of Grafton Mayor or MODUS? Maybe have a quest to discover the location of an in IA unit been shipped to one of the military/scientific installations right before the bombs dropped, retrieve it, repair it, and install it inside Cyptos?
---
damn that sucks dude.  send us a screenshot so we can help
---
And you 8n this sub is just sad and pathetic.
---
thank you!
---
Had a tree top base built around one of the monorail pylons, several stories up.  
---
Was close to logging off, and another player showed up, was hanging out on a platform that had nothing underneath.

Waved bye-bye.

Me and my wife's camp are next to each others and this low level noob came and started shooting at her camp she chases him off I came out of my door and threw the follow me emote he did indeed follow me on to my house and went straight in to the little room that I have my weapon bench I went a locked every door in my house and watched him shit himself like he was in a panic room ü§™ü§™ü§™
---
This is the actual title you used, dude. 'Solely' is the word you used. If you don't know what that word means, grab a dictionary, because people are responding to what you did in fact write as a pretty ridiculous headline.
---
The couple times that's happened to me a scan + repair from the launcher fixed it.    
---
Sucks, fo76 is a good game and held back from greatness mostly by bugs and a few bad design decisions :(
---
I used to destroy every camp I found back when that was still possible then kill and eat the person when they showed up to defend
---
what did I do to make Bethesda real quiet?
---
&gt; My bet is
---
And that's another thing, you could be absolutely right, but why hasn't Bethesda communicated this? Why would they not make it clear that this is the case?
---
They're grafton riot contorl
---
Yea. Fuck those people who aren‚Äôt writing things you want them to in a public forum.
---
Could you record it cause I‚Äôve done the event 4 times and they all been 1 star.
---
When we talk "overpriced" what defines what is normal price? Do/should we account for in game atom earning? Do they account for that as being a possibility for buying cheaper atom packs to combine with earned atoms? These are the questions people don't ask because it would make too much sense.
---
Beyond the now fixed scrap box what are you speaking of?
---
What type of weapons were you using? Explosives?  I tried solo'ing yesterday and had no idea wtf I was doing... Lol.  Then I actually looked at the map to see where I was supposed to be.   Didn't try the no robot approach. 
---
I'm thinking mines by cars (easy enough to throw) then I have an auto grenade launcher.  That should go pretty quick, then kill the legendary with my railway rifle.
---
In your approach, did you graffit the cabins or just blow cars up?
---
Nah, you're thinking of the bug where it has no legendary stars for a second (or two) and only then it gets its stars. Has nothing to do with the amount of stars it gets.
---
I'd settle for 1/2 the price.
---
I did. I server hoped into e different servers that were nuked after my original attempt lagged out for being in a nuked event. 4  nukes on 4 different servers
---
&gt; Quality Of Life
---
They promised they'd get rid of the shot tagging system and base it on event participation next year.
---
Not gonna say too much, but you sound like an angry child. You see a nuke, don‚Äôt attempt it in that server
---
Or a retarded ape like you could change your gameplay for a week
---
Yeah Same. Did it 6 Times so far and it crashed 3 times. Servers Run Like ass when more than 2 players come together
---
On PC I ran the event 5 times on the same server, always at least 12 people participating, around 20 at the peak, and though there were frame drops and the quest took half a minute to update sometimes I never crashed, so it definitely sounds more like a problem with the code and hardware on console than server stability (though the quest lagging is definitely on the server).
---
I bet I jinxed myself now...
---
Because Bethesda already addressed this issue. It's slated for Q1 2020.
---
overall loading the game when you log in can take a while (more if you have an hdd) i have 3x500gb ssd in raid 0 and it takes more time to load than the average time to load other games . i dont think you cant do anything about it
---
I shot peoples cows at their bases if I see you locked your house/water purifiers.
---
It was pointed out to that Cyptos wasn't directing quests in the Order of Mysteries story line.  So, what about adding an additional quest to the Order of Mysteries story line to increase the IA of Cyptos to the level of Grafton Mayor or MODUS? Maybe have a quest to discover the location of an in IA unit been shipped to one of the military/scientific installations right before the bombs dropped, retrieve it, repair it, and install it inside Cyptos? Then the "Mistresses of Mystery" could be out in Appalachia once again, upholding the virtues of courage, cunning, and compassion.
---
With Bethesda intransparency lately we might never know but what we know is that they won't fix it same as with the Fastnacht masks
---
why did you buy it then?
---
Bull I'll still have 100 bucks extra a year. Lol
---
NAC doesn't have the same ring to it lol
---
It was advertised as a cosmetic pack. You got the cosmetics. Don't really need anything more, especially not a membership.
---
Maybe a month at most, but you're definitely not realistically getting more than that.
---
Maybe its down to the AWS server it runs on and not your PC. I have a similar spec PC but had no problems apart from the frame rate dropping sometimes when near the end (car explosions and a dozen assaultrons firing everywhere). Did it 5 times yesterday without crashing once. But if I go into the Pip-boy, scroll quickly and eat or drink something it CTD's or reboots the PC .
---
It's all the explosions and shooting going on. Also Whitesprings is a very busy area with a lot of objects in it, even more so with the decorations. Meat Week by contrast is much easier since it's out in the Forest, there isn't nearly as much going on an no cars exploding.
---
It's more about the location than anything else. While I'm good in all areas of the map, Whitesprings tends to lag me out. When I first enter the area after it's been nuked I will often freeze up, to the point where I've been killed by ghouls several times while my game is frozen. The same happens during Mischief Night. Turning down graphics settings helps a little bit.
---
Maybe by contacting the support with your tricential key they should give a month. Sounds fair to me. You supported the game at launch, they add the possibility to run private session, you should be able to try it.
---
Also, I did not own this edition, that's just my thoughts
---
Take over Sunshine workshop and make Fancy Lads.
---
Best part when one of the dailes to capture a workshop or be below lvl 20 while at a workshop as they are easy targets and low lvls know no better.
---
You can place your Tent inside a Workshop? Oh, wow.
---
you sound poor
---
Lol bunch of losers.. sounds like they need to maybe take a break from the game and do something with their lives üòÖ
---
But I can put candy in for other Vault Dwellers to take üò≠
---
Just don't buy it?
---
Make it 5 bucks and give out the tent and scrapbox for free
---
Its just a candy bowl? Its pretty much useless other than it looks cool
---
Lmfao you‚Äôre literally getting mad over nothing, it  isn‚Äôt that serious dude.
---
Don‚Äôt kid yourself, at the rate they keep adding new content to the atom shop Bethesda will just abandon the game altogether and make buying skins for cash the main storyline
---
"game altering"?
---
You're calling the candy bowl "game altering"?
---
If you want the same effect just drop some shit on the ground outside your camp before you leave and "tada" you are having the same "game altering" effect of the candy bowl
---
yup, but I just use it as an example to myself...each time I thought about pre-ordering anything since, lol.  Live and learn I guess, they got me on that one.  It won't happen again.
---
Nah he sounds like a responsible adult, not a child with their parents credit card.
---
I did both. I use a junkies explosive prime combat rifle.
---
Good question, console limitation maybe?
---
It's 18-21C in my house right now, with my GPU (and CPU first matter) running about 35-45C, so an "overheating" issue seems very unlikely.
---
As far as the rest:
---
1. I have run the game on a 970 and a 1080 Ti, and suffered far more crashes then, but the game was far less stable at that point, and I don't think I have crash dumps from that period. But, seeing that it was so crashy anyway, and my system is so stable otherwise, it's hard to believe there's something I'm doing wrong. Other than, maybe, playing this game? Literally every other thing indicates my system is fine.
---
2. How old? I've generally used the latest drivers, but I'm pretty sure I've been getting this for--yep, since at least February.
---
3. Yeah, even down to extra HDDs.
---
The 1903 issues were unrelated, and I was on 1803 when this started. Exact same crash since February.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand why you were expecting more.
---
What about the people who got power armor edition? They paid more then the tricentennial edition and got a cheap helmet and bag. See your argument is flawed
---
"F2P players?" Is everyone forgetting this game cost money?
---
Do you have an XBox or an Xbox One? I recently upgraded to a PS4 Pro and it handles frame rates a lot better and crashes less frequently. 
---
I did however get the no respawn bug during an event last night. I was on my lower level alt with no stimpacks and died like 10 times so I'll be doing it on my main from now on.
---
But yeah, there's a lot going on. I really wish Bethesda had developed or used a new engine rather than adapt the FO4 one but what can you do.
---
I'm gonna start leaving stuff on people's beds now. Maybe some gift bags, maybe some prank stuff, maybe even something nasty. You never know
---
You sound like an old asshole that probably dies his hair because you mad youre old. And you are probably divorced
---
ah. a poor adult.  Got it.
---
Thats a perfect idea, Im with you!
---
Oh forgot to mention that, I‚Äôm on PS4. The last big I mentioned with the power armor disappeared with some some of the bigger patches, but I don‚Äôt want to wait that long this time because yeah, I could at least still play with that character, just not in power armor.
---
Its $8.33 a month if you buy it by the year.  Thats nothing
---
Are you praising a game for not disconnecting and only having 2 glitches years after release?
---
I bought the candy bowl and suddenly 700 scrip appeared in my inventory.
---
waaah waah wahh.
---
Thanks! I'm so glad that it is 5 dollars and that I bought all of the Game Altering Stuff just to make that happen! ‚ù§
---
Shills work both ways. Positive reviews for company‚Äôs products AND negative reviews for competitors. So you really should be leery of extremes in both cases.
---
Got mine with in game earnt atoms thank you very much
---
a bag of flaming dog poop?
---
Yeah if you have $100 to spend on a game most wouldn't spend $60 on
---
You are a vocal minority. This sub doesn't represent even 10% of the player base. Stop making assumptions and stating them as fact.   
---
"I'm offended so everyone is" lmao
---
Something like that XD
---
Shouldn‚Äôt you be in class?
---
I was doing the Sheepsquatch event with the cows. It was early on, so several people showed up.  Someone else, not me, one shot the Sheepsquatch. This guy starts screaming and cursing at me while following me around the map. I tried to tell him it wasn‚Äôt me but he kept at it.
---
I was about to just block him and switch servers but I decided to see where his camp was located. Turns out he was close to a fissure site. I lost him, crouched, and fast traveled to his camp. It didn‚Äôt take much to get the Scorchbeast over to the camp. After they had largely trashed it, I bought the cheapest item in vendor so he knew it was me. When he returned, I made heart emotes at him as he came back to look at largely leveled camp. He then proceeded to waste his resources by throwing all his grenades at me while screaming and cussing at me.  At this point, I got bored, blocked him, and switched servers.
---
I feel a little bad for him but he was a belligerent ass. Towards the end, he was threatening enough that I ended up switching screen names a day or two later. There are some real nutters out there.
---
Oh, this is why the salt in my vending machines never sells. People are dishing it out for free.
---
It's a file corruption message... I got this a lot on NMS after some recent updates on old saved games I had. As a PS4 owner, there's not much you can do...  as you have to access the files from previous saves. What I did was just start over and it seemed to work... but that doesn't help you. Just keep checking for updates, maybe restart your PS and hope for the best. Sending the reports may have an impact, I never heard back from anyone at Sony in 6 years of reporting said error messages.
---
Xb1 the commando tree of perks have missing flavor text
---
If you bought that edition you're a dumb ass. Fight me
---
It was new to me :(
---
I would try repairing, then deleting and reinstalling the game to see if that fixes things.  It's possible that if you have a locally corrupted file, one of those would fix it.
---
It's a bit of a chore to do, it's up to you whether or not it's worth the time.  You could also try contacting bethesda for help on their support page, though that may take some time and will almost certainly get you a canned response, but that may give yo other options.
---
Why just the space suit
---
Lest we forget Bethesdas [previous 'discounts'](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6w2m7/the_atom_shops_prices_are_slowly_going_up_and/).
---
Great tip!
---
\*cries in money\*
---
The question was for the BOS paints for power armor, which are random drops from forbidden knowledge.
---
For a $100 a year you would think the Atom Shop items to be free.
---
Perhaps, but there was still another version "higher" than Tricentennial.  Even so, there were already embedded "perks" for the price of either upgraded version (however weak or hard to get).
---
Either way, you got something (like it or not) for your extra dollars.  
---
How does, almost a year later, 'I decided I really didn't like that perk after all...' equate to 'you should gimme something free' ?
---
Work to get a better job.
---
Oh awesome! Thank you for the idea!
---
What do you have to do to earn them?
---
So tripling the rewards to a limited time event is not an advantage, bug or not?
---
people that show up at the last second probably don't get all the cool plans and stuff so ...?
---
Obviously there are damage perks for each weapon type, but there are also some anti-armor perks and 'universal' damage increasing perks as well:  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3313353&amp;d=a04cu2lt2ip2se2pp2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3313353&amp;d=a04cu2lt2ip2se2pp2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=) 
---
These are good for pretty much any build so its a good place to start at least (I'd only put 1 point in tenderizer though).  I don't use bloodied/junkie weapons, but I can still kill things pretty fast with just these perks, some weapon specific damage perks, and a decent legendary.
---
Nelson Muntz: "Gotta nuke something"
---
Well, I can‚Äôt get in with my character t show that pixel bug, because I only get a black screen while loading in... if the game doesn‚Äôt fix itself with a patch i think i have to delete and reinstall it.
---
\*insert the "he called the shit poop!" Billy Madison gif\*
---
What?? Bethesda not fulfilling their promises or that they are advertising?? You‚Äôre wrong that not them! They would never lie, take back promises, or not deliver what‚Äôs advertised!
---
Todd, stop using reddit for ideas, thanks.
---
You mean they'll charge for a less laggy server upgrade
---
My 3rd character hasn't been had any paint plan drops yet :(
---
Innocent ignorance, naivety and just being oblivious i can put up with .... selfishness and a lack of manners, not so much.
---
You should be ashamed of yourselves for giving Bethesda money.
---
That's great, it should be free like the punch bowl
---
Imagine still being on this sub after quitting :)
---
I bought the tricentennial Edition the day after it was released so it would qualify for Best Buys gamer Club 20% off.  I.e it cost me $64 instead of $80, I got some skins I'll probably never use oh, and 500 atoms. 
---
 That's fine.
---
13 items/hour
---
Yep. I've keyed my mic and said "hey come here and shoot this legendary". Still run around shooting other stuff. I will only wait so long.
---
yes
---
You can just buy the robot in the Atom Shop. No need for 1st.
---
What are you telling me this 4? Nit related to the post
---
Start again today and get into vault raids
---
So because OP doesn't want to spend their hard earned $$ on stupidly priced items that makes them poor? You sound like an ignorant 1st member.
---
Wow 16 clueless little punks that have never heard of a slippery slope. That's actually pretty surprising.
---
Yeah I will see what I can do. The whole reinstalling thing is indeed time consuming, considering my not so fast internet here. For now I‚Äôm playing with my second main, checking the corrupted character here and there to see if I still can‚Äôt get in and if that‚Äôs the case till the event is over, I‚Äôm gonna delete the game and reinstall it. Thanks for the tips, really appreciate it!
---
Private servers aren't new fresh servers. 
---
From my understanding, they're just old servers others have logged off on. People are logging into them for the first time and finding lots of the items/spawns/etc already tapped.
---
Not what this is about. Saying maybe make it every 30 because it keeps crashing. Please read before posting
---
Can't get these moments in any other game.
---
I've accidentally done that AFTER I called them over so they could get a hit but before they could.  Oops.
---
See if this works for you. Worked for my friend and I.

---
serious 500 atoms is not much... and Scrapbot is awesome and worth every atom. no regrets
---
I didn't said anything about praising the game. But why is bad that I saw 2 bugs and had 0 disconnects a year after release. No game is perfect or have 0 bugs.
---
I will have a look at this when I play next.
---
What's rubber band? Btw wow classic? I heard that the game is cool.
---
Booooooooooo!
---
I'll give that a go when I hop back on later tonight. Hope it helps. Thanks!
---
Pecus Inculta
---
you get 1 each of an item from these categories: stimpack/radx, pumpkin grenades, various pumpkin plans, WS centric stuff/plans, normal outfits, potentially 4 new/unique special outfits, and/or a vampire vaultboy cutout. for a total of 4-5 items
---
hit the boss at the end and get legendary (armor or weapon)
---
THere are also some legendaries scattered about the ghouls - it is WS, afterall :)
---
Talk about a bloody mess
---
Crashed 2 out of 2 times last night.  Both times all the way back to the xbox live start screen.  Didn't want to launch the game for a 3rd time so I stopped trying the event.
---
Where the hell are you getting this "triple the rewards" from? You're just pulling that out your ass. 
---
The event runs every hour for one week.
---
The number of events during that time is 168. Now most people need to eat sleep and work and will never come close to that number.
---
I play, on average, 2-3 hours per night. That means I'll get 14-21 chances at the event. Say I hop to my private server every time the event is done, oh boy I get up to 42 chances to run the event!
---
How about someone who plays 4-8 hours per day but doesn't server hop?
---
They get between 28-56 chances! Do I still have an advantage?
---
And that's totally ignoring the fact, as you still are doing, that ANYONE CAN SERVER HOP AND DO THE EVENT AGAIN.
---
Mischief happens every hour on the hour. 
---
If you leave an instance, it may happen ever :30 of every hour. 
---
Like 1:30 - 2:30 
---
But it's normally 1 - 2
---
Quite related to the post.
---
That rhymed
---
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of West Virginia the sons of former slaves to Bethesda and the sons of fallout 1st owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
---
I took the ammunition depot from some low levels right before they could claim it. They did all the hard work clearing out the place, I just swooped in and claimed the workshop before they could. I could almost feel their disappointment through the monitor. I felt bad, but I also really needed .308
---
Don't believe me then but why would I lie?
---
And yes I believe when someone says to me that he has bugs because when I play with friends they have bugs and they tell me that they have bugs and I believe them
---
Gamepass ultimate - over 150 titles with easy 10-15 being great games. Works on windows as well, comes with xbox live -$14.99 per month. 
---
Netflix- thousands of tv shows and movies at your fingertips- one account streams on 5 devices- $8.99 per month. (Add hulu in there too as example) 
---
Fallout first- an outfit. Some emotes. 1650 atoms. Private servers that arent private or new. And a stash box for the tab of items that weighs the least. All for a game thats still largely broken and still not being fixed. $12.99 per month. 
---
Can you see why people are pissed? I can.
---
I feel that, but NAR is worse
---
I expect at least someone to say, buy fallout 76 or fallout 1st
---
I‚Äôve had dudes threaten to nuke my camp before but I just laughed. Who wouldn‚Äôt just log when they get the PSA?
---
Cool, thanks for all the info man!
---
That's fair haha
---
Yes, you can.
---
Obvious shill.
---
Can someone plz explain how people are "hunting" u in a game with little to no pvp? The pvp that is there is totally optional. I'm not quite understanding.
---
Public events = No cost. 
---
Regular events cost. It isn't Fallout 1st exclusive. It has been a feature before 1st. Yikes.
---
No its not
---
They‚Äôre on nukacrypt.com already!
---
Maybe it‚Äôs more about what the game actually has to offer. Jeez
---
So do I.... doesnt mean we should support them going back on their word and adding in non cosmetics to the shop.
---
Running and forward suddenly refreshing behind you
---
I didnt pay for shit, i get atoms from the challenges. Not my fault your broke ass cant manage atoms or buy more
---
I'm pretty sure they can blame Bethesda for the dog shit engine they had to work around and learn. The bugs mostly come from that since the engine doesn't play well with itself...
---
I waited until I saw he was distracted doing events.
---
No, you can't. Only other game I can think of is Minecraft.
---
Hahahahaha
---
I can‚Äôt see what your getting pissed off over. I found this and laid it out, I said I didn‚Äôt test it. I say tripling the rewards because my friends managed to pull the event up three times and probably could‚Äôve kept going. If you server hopping public events you‚Äôll be joining near the end and the best and at worst the event already ended, with this the event isn‚Äôt even started and it gets reset. Do you understand now or are you going to make me type this for a third time?
---
 It will be the same. The area will scale to your level. The high level areas have minimums.
---
That happens me a lot on rainbow six siege, and well also on fallout 76 but just when the landscape is loading
---
I've sat there and let it be untouched. Never changed. Wonder if a specific platform is allowing this.
---
Ahh another ignorant little kid with his moms credit card
---
Are you aware that if you run or jump through it at sprint speed it doesn‚Äôt usually affect you? Something I discovered a while back since I‚Äôm also a bloodied/unyielding build
---
&gt;I hate how Fallout 1st has created two tiers of player, and it absolutely has. I just didn't want to be in the tier that didn't have these advantages, especially now that I've seen the difference it makes.
---
How fucking brittle does your backbone have to be to realize that the system is morally wrong and the design is terrible for the game's health and yet you *still* plunk down $100 to encourage further erosion of the game you claim to love.
---
Five bucks and what you just posted isn't even gonna get you a footlong at Subways. All that matters is where you spend your money, and you chose to spend it on this game's continued decline. So, good job, I guess?
---
Of course. Also you do not get the armor. You get the plans for a piece of armor. You get vault steel for crafting it, 2 from novice, 4 standerd, 6 expert. Power armour take 27 steel n normal armor takes 10 (with perks on)
---
It‚Äôs true but that would be paying almost double the games value and assuming it will continue to be good enough to keep you engaged for a year
---
Not sure about it releasing daily, but I do know that it can be earned across multiple matches
---
I have done 12 and received my rewards 12 times.  I have frozen twice (due to explosions) and just stayed on until the rewards were doled out.  I do the following to improve my chances of not crashing
---
1.  Log out then back in close to the event starting.  Any time I have crashed/frozen I was playing a good bit, then went to the event.
---
2. Stay away from larger groups of players, I have a set path I follow from bonfires, to trick or treat bowls while destroying every robot in the way.
---
3. Avoid causing explosions yourself, the two times I have frozen - The first was getting the final hit on the sentry bot and standing close enough to get hit by the explosion, the second he exploded I permanently froze (I could hear other players and waited until rewards were given out before closing the game).  The second was right in the beginning, and every car went off at the same time I blew up 2 more.
---
4. Try not to use explosive weapons - this just adds to the problem of the game having to keep track of all the cars, robots, ghouls and now explosive rounds.  Just use your strongest non explosive gun, I use an auto laser rifle to tag everything without Insta killing to share the exp and loot.
---
I learned most of this from faschnaut and how to improve my stability.  This may not work for everyone but I hope it helps anyone having this problem.
---
TV settings, if you have a setting called ‚ÄúGame Mode‚Äù which many now do that helped considerably instead of same settings you watch movies in.
---
what's the benefit.

Wow a clueless OP not understanding that saying something is a "Slippery slope" is a logical fallacy. Just makes you look like someone who wants to be mad. Go ahead, be mad, just don't be surprised when people call you out for being aggressive toward people who have done nothing to you.
---
Yes and it blocks the camp of anyone loading in too if they conflict which is really annoying when people drop that tent at popular camp locations.
---
Brahh i just said i dont pay for shit üòÇ
---
Why would i spend money to look better
---
Free fast travel point
---
Ok thank you
---
What about the players that spent $200 for the PA Edition? Asking another hundred out of them? Oof.
---
Private works as public, same rules :) The difficulty scales according to your level.
---
Are these posts legitimate or a PR attempt post F1st fallout? It seems suspicious that people would post about seemingly trivial in game experiences as if they‚Äôre significant emotional life events.
---
It is if you complete some challenges to get 500 easy atoms for free by playing some of the content
---
Take that down. It doesn't fit the narrative of idiots who know nothing about the lore trying to act like they know the lore.

Looks like Far Harbor to me, but he has some vegetation mods on like:

Yeah I know we‚Äôll get atom shop items for Christmas &amp; NY I just want another event so I‚Äôm not waiting from November 5th to March 2020 for new content. :-/
---
It‚Äôs worth more than $12.99 with what it‚Äôs offering. For what it‚Äôs worth this is a good deal for what you get in return.
---
Average pvp experience
---
Gotta add unyielding Armor to that for the full Monty üëç
---
I paid more than that per month for other online games AND had to pay for DLC to boot.
---
I'd give you gold if I could xD
---
Exactly, why encourage those who don't want pvp to join a pvp server. This just caused people to get upset that then led to damage nerfs and boom empty servers. Extra caps and xp on player kills would be enough.
---
When I tried it someone got the bright idea of nuking whitesprings. As if Whitesprings wasn‚Äôt laggy enough on console. The server almost crashed.
---
Just uninstall the game and leave, you'll be happier in the long run it seems.
---
yes we can.
---
Weapon/armor skins, a few halloween camp items, and a glowing skeleton outfit.
---
For real, fuck this game. How people still bent over backwards to get fucked by Bethesda is beyond me. So many great games out there and y'all choose for this broken buggy cash grab shell of a Fallout game smh.
---
I'd pay for that!
---
PH told a few misleading lies during the pre-release hype stage... in his position and at the time, what he was saying about cosmetics being the "only" thing to cost more money, was a lie PERIOD. He even reiterated that talking point in various articles, mentioning "a line they (Bethesda) would never cross". He either intentionally lied or unknowingly said what he said, in the latter case he shouldn't be vice president/in charge of public relations and marketing. The reaction is on him and no one else. I wouldn't choose to say nasty things except the truth, he's a liar.
---
I was really hoping this would be the solution to the horrible Nuclear Winter hitching but I was already at 720p  üò≠
---
Ok thanks! I dunno why people are downvoting but thanks for the answer
---
You do know you can get the atoms for the scrap bot in  like a week of in game atom achievement. It is pretty cheap compared to skins n such
---
Earn XP.
---
Ahhh. I see. Do you need that stuff you buy from the purveyor for the armor set? I forget what she sells exactly but I thought it was for the raids
---
Your post is praising it. That's the point of the post... to say it is t bad, therefore, praising it...for being playable
---
üßÇ
---
Aha, so you were using that trick before. Lol why didn't you share it with everyone complaining about lag?
---
Even in NW now, I am getting a lot less stutter at 1080P than 4K UHD. Will be trying 720P next, because stutter still exists.
---
Spoiler? Tag should say SALTY...
---
You lose the tent but the rest is correct.
---
I'm just saying that I didn't had disconnects and I only had 2 bugs.
---
They did a power armor update that removed the individual pieces from the chassis at one point.
---
Okay thanks
---
Oh, well dont need that.
---
Legendary modals, and yes you need 1 for each piece you craft
---
Last night I got home from work and joined the 6pm event on PC. It got double nuked including destroying my camp by the El Camino billboard in the hills to the northeast of Whitesprings.
---
In my experience you get better stuff by setting it to Scrap vs Junk as well.
---
Yeah but why?
---
Lol the krill mobs out I see
---
Ok, but this is never happened to me so far. Server hop
---
Usually a profitable endeavor so I get why from a business sense. One person will spend more money in a week than 500 people will spend on just buying the game. From a gaming perspective, they've sold their soul.
---
Lol it‚Äôs the krill army don‚Äôt even argue with this shrimp &amp; his tiny online attitude downvoting like anyone caresüòÇüòÇ
---
Okay than i have to Play NW and Hope that i compled some quests
---
Why? Well because I wanted to know if anyone is in my same situation.
---
Sorry if it doesn't seems like it
---
I have 1st and haven‚Äôt even placed it in the private server... also haven‚Äôt placed the scrapbox since I manage my storages since the 400 max days...lol
---
So you're saying in no other game can you be left a gift at your base or place where you are? Okay, I'll help
---
Rust
---
7 days to die
---
DayZ
---
And those are just a few off the top of my head where the exact same experience can happen. A random person leaves you free loot.
---
Yes and it's very usefull
---
Cool, I‚Äôll keep this all in mind. I want the actual armor so hopefully that‚Äôs what I get. I don‚Äôt use PA at all besides flux farming tbh
---
excactly.
---
It does say "some" sweet items. So maybe like ESO there'll be 1st exclusive items or some new items with two price tags
---
Lol theres no rant flair
---
Yes. That is how they work
---
Where are the Halloween NW rewards? They aren‚Äôt showing up on the rewards bar..
---
they have even stated that you will have the scrap box if you put it down, however... while you will be able to pull from it you can NOT put stuff in it.
---
&gt; tiny brained imbecils
---
imbeciles*
---
Only reason why my friends and I bought the edition was for the codes to share for the BETA to give to others we knew.
---
Speaking positive stuff about the game? Clearly a paid Bethesda shill
---
No I enjoy the game, I just hate to see it deteriorate. I'm ashamed you all dont see the same thing I do.

don't get star-struck yet.  While the outer worlds is 'a good game' i would hardly call it phenomenal or outstanding or anything - we are just too used to Bethesda's trainwreak  to really have a balanced opinion on the matter.  Even Aliens Colonial Marines is better than Fallout 76 at this point and that game was also terrible.
---
This would have saved them a lot of trouble
---
It sounds like you're mocking people who don't like Fallout 1st while praising the game for meeting a bare minimum standard. It also sounds like you're not old enough to even understand why people are upset about Fallout 1st because you weren't around for games before DLC or console games having subscription services so you have no base to judge it off of. I imagine 86% of the ones defending FO1st are under 18.
---
There should be... TBF... I think some would use it. Or should I say they should use it...lol
---
Lets all start doing this
---
No, it should be 60$, you know, the price you paid for the base game ?
---
&gt; Not all people. Just anyone who has unreasonable and unrealistic expectations.
---
Not everyone, just people I disagree with!
---
Classic.
---
It might be awhile to get a full set of plans, it's all rng. You have a 33.3% chance to get a plan from each set, there's 3 sets. So 100% chance u till you get a full set, then it goes down by 33.3% each set you complete
---
To be far ever since the game was announced there have been post like this little small experiences people like to post
---
Doing an event and a player accidentally engaged me in PVP. I needed to complete the PVP Xbox Achievement so I killed him at a strategic time.
---
Limb damage is probably the most desired effect. Would say 120,000.
---
How many of the three was a correct about?
---
Nice, too bad the fedora doesn't count as a costume piece
---
Makes sense to me. The atom buy is a skin not a loophole
---
How much do vampiric weapons heal? I'm curious because I've heard of people using vampiric weapons but I don't know how effective it is. Is it her shot or per damage? Like if I used a vampiric missile launcher vs a vampiric sub how would that vary?
---
I‚Äôm not allowed to forget, every time I contemplate it, my wife reminds me that I bought the Power Armour Edition
---
I'm all for calling it as it is
---
Never noticed lol
---
Correct.
---
Definitely. Scrap doesn't include things like ballistic fiber like Junk does. The only drawback is that it fills faster so you have to remember to empty it more often.
---
Read the stats. Heated adds more energy damage.
---
I wish someone nuked it the 2 times I‚Äôve done it... hardly any ghouls both times and I need some high radiation fluids!
---
This is less of a fallout 76 issue and more of a playstation issue.
---
Getting quite a few down votes. I'm new to Reddit should I have put this post elsewhere?
---
Always worked this way.
---
I bought a backpack from the store before completing the quest. That's how I leaned lol.
---
They clearly weren‚Äôt around for the Punch Bowl.. good times.. if I could remember them *hic*
---
Uh, no. GG.
---
Its worse less players on the map to spawn enemies feels like all the enemies spawn near you randomly
---
As sad as it is, I can't help but wonder if each of these posts are that now. I let myself believe they are legitimate, but it is still nagging at me in the back of my mind
---
Ha, good call
---
It's not particularly worth it AND simultaneously prevents extra rewards from wearing costumes. Its 10% more/better chance for wearing a costume.
---
Yeah I'm just seeing people A: acting like not wanting fO1st makes them "want free stuff" and now I'm literally seeing people saying people that paid for the game are F2P players and I'm like, "the hell is going on?"
---
Agreed. Everything in this sub should be purchasable with Atoms or included for free to subscribers. 
---
I still want just a private server option. Don't really care about anything else other than the outfit.
---
They literally both have the same listed energy damage, though
---
People got this all wrong. It was already looted because whenever you hop into a new server, any stuff you've previously looted is gone
---
How many people bought a private server for this reason? Why would they fix it they'll lose subscribers.
---
Worse you don‚Äôt even get a pattern every run. I‚Äôm at about 3/6 right now. Pretty much never gonna get all the buildables. My free time is limited and just finding a server that isn‚Äôt already completed takes a half hour. Not worth leaving a server that isn‚Äôt. At this rate I‚Äôll probably get half at best and a bunch of duplicates.
---
You saw what it came with and made the decision to buy it..
---
Even if they offered it now, it would look like a knee-jerk reaction to the backlash.  It would probably not go over well.
---
Plus, now they've diluted the need/desire for their premium package, though honestly I'd say since they got those things for free, the benefit is still there, it's just less 'exclusive'.  But if people get butt hurt about losing exclusivity, I'm going to have a hard time feeling sorry for them.
---
Not doing it outta curiosity. doing it for the lolz
---
Does the Heated on say it had Extra Flame jets in the mods? That means extra damage.
---
Quit playing this game. It contributes to the predatory practices of microtrans and bullshit subscriptions.
---
Large whopper meal in NYC $15. What is your point?
---
I don't have fallout 1st and I don't think it's a good idea, I said the fallout 1st thing because normally I see people complaining about the game bugs and for no reason including fallout 1st on the theme.
---
I was around games even before microtransactions or games that comes on parts by DLC.
---
Why would I mock people who don't agree with the fallout first subscription, obviously you can have your opinion, but don't take it to an extreme.
---
Ironically it would be kinda funny seeing all those that complained about it then getting it...lol
---
Thanks for gathering all of this, as per. Keep up the good work, please.
---
If you mean people that expect better from games then yes.
---
Or don't give them another penny and go play games from developers that aren't shady pieces of ass
---
Someone did it last time I tried. So I hopped on a private server without jerks and did it that way. Less laggy too.
---
You're acting like the skyrim devs made 76. That's bullshit and utterly asinine. They specifically made a new team for 76
---
Perfect.
---
Look at the map then look at the players tell you find somone with the fallout 1st logo. Now you hunt
---
Lucky you. I used to be around WS station and was frequently blocked by someone who dropped their tent outside the station instead of somewhere more sensible.
---
True. But gotta be in that Halloween spirit of Tricks and Treats lol.
---
I tried them both with the extra jets mod, and they were the same, then when I took the mod off them both they were still the same
---
Did ypu restart your game?
---
Obsidian Shill account
---
You pay to have access to "private" servers, "free" atoms, "free" premium items (like the one mentioned above), exclusive sales, and some other garbage.  
---
It still is a good deal for those willing to pay, but doesn't make it annoying to everyone else that don't have the money or will to pay subscriptions.
---
The game must be glitched and not displaying correctly. It just is what it is.
---
Multiple games. 1 challenge is added each day. You don‚Äôt need to unlock it on the day it is added. Have until Nov 12 to get them all
---
2 guys came to kill me I had a workshop my base was nearby they contested the workshop I let them have it they were to high level but my base was also near by so they decided to destroy my base this was when you could do that at will so they got wanted and another even more op guy came and killed them both but he got really hurt in the battle very little hp left so I killed him I guess he got wanted in the battle some kinda way maybe shot my base not sure but all 3 were dead I looted all 3 players bags and left the sever with tons of loot.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt of bought it in the first place
---
That‚Äôs odd. Most BA companies can be found only on specific sites that are used for that. That or word of mouth. You definitely got hired by some shady company. Brand ambassadors dont do stuff like that. They represent the brand at events/stores etc. super unlucky lol
---
New challenge is added every day
---
This was well planned out. The event can be done on private servers, so by making it harder to do on public, they are encouraging sales.
---
Got it.  Now have you tagged with 'Hurts people for lolz'.
---
There‚Äôs also today‚Äôs ESO+ bare the lootcrates(that are still more cosmetic than the atom store) which should be the bare minimum for what F1st could‚Äôve.. should‚Äôve? been and that‚Äôs what, $1 less as well?
---
Nope, but there are ingame costumes for mischief night.
---
I can‚Äôt think of a single MMO I‚Äôve played where I ‚Äúbeat the game‚Äù (final boss quest) before I was max level. 
---
That‚Äôs pretty much the same here. You probably need to be 50+ to do the silos/SBQ.
---
I see. Yeah that must be it
---
I kept having similar problems ‚Ä¶ all the kabooms, and the explosive shotgun superleap bros, bring everything o an absolute crawl.
---
Luckily, you can join the event, then just idle in place and they explosive guys will generally complete it for you.
---
That said, my last run an hour ago? NOBODY ELSE SHOWED UP for about ten minutes. I was able to walk around, light the bonfires, paint the grafitti, do all the STUFF and it was awesome! Annnnd then the last stage happened, death robots came out of nowhere, and both of us died repeatedly until time ran out and the event failed.
---
D'h.
---
Sorry new to reddit dont know how to properly do tags and shit. Still learning.
---
Wouldn't surprise me, there's def a reason it's fallout "1st"
---
Hopefully it gets sorted out and good luck!
---
Are you joking? I do like limb damage.
---
I‚Äôd follow what currently exists in ESO since the 1st subscription models the ESO plus subscription. 
---
Camp size I don‚Äôt see getting bigger however I could see the items value reduction against the budget on certain items.
---
Imagine having nothing better to do than go around telling people they are wrong for playing the way they want too
---
Alright, how much are they paying you?
---
16 less people and no one hopping world is a huge improvement overall... like night and day.
---
So we cannot comment if it's been more than 2 days....?
---
Your name is literally VaginaFishSmell. No I mean the krill army that‚Äôs been lurking for a year waiting for a big PR issue to flood in &amp; mass downvote positivity &amp; just post all these bullshit whiney posts :-)
---
They want real money. If they'd make it 4000 atoms, so people can't get it with atom challenges, people would complain (at least) just the same.
---
Mine crash on Xbox
---
Too! üòñ
---
If it were part of the initial offering with the 1st thing came out, I'd have had a much softer opinion of the whole thing.  But now it will just look like they're fumbling to save face.
---
It *IS* a better way to generate revenue than what they're doing now, and I'm not at all opposed to it.  It would still refresh a little of the good will they've lost for me, but it will still look bad at this point.
---
Just goes to show you how little rational thought went into this whole process.
---
correct there.  The game was advertised as "free forever" type structure with "DLC and patches being free" and the shop being "cosmetic items only" to pay the bills.  This was the advertising, this was the plan.
---
they seemed to fail to realize that overpricing your shop doesn't drive sales up - in fact it drives them down, and instead of correcting this issue with 1/4 the price oaf items (which I can state if they did make them 1/4 the current prices, I would spend so many atoms instantly, and I am not alone) they have instead gone to a new model of gameplay - the subscription.
---
it's not law breaking in this regards though.  it sucks for us, but they "can" change a model after time has passed. I just think they are going about it the wrong way at the wrong time.
---
Step 1: Repair the damages done, get some good will back.  Fix broken aspects of game, be transparent with what is coming with "Wastelanders" and other "DLCs" so we know what is "being worked on" and what needs more attention. (like, weapon balance, condition losses, glitches, etc)  Even if it can't be completed "now" letting us know "we are reworking it, here is the new plan" will go a long way.
---
Step 2: cut the bloody atomic shop prices down. 1/2 or some items even 1/4 current prices (pre sales) is more on the line what people were thinking of when you said "cosmetic only" items.  We think weapon skins, paint jobs etc. for like $2 - not $20.  Especially if it's something simple as a recolor. (The Sims editors have been doing it for just about 20 years now) 
---
Step 3: More content. There is basically nothing to do in this game.  For a game advertised as "go anywhere, do anything, be whoever you want" you sure left out parts of the game that make that important.  At the current time we can Server Hop for Caps, Legendary Spawns to try to get RNG gear to RNG the effect we want to RNG the item we want with RNG if it is even usable to us, or Grind Levels endlessly for no real reason.  We can't build anything that stays, or helps, or promotes teamwork or anything on that line.  There is no permanency and we need it.
---
I know we "groundhog day" based on server time or play time  (log in, its reclaimation day, time passes faster than in real life so you can make it weeks further if you stay on, but once your off, it resets)  but we really need some events or story or something to occur- more often. (Wastelanders has stated "the return of NPCs" and depending how you read that it could be that they are arriving, instead of just being Ret-Conned in to the game changing the mechanics for us Year 1 players)
---
Step 4: now that your reputation is better, you have more content, and have fixed game issues - look at the sales.  IF you are in dire need of cash - NOW is the time to release a subscription or battle pass type system.
---
In game, the community is awesome.  This really is what I wanted; "Fallout with Friends".
---
On Reddit though... Thats another story.
---
Sorry thought my sarcasm was obvious haha. Limb damage has its place for sure. Usually don‚Äôt see it selling for much though.
---
There's actually a dupe method that involves the scrip machines. I won't go into too much detail, lest I get myself banned from this subreddit, but what you're experiencing may be a result of the latency this method uses and exploits.
---
Judging a few bad decisions? Its more like recognizing a pattern.
---
I also wear a space suit the whole time. So I guess I‚Äôm just excited to see ‚Äúone of my own‚Äù.
---
Will be on tonight. PapaD0c510, hit me up.
---
Because my username is relevant in any way to the discussion? Sit down little one adults are speaking
---
next time try one shot every mob and compare that "uranium exctrated meter" to those runs where every legendary is alive longer. 
---
when soloing uranium fever there are less mobs and they are insta killed at spawn point so that reward meter fills like 95%
---
end rewards are tied to that meter so sharing those legendaries gives everybody more those 35-40lvl legendaries but ensures that no one gets rare plans
---
I can't believe it took over half an hour to get a like and response!
---
30k now
---
vroom vroom.  shake and bake.  Ricky Bobby, I want to go fast.
---
Went ahead and googled it and it would seem that you guys in Australia make almost 20$ an hour minimum wage, so 22$ isn't that bad compared to the US at 7.25$ minimum wage for a 13$ sub. People still pay more for a WoW sub and buy the expansions at an overpriced rate and receive only access to the game. (Just see a lot of Australians complaining about this) Wherever you are, be it US or any other country, if paying for an *online* game frustrates you then..
---
I'm really confused why people are crying over a sub that will keep paying for server equipment, data usage, and employees to deal with these people; concerning really. Seems perfectly viable for a game you enjoy to play *online.* If all you want is Fallout, go back to one of the many series before this. Buy it at a lower price and not pay for online play because that's what you should get and deserve.  
---
I would pay monthly for any game *online* that I truly enjoyed if it meant it was good for the company. Because ultimately, you want the company to stay in business so you can continue to play it.. *online.*
---
You pay for the development of the game initially and then you pay to play on their servers (on the line) after that in order to maintain the servers. It's not hard people.
---
I left raw fertilizer and toilet paper on someone‚Äôs bed in their camp awhile back. I couldn‚Äôt stop giggling kinda hoping I‚Äôd get caught lol.
---
Because I haven‚Äôt crashed in months?
---
If it's what I think it is, your skeleton is separated from your character model and is getting in the way of your vision when  crouching. When this happened to me I straight up blew myself up with grenades and respawned with it fixed
---
Seriously? Jeeze. I haven‚Äôt been having issues. Maybe I‚Äôm just lucky.
---
I heard a weird experience last night where there was like a residual nuked effect. As in there wasn‚Äôt an actual nuked zone but plenty of flora and hoards of bloated glowing ones. Made for a hectic, but crazy fun Mischief Night. Had a blast.
---
atoms are also bought with real money. No one forced you to earn them in game ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
What pattern? when did Bethesda apart from fallout 76, launched a microtransaction system (that isn't the creator club), made a subscription (ESO+ doesn't count 'cause zenimax made the game not Bethesda) and when did Bethesda launched a game that needed DLC's for fixing itself (updates doesn't count)?
---
That's a better option for you, not for them. They want a steady revenue stream, not a revenue stream that spikes and then dips.
---
That's beside the philosophical question into why people think they are entitled to tell Bethesda what to do.
---
Yeah i let a few randoms in my server and they did this damn dupe i kicked them out
---
So you're happy someone dropped their guts at your camp? As gross as it sounds it is funny. Although it may mean something different to you but in UK it's a fart
---
&gt; the whole point of the Atom Shop is to generate revenue to support the continued development of the game, it's just basic business.
---
but what about Fallout 1st then??? What about selling the game for a premium price? What about all that money?
---
Lmao you had to google slippery slope. Nice one kid. Then you went on to regurgitate logical fallacy without knowing what it means. Bethesda selling game altering items by principle is a slippery slope. First we had a stat buff, then convenience items like the scrap and repair kits, then we get fridges, the all mighty scrap bot, a stash box we can put anywhere. Now I know half the bigots that read this will go " aghhhh herdurrdurrr this idiot thinks the scrap bot is a game breaking pay to win mechanic, shut up already." I'm not I'm explaining how tiny p2w mechanics can grow into something worse like paying for bundles of scrap or buying legendaries. So please kid, get a clue.
---
I have an even bigger question - why on earth would you buy it in the first place
---
Damn. All ive had was level 200 come destroy my camp for no reason and call me a scrub
---
Congrats, youve been honey dicked by AAA game companies to the point where you believe PRIVATE SERVERS for $100 a year is okay. Oooh I love being in a server alooooone, its so much better and faster. Loading into a game by yourself has been a thing for as long as gaming has been a thing. Game sucks with bugs they still havent fixed, the fact that you still decide to give money to those people shows that youre more of guy who likes to be a contrarian than an actual gamer.
---
I know. Doesn't need an answer to get fixed, just needs to be read/seen. ;)
---
Wasn't it released on Oct 23? So 18th sounds somehow unrealistic imo
---
Okay fair
---
Yeah I was in one, my robot lagged out for about 3 minutes and then we couldn't light the pyre
---
created a map of ash heap locked crates - [https://i.imgur.com/M1tXjP6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/M1tXjP6.jpg)
---
Eh, mostly people here are pretty good.  There's always trolls that come out whenever there's an opportunity to act like an idiot, but you kinda have to expect that whenever there's anything controversial.
---
It shows best when things are quiet, and they have to *really* stretch to come up with things to be trolly about.  Lately, it's been easy with the whole firsters thing, not hard to push people's buttons when something like that is going on.
---
This is my exact situation o\_o
---
I was so happy to see they were selling a glasses pack and then really disappointed they were all gag ones....give me some more cat eyes and everyday styles!! :(
---
I think that's technically the best, but right now I'm more a fan of Power Armor.  Currently grinding for the Strangler Heart set.
---
Xbox can handle it fine, it's the gamebryo engine
---
No pa skins count unfortunately, but I believe you can take of your helmet n put on a mask and it counts
---
I had a level 300 come and throwing nuke mines at us in passive mode but that was it
---
You could leave a flip lighter and toilet paper.
---
No I‚Äôm saying how are you guys still seeing it, I though there would‚Äôve been more posts by now
---
I'd rather have a tent there than another camp with overprized stuff.
---
Lol, nice one. You‚Äôve got me. Unfortunately only children whine so that‚Äôs all on you guys :-)
---
The thing anyone whos ever paid for a free to play game could tell you.
---
I certainly hope you've let BGS know what you know about the situation.  I don't have much faith in them to keep up with all that.
---
No one cares
---
This is a super old trick. People have been doing this for ages. Works for all consoles that allow it, at least as far as I know.
---
I have been doing it for Foetnite since StW.
---
You are lowering the resolution, meaning less processing power required. It only seems to work for poorly optimized games.
---
Not big on classism in this game, especially since the divide is about as artificial as the current good-will. People won‚Äôt buy it, okay good on them and those who do have more than likely bought it for one of three reasons..
---
1.) NCR Ranger outfit
---
2.) Manageable privacy/better storage management/server stability
---
3.) all of the above
---
Everyone involved gets a personal win whether they bought it or not but harassing those who did over the fact is more than likely going to incentivise them to keep supporting it out of spite or to genuinely make a point
---
I got a good laugh out of the Mr. Fuzzy ride and fog machine.
---
Ah so you also partake in such role-play. I see I'll try to be more sensitive about others like that
---
Thanks again Aten. 
---
Both the community and Beth need this good work with the diligence you bring.
---
This isnt even about Fallout 1st at this point.  You literally made up a list of things to get yourself riled up about.  Why would you even do that to yourself?  Smh
---
I‚Äôve done this multiple times bc I‚Äôm achievement hunting and I generally don‚Äôt come across people super frequently unless it‚Äôs events but, I always go after low level players with bounties. When I was low level and figuring out the game I would get minor bounties too and had high level people show up just to kill me so I know how it feels but I need to kill like 15 more players to get the achievement.
---
What cache do you mean, and where is it?
---
Yay, I‚Äôm glad!
---
I know these posts are meant to be echo chambers on both sides, and no minds are going to be changed from either viewpoint... But if you want an offline fallout experience, why would you buy an online fallout and then pay extra to turn it into an offline fallout? 
---
I feel like it would be better for you to just play fallout 4 instead of an offline fallout 76.
---
Can confirm, this works!
---
I feel bad for you f
---
Says the one deflecting the conversation away from these predatory practices.
---
Would love to get that, but my lack of a steady team makes grinding raids challenging. Good luck man!
---
I upvoted for ‚ÄúMost people playing this are probably adults with decent paying jobs‚Äù
---
Doesn‚Äôt really seem like many people understand that people have their own jobs and their own money that they can spend how they want.
---
I'd love to stop by and trick or treat today or tomorrow! I'm on PC too, cactuspixel
---
And not far from my base in the mire either - thanks for the tip!
---
I didn‚Äôt deflect, just shining some more light on how whiney the krill army sounds :-( sorry it hurt your feelings
---
Lmao my friends got the same link and lied that he had about 3k of gears screws and glue along with a lot of lead. Some how he was given it all
---
Sweet
---
I never understood why companies shifted to reddit and twitter to get the most details, sure quick news flash type things like "hey , whenever i log in, everything blows up" but for detail bug reports, concerns, debates, shouldn't the PROVIDED forums be used?   Why don't they ever seem to look at those?
---
For those on XBOX, I found that slowing down and not going too crazy in stages 2 and 3 really helps avoid freezing and crashing.  Try not to use explosive weapons and if you hang back a bit it helps.  The more explosions and running around jumping causes your character to freeze.  I have tried a half dozen ways of playing event.  For the main Sentry Bot at the end get one shot in and the try to avoid the Assaultrons as much as possible while inflicting some damage on them.  It sucks to have to adjust play style but it is that or crash all the time.  Or  you can solo in private session but that sucks all by yourself.
---
Well... The other day I saw someone waving at me and shooting a mailbox. The mailbox had a ton of ammo in it when I took a look at it... So I waved back at them, took the ammo, gave a thumbs up, and I fucked off as fast as I could.
---
If you read this, anon, I'm sorry I stole your mailbox ammo.
---
I guess that‚Äôs their point, would be nice if hazard suits counted as a costume though
---
its just wrong for BGS to grab your junk!
---
We shall see you on the field of battle, bourgeois!
---
Yes, it says it right on the description in the Atom Shop.
---
Yet you won't comment on the issues at hand. Hmmm
---
Quit telling people what to do, if people like it then let them like it.
---
Your right, I was about to bring up Elder Scroll Blades but the fact that Creator's Club exists sets the high water-mark for the direction their heading.
---
r/Beetlejuicing
---
If you look down as you go through the event it definitely helps a lot
---
Do you keep the NCR outfit at least?
---
A few notes:
---
it‚Äôs nigh impossible to place the Cat Halloween decoration on a billboard while the witch joke and the pumpkin man place fine. 
---
Annoying but yeah. 
---
FWIW I also have a lower spec machine and can confirm that the lag is right about Scorched Earth level when the whole server shows up to party with the Queen or when Vault 94 is chugging. 
---
2nd FWIW I ended up in the bonfire by fast travelling to the event when it was nearing the courtyard. 
---
Possibly an adjusted spawn point to the front of the lawn instead of the center might help there.
---
You too!  I can't get through Meltdown on standard yet, but my 3-person team managed to do a Dead In The Water Expert run.  We can do washout on Standard, but the Ag wing is such a pain.
---
It really would be a good move to put these items on the shop.
---
Wow! Well she had junk from the different accounts on there and lost hundreds of each Flux.. Steel,screws, adhesive and lead by the thousands.. Guess I will put the ticket in and see what happens
---
The event is buggy as fuck, just having all the players is laggy as fuck, while other event doesn't even make me lag.
---
yep, its got some good copper if im not mistaken?
---
Sad part is it didn't feel good either
---
or you could stand up and not support a broken game's  predatory greed by buying into this stupid subscription in the first place - wait it out and find out what happens.
---
all your doing by giving them money is saying "it's ok to keep doing a horrible job on this game and future games' as they just look at the cash flowing in.  Your actually risking future games being just as bad if not worse in this fashion.
---
Game Pass for PC is currently $1 your first month ($5 otherwise) and you get access to  a TON of games.  So.. why would you pay $13/month for 1 VERY BROKEN game?
---
You do.
---
The Ranger Armor Outfit, player icons and emotes must be claimed from the Atomic Shop while your Fallout 1st membership is active. If you cancel your membership after claiming them, you will still have access to them
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-launch
---
We appreciate that!
---
I'm not sure what affects how much. Higher dire rate, so automatic weapons, are better. My vampire lever action wasnt to great.
---
If get 1/4 to 1/2 health from a target. Which is 2 to 6 shots
---
When wastelanders comes out
---
Just put a stupid amount if you have the hours to back it up lmao. Not like they'll look into what you lost if they want you to explain
---
Yeah, forget exclusivity, everything should at least have an Atom price.
---
Xbox can't handle this game thats why i switch to pc
---
Wait are these the Atom store death bags?  I thought it was only on death, but I guess that since they are both the same bag, dropped items should be the same overlay.  The Candy bucket overlay filled with dropped toothpaste and a severed skull would be a nice trick.  I may use some of my saved free atoms for that then.
---
Glorious Fallout 1st Master Race unite!
---
Hmm. I guess I missed that
---
Endless shooting fix is part of  [Fallout first](https://falloutfirst.com/)  subscription, in the end a non looping audio is just a convenience.
---
Yeah /u/vaginafishsmell , go fish off!
---
What they said.
---
"There is no war in Ba Sing Se."
---
Not the issue, but my wife lost her favourite weapon when the game crashed a while back and we contacted them. Had a video of it happening and us all looking for it in cade it dropped. The reply we got was basicly "we cant give it back", and when we asked for something in return (probably atoms) we got a reply saying our ticket has been closed and issue resolved.
---
Thanks Bethesda
---
I see what they tried there, and i dont like it.
---
right? they r such teases
---
Server is up guys! Only rule I have is to not take workshops that are owned. Since there are only 8 people max, this shouldn't be much of an issue.
---
Unless someone from Bethesda is reading this post addressed to Bethesda.
---
Nothing. Just a nuked area and unable to get max rewards. You do you though.
---
Notice that alot of them make some mistakes with english...as if theyre paid cheaply in a third world country. Which is a wisespread practice. Maybe bethesa introduced it into the gaming world too.
---
Think I'm going to put an astronomical amount in and see where it goes.. Luckily I hadn't put all my junk in my box yet and was able to help her rebuild.. Yes she had the hours put in.. More than I do
---
I think after hearing of the issue everyone should have taken screenshots just in case since Bethesda would most likely ask if a ticket was submitted. 
---
With that said I lost a set of power armor and sent in a picture screenshot not only of me with GT on screen (only two of us on team and screen)  and they said that wasn‚Äôt enough... 
---
Their response was they didn‚Äôt have the tools to replace in game items that were lost. 
---
And that was it...
---
They did too apparently.
---
One time I was gonna trade this guy my 2 star explosive assault rifle for his 3 star assault rifle and pay him the difference in caps. After he kinda caught an attitude and had a very demanding tone through messages I decided that I'd teach him a lesson on manners though.
---
He gave me his weapon first, trusting that I would give him mine in return and pay him in the difference in caps. Once I had both weapons in my possession I proceeded to exit the trade menu, wave goodbye, block him and switch servers. Still have both guns till this day.
---
so what youre saying is its just regular old Beth sucking.
---
fair enough
---
I didnt want an offline fallout 76 experience and I dont. I just avoid idiots cause I can.
---
Kid rock?
---
Stop praising them for shitting on us...
---
Yeah did that and restarting the game, didn‚Äôt work for me. And now just black screen while loading in. I hope my second main doesn‚Äôt get the same bug
---
Brand Ambassador account
---
I was about to say, was OP even here last week...
---
I got max rewards it was completed and all. Put a ranger hat on at the end so yea...I was hoping for more but oh well. First time I ever nuked a event only my 4th actual nuke I've launched.
---
I could be wrong, but the way it's set up makes me feel like they may add some sort of functionality to Atom Shop backpack skins at some point.
---
Does it block camps? I thought camps would have load priority over tents.
---
Cant you just put the vending machine in your front yard and still lock your door?
---
Amusei: 
---
For someone who hates the game you come onto the forum to comment. Curious.
---
Yea well I'm not letting even of Bethesda is reading.. She literally lost hundreds of Flux.. Countless thousands of other junk
---
&gt;There are studies that show kids with their parents' credit cards are the ones who download all this stuff and it encourages bad gaming behavior
---
And you know who is to blame for that?
---
Parents. If they parented properly, and took basic precautions with their credit card and used parental controls that are available, this would be a non-issue.
---
But sure, let's blame the devs for ***making*** the innocent widdwe kiddies able to spend their parents money.
---
wow. "make it so sacks of shit can't wreck the game experience for everyone else" is something you're strongly against? Must be a sack of shit.
---
Yeah it was kinda predictable, since the game lags when even one car explodes. Having multiple explosions and the whole server at one place, well, let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm glad when I‚Äôm left with  10-15 FPS lol. But it was really funny nonetheless, but sucks ass when it breaks your character.
---
only you can't get a full team on there to actually complete the event.
---
How does a simple comment bring out so much hate.  If it's fake who cares.  Move on.  Upset about the cash grab that is bethesda... who the f*ck isnt..  Move on... why come and crash on perhaps the last few good things about the game and that would be the community... Move on.  Seriously people.  If the game no longer brings you excitement or you are angry at too many things that bethesda has done... move on.  So many corner dwellers and haters on these pages.  We get it.  Your mad.  Move on.  And trust me... I dont fucking work for bethesda.  This games future makes me incredibly sad, but I have an amazing group of diehards who still make it fun... so I wont be moving on.  Yet.  Find yourselves a group who make it fun or... yep u guessed it... MOVE ON.
---
I'm surprised they let you cancel at all. When I tried to get a refund on the tricentennial edition after their s**tshow release (and general unplayability), customer support literally told me to go F myself.
---
Guy kept shooting me and my friends none stop trying to get us to pvp him, we went to his camp, he kept doing it, we killed him and wiped his camp
---
With eight people. Not a full server full of people enjoying the event.
---
You'd think so, but I've been blocked several times and the only evident thing was a tent.
---
It was publicized on YouTube. I'm sure they are aware. It's been there for a couple of months now.
---
I keep seeing everyone refer to FO76 as a premium priced game, but I truly don't see that, COD4 cost $89 many years ago, FO3 was $49 +$9-12 each for the Add-ons (DLC), virtually all other games today have tons of micro-transactions and real P2W structures that cost a lot more than this one.
---
Considering that the Original Fallout came out 30 years ago at about half of what FO76 cost, and inflation being was it is, I would no call $40-60 premium priced by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Also, none of the Subscription service provides new content that is not available in the base game.
---
I could spend the next 30 minutes going on about charging for non-cosmetic items, but it's all been said.  I'd take a small atom charge over a subscription, but they're both a problem.
---
BGS has got a long ways to go to repair the lost trust for me, and at this point I don't think that's in the cards.
---
I know, right?  Like, it's so damn hard not to be a cuck edgelord who has to assert their dominance in a video game to feel in control.  NOBODY UNDERSTANDS!!!
---
Then good hopfully they have statistics on everyone junk
---
I mean, can't really blame some people when there was a guide on youtube (even if the YTer did take it down the day after). There's actually a 50/50 that the game will just eat your items, from what the video said. So, high risk/meh reward
---
If they did they wouldn‚Äôt need to ask for proof of what he lost.
---
I just leave fertilizer on people's beds
---
Whatever you say, still gonna spend my money however I choose
---
Dabney is one of the overlooked treasures. Easy to defend and use, so far out no one goes there, and has a few resources. Plus the defend missions usually have pretty good enemies, other than the bloodbugs. My camp is close by for a reason.
---
"The game was rigged from the start" 
---
Ooof
---
I'll dominate you.
---
In battle.
---
Returning player here. Where do I go to het these spooky items?
---
Lmao fair enough
---
Refunds and cancelling a subscription are two completely different things.
---
https://youtu.be/DDdDfW7YSkQ
---
Wait you're right I forgot what Friday I got paid it was the 25th then
---
Nuclear winter and adventure mode for "mischief night" event
---
Twice now
---
What? You don't need the work bench to claim a workshop........
---
Yeah, im not saying i dont understand online subscriptions or services. But fallout first is horrible value. Point blank. They want another 100 bucks and im still waiting to get my original 60 out of it.
---
Lol, I have my decontamination shower separated from my house &amp; my vendors, and upstairs are a few radiation emitters (that if your at full health it will take you down to 20%) for the bloodied boys&amp;girls.
---
This is why you need a private world üòâ
---
Took a few hundred explosive bobbleheads and a tse shotty on a mission to blast the power armor right off the chassis of every player I saw
---
Sorry, couldn't get the numbers because I didn't have a ts in inventory. Picked one up last night though. It shoots a extra pellet and the damage is divided by 9. It's not like flooping said.
---
Two shot is basically 125% of the base damage divided by (number to shots + 1). The pellets that hit the head do crits that get added separately. The shotgun shoots 8 pellets normally, 9 with TS. [https://imgur.com/a/lAKYwQU](https://imgur.com/a/lAKYwQU)
---
Odd that it wasn‚Äôt coded that way.
---
What the hell is that first sentence supposed to mean? Bethesda doesn‚Äôt make most of their money off kids who can‚Äôt control themselves with a credit card they make their money off adults who don‚Äôt care, I like how you said that dude pulled a straw man yet you literally did just that, stop saying kids are the one corrupting Bethesda when they make up a small percentage of 76 players especially when they‚Äôd rather be spending money on fortnite or something, this game is hardly fun for adults let alone kids, shit on the subscription all you want but don‚Äôt say everyone uses their parents money then say there are studies that kids do this ON COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAMES
---
Gamer club counts on pre orders too.  Or at least it did for me, mine expired mid October üò•
---
Wow. Just found this. OP must be a prophet.
---
You da real MVP.
---
Thats a moot argument. Cost of living in nyc is just as atrocious as fallout first.
---
Sold more ammo last night than I‚Äôm used to though I credit the event for bringing people over to my camp-as far as ammo goes I think it‚Äôll still sell-fallout 1st will let some people hoard effectively to where they‚Äôll be set for good, but if the player knows how to farm effectively enough already, they are likely not buying ammo from vendors. Ammo will taper off somewhat, I believe, but not in a way that‚Äôll make ammo null. Where is your camp? If not white springs definitely worth committing in for the duration of the event
---
It's not an add on or DLC it's an optuonal service with an optional price. If you don't like it don't buy it. I have no issue with it and will eventually buy it around when Wastelanders comes out.
---
If paying for an *online* game frustrates you then.. don't play it.
---
I'm really confused why people are complaining over a sub that will keep paying for server equipment, data usage, and employees to deal with these people; concerning really. Seems perfectly viable for a game you enjoy to play *online.* If all you want is Fallout, go back to one of the many series before this. Buy it at a lower price and not pay for online play because that's what you should get and deserve.
---
You pay for the development of the game initially and then you pay to play on their servers (on the line) after that in order to maintain the servers; the perks are nice to have instead of not getting anything in return at all.
---
So make a ticket and throw up a link.  Only takes a couple minutes, and I don't believe that they have the manpower to even be scrubbing youtube for things like that.
---
I spent a hot minute looking after responding to the post, and I didn't see anything that fit that description on Youtube, so it's possible they don't know.  I'd *really* hope they have the tools to find this stuff even without searching youtube, but they haven't been too good about not disappointing me at every turn so far...
---
They're just doing Atoms work.
---
That's exactly what you said. Although I may have gotten the context wrong but regardless, you're trying to justify the targeting of players who purchased 1st.  That makes you trash, just like the Op that posted this originally.  Pretty sure the devs didn't design the game this way so garbage like you can go and specifically target certain players.
---
I've hunted legendary ghouls in the cottages for quite some time.  I start at the club house, do the cottages, then the parking lot, then Whitesprings Station to offload my loot.
---
From someome who has never played the game, it baffles me that you'd want to buy a subscription to get singleplayer for a game that was expressly designed and advertised for multiplayer.
---
I'd wait until after the first month and the see a subscriber drop because people wanted to try it out and get some atoms and loot. Slightly off topic, does your tent go away after you cancel 1st?
---
As of time of posting (2:33 pm) $12.99 USD is $17.13 CAD. They rounded up to the nearest dollar, like most places do when it comes to pricing.  
---
Kind of sucks, but it's also par for the course when comes to American stuff coming up here.  
---
C'est la vie.
---
I love hurting others :D
---
I'm sure the tent is coded just like a camp. They seem to have the same overlap rules.
---
Team said some things I didn't agree with while playing Nuke Winter. Hung back while they were downed by another group. Threw a couple grenades, killed my team and the survivors of the other team. Over mic, "I'VE NEVER FELT SO ALIVE!"
---
Apparently some places in the states don‚Äôt have tax? And we do lmao
---
so these type of posts gets boosted on this sub to fight against growing hate for actual reasons? nice.
---
Subliminal marketing at its finest
---
Ninja and Covert Ops stack for melee damage only? Or is ninja also buffing ranged sneak attacks?
---
Do the burrows really get affecting through a loading screen
---
&gt;Spend weeks killing scorched and acquiring scrip for the sale, get nothing useful and learn that RNG is seeded, in other words "the game was rigged from the start".
---
I got a couple TSE's (which imo are garbage but players will buy them) and a sweet Junkies lever action. It's just rng sometimes it's good other times not so much.
---
It has nothing to do with a singleplayer experience jesus fuck
---
Oh, let me clarify. 
---
The method has been in the game for a couple of months. The video was only up for a day. DemonAsylum posted it, and a lot of his followers got angry because this method has a 50/50 shot of causing you to lose your items instead of duping them, and a few people lost some pretty good gear from what the comments said. 
---
So, I wouldn't be able to link it. I'm sure they are aware though, because they've tried twice now to patch it out. Short of eliminating the scrip machine and going to a format where you all the items directly to The Purveyor though, I don't think they can actually fully eliminate this one.
---
Not wut I meant
---
yup, and thats one of the hardest things to farm.
---
Sucker!
---
its so much better for copper than billings.
---
Or not have a subscription
---
Has the sentry bot been higher than 1* for you during your solo missions?
---
https://www.thedailybeast.com/bethesdas-fallout-class-war-has-players-targeting-premium-subscribers
---
Your post got quoted in this article lol
---
Frankly this is hilarious.
---
How does that make it moot? It‚Äôs the cost of two products that someone living in NYC can decide to buy. Down by me it‚Äôs closer to $10 for a large whopper meal. Annual pass comes or to $8.33/mo. So my whopper meal is still more expensive.
---
Nope. I've had crowned and 1 stars and have yet to see anything higher
---
Yet, still more valuble, and depending where your bk is located, less broken. Lol
---
Everyone should receive the 1st membership, for free. Charging people extra for game fixes and features you already promised (and they already bought) is just plain unacceptable. 
---
It would be like after they f**ked up their fallout 1st release by deleting users junk, they came out with a "Fallout Platinum" membership that restores that junk, for an additional 12.99 (per month).
---
I‚Äôve commented on them before :-) don‚Äôt need to repeat myself like the krill. It‚Äôs not pay to win in the slightest, more like pay for convenience which is in every game with MTX in the modern world. Not concerned but seeing the whole gang of shrimps come out in full force is a damper. Maybe lives need to be gotten so you don‚Äôt have to spend all your time being negative in an online public forum? Not sure! Hope you find whatever it is thoughüëåüèº
---
That doesn't do any good because hardly anyone actually buys the atoms. They just farm the free ones. So, no. That would be a terrible idea, and the goal of increasing revenue would fall flat.
---
I been wearing the same atom store dress and jangles mask, it seems to count. It should pop up and say if you need a costume.
---
That's why I love Fallout 76.
---
It's seeded, which means some accounts are "luckier" than others.  The user that posts the bug roundups has commented on it.
---
how many overseer points in a day do you need to get the daily item?
---
I‚Äôve had those small letters disappear into the vendors in the past. Solved by storing the vendor in build mode. You should see your letters reappear in ‚Äústored‚Äù with the vendor.
---
We certainly do, but the difference between Canada and the States with regards to taxation is a whole other discussion.  
---
You shouldn't've gotten hit with any tax on this though; I certainly didn't.  
---
Unless you're in Quebec. You might get hit with taxes on stuff like this in Quebec. I can't say for certain but I wouldn't rule it out by any stretch.
---
Disagree
---
I had someone randomly message me last week on XBox saying, *"Interested in a Level 80 3 star legendary Scorchbeast?"*  He was down near Watoga.  I traveled there and helped him and a few other people kill it.  Easy peasy.  Good stuff.
---
This. Hardly anyone actually buys Atoms. They just gonagter the free ones.
---
TBH I'm not sure what that means. ELI5 please
---
This is why people were blasting 1st. Its easy to take sides and get caught up in the nonsensical rants but that this happened to anyone let alone people paying extra is absurd, made worse by the fact that people now have to go thru hoops with their dreadful CS and theres zero accountability or acknowledgement from them about it. 
---
At least EA somewhat engages with their communities on various platforms and occasionally offer community makeups for their blunders.
---
Get out of here shill and go get your premium ass pounded
---
Dear Customer,
---
There has been a shortage of sweet sweet items in the atom store.
---
We are not planning on doing anything about it.
---
Best of luck, Bethesda Customer Support Team
---
Becaise youre isolating one city. One city in which the cost of living is super high. One city in which the minimum wage is outrageously high compared to the rest of the country. If youre trying to make a comparrison, do it over something that stretches beyond more than one city in the world. Cuz a whopper here is 4 bucks.
---
Did you even read the second paragraph you wrote? It's obvious you want a singleplayer experience.
---
Been playing nuclear winter and its pretty fun tbh. Where do I go to start the event?
---
About what? Being more valuble? Or less broken? Lol
---
I like the new with fallout 1st less risk lol
---
And even if you don't put it down, it will still allow you to use those mats when crafting.
---
Gorey?
---
No it's not. If I wanted a single player experience I'd never gotten this game and poured over 2300 hours into for a whole year. I just wanted less lag and to avoid dumbshits. I got what I wanted.
---
I meant just for mass and fluid. It‚Äôs half the work if you just want those
---
A large whopper meal is $4? Bs it‚Äôs not 1992
---
You don't believe me about what? Also, I didn't cuss at you, calm down. Additionally, you still haven't actually answered the question. "Whatever the fuck I need" doesn't really mean anything. I'm serious. Why do you need unlimited storage for things you can find all over the game? Again, I fully support expanding the stash size, regardless of how it's coded and stored. If they can do unlimited storage, great, let's do it. But they tried and it was broken. I didn't and won't buy the private service, so maybe i have no way of knowing if its actually beneficial. Again, I haven't worked with their software. Maybe that's why I asked the question. I made a second character the other day because of two glitched achievements and stuff that's stored wasn't shared like in Diablo 3. So why would you have a ton of alts? If you play long enough, just like almost every Bethesda game, you can unlock everything under one character and just change out your perk build to suit your mood. I'm not defending Bethesda's choices.
---
You should play the way you want to play. There‚Äôs more to having fun than having an ‚ÄúOP build‚Äù. That said, you sound like you‚Äôre ready to give it a try so why not? You may find you enjoy living on the edge!
---
Both. I get pretty broken when I eat at BK
---
Bloody outside PA is very squishy even with all the defense perks. Bloody inside PA with Emergency Protocol, Blocker, fireproof and dodgy is in no way Squishy.  You can tank anything in the game that doesn‚Äôt poison.  SBQ will do almost no damage to you under 19% health.
---
Hmmm last i checked it was right over 100 hours. In adventure mode. Probably close to 40 in NW. 
---
I dont see value. So i didnt buy it. And i wont. Im also not telling you to not buy it. Go ahead. 
---
All i did was compare it to other services that cost roughly the same per month. Feature wise. And then i said i can see why people are upset. You took it to where it is now.
---
Terrible move. It would take away the whole point of the subscription, and they wouldn't make any money off of the items, which is the goal. Everyone just uses the free atoms they farm from challenges.
---
The hunting part was mostly in jest. The only time I've been killed when I wasn't fighting back for fun was when I was AFK in my CAMP, and even that was kinda funny because the guy messaged me over Xbox live "Death to the bourgeoisie."
---
it means your character or even your account might have a set seed that decides what your legendary rolls are going to be. so it's not just "rng being bad today", it'll always be bad.
---
anecdotal evidence, but I've been playing since release and went well over a dozen different characters and my rolls have always been bad. so I'm inclined to believe it's per account and not character.
---
It's so lovely to see a community coming together in a broken mess of a game
---
Maybe if we're lucky for Halloween Bethesda might actually start fixing the game and getting stuff right
---
White springs resort, at the top of each hour for the mischief event, NW unlocks are just from XP earned.
---
I am a gift bag bed dropper!
---
I do that all the time x
---
Ah, i was talking about the burger being broken. Lol. But since you keep going back, i see youre a glutton for punishment. Fallout first is right up your alley. Lol.
---
Wait so you have 140 hours in and don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs worth $60?
---
Free servers for everyone! Lol
---
You don't have to defend Fallout first or Bethesda to appreciate somebody having a good experience in the game. This subreddit is more than just that, and it's not fighting against hate to say "Hey this one dude was really nice to me and I wanna share the experience". Chill out.
---
Because they are fully entitled to what they want when they want it, and how they want it, as often as they want it. Didn't you get the Communist Daily Memo?
---
Yeah I read take off the pa helmet, have the tin foil hat on. I still haven't seen anyone nuke it on PC and I have a lot of the new items, pirate outfit, whitesprings caddy, clean ranger outfit, plans.
---
Oops, *gory*. Yeah, there are different looking drop bags that you can get now.
---
Ammo sales would be affected since you can stockpile lead from lucky hole, ultracite from that one cavern, and steel from super mutants.
---
Why pay for ammo when you can do a couple runs, and craft what you need when you need it?
---
Besthesda will further adress that in the "Fallout Second" annoucement.
---
Seriously... this sub is **full to the gills** of people screaming, swearing, wrenching their hair about the game.  Every time I think to myself, "Why in the name of god are you still coming to this sub to post??"
---
Oh,thanks for the info! I stopped playing when they announced the wastelanders rollback,might go back
---
You can say f76 is shit, and get out of the f76 subreddit, but you can't decide what "pay-to-win" means arbitrairly.
---
A whopper sandwich where i live is 3 bucks and some change. The medium meal is 5 bucks and some change. PA.
---
No I personally don‚Äôt see the value in it for how I play but can‚Äôt understand getting mad that someone else might want it as many on here do.
---
The honest answer is they didn't build themselves the tools to restore lost items. I still wouldn't believe them. Similar games and games with far less resources can restore lost items
---
One at the whitesprings every hour on the hour
---
Yourr assuming in mad at the people buying it, im not do you. Its just horrible value.
---
GIB. I mean, why not? It‚Äôs the least they could do after the whole fiasco. I just think it‚Äôs disgusting they are charging their most loyal fans that actualy enjoy 76 so much money. Because who else is gonna dish out that money if not the loyal fans.
---
Yesterday I got mad at a player with political messages all over his camp. It was whatever but he was using his vendors as a bait and had them behind lock doors but still on. I messaged him and asked if he can turn his vendors off or open them up. He gave me a long mean message back pretty much saying it was his right to use it as bait to get people to visit the camp and read it. 
---
I got pissed at him after that point and lured all the enemies of a nearby fissure site to his base while he was away and baited them into destroying every piece of his camp.
---
The last event was for aggregate XP, you should earn each additional reward as you increase total xp. So far neither of the unlocked items have been available to earn in the challenge menu, I've earned enough xp already that they just appear as claimed when I log in.
---
You‚Äôve missed the point by several thousand miles.
---
They are unlocking 1 per day, but you have until Nov. 12th to get them all
---
Alright appreciate it dude
---
I like your idea of players dressing as one of the Unstoppables while they are completing an Order of Mysteries's daily quest/event. Maybe there could be a reward bonus if they do so?
---
Whay are they called
---
Jeeze. I haven‚Äôt seen those prices since I was a kid. Wel point is, $8.33/mo isn‚Äôt much. It‚Äôs actually incredible how much value something like Netflix can give for so cheap a price. A movie ticket is $12 on its own (next you‚Äôll tel me you still go to the movies for a nickel)
---
Is this a fucking reddit call to arms? Yikes
---
This is my bad deed as well. If it's unlocked I assume it's because you're a high enough level and you don't need it anymore and it's a donation to the public... I generally leave at least one of my purifiers unlocked with a sign on it that says 'free water' or if I've taken hemlock holes I'll leave the obvious acid collector unlocked for people.  (If they're not doing it for charity then I assume they need to be educated about the lock system) what surprises me is how many people will lock their purifiers and the resource collectors but don't lock their Collectrons. I think a lot of people don't realize it has a lock option on it as well. I didn't realize it myself for the first couple weeks I had it. hell I just opened the terminal on the thing for the first time the other day and discovered that you can swap between it collecting junk or scrap.
---
Thank you for the explanation
---
So I can confirm my rolls have been all over the place usually bad. Sometimes very nice.
---
Is there proof game companies do this or is it all "tin foil hat" speculation.
---
Go ahead, good for you, but you have to admit its an overpriced pay-to-win advantage
---
They honestly just need to stop the camping around hot spots in general. I remember when people would have missile towers on the golf course behind the clubhouse. I would systematically destroy every single square inch if their base, when possible.
---
Mischief night I think
---
It won't be much of a battle, Proletarian rabble!
---
No, i dont feel like ive gotten my moneys worth. My hours are that high because you have to do every event 4 times until you complete it without a disconnect. Maby of those hours were spent fighting invisible enemies or trying to figure out how to get unstuck, or trying to figure out what the hell was going on during the PA glitch days. 
---
And if im honest, probably a solid 10 hours trying to remove a foundation lol.
---
"like old people with polio" ook
---
This comment made my day
---
I think they do have the tools since I‚Äôve read a few stories of them restoring. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs whole character wise save, like everything from yesterday would be restored and nothing after last save or if it was individual items. I believe if anything it would be a character save so anything new past the save would be lost.
---
I think I know how that would work, it's something I've thought of before.
---

If it's what I think it might be, they can absolutely find a way to fix it (though really there's 2 pretty big assumptions in that statement, so don't quote me on that :P ).  But again, only if they know about it.
---
You don't *have* to let them know, but it is the right thing to do.  Though, if (like me) you really just *think* you know how it works, it may not be helpful.

I'll just leave all that here, and let you decide.  I don't really know enough to even advise what you should do for certain.
---
It's even laggier in a nuked whitesprings
---
&gt;I think I know how that would work, it's something I've thought of before.

 You have been quoted on this post.

No. I am saying a lot of people are mad that the offer exists and angry and people for buying it. Saying they are ‚Äúruining gaming‚Äù. One person in the last few days likened it to the holocaust and another said it was like domestic abuse. I mean- seriously people?!

Would blocker and dodgy be a must on a 50 Cal gunner?

I haven‚Äôt spent anything more than the $30 I paid for it. Also, I‚Äôm almost certain you‚Äôre not my mom.

Nope, just a good deal

" Spend weeks killing scorched and acquiring scrip for the sale, get  nothing useful and learn that RNG is seeded, in other words "the game  was rigged from the start". "  
---
All games rng work like this. There is no real rng whatsoever in any game. (the most random randomness you can get is things like atmospheric noise)
---
You clearly don‚Äôt value your time if you don‚Äôt think 140 hours&gt;$60
---
At least for ranged bloodied, your only squishy if they get to you.

With unyielding your AGI gets pushed so high you can tip toe around enemies and not be noticed.

I only die with my bloodied stealth commando if I slip up /shrug

Well that's...special.
---
Wait, y'all are getting paid?
---
A headache about 50% of the time... when it doesnt freeze up it's a blast though! I got the pirate outfit the 2nd time through!
---
Or just spend a weekend duping cars and buy anything you want in the game
---
I am sorry you have such a negative view towards people using fo1st but please feel free to add my accounts to your block list IGN: Karthathan , TheHoboSeer, EmeraldAshura, and KarthsKubby as I am sure our personalities would not mesh well. I tend to enjoy playing with chill, laidback, and positive people, and rejoice that I can effectively stack my server now with those that are like-minded.

I wish you luck in the wasteland!

Ontario for me.

$20.33 total for a one month sub.
---
Nah, but the matinees at kendig are $5.50. Lol. Last i went anyway. But that was like 4 years ago. Movies are still outrageous here too. 
---
And youre right. $8.33 isnt a lot per month. But thats not what youre paying per month. Youre paying 100 dollars upfront, or youre paying 12 or 13.99 a month. You cant keep using the 8.33 a month argument. 
---
Hell, if it was outright 7.60 a month or maybe 76 bucks a year, now we are having a very different conversation.
---
Take resources from their unlocked collectors &amp; purifiers (including the Collectrons, I don't think a lot of people realize you can lock these) and if the prices in their vendors are 'asshole' prices I also raid all their crops.
---
Customer service is bad. They once asked me in an ongoing ticket what my email adress was. Like they seriously asked what by Bethesda.net email was. It was the same email they sent that email too and the three before it
---
what, seeding? it's something pretty basic and widely used in, well, every game with a semblance of randomness.
---
outside of some dataminers it's mostly speculation in regards to Fo76, though. but considering the Fo4 legendary system and how it used to lock entire pools I wouldn't be surprised.
---
Start abby's quest line in the mire. After that you can harvest them easy, don't complete the quest. Otherwise you have to wait until heart of the swamp event pops up at night. Then you might see one across from dyer, you'll pick it and still no swamp plant. It looks like a glowing flower, not the strangler pod.
---
Yeah I run both on my bloody heavy gunner
---
yeah most of us were bored after a couple weeks. what took you so long?
---
I requested refund several hours after release when I logged into that disaster. No question asked got refunded in minutes. Later one shitshow has begun.
---
wow, you sir are the true definition of evil, both physically and psychologically 
---
we are complete opposites, i have had to help defend kids like that against people like you
---
You will die a lot more. I know I have.
---
I literally cannot even log into an adventure server to play this event. It just disconnects me once it tries to login.
---
The tin foil hat had me smilling, yet it's the best theory, i dropped 1 star boxing gloves like i dropped TSE 50 cal ect ect, i honestly doubt about characters being luckier than others it's the point of RNG, you can get 4 good legendaries in a row like you can get 4 bad ones or even a mix of both.
---
This is literally the worst reason to dislike NPCs.
---
I'm no psychologist, but I would imagine like someone in a relationship they cared about and got hurt, I think what you're hearing are fans of the game (because they enjoy either 76 or the franchise in general) and they are venting frustration because they are experiencing things beyond their control, and in feeling helpless, they're lashing out and being toxic in hopes their behavior will give cause for the other person in this relationship (Bethesda) to change. I think that some people believe if they complain enough, things will change. This thinking isn't wrong, but it's not reliable, because if your gripe doesn't outweigh Bethesda's justification (for the greater good of the game and therefore the community, so to speak), all the trashing and flaming in the world isn't going to change things.
---
Can you post your build via Nuke and Dragon?
---
It's okay, you get used to the low health after a while. The real issue is it can ruin other builds for you once you get used to the insane damage output it gives. It's hard to go form doing 4k+ on a queen hit to under 300 (even 300 is actually really good!).
---
Either way it‚Äôs not much money in mind. I just personally don‚Äôt buy atoms. If I did this would be a steal.
---
Will that be the 2nd quarter of 2020?
---
If you are looking for a costume, check the survey tower at the north end of the divide. Mask at the Halloween shop north of the mire
---
At 19% HP, bloodied is around 3.24x your damage. 
---
At nighttime, a proper sneak attack build is 3.75x your damage.
---
You should make fun of them for not using a *real* OP build.
---
Try junkies as an alternative? Don‚Äôt have to give up the health with junkies but also miss some benefits of nerd rage, etc.
---
Well, look at it the other way too. I didnt enjoy fallout 4 at all. But if you were to look at my map, youd see i destroyed that game as well. I enjoy fallout. I have for the last 20 years. The hours add up when you continually try to give it chances. I wanted to complete it entirely. I dont want to be one of those people spouting how this game sucks when i havent even left the vault you know?
---
according to the dataminers it might not be entirely random. now that I think about it, if they based the legendary system off Fo4, then it's not random at all.
---
I kinda love how redpilled this subreddit has become. Year ago, for posts like this I was downvoted to oblivion :D
---
Some accounts are more likely to get useful legendary effects others are more likely to get trash legendary effects, its not pure RNG. Comes from data mining finding the keywords and data gathering figuring out implementation.
---
Aye the lmg.. You have to be a lead farming a lot =\]
---
haha nice!
---
And for the most part I'd agree with this statement... but they are literally aiming at the last bit of community we have.  It's not aimed at bethesda which I'd have no problem with.  But to aim it at people trying to still enjoy the game is just dumb and thoughtless.  Imo anyways which doesnt mean squat.
---
Effective as Gun Free Zone stickers...
---
People get fined pretty regularly for blatantly false yelp reviews, if that makes you feel better.
---
I bought tricentennial and think this is ridiculous. You can‚Äôt just add things to something that was available a year ago. That doesn‚Äôt make any sense what so ever.
---
It won't be the first time that Bethesda lies about something.
---
Its nice(combat may be a little basic but game doesn't have that layer of bethesda grime gunking up performance/playability)
---
Because when I purchased my car and had the brilliant unoriginal idea that I thought the manufacturer should install leather seats for free... He told me where I could take my loyal fan community.  "Buy the next one with leather seats or we can install them for a fee. You're not obligated any new enhancements? Wtf bro. My kids got to eat."
---
No. We don't get to dictate our "gaming community entitlements". Vote with your dollar. Spend your time happily with games you enjoy.
---
It's an interesting train wreck of a game to follow. I used to love Bethesda, they made some of my favourite games such as Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3. After that, shit just went downhill, Fallout 4 was still fun but the story and quests were noticeably dumbed down. The Creation Club was my first big wtf are they doing. And now with all the shit they're pulling with Fallout 76, I lost all hope for the future of this franchise and TES. So yeah, you guys supporting this is the reason why our games are broken and have garbage overpriced micro transactions in them. Cause people like you keep supporting it.
---
Ha! See, I‚Äôm not defending shit. They‚Äôre all fucky these days, but there are a lot of cool people in the community. Just don‚Äôt pay for overpriced shit. There‚Äôs a difference between the people in the other sub posting the usual fun stories and the people who are in there defending Bethesda‚Äôs horrible slide into the sea. Some people here (not you; I know you‚Äôre joking) can‚Äôt see the difference, and it‚Äôs absurd. Some people exercise no sense of nuance.
---
"heard something about events"...? seriously?
---
I guess. I personally wouldn‚Äôt put that number of hours in though if I didn‚Äôt like it.
---
50/50 shot to lose your item or end up with a duplicate copy? That doesn't sound like duping, that sounds like they have finally added an in game gambling mechanic. Double or nothing bet it all each time. Lol.
---
The OP is literally just one of the reasons private servers were requested so much... it‚Äôs pure hate and anger over nothing that effects them.
---
I'm gonna be chillin around my victim's camp, and the instant they discover it, ima fast travel away. Just to get a kick outta it. Ima have to find some toilet paper now...
---
I'm gonna put a flamer fuel or molotov and raw fertilizer on someones doorstep too, lol.
---
Mine lags at first when loading in, once all cached it's good. Running a amd card though, not nvidia.
---
Hell no I ain‚Äôt fishing for kudos, I even said at the start I know I‚Äôm gunna get downvotes and hell no it isn‚Äôt lame posting it here, OP literally asked for the absolute worst things people have done and I answered. Did you expect better? Did you hope everyone got along in this game? There‚Äôs always gunna be people that are different than you anywhere you go and learning to accept that is just a part of life.
---
Just because my specific answer to his specific question isn‚Äôt the one you wanted is no reason to be that way.
---
How broken are you inside? Seriously??
---
For me, its not about the money. Its about the value im getting for that money. Iys about wastelanders being pushed til first quarter 2020 and this crap being dropped in its place. Its about the state the game is currently in. If this was a finished product, take my money. All day. But its not a finished product. Its just not. It hasnt been since launch. So to ask for more money without having done anything to earn it, that doesnt sit well with me. Everything that is now hidden behind a pay wall were suggestions from the community to fix what was already broken.
---
‚ÄúScientist Rick Sanchez‚Äù oh yeah buddy I‚Äôm sure it would take me several lifetimes to lower my intelligence enough to drink paint and shit out reddit posts like this all day.
---
Are you going to try doing it solo after nuking it?
---
I had this issue as well a few times recently, I honestly chalked it up to connection lag since their life bar wasn't decreasing.  This was happening with all sorts of creatures.
---
Congrats,sounds like a very fun and hectic experience.
---
You‚Äôre a good person then, keep it up if it makes you happy.
---
I agree! Whenever I see these posts I leave that message in hopes that, when I do play on public servers it is a little more pleasant.
---
Once they add text chat I'll know what the in-game community is like. xD  For now, I have no idea because I rarely run into other people and don't really like hearing gamers on mics when I'm in a roleplaying game.
---
Ive spent 20 years playing fallout. I owed it to the series to finish it.
---
I didn't give a new player free stuff.
---
Always said it. The best thing about this game is the community of players. Zenimax &amp; Bethesda heads take it for granted
---
It is. I'm still a noob and day everyone is trying to help already.
---
This seems like just a festive move, but I know what you mean.
---
Agreed.  I've got my weapon plans listed for 800-1200 caps (half the msrp or less), bulks for 15-40 (depending on material), ammo for 1-3, stimpacks at 14, etc.  Despite being just above Watoga I get 1-3 paying visitors every evening.
---
Hmmm maybe. Now there's a challenge.
---
I feel like if the company lied to you this much already there isn't anything that will stop them from lying again. Especially if people keep paying.
---
Any positive ANYTHING shows Bethesda that no matter what they do, someone out there is gonna keep playing no matter what...
---
Well thats a little far, im not going to hate you for buying it. Its your money. Im not gonna log on the grief you for using a fallout first emote. Thats absurd as well. The only thing i can do is compare it to other services and show people the value isnt there. And do my best to explain why. 
---
Just because we disagree doesnt mean i hate you.
---
You should at least jump in for the Mischief Night rewards. And it‚Äôs pretty fun.

 This is my build. I keep three into perception to pick the locks in silos.  If I‚Äôm not doing that I‚Äôll switch to glow sights for nukes or the bobble head finder for farming.  I keep gun fo because for lazy farming I just vat tap one shot super muties with a prime BE Gatling gun.
---
I like challenges and been trying to do all in game ones but I create my own as well! You have to in this game. 
---
I heard nuked WS spawns a ton of glowing ghouls!
---
It's your money so I'm not going to complain at you for it. But that's how business works, they'd have a better incentive to fix the game if it no one brought anything. Its the best way to protest or get a company to do something if it cuts there bottom line.
---
Second Life has been doing what Bethesda has been doing since 2005-ish.
---
TES Online is the same model as Bethesda. Did they screw up with the private worlds being behind a sub? IMO Yep. Should they have left it with Atoms for the sub? Yeah. 
---
Most game companies are doing this, sadly. While I get your anger is there, I don't get you coming in and acting all emo when someone's sharing a positive experience. THAT is my concern. Person's happy over a kitschy item. You come in and go 'Well you suck' and expect us to tolerate that? 
---
Nah mate. I sympathize you're upset over Beth practices. I'm irritated as well. Let people enjoy their happiness here.
---
Are you using the standard servers as opposed to private servers? I‚Äôm wondering if the support that‚Äôs being provided for private servers may be having an impact on the adventure servers. I don‚Äôt really know much about servers so that‚Äôs just speculation on my behalf.
---
video would be awesome :D
---
Ive only done mischief night like 5 times, ive only made it through without crashing once
---
You really need to work on your critical thinking skills.
---
Hmmm I'll look.
---
Agreed. But this comparison really isn‚Äôt valid. Because there isn‚Äôt a single car manufacturer who will give you free leather or trims. On the other hand, in gaming industry, there are plenty. It was used to be called - patches with some small content updates &amp; upgrades. Now it‚Äôs just shipping broken games on day 1 and then spending whole year on bugfixes and critical balances &amp; MAYBE QOL improvements. But Bethesda is now charging for QOL stuff.
---
Absolutely, vote with your wallet. I do.
---
Living in the wasteland ain't easy. And it'll cost you sometimes.
---
Grind, all there is to it. You get better legendaries, you get more levels to make a solid build. Grinding, what joys
---
The data (though anecdotal) indicates that some accounts are ‚Äúluckier‚Äù having greater odds of useful effects.

Yes?

&gt;these type [sic] of posts

Okay so after closing the application countless of times and restarting my wifi it shows that I'm a member c:
---
This wouldn't surprise me either, given some of the... difficulties, Bethesda has had with the launch and the various bugs in this one. However, I do think it's balanced out a bit by two things: 
---
1) Plenty of the game's "normal" weapons are plenty viable for anything you need to do. Since this sub is full of people who play the game a ton (and trolls who don't play at all), there is a lot of emphasis on things like the bloody and junkie builds, but unless your goal is to farm the queen as fast as possible or something, you don't need either for most common adventuring. I basically use a legendary lever action rifle, the All-Rise and a non-legendary handmade, and all three are plenty fine. 
---
 2) Player vending and trading are pretty robust. If you can find your way to this sub, it's not much more of a hop to get to the trading sub, where you can get pretty much anything for the right amount of caps.
---
;)
---
Yes, a lot of mines do as well. Sometimes even the glass caverns do but you don‚Äôt get legendary‚Äôs.
---
Highly unlikely (though not impossible) that character or account 'seeds' are a thing.  *Slightly* more possible, but still very unlikely, that it's a server-based seed.
---
Mostly it's people not understanding how probability works.  Not 'I don't understand what odds are' levels, but overall it's a subject a lot of people have less of a grasp of than they believe they do.
---
Look up the monty hall paradox (not totally applicable here) or the birthday paradox if you want a good idea of how 'odds' can fool people.
---
Only F1st players get support lol
---
Can I get a source on what you've said about Wastelanders being delayed?
---
8th
---
you're reading **way** too deep into what's obviously just a bs PR statement.
---
the community wants whatever Bethesda deems the most profitable.
---
The game will never be a finished product, that‚Äôs the whole point. They are always going to be adding and changing things.
---
If I'm understanding you statement, your assumption is that hardly anyone spends money on Atoms, and that is unlikely. Exclusive costumes and other items are incentives for 1st, sure. FOMO is real. I suspect the market would bear the increased value of a bundle of costumes, atoms, atom store discounts, private server, secondary fast travel point, and scrapbox even if some of those items were available on the atom shop as well. Players who choose not to purchase the bundle may be willing to shell out real $$$ for the items, or at least continue playing to earn the Atoms to purchase these items, because, again, FOMO is real. These are both victory conditions, because engaged players buy things. Enraged players don't. Fallout 1st clearly makes some players feel excluded. Exclusion leads to players feeling marginalized - like they don't matter. Marginalization leads to shame, frustration, anger, etc. Marginalized players aren't going to spend money. They're gonna troll other players, rage on your forums, or behave irrationally, because they want to be heard. Honestly? I'm gonna use Fallout 1st until I tire of 76. I think it's a good deal for me. That doesn't mean it's a good deal for everyone, and I don't believe that excluding players from virtual goods or convenience items is gonna generate more revenue. I'd much rather pay for the deal that works for me, and allow players to also pay (with Atoms, purchased OR earned) for individual items that they find useful.
---
I'd buy atoms if I could get a decent value for my money. A power armor skin will never be worth $18 to me. If it were $6, yeah I'd buy that and give them about $40 a year for atom points besides what I grind for. At the ridiculous prices they're charging, though, most people couldn't be bothered.
---
Where it really gets fun is when you stack that 3.24% from bloodied with the Sandman/CO 3.75% sneak damage. 
---
'Thats where the fun is.   I like hitting for 3k a shot with my rifle.
---
Stop making up things nobody said, dummy.
---
I would also love to sit at a booth and sell like a vendor while sitting.
---
Good. I was worried you hated me :)
---
I lost my old account and Bethesda told me there was nothing they can do about it, even after they asked for proof and I delivered. Any in-game items that go missing are forever lost. Even though they can fix this issue for you, they won't.
---
Nuke an event = asshole
---
Buy FalloutFirst = asshole
---
Workshop PVP = asshole
---
Kill a legendary enemy at event = asshole
---
Do anything = asshole
---
I can't wait to see how they monetize these suggestions!
---
Causing mischief like a boss. Should get all the costumes for it
---
That‚Äôs a shit ton of junk, why hold onto so much?
---
You think I invented all of this?
---
*snicker*
---
That is way too long for me to read
---
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it was the middle of the event so everyone had to bail or just died. Not fun.
---
Literally just use your eyes to look at the Halloween event...A fire fighter outift, a pirate outfit, and a cheesy pumpkin suit? Then 2 more outifts in the Atom shop that they could have just put in the pool of rewards...no more new content scheduled for the rest of the year...wastlanders was SHOVED back into late Q1 of next year...now they want us to pay monthly for an indie level release...
---
Please forgive me for thinking someone leaving a piece of candy on your bed in a paper bag doesnt really put a smile on everyones face
---
8th.. one an hour? That‚Äôs 8 hours gone.
---
Standard servers.  I have been having this issue for well over a month, but it's sort of rare.  It shouldn't have anything to do with the private servers so long as the servers are independent of each other.  Latency could be factor as well as line noise or too much stress on a particular server (number of players in a game, system diagnostics at the server location).
---
I still may for a plethira of other reasons i dont yet know, but at this point, over this, youre good. Lol. :)
---
Excellent point sir
---
I only have important stuff narked, i just refuse to ever run out of screws/springs lol
---
Yes, marrying both builds is where you get the most damage out of the majority of weapons.
---
My team is waiting for wastalanders
---
I sit in a chair when I need to... use the facilities... so I don‚Äôt log out. Or just to creepily watch people using my vendors. I do wish there was a way to jump up vs the slow animation though.
---
I mean flux is 1lb per flux and most players have 20 of each being 100lbs right there. Ultra is heavy and so is steal and would. Being a heavy user i have about 50-200lbs of lead or steel any day
---
Not defending one shotters cause that always sucks but because of the way aggro works in this game the highest level player(s) are always getting trained by random mobs not yet tagged by anyone else.  We can only tank them for so long.  Couple in the ridiculous spawn rate of the assaultrons in the final phase and if you dont melt the bosses face off everyone has theirs melted off.
---
He always spawns in the same place anyway so getting a shot in on his spongy ass shouldn't be an issue. Also imho the best loot is plans from the event rewards not the one star Lego you get from ol rust face.  You also can get quite a few random legendary ghouls up in the cabins and they can be 2 and 3 stars.
---
I mean, there's literally one event involved. Just curious how you only managed to read partial information on that.
---
"I definitely made the right move, spending money on a subscription for a severely broken game"
---
"Why so many griefers on an online PVP game that was designed to have base raids and destruction? I don't get it! Why won't they stop playing the game as it was meant to be played!?!?! Good thing there is a Pay 2 Win sub so I don't have to play the actual game."
---
Could you imagine people whining about getting killed or raided on Rust or another similar game? 
---
Love how all these people that wasted money on this game, and then the sub, are talking about 'toxic' or 'childish' behavior, when that's what the game was made for. 
---
Good job buying that Pay 2 Win on a crap game.
---
I like to leave coal if their vendors dont have good items.
---
Gotta let go my friend. I almost exclusively repair with kits from the Queen or other events.  I keep about 40 or 50 of the main mats. The weird shit like concrete or circuits I keep about 10. My wife has the FO1st so she just hoards whatever.  My stash is full of extra gear.
---
the time it takes to repeat what OP said, complete with punctuation is equal to the time it would take to say  "Mischief Night Event at Whitesprings Resort Top of every hour"
---
Aha we got you now! Bethesda makes players pay to win with new event where you can only solo in private servers! Notify Jim F\*\*\*ing Sterling so he can make another youtube about this!
---
Side note thats Jim Sterlings preferred name, if you don't believe me check prior videos about Digital Homicide.
---
Whats the best way to do that? I really don‚Äôt remember much.
---
Well damn, I'm happy you appreciate it. Thank you, this comment made *mine*!
---
I had the same thing happen today. I died seconds before the sentrybot and had to restart my game in order to respawn. Of course that meant I missed out on all the rewards.  :D
---
Question. Do you get to 4k with melee or with guns?
---
It‚Äôs the first time it‚Äôs happened to me but I haven‚Äôt played properly since August or something I think. Hopefully they sort it out, I needed to eat something quickly and I knew Radstags were close. I‚Äôve changed server now and everything seems fine on this one, other than a Liberator being tabove a factory just floating üòÇ
---
There are plenty who will give you a free server....?  
---
They can charge what they want to charge.  Return your game if it is busted on day one. Get a refund. Come back a year later if you must possibly when it is more stable.
---
Support the f out of the companies that give you enhancements for free for years into the product.
---
I play an instrument when nature calls, or I need a refill.
---
I could be wrong, but I was under the impression this only affects video output, not the in-game/render resolution. The "internal" resolution or whatever you'd call it is still at 4k assuming you're on the X, so it's still just as taxing regardless of system video settings.
---
This was actually one of the main reasons I got an X, I was hoping to play at 1080p with better performance, but I can't say I've noticed a difference between resolution settings, whereas switching to my low-mid tier PC is a night and day difference. I would think switching from 4k to 1080p would at least double the frames in most games, or maybe they're all capped at 30fps, I dunno. I'm not knowledgeable enough about console hardware to say
---
Well lucky for you I put the TLDR at the top. But if you need it broken down further, "Game shop cost much money, buy robot"
---
What is the point of a painting but can‚Äôt paint it? What is the point of a rug that we can‚Äôt wipe our feet on? What is the point of a fridge we can‚Äôt stick magnets on?
---
this game mode sucks but the skins are 100x better than what we get in adventure mode so i guess im going to be playing this crappy fortnite knock off for a while
---
I wish I knew how to do that. I grabbed a few pics, I'll post them in the OP. :)
---
Yup and you're a little bitch

Yeah buddy I am an actual scientist working for the government, I don't think you have a enough capability to understand what my job involves. And your lack of understanding doesn't change what I do, so it's I don't care if you don't understand.
---
"some" means they never ever actually have to do that.
---
Yesterday, I gave someone a note that said "I.O.U. Whiskey"
---
By finished product, im talking about one that was playable at launch. One that works regularly. Not the patch/immediately break again system we are currently in.
---
Didnt read anything
---
You can take it like that. I've worked with and know too many developers to think that, though.
---
By understanding what they're thinking and what they're seeing, perhaps a solution can be driven that allows the game to move forward.
---
It just works
---
This is the exact reason I got fallout 1st for 1 month.  I plan on picking up every scrappable item and farming lead/steel til my eyes bleed for the next month.
---
I have a full set of weapon weight reduced marine armor so I always kept all my guns on me. Now I can put it in my stash AND keep my tons of scrap!
---
Make it into ammo and it‚Äôs considerably lighter with bandolier perk. I am a heavy gunner as well and I burn off all my extra steel and lead into whatever ammo I feel is low. Of course always keeping over 20k of 50 and 15k of ultracite 50 and 5mm.
---
Exactly my thoughts brother. Good hunting!
---
Ontario as well and I only got charged $17.99. Checked my card before the last post just to be sure.  
---
PC membership, purchased through their site. I wonder what we did differently.
---
Yea. I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm impressed with the rewards. I get that they are trying to keep it cosmetic but even having a 3 star legendary at the end, would be better. They should keep with camp items but why not textures or remodels for existing stuff?
---
I disagree on this one, paying this much over a fully priced game feels wrong. I can accept it for a F2P game, but not this. If you‚Äôre fine with it then take it. But I feel like it send the wrong message to Bethesda.
---
Events, especially public events
---
Hey maybe then I can put something decent on my resume: "Modeled shop experience for AAA product"
---
Close the game, run the game again. Cache cleared.
---
Bethesda secret to remove most of the bugs is to inflict random groups of player with lots of bugs where only they are effected so rest of player base seems bugs free in comparison. Don't believe me have you seen how long it took to fix the mire daily quests?
---
As a workshop raider. Having a free mini CAMP and endless space for dropped scrap is the most tempting and bullshit pay to win I have known. One of the only things stopping some of my PVP characters is being over encumbered with other player junk. Imagine being able to pick up 800 lbs of junk from a player, walk outside of the workshop boundaries, place that mobile camp, and deposit all that junk before the defender can fight back for it.
---
that'd be nice.  I'd like to see them add "dirty" versions of the Unstoppable outfits so people don't feel bad for not wearing the atom shop outfits.
---
i havnt seen anyone do this yet but does it count towards the carnage youre supposed to start?
---
also, 100% of your PC games will play better if you set all the graphics settings to minimum.
---
P r E m I u M !
---
You has to go say "it's your parents money" anyway can have a job you know, I'm under 18 and have a job and pay for my own shit when I want it.
---
Xbox for me man.
---
As if not having more than 30fps was enough!
---
No.
---
Everyone has to flee the nuke zone or stay in it and die. It was the middle of the event and we were unable to finish it.
---
This, so much.  
---
As a habitual 'reloader' there's nothing more irritating to be surprised by some beastie in the world and upon whipping out the appropriate firearm find that Bethesda's stolen your magazine!  
---
Then there you are with your pants down facing off some gribbly.
---
Sarcasm is hard to get right through text. Read the comments in the thread, it's mostly an idea to drive more player PVP.
---
I hear ya. I think their thinking is that either if they can spread enough discontent, perhaps Bethesda will change their direction, OR if they can't the happy with the game and the direction  Bethesda is taking it, then no one can, essentially sabotaging others' enjoyment because they are upset about it.
---
After the month ends You get to keep the scrapbox?
---
&gt;the community wants whatever Bethesda deems the most profitable.
---
That's such BS.  The community wants what it wants, and hopes that BGS can be profitable.  Nothing more than that.  I think you see that though.
---
Keep in mind, a lot of high-level decisions aren't even being made by BGS, or even Zeni, at this point.  Price points for cosmetics maybe, but not the push for a subscription.
---
üëç
---
 &gt; By that time I'll probably have played another game.
---
Tons of alternative out right now! We got The Outer Worlds, and next month Death Stranding. Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2, and Cyberpunk coming up as well next year.
---
Who knows though. Maybe Wastelanders will be enough to bring people back to the game and ignore Fallout 1st. 
---
Maybe I'll play on and off over the next few months, I think I've logged in maybe 5 times in the last six months. (But I won't spend a dime. I haven't spent anything since it launched, and I intend to keep it that way.) But there are too many great games out, and on the way, to focus on one made by people who show nothing but contempt for me. So I won't be playing very often. 
---
If anyone else wants to keep playing and enjoy the game, I have no problem with that. If you want to delete the game and never look back, I'm cool with that too.
---
&gt;Nah once the stars are up it doesn't change.
---
[It does change.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/500304724?t=04h23m45s)
---
Nothing is free, not even freedom. You bought the game, you'll buy the items in store. You'll buy the sub to try it when the DLC requires it. It happened before and this time is no different.
---
i came on this mainly to read the stories. but being a good boy scout you asked nicely so i will tell, obviously its nothing like yours lol.
---
a couple months ago i was travelling around minding my own business just scrap collecting, was near flatwoods i believe. i bring up the map and happen to notice someone was wanted, low level like 15 i think or something (i was around 100 at the time i believe). they were being chased by a group of even lower leveled people except for one who was in the mid 40s. they were near Poseidon so i just fast traveled there and ran into them. with my mic on all i could hear was the 40 guy yelling out at the 15 saying "DUDE WTF?!? GIMME BACK MY SHIT!!!" so i took out my sniper rifle and one shot the guy. 40 guy got his stuff back and explained that the 15 guy ambushed him and managed to kill him with a couple of well placed mines. 
---
level 15 guy comes back takes a shot at me, tries to run when he didn't one shot me so i pull out of my shotgun, chase him down and take him out. comes back again, gives me the angry emoji and leaves. i didn't bother trying to find him again cause sure enough he would find me. by this time the people i usually play with are on and we just hanging around my camp chatting up. well go figure this persistent little 15 comes back with a group of 3 level 150+ people, all i thought was "oh for fuck sakes"... sure enough not being prepared at that time myself and my friends get blown away. we all respawn only to see these dicks attacking my camp, so we fight back only kill one of the higher leveled people and the 15. we again die and have to respawn, only this time the dude i helped out before showed up with a group of 3 level 100+ people. needless to say we managed to kick their asses, they never bothered to come back for their loot which wasn't much to being with, the 15 guy came back gave me the angry emoji again and with my mic i just said "dude, don't steal peoples shit it ain't cool, if you want help we can help you. i helped out these people and now i've got a mini army backing me up".... he gave all of us the thumbs down emoji and logged off.
---
like i said nothing like yours, but that's how i work
---
Scroll down.
---
Yeah put mischief night in the search bar
---
That's a bug, they said they'll be fixing it within a couple of updates
---
Ok Santa
---
So it's the Microsoft tax!
---
That's a shame my friend.
---
Nope, once you join you're bound by Bethesdas terms for the remainder of your time on earth... Should've read the fine print!
---
So in other words acting like a bunch of 4yr olds... see I recognize this trait *looks over at son...*  it's too bad really... if a few people can still come up with new exciting things... everyone can.  Or as stated above just let it yo and move on.
---
Thanks for the comment.  
---
BTW The following Glasses have the same issue.  
---
ATX\_Mothman\_Glasses "Mothman Glasses" \[ARMO:00567438\]
---
Haha yeah that would be one theory. And an evil one too, because sometimes people don‚Äôt believe you!
---
If the information got past OP so far, I don't have a lot of confidence that me explaining it now would make a difference.
---
I have to work on a car so like 6 maybe I added you so just join me
---
what I meant is that Bethesda is gonna say whatever to peddle atoms, so long it's not verifiable so it could be true and you can't prove otherwise :\^)
---
An Edward Gorey style loot bag would be just fantastic.
---
I‚Äôve heard that they hang around after their owner leaves the server but I‚Äôve never actually seen it myself.
---
Bethesda Administration: beatiful rainbows
---
:3 by good items I mean nuka colas and stimpacs. Only things people carry are boring handmades.
---
You get what you pay for. If you want 1st you'll pay.
---
You realize that with most online games you don't even get anywhere near this many seasonal items right?  Of all the online games I've played over the years a seasonal event might give a single outfit and one or two decorations.  The only reason 76 even has this many Halloween decorations for you to complain about in the first place is that a lot of them were already in the game because of the lore.
---
Once it runs out your subscription will automatically terminate.  The risk of buying a year in advance is wanting to cancel, but the reward is a heavily discounted price.
---
Request sent!
---
Then why have dataminers found ‚Äúseeds‚Äù in the .exe?
---
Could have just been on a laggy server. It happens with every multiplayer game.
---
Hovering Liberator, NICE! lol  They're just evolving, don't worry about that little guy.
---
You cant use the scrap box without the subscription. You keep it, but it's useless as far as I've heard and seen.
---
So I use like five to ten accounts simultaneously, switching and resetting my modem when I get a temp ban or when I Unidan a post. When one gets banned from enough subreddits that it becomes inconvenient to use I sell it to one of these companies. If you know how to negotiate, a year-old account with a few badges and around 20k comment karma (which is like the low end of what they're looking for) can net you upwards to $150-$200. It's not a ton of money, but it's an extra thousand a year for the shit-posting I would do normally.
---
It's really fun to check out the user page for the account after selling and see which company it was resold to, you'd be surprised at who buys them. Some are just random shitty companies that post like 5 times trying to promote their product but are immediately called out as a shill (at which point you can often recover the account and re-sell it) but some are some really prominent companies.
---
You're not the target audience.
---
Thanks.  I've been wanting to test the whole "wait until the mist is gone to attack the sentry bot so it can gain stars" theory but have been stuck at work.
---
Yeah I dunno I haven't crashed once. However, I had several CTDs when trying to join a server, either Adventure or NW. Basically, the game is just as fucked as it was at launch, stability wise, and Bethessa has zero intention of fixing it because they can milk the cash cows anyway.
---
I did this yesterday, but with halloween candy and toilet paper and alas, in a regular baggie.
---
You won‚Äôt be able to put items in, but you can take them out!
---
So any new scrap you get will have to go in your stash, but anything you can fill up in a month will be saved!
---
Fair enough, you got me there. I won't bother posting anymore negativity here, it won't make a difference anyway. To each his own. I don't care that much anyway lol. Well, have a nice day! It's all love üíï
---
Oh forks! You got me now! Ok everyone, notify the rage media. ;) On a side note. Tried solo again and failed miserably. Hahaha oof.
---
That's pretty cool. I gotta say, the community for this game is pretty nice. Sure there are some griefers, but for the most part, the people playing are really great. Very creative.
---
Mow your neighbors lawn for cash and buy it. Should only take an hour lol
---
Saying that it is impossible to use a hat with them because uses its slot not the glasses one.
---
Pubg\*
---
Makes sense. You moving through the environment slower means things don't need to change/render as quickly, which means less packets flying through the interwebz, thus lowering the potential for things to get all garbled in transit.
---
Halloween is the only holiday for which I decorate IRL, so all the halloween specific plans have lots of appeal. 
---
There are a couple threads pleading we wait through the green glow phase so the bot mutates to a higher  star level, but it appears either noone believes it, or don't have the patience to do so.
---
If your on xbox i could build one for you
---
My dude I just wanted to toss out some suggestion for what helped me not crash during the event
---
It is no good for PvP players but luckily I despise PvP and avoid it at all costs
---
Minecraft\*
---
A Neil Breen DVD in a brown paper bag.
---
That makes sense. i was honestly interested in hearing if the actual damage counted toward the event
---
I played all day,not loggin in tonight.think we have different time zones,i live in Europe time.u American?
---
The .exe isn't tied to your account or your character.  The exact same seeds exist in every copy of the executable.
---
Plus, they're used for a number of perfectly legitimate things that aren't related to screwing you out of good drops.
---
You guessed it
---
&gt; Respectfully, I don‚Äôt see how it does 
---
Let me try.
---
&gt;The problem with this game lies **solely** with bad PR, and awful marketing.
---
[Here's one definition.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solely) 
---
[Here's another.](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/solely)
---
"To the exclusion of all else"
---
So, you say in the title that the blame is 100% due to PR and Marketing "to the exclusion of all else". This means you are saying that the actual gameplay issues are not part of the problems the game is facing. 
---
So, to recap:
---
You:
---
&gt; **The problem with this game lies solely with bad PR, and awful marketing.** 
---
Response to you:
---
&gt;The title of this thread alone is preposterous.  
---
&gt;This game has a LOT of problems. The PR and marketing are just one tiny slice of this bullshit pie. The game is laggy, buggy, unfinished, prone to crashes, and has "pay to expedite" mechanics. It recycles the engine from Fallout 4, which was not designed for online multiplayer stuff. There are still major glitches that Bethesda has made no attempt to address. They have lied right to our faces repeatedly. Finally, they introduce this Fallout 1st nonsense, lie about its features, and grossly misrepresent what you're actually getting.  
---
&gt;The fact that anyone out there is still defending this flaming mound of garbage is astounding. At this point, anyone still saying Fallout 76 is great and Zenimax loves us is either on the damage control team payroll or is a raving lunatic.
---
Your response to this:
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt think there is anything in my post that contradicts the points you made. 
---
That's how it's contradictory.
---
You were level 50 in NW or Adventure?
---
I believe the fallout equivalent is a missile.
---
Man I sure hope 100% of fo1st is going back into this game.
---
Unfortunately on PC.
---
Oh nice, I figured I just turned it into a black hole.
---
I can get it back so if we can't meet up its good ill just go pa farming
---
Did you start a new character in adventure and forget to switch over?
---
Yes, but you can't add to it, only use from it.
---
Bethesda may be a turd sandwich, but the people playing are not.
---
Yeah hasn't worked for me. He's either crowned or 1 star
---
Yup! Sounds about right. There was definitely some lag still, but I didn't crash. I will say it's annoying that if I don't want to crash then I need to just crouch while doing the event, but Whitespring has always been known to be a buggy, laggy area. Toss in loads of people and exploding cars and uh, yeah üòÖ
---
Indeed!
---
I am pretty sure he knows ;)
---
I‚Äôm all for the decorations. I just wish it was more than just pumpkins. This is when they should be doing Halloween masks and lighting.
---
Sadly, yes. Much of what you're seeing are adults who never developed healthy coping skills for life conflicts.
---
Maybe? I'm just gonna assume it's gamers doing what gamers do. Having fun.
---
Gw2 admittedly had a better launch then a lot of the other mmos but if you are saying it had no issues the first year then you are lying.
---
Yes, you keep it and can remove existing scrap from it, but cannot put any new scrap into it after the subscription ends.
---
So folks are becoming scrap farmers for the next month in the hopes that they can bank enough scrap for the foreseeable future.
---
Lol. Stay safe. Hopefully may see you one day in the Wastes. 
---
Always free water and food at my C.A.M.P
---
It's still a dick move
---
i was getting a lot of freezing, and my computer is pretty far beyond epic, somehow i don‚Äôt think it was my side
---
I might not be too good at explainging this but place a floor, just a normal wood foundation, place a staricase on the platform, just a basic metal staircase, place a rug on the staircase, place an instrument or something you can interact with on the rug (preferably a bass), then grab the staircase and put it leading into the ground
---
Trading aswell
---
Ok we‚Äôll see,if i see u online anytime soon we meet up,anyway goodluck
---
I didn‚Äôt think of doing that, thats funny.....
---
I'd say probably coincidence. I have seen people run around blowing up cars and the servers held up, so it seems totally random. That said, lot of people getting together and using explosive weapons does seem to increase the chances of lag and crash. I have seen some horrible lags during Scorched Earth when a lot of people use explosive auto weapons on the Queen, to the point where the server stops registering my stims, or sometimes I don't take damage, and at times, the Queen seems to become slow and sluggish and stops moving. Overall, these are signs of under-optimization
---
Thanks I know you didn't  do anything but you offered and I appreciate that
---
You're right on that account :P
---
At this point, I wouldn't be terribly surprised if we were to learn that *most* people at BGS, particularly the locals that actually deal with the game regularly (austin) don't really want to see things go to hell, but that the investors are pushing hard to stabilize the game's revenues (so that instead of huge money coming in around launch, and much less until the next launch, there is a more steady stream happening year round).  That would make it easier to sell their stake in the company, or to help make an IPO successful.
---
REFUND!
---
Saying the amount of bugs and glitches in F76 is somehow "normal"/ not unusual is absurd
---
So he's a shill for being 'overly' positive and lacking widespread gaming experience? That's just unintelligent guys lol
---
Not 100%, I know our overall strategy but not all the details, that's their job and everyone makes mistakes.
---
I believe there's an Atom challenge for this, the "Puckered starfish" award.
---
Oh thats why, thanks you
---
The problem here is not the content of the post, the problem is the title. How do you not see that?
---
Although, your post is chock full of nonsense like:
---
&gt; To your avid everyday Online gamers and hardcore MMO gamers there is nothing too bad or out of the ordinary for where FO76 is currently at other than a lack of dedicated open PVP space. 
---
There is plenty bad. MMO is probably my favorite genre of game. I've never played an MMO at launch that was as buggy as FO76 is. And I say **IS** because it still is a dumpster fire of a game. 
---
Even then, something like WoW (maybe not the best example any more) or FFXIV charge the monthly fee, but they have a constant development cycle that produces new content, balance changes, and bug fixes, as part of that fee.
---
To be fair, nothing about this post is bending over for Bethesda. They're just making the best of what they have. This is something the players are doing for each other. Bethesda has not much to do with it. I think the same way sometimes when it comes to Runequest vs modern MMORPGs. But people like what they like.
---
They like the Fallout world enough to play.
---
Since it is an online game I have been waiting for a big bulk of content and bug fixes to maximize enjoyment. With some titles it takes a couple of years for this to happen, No Man's Sky is a good example of that. I do the same thing with other online titles such as Final Fantasy 14. I'll play for a while, then stop and come back when a bunch of content to chew on has been added. 
---
For Fallout 76 since I stopped playing so early it is hard to tell how bite-sized the content updates are.
---
I love when there is on at an SQB fight, so handy.
---
Some guy complained bout me having my mic open. I told him to mute me if it bothered him, and he got salty. I noticed his camp was south of Watoga station so I went down that way and baited a scorchbeast on to his base. Better than a nuke. I stood on top of his reactor and decon showers till the scorchbeast destroyed them. He finally arrived, his base 80% destroyed, and that's when I blocked him.
---
"You have insulted my honour and for that you must die!"
---
Yea you can respec by leveling a lot and than switching points. idk but im guessing at level 54 you still have new places to find. Start with collecting all locations maybe? thats still fun and not just grinding. Then do all the things that were added after you left maybe? like the burrows,  arktos pharma or the boyscout thing. 
---
Then start farming like crazy, i have daily spots like, whitespring resort, west tek research center, fort defiance and the charleston capitol building.  and yea events. 
---
It never hurts to launch one or two extra nukes either :)
---
Well, I was at Whitespring early this morning and managed to stay out of the way of all the Halloween mobsters long enough for the event to finish.  Got event rewards wearing my Excavator armour and wasn't even trying to participate.  Go figure . . .
---
You guys gonna talk about the reaction to fallout 1st or are you being forced to not speak. I will take you not answering as Bethesda censoring community feedback. I just want to know if you will Ever make a comment because this is insulting at this point.
---
I was going to quit 76 after months of defending it, but this one post saved me. Never stop fighting. Never stop trying to make our game better until Fallout 1st is gone and/refunded. Get your items then refund it like some people are doing, or just don't at all. You think this isn't bad? Maybe not by itself, but kf Bethesda makes a profit off this, you can bet they're going to do even more things like this in future games
---
Yeah Whitespring is already buggy and laggy enough, add in a crap ton of people and exploding cars and laser weapons, you're guaranteed to freeze and/or crash. Have also seen it in SBQ fights, like you mentioned. It's annoying, but hey if crouching and moving slowly keeps me from crashing (knocks on wood) then I'll take it. For now, anyways. Game needs more stability, that's for sure
---
 So this pretty well all consoles I assume.
---
You are probably being downvoted by devs and children/adult children who dont get the problem because capitalism good
---
Bethesda you're gonna have to make better posts than this to convince people to play
---
Ooh cool, thanks for the info guys!
---
On PC I can confirm that the event plays smooth on a private world with only one person on it. The only bugs I have seen in roughly 10 completions of the event was as follows:
---
1. One instance, all of the ghouls in Whitesprings were bugged and staying on the floor hostile but unresponsive. Leaving the server and returning to the same one resolved it.
---
2. JES-2R got stuck during pathing from the second bonfire to the third bonfire for roughly two minutes. It suddenly warped to it's destination.
---
3. The damage bug effected the outcome of the final battle several times. One instance an AA .50MG was healing the Assaultrons more than it was damaging them, switching to a primed Bloodied .50MG managed to overcome the "healing" effect.
---
Yeah I'm on Xbox, probably should have said that in the post!
---
I'm a high level and lately I seem to be getting lower levels (14-30ish) coming at me like *fight me bro*. Well then no free stimpaks from me!
---
The effects can be either usefull or useless depending your playstyle and build, so my character is both lucky and the server can predict what is going to match both my gameplay and build ?  i will make sure to equip my tin foil more often i guess.
---
I understand the first part. That doesn‚Äôt mean the seeds don‚Äôt reference character or account data. 
---
The second part is what I was asking about, what are those legitimate things?
---
It's just a placebo effect tbh, X1X renders all games on the max resolution specified by the dev regardless of our output resolution settings. By setting the output to 720p or 1080p the console is just downscaling the image already rendered in 4k, so there's no good in doing this...
---
Shhh shill
---
Competition is actually good for the businesses that are pricing goods fairly. It‚Äôs bad for the ones trying to jack up prices.
---
I‚Äôm admitting to my first job out of college which I didn‚Äôt spend long at because I found out it was a predatory job like MLM. I was a naive kid and didn‚Äôt know anything I just got excited at a job offer which seemed great at the time. I‚Äôm not attacking anyone? I‚Äôm clarifying that the position does exist and suggesting nobody should immediately discredit someone‚Äôs claims. I am now working in a completely different field doing well, and that company was not ‚Äúvery famous.‚Äù  The comments you have made are egregious and immature. If you would like to discuss my post in a mature manner I can- but this is sad.
---
I am already doing that.
---
Hey, they need their safe space so they can pat each other on the back and tell themselves how worth it that FO1st sub is.
---
To be fair, Second Life is a more of a social platform than a game. And ESO is an entire MMORPG with an incredible amount of content. Fallout 76 is a modified single player game that remains broken in fundamental ways.
---
If Bethesda had managed to fix everything, and add Wastelanders the sub wouldn't have been poorly received. But this is on top of a series of blunders that have been going on for almost an entire year.
---
It's not the service alone that's the problem. I'd pay a sub. If they bothered to make the game as good as it can be before launching the service. But even the service launched broken!
---
And to be fair, ESO was heavily criticized it's first few months. Especially locking Imperials behind a special edition.
---
&gt;Couple in the ridiculous spawn rate of the assaultrons in the final phase and if you dont melt the bosses face off everyone has theirs melted off.
---
I realise that now and it make sense to take out the boss fast, game mechanics needs balancing.
---
Do the trick or treat bowls work more than once? I can't click on them after the first time.
---
Oh, they don't need me to do that. All they need is a keyboard and some Mountain Dew.
---
That‚Äôs silly. Is that what you do in the shop? Most people save for what they want bs wasting on cheap things they don‚Äôt.
---
I think he was probably giving it to you?
---
Youre not build for the bloodied life. I can tell. :-P 
---
I never even use PA really. Even with the SBQ most people now just let it come outside the circle so you dont need one.
---
There was talk some time ago that the bait bomb you learn will make them land. Maybe someone who has tried it out can back me up.
---
This is a good idea, I‚Äôd like to see it!
---
Some of them refresh straight away, some need few seconds. Some can't be refreshed. But mostly clickable multiple times.
---
My game runs smoothly. I‚Äôm sorry yours doesn‚Äôt. I used to crash a lot at launch, and honestly it‚Äôs been months now since I‚Äôve had a crash.
---
They're probably confused because so many people are still buying into the scam and keep giving them money. Why fix anything if you're still getting paid?
---
wait. you really think more people buy utility than cosmetics? imo its completely the other way around.
---
why would you even buy a repair kit when you can get the better repair kit for free in game?
---
Just poop (spoiled) sacks. All in fun, usually if they leave their bedroom/house unlocked. I think next I'm going sleep in people's beds. 
---
Especially is true for high vending machine prices.
---
Shotgun with Enforcer 3 perk works for me.
---
more like your wants matched the seeded rolls, not the other way around like you implied.
---
no tinfoil involved here, though. seeds are a very basic mechanic. and if you look at the Fo4 legendary generation system you'll understand why it's perfectly plausible.
---
I wouldn't wear 90% of the shit in the store even if it was free it's mostly freaking ugly. I guess they wanted to cater to the fortnite crowd where everyone looks like a dumbass.
---
 And then they're shocked that the Atom store revenue was garbage.
---
Little bastards are almost immune to even my most effective weapons... shooting a level 16 Rad Rat with a level 50 Armor-Piercing Lever-Action .45 cal Rifle with exploding bullets with area damage, and 100 damage, should PULVERIZE the little bastards in one shot.
---
But it routinely takes 3-4 shots to do the work. WHYYYYY?!?!
---
We need a super high gravity applying plasma caster, get some people blasting at it consistnetly while others cryolator them to keep them still. Next thing you k ow shes stuck on the ground nearly froze. Solid.
---
Sound like someone from the That Fallout Show podcast.
---
I took breaks XP
---
Most people just want the outfit Because its iconic and easily the best outfit that they have put on the store.
---
You would hate mine, he has a cell and when I get tired of him I boot him out of the ufo and he falls off a cliff
---
Where are some bowls at?
---
You do and I bet they are kicking themselves over this decision.
---
If I see someone with a bobblehead stand and If I happen to have the bobblehead they are missing and they're at their base with me, I'll give them the missing bobblehead seeing as how I dont have the schematics for the bobblehead stand
---
Iirc you can change them independently, Death and dropped bags.
---
I've been doing it on my heavy gunner. It's possibly the most fun event in the game. Because it uses the areas natural spawns there's no waves of one mob then tab out until the next wave like a lot of the events. Throw in the huge explosions and I'm living out my 80's action movie fantasies.
---
Bethesda have officially lost their minds.
---
Cool. Glad that works for you. 
---
Not everyone is running that specific build.
---
I think this is just a placebo effect.
---
I've done the event 5 times now and haven't had any issues so far.  No freezing or crashes.  I'm playing on PS4.
---
3 toilet papers a day from Big Al's tattoo shop lol
---
If the forks show up..
---
Some hairstyles would be nice, instead of drip feeding like, 4 or 5 terrible ones. It's like they've never actually looked at what people mod into their games.
---
China is asshoe?
---
Interesting. Definitely will try that out!
---
I need to get in the habit of doing the Dailies. I tend to start, and then get distracted.
---
Last night, I tried to do the Huntmaster's quest where you kill one each of three different baddies. It gave me a Honeybeast, a Mirelurk, and a Mongrel, and 25 minutes to complete the quest.
---
Got the first two in about two minutes.
---
But the mongrel was supposed to be in an area that was COMPLETELY OVERRUN with Radstags - like 20 of them - and then five different Yao Guai showed up and slaughtered the Radstags. Then Super Mutants showed up and killed all but one of the Yao Guai. I just stayed hidden and watched the whole thing unfold.
---
This happened 3 different times, and the timing clock for the quest never went below 23 minutes left.
---
It was weird.
---
You've raised good points. However the Second Life came up  because it is an immersion and people do play on sims which have combat and action and respawn 'like' Fallout 76. And for 'crap' items, the business owners don't have nor will get purchase. People demand top quality. 
---
It seems more that you're irritated, as am I, that Beth Q/A lived up to it's poor expectations (Nonexistant. Fallout 3/Skyrim/New Vegas/4/76 were all Alpha or Pre Alpha on launch)
---
I welcome criticism. Don't care about criticism. But to come in and go 'Lol you suck' when a person's sharing a small amusing ancedote? Meh. That I object to.
---
Good read.
---
They would have earned more from the atom shop if they reduced the prices 50%.  I rarely use it due to it beeing waaay to expensive.
---
Half price, sell shitloads more.
---
Wtf you can do that?
---
I have to wonder how any of us made it in to Vault 76 - for being the "best and brightest," why did we leave the vault with all of our SPECIAL stats at 1?
---
Great I will have a go ...do you mean place a rug at the top of the staircase ?
---
as long as being pedantic holds up in courts everyday, I'll continue being pedantic.
---
Just use a shotgun 4Head
---
Their hottest selling items were the fridge and the collectron. People bought them because useful robot &gt; cosmetics. Repair kits and scrap kits are fast ways to get back into ship shape, and not everyone has time/patience to farm them, and if a few bucks can last you a while. Not everyone who plays goes all out on every mechanic all the time.
---
Of course unless they release that sort of data we'll never really know, but, you know. The thread is tagged Speculation.
---
No problem, I speak from experience lol
---
&gt; steal and would
---
Voice "recognition"?
---
Melee, highest I've gotten was 7k. If you get a Bloody Swing Speed +1 STR  meathook you can go even higher, it synergizes with unyielding, nerd-rage, unarmed, one handed, twisted muscle, and talons.
---
I've spent money on one thing, and that was a Power Armor skin pack. I farmed atoms for everything else.
---
Don‚Äôt trust China
---
No, China numbah one!
---
I don't know what to think exactly, i can't deny it can be a pretty strong system to make trade beetwen players more important, i noticed myself looting a lots of bloody and unyelding pieces with my build intended to play this way, it's still very RNG tho :D
---
Some effects are inarguably better than others, regardless of playstyle. There is no build where bash damage is better than faster fire or explosive.
---
Down a couple steps on the staircase
---
Well, the ammo itself is lighter than the mats but Bandolier only affects ammo in your inventory, not your stash, right?
---
Exactly. Half price on the Atomic Shop would sell way better, and they could bundle stuff. I'd buy bundles all the time if the stuff was worth it.
---
There have been divisions of Sony that sued other divisions of Sony, they seem to be doing alright.
---
Why use google when you can post a question in here and get the answer just a few hours later?
---
Camp cosmetics, pointless like everything in camps except workbenches, instruments and beds. My camp doesn't have walls now just a 1x1 base, a stair and workbenches, all I need. I sleep and play music in other people's camps.
---
I do have a worthless cow that I can never milk, so there's that.
---
beautiful
---
Ok great many thanks
---
Me too but not for beds, I leave a beer whenever I visit someone's camp that has a dedicated bar in it :)
---
Thanks, cop.
---
Afraid you won't, maybe in the next one. But it is appreciated though.
---
sure, officer.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking
---
Ah so you mean the game is using the ram but not releasing them properly?
---
you make that much cash on patrol?
---
Destiny has the same problem.
---
Tbh I felt very little connection between the two games. The outer worlds felt much more like a borderlands rpg.
---
Do the daily and weekly atom challenges and you don't have to pay $18. They don't charge 18$, they charge 1800 atoms
---
well those too are functional cosmetic items imo. i thought utility in reference to the scrap and repair kits. but i get your point now! and yea those are the hot cakes. like the Mr. Fuzzy ride. i bought that. not the fridge or the annoying robot tho. but thats just my taste lol. id love to see more of those type of items. Even just Neon lights that flicker would be nice. Even a spooky door would have been fun. like it opens and closes at random times or something.
---
&gt; learn that RNG is seeded
---
There's very little funnier than people using technical terms that they do not understand.
---
Ok many thanks
---
whitest of knights
---
I'm just saying the general audience for Second Life, is probably more predisposed towered paying for premium things. It's a different culture.
---
I'm pissed off with Bethesda's lack of competence and contempt for it's most loyal fans. These people put up with so much, and Bethesda can't even take a break long enough to build any good will. I've never seen a company do this much horrible stuff for this long without some kind of stopgap of goodwill.
---
I welcome criticism too. It's healthy. And I agree, if one is just gonna show up and say "you suck", one is not worth listening to.
---
I understand that part.  I think they were referring to the "destroy vehicles" sections.  ie car go boom from big bomba, make many progress all at once.
---
I usually leave a toothbrush and toothpaste on people's stashboxes and beds. Gotta keep up the dental hygiene.
---
I'm solo, have no friends, play the game on my own, there is no purpose in any of this camp building stuff unless it has utility.
---
I sometimes enjoy other camps but they seem mostly carbon copy vomit dumps of everything they can cram into it the space, all the same and boring.
---
Had this happen yesterday. I had fun. Loot was certainly better, lol.
---
I would assume it probably does.
---
Most people completely left the server once the sirens went off.
---
Every game does that though. Especially online games.
---
Last night I went to Whitesprings and there are candy bowls at each door to go trick or treating. You can collect candy there and then use it for your drop bags. :)
---
You can take candy from the bowls relatively quick, I usually run between two grabbing the candy from them to fill the meter fastest.
---
They are in a crate, near lawns border closer to Whitesprings main entrance.
---
Seeds are used for a lot of things, it's hard to even narrow down a list.  But they are used for random number generators commonly.  The fact that there is a seed is expected, and the fact that the same seed is used in every executable (at least per platform, though I'd expect it's the same for them all) means that there is nothing you can claim to be nefarious.
---
A seed is just a starting point for a 'list' of random numbers.  Computers can't really do anything 'random', but they can get close.  They can say 'your random number is the Xth digit of pi, and all subsequent random numbers are the next digit', and the seed would be what X is.  (That's a horrible example and isn't real, so just use that as an illustration).
---
CAN a seed reference your character somehow?  Sure, it's possible, something like, in the above example, the seed is X plus the number of characters in your user name.  But that only sets the start point slightly differently, it doesn't change every random number to something that never gives you a TSE.
---
Since the game is *constantly* rolling random numbers for you, every time you approach a mob or container, there's never any way to know what point on that list of random numbers you're on, so there's really no way to accidentally make a seed do something like people are suggesting, without either doing it on purpose, or though criminal levels of stupidity.  I can't guarantee that there's no stupidity in the game, but I can assure you with very reasonable surety that there aren't any 'cursed' characters or accounts.
---
Dude... reading shit like this... I think I'm done man.
---
I'm a 1st member because it was the best deal for atoms for the Halloween package, but I read shit like this and feel like they care more about the store than the game. That has always been there priority from the start and sadly their best content and rewards cost atoms. Cheap duffle bags, hardly any content, false advertising, unfinished, unpolished, constant lies, unplayable events.
---
I've been playing some new games that game out, OW, BL3, etc, and coming back to 76 afterwards is such a bummer. I log in, get my piece of shit lvl 45 legendary with dumb perks on a weapon type that I don't even use for 100 scripts and log out.
---
See you guys in Wastelanders. Maybe. I'll probably be a shit show like everything else. Sorry for the rant, these comments from passionate players got me fuggin' mad.
---
I have to start putting the actual suggestion in the titled of my "suggestion" posts, instead in the of the body. I should have titled this **"Let Us Use Our Pipboy When We Are Sitting".**
---
Same here, although chairs do suit a purpose if you have a musical instrument next to it
---
He's a guy whose last name rhymes with "fuck 'em"
---
&gt; Lmao you had to google slippery slope. 
---
To hyperlink it to you as to prove my point? Yes, I did.
---
&gt; Then you went on to regurgitate logical fallacy without knowing what it means.  
---
No, I went on to say that your post was inflammatory towards people for no reason at all. You were unnecessarily hostile to those who have done nothing to you, and shouldn't be surprised when people react poorly. You didn't make a post discussing the monetization of fallout 76, you made a post blaming and flaming people who have paid for in game items. The fact I need to spell that out for you makes me wonder if you understand why people reacted negatively at all.
---
Like your English mistakes?
---
Exactly. As it is now the value of the items is not large enough compared to the price they ask for a virtual item.
---
I have bought, but only when discounted. I dont mind spending money, but i have my limits.
---
I read the tip here on reddit and got it to work a few times.
---
But I haven‚Äôt been able to analyze why it didn‚Äôt work on some occasions. I never kept track of what I did, if I made some damage first or not for instance. Or how far away from the bait it was.
---
I do think more people buy those than you may expect, but I don't speculate they're as hot as the Fridge and Robot were, and that's what they're thinking of: A CAMP item that actually gives and in-game benefit, like...I dunno, a cap press? God that's a terrible idea, I feel dirty just having thought of it.
---
But yeah, interactable objects would be awesome. I'd love to make a build around stuff like that; my current house is build on a pond with a windmill sticking out of it. I've gotten nothing but compliments.
---
Maybe we find a Holotape containing a system upgrade that hadn't been implemented yet, and when plugging it in starts the daily quests?
---
Same and I agree.  The glowing ghouls and flux even persisted for each future event run even after the nuke zone had cleared.  So I was running  the event like normal but with better loot and enemies.
---
i swear its not random because for whatever reason out of all the weapons there are... at least 20% of all the weapons i got were harpoons. Like theres something about my character that makes those spawn, i guess (unless everyone always gets those?!) And no i was never looking for one (until i got a exploding instigating one that i fletched)
---
Ahh ok cool. Statement retracted.

Please read our wiki page on this subject

Hey, degen, check someone's post history before shoving your foot in your mouth like it's the last beautiful, crispy paint chip on your nursery wall.
---
Putting 5k pounds of Bohemoth bats into somebody‚Äôs stash, permanently corrupting it
---
Shhhh. That's part of the joke.
---
For the same reason I'm on the blizzard sub: I enjoy watching a good dumpster fire.
---
Shes so mad she sent her husband out :D kinda sweet tho.
---
No one likes a gummy wasteland.
---
Was trying to point out that google is faster, my dude.
---
I steal lead from their extractors and take their scrap bot scrap and purified water when nothing is locked.
---
I'm  a monster.
---
Haha yeah
---
How does that even happen? did she put it on the ground before it crashed?!
---
I just tried it and it didnt start again. For real.
---
Are 5‚Äôs entirely out of the question?
---
Maybe it's because I'm also playing multiple games right now, I try not to focus on one lol
---
Correct you can have 20k ammo for like 5 pounds on your player
---
If its anything like the hero of the wasteland statue, its going to be quite a few updates üòë
---
That's just it-I *do* want some of the stuff in the shop. It's just...Too expensive, so I'm stingy with my atoms, and FOMO's never really worked on me.
---
I know but I had runs where the forks just didn't show up.
---
Todd is your Godd now
---
I‚Äôm not claiming nefarious. I‚Äôm just referencing the data supported theory that the way they implemented seeding has made some characters more ‚Äúlucky‚Äù. The bug round up guy seems to understand the mechanics of this game quite well and has collected thousands of data points. I‚Äôll continue to trust his work.
---
I also have 4k and the one x, I've often wondered if the clarity of the game disrupts the mechanics of it.
---
On PS4 I think your subscriptions can be found in settings -&gt;account or something like that
---
Hah im at a pond too. way down south and id love to  have more of such items. OOOH my last one was the halloween smoke machine. I love it.
---
God damnit. Like I said, I could feel that that was a slow moment for me, but for the life of me I couldn't figure it out.
---
I don't know how anyone would know I was a first player to begin with.
---
I mean his job is to speak on behalf of the company my guess is he doesn‚Äôt really agree with everything they tell him to say but he says it cause it‚Äôs his job
---
How do you know me so well?
---
Someone said something about nuking it based on the number of Fallout 1st icons seen in the server.
---
You like troubleshooters?! just because of mischief night or in general?
---
Also are you sure you still have script to earn? (Like those 150 you can earn per day)
---
A CM acknowledged there is a bug with jetpacks, specifically that it triggers too early when jumping. Who knows when they will fix it though, it's been an issue for months. Makes jetpacks hardly usable, I'm usually out of AP before I even reach my max jump height (I have Marsupial).
---
Maybe not a skyscraper lol but I would like a little bit more. Thing is the atomic shop is constantly showcasing new things for your C.A.M.P,  I understand that said items are mostly cosmetic,  but being able to incorporate most if not all would be cool. 
---
I dont think we need a whole 4 acres lol but adding on to what I already have is just fine.... for me anyway
---
Maybe go to trading for this one.
---
This should help.
---
https://youtu.be/GIukh6xshy0
---
I crashed about 7 times before I just stopped trying. gg bugthesda. glad I paid for fo1st and can't even play past the loading screen üôÉ
---
Seeing the Stash Box, Ranger Outfit, or if you applied the gamer icon would all be dead giveaways
---
I've seen where people tried to hide the stash box, but the way camps can load in piece by piece I'd reckon people can still see them.
---
 Thanks for the heads up. ;)
---
Not sure. I've been trying it every 24 hours and that resets them, try 12.
---
I once saw 4 orphaned bots at WS Station.
---
Ha yeah everybody has those moments though!
---
If they really expect people to pay a subscription for an option to buy even more content they‚Äôre dumb AF
---
And who is the target audience then ?
---
I can hear Ron Burgundy Saying ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Believe You‚Äù... 
---
Sorry but you don‚Äôt sound at all like a 1st subscriber... like at all...
---
Yes, I understand cosmetics, what I should have put in the title was the suggestion to allow to access our pipboy when sitting.
---
Not familiar with the exploit, but it would not surprise me. sometimes those lag a lot.
---
And check all the train stations!
---
I was asleep in someone‚Äôs camp one day (they had left one door locked and the other open). I had a giggle at it when they found me until they brought out the ProSnap. Then it was creepy. I ain‚Äôt doing that again!
---
As long as I'm the one benefiting from it.
---
I think that you can get raw data to say whatever you want it to.
---
The cosmetic items for example are a one purchase, and you are done. It counts as one item sold.
---
Scrap and repair kits come in packs of ten, and are repeatable buys.
---
So if i buy one outfit and a pack of repair and scrap kits, i have bought one cosmetic and twenty "utility" items.
---
multiply that up by thousands of players and in the space of one year we have sold 2 million cosmetics, but in the space of two months we have sold 8 million cosmetics.
---
You can also inflate that number quite a bit with the bundled kits that came with the very popular bundles that included an outfit, lower cost atoms..and the kits.
---
In my mind Bethesda has had this time line for these items planned since the start, if the game had functioned and was as successful as they had planned then the pushback likely would not be as significant as people would be paying for an experience that was "worth it" rather than being asked to pay for an experience that..."well it is ok i guess. Fun sometimes but bogged down with issues that shouldnt be there"
---
Next atom shop items will be communist based so there you go why was that on the game
---
If you really wanna get reduced weight don't buy 1st to tell Bethesda that it should be a part of the base game.
---
Yeah I feel ya - I mean I could be wrong. Im just going over their choice of language " offer is exclusive to "
---
Items in vending machines show as one big lump (when viewing from stash or inside a the ‚Äúsell‚Äù UI in a vending machine). They used to indicate when the item was on a different vending machine.
---
Naked mobs that are frozen in place and invincible.
---
Pretty much ya, they act like children throwing a tantrum in the grocery store when mom or dad wont buy them what they want. Worse thing Bethesda could do is listen to those whiners cause it would validate the behavior. Game is far from perfect plenty of flaws but I still enjoy it. Constructive criticism is good. Autistic Shit Fits and screeching and crying isn't. For every comment I see that has actual criticism there's 10 more troll one just SCREEEEEEEEECHING. It happens with every game nowadays which baffles me cause they still go out and buy it and cry about it. If you dont like it dont buy it, it's that simple. And that's my 2 cents
---
Imagine being a poor.
---
Well from what I heard they do eat up ram but they also release them, a well optimized game should not eat up all you ram like this, fuck this shitty engine.
---
Still have scrip to earn, just can't get it to cash in.
---
And in this case TS is Two-Shot. Since this character is a shotgun surgeon build, that was a sweet find.
---
from the big blue sign that you keep your junk in, that is twice the size of a standard stash box.
---
Honestly if you‚Äôre someone who regularly spends money buying atoms, it‚Äôs a pretty good deal. Even a 1 month is kinda like saying the ncr outfit is about 1700 atoms, and you technically only paid $12 instead of $17. Not saying I support Fallout 1st in anyway (private should be free, not to mention game changing items), but I bet this is a reason why some people got it. Note: haven‚Äôt checked the atom cost since launch but this is assuming it‚Äôs still $5=500atoms
---
All you seem to do is doubt anyone that says anything at all.
---
No you're right. On the X, if a game asks what output resolution it's using it will always get back 4K, so the game has no way of knowing if its ok to go down in resolution in order to increase performance. 
---
On PS4 Pro however the game can ask what output resolution is being used and it will get the actual resolution back and can adjust accordingly. Because of that it's beneficial for some games to change your video output to 1080p to get higher framerates etc.
---
Are there not included atoms with 1st sub though?
---
We have that saying in Australia too.
---
would be curious is this is how it works or not.
---
I came across a Pro-Trump sign over someone‚Äôs bed so I jumped up on it and left a loot bag of fertilizer as a present. Sadly the server crashed before I even left their camp.
---
So YOU bought my Nukashine!
---
9th: crashed on loading screen.
---
Not if you store it between uses.
---
Can you show a screenshot of it please?
---
I'll see what I can do
---
good be part of the problem as much as you want. you are so ignorant. so sad
---
If you had access to their financials and saw tons of people were buying it would that change your outlook?
---
I thought it would ‚Äúmake my year‚Äù 
---
Instead it killed the game for me üòÇ
---
There are, 1650.  So i guess it depends how many Atoms these cost.  There are a bunch of the camo ones, one for each armor I think in game- but they might stagger them for purchase or shit, i guess it could be one huge pack?  Dunno yet
---
Yes. 1650 a month.
---
That's ok. I dont want to take ingame money from the poors that couldn't afford Fallout 1st. It's the only money they have after all.
---
Sure, but I reckon quite a few subscribers aren't doing that...though this is just an assumption.
---
Assuming that I even had the box out, they'd have to break into my house to see it through a level 3 lock to even see it.
---
I dont really care about they're reactions. I'm giving them information. They do with it what they will.
---
Ok no worries. Then send a ticket to Bethesda, really they will help you as they did with all the people with reseted characters, lost characters, lost items, etc...
---
my guess is its a bunch of haters still upset at 1st subscribers. 
---
What better way to hit a bunch of them all at once than to nuke an event they are all at.
---
People are just riding the anti-76 hype. They've been waiting for something to *really* complain about and Bethesda has served it up on a silver platter.
---
One shotting the sheepsquatch just as it comes out of the ground.
---
Absolute gaurenteed way to make people do the angry face and question mark emotes, and I also imagine a lot of cussing behind the keyboard.
---
One time I even had a Chinese dude turn his mic on and say some gibberish while hitting me with a slesge, he sounded pissed.
---
I'll be sure to do that thanks!
---
Camo paints look dope as fuck.
---
Well hi! We're so glad you decided to join us and offer up such a pearl of wisdom.
---
It may come as a shock to you, but I don't have first, either.
---
Have a wonderful day! :)
---
Glad to help
---
I had a CTD last night in the middle of something that made me pissed enough to not re-log
---
I can‚Äôt do any of this cuz my game freezes most of the time I do the event... froze 3/5 times I‚Äôve done it üòÅ
---
Only time will tell. One thing we know, its gonna get some people riled up I'm sure.
---
Let's see how perfect that works..
---
YOU DESERVE IT!
---
:/ I dont experience that cause I solo on a private server so I'm sorry you have to experience the lag.
---
What do ya know its fixed huh
---
No doubt at all... I‚Äôve met plenty of awesome people in the wasteland and in different groups! 
---
Sorry but it‚Äôs pretty obvious the OP has issues with Bethesda yet they support Bethesda with buying a subscription? Right...
---
No clue what any of those locations are
---
Exact bug in Fallout 4. I had to make a new save file since it was permanent.
---
During the event, slightly out of line but it is mischief night. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Before the event, it's a must do.
---
I'm all for it, but in all honestly I'm hoping for a little bit more, such as any surviving Order members (not that the story leaves much room for it, though given all the bodies, it's no too far out that a few survived, found there was nothing to come back to, and fell in with the Responders) coming back or us actively rebuilding as the head headteacher/guildmaster when Wastelanders arrives.
---
Pardon me? I didn't understand you sorry.
---
Probably not, I do because the blue box clashes with the orange rugs (and there simply isn't much room in the house to begin with)
---
In any case, had this happened to me, I'd simply give the thumbs up emote followed by the robot.  My main's store is a RP store where I sell "cooking supplies" (Cream, Sugar, Honey, Salt, Pepper, Spices, Wood), i'm not going to feel bad over not making 15 caps.
---
I'd be more than happy to look over what they're talking about if you point me in that direction, I'm interested in that stuff on a number of levels (I'm a data analytics manager).  I'd be interested to see what it is they've dug up.
---
I'm also posting a follow up to my last post with a bit more info just to be clear on a couple things, since it's gotten a little deeper than a single post.  It doesn't change anything but it does (to some extent) explain that what you're reading from those other bug hunters (and how they're not necessarily wrong).
---
Lever or handmade
---
Let us guess what these future utility items may be. Or not... Anything you say can and may be used and sold back to you hehe.
---
Dunno why you got downvoted
---
You can wether do some vault raids, events, questlines, side mission enjoy the community etc...
---
I have enjoyed Mischief Night.
---
Have noticed an increase in Gamers last 2 Days.
---
Lol. What a poor
---
I log back on and I'm back to my normal level
---
Me neither XD, wait what hahaha üòÇ Why?
---
Well this one time, in bandit camp...
---
After a year, with all the initial purchases, after all the atom points I (we) bought, can we have a stable game where this isn't an issue.
---
Before the event is fine. This was launched and targeted during which was incredibly frustrating.
---
Well, in their defense, this person only had one other post of "Do you not have wallets" on this sub.....
---
Wish I could get that suit! Still no luck yet!
---
Lever or pipe bolt. Depends how you play.
---
That was fast XD. Welp, enjoy then friend maybe it was a display error.
---
Have a good one
---
Given that they doing bulk ammo, the ammo press is almost assuredly coming
---
You to man! Thanks for the help!
---
I started playing just after Xmas, and I did have fun with it.  But with their numerous broken promises I called it quits.  Fallout First was the final straw that drove me to uninstall the game entirely.  As much as I love the setting and lore, enough is enough.  I have other things to do and play.
---
The servers have indeed been full!
---
your a monster!
---
Dude lighten the fuck up.  Christ, the personal attacks on the OP is not warranted.
---
I got a skull mask
---
Why post this? You can literally preview every camp item in and out of the atom shop without owning it or knowing the plans.
---
You were told exactly what you were getting when you bought tricentennial, you received that. I don't know why people who bought tricentennial somehow thing they deserve anything special
---
Yeah I got Fallout 1st for free since I've had a code for months on xbox what I've never really needed so I figured I'd use it on this since I'm not really using my own cash I've worked for and then I can give my own opinion on ot which I personally think is pretty fair and 5 minutes into buying it I'm surrounded my 5 different people smacking me and using the money emote, its hilarious.
---
You do know asking (even politely) this will generate more nukes right?
---
Online multiplayer is what the world wants.
---
I dont disagree, I just think they did it for a different reason than I normally think, instead of trying to pad the pockets of Zenimax execs (I am sure there is some of that), Zenimax owes a venture capital firm (or some similar concept) a shit ton of money and I think that company is out of patience and wants to be done with the whole thing, so Zenimax is trying to speed up the process of getting them their money, it seems like Zenimax is all but done with the video game industry and I do wonder what the future holds for bethesda, will they inherit Zenimax's properties and turn things around, or will they be hung out to dry. Bethesda gets a lot of hate on here, but I think the lion's share of the blame lands on Zenimax for terrible decision making and getting in bed with what are essentially loan sharks.
---
Yelp might be an exception, as they are not a retailer and aren't getting a cut of everything reviewed on their site. Still a bit surprising though. They fine businesses or the actual reviewers? Seems like it would be hard to enforce either way.
---
Are you using a 1st icon? That may make a difference.
---
I'm getting decent sales, but the only thing I have visible is the scrapbox in one of my crafting tents.
---
Depends on pve or pvp.  Also what perks you have.  So some more info please
---
Oh I'm so sorry. I'll have it removed right away!
---
Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but gamings already mostly fucked. They're just following a trend to get money. Also dunno if you knew this but the Austin branch of Bethesda that runs the game at some stage was looking for people for microtransaction related crap. So it was always gonna happen.
---
It's fine to be sceptical about what's gonna happen in the future, I hope the Maryland branch doesn't follow the Austin one in microtransaction related things with the next game, but honestly, there's no stopping them from doing this. Corporations don't just want money, they want all the money.
---
I'm going to follow up my last comment to make a couple clarifications, but I want the first one to be the one that sinks in first. 
---
It is *absolutely* possible to design a system so poorly that random rolls don't produce random results.  Generally you have to really mess up the programming in ways that don't really have anything to do with the random numbers. 
---
BGS *has* done this in the past in smaller things (like the 0 star legendary debacle), but the results are quite easy to see when that happens.  It usually means they eliminate whole results (like no one *ever* gets the 2-shot legendary), and it usually results from coding something like 'give me a random number from 1-10, and use that to pick one of these 11 choices'.  Not a problem with the random number, but with the coding.
---
Even at a programming level, most coders don't understand how random number generators work, so it's not surprising how there's some misinformation out there.  You code in x=rnd(10), and you get a random number, and that's about where the understanding ends.  You need to be pretty deep into the minutia of the code to even care much past that point, much less understand how random number seeding works on a particular platform (and it varies).  Most people who program things won't ever even use a seed directly, since it's not something that's important in most applications.  Useful in some very specific circumstances, but not usually.
---
But the bottom line is, random is random (for all practical purposes), but other things like bad coding can screw even that up.
---
If you have the plan and patience, a bloodied fixer is also sweet. Haven‚Äôt got it myself but did get a 2 star executioners fixer from the purveyor with 50% crib damage increase. Still not as good as my bloodied handmade but close!
---
I have no idea why they had to use whitesprings. My guess is laziness. But hasn't everyone been there 1000 times already? There are a lot better locations in the game
---
I doubt that Nick Valentine. 
---
You disagree with anyone that has anything remotely bad to say about Bethesda. 
---
There are plenty of people that have been getting the subscription and then refunding it just so that they have the ranger outfit.
---
I truly wonder if even half the people who dropped $100 for the year will even play the game for that long. I doubt there will be content updates for that long.
---
I've gotten most of the pumpkin plans and the cut out and jack short suit and fireman outfit. Will work on the others after my nap. Been at it since 1 this mornin
---
Someone left me 250+ pieces of candy.  Wasn't sure if someone was being nice or just put me in a diabetic coma üòè
---
Don‚Äôt know why someone downvoted you...
---
For longer shots, bloodied gauss. 
---
Med-Close range was a 1\* bloodied handmade. 
---
Recently swapped over to commando though, you can still one shot pretty much everything but your overall DPS is wildly higher. As is ammo consumption : /
---
Its just hired Bethesda shills grieving the event so you will buy Fallout 1st to get your own server.
---

Because a large majority of subreddit users haven‚Äôt a clue what upvote/downvote is really for...
---
It‚Äôs not if you like or dislike something... that‚Äôs what they think it is... it‚Äôs not.
---
20 caps a pop
---
Because he‚Äôs an adult and can spend his money on whatever he pleases. After a year of release a game company is asking for money and for that money they‚Äôll sell you things. It‚Äôs a pretty simple idea, game developers enjoy getting paychecks for the work they do. You guys think $60 retail game cost entitles you to years of content?? Give me a break. I‚Äôm out of this sub until the cry babies calm down.
---
Yeah it's just never guna be this one because bugthesda makes it
---
I upvoted it all since many don‚Äôt have a clue about the Reddit upvote/downvote system isn‚Äôt or for...lol

Whitesprings golf course, 3 players in the clubhouse room in a nuke zone. Held the trigger down on my tse 50 cal and killed them. One dropped 500 screws and springs and around 1k of steel. Stole it from his bag and crouch walked back to a stash box.
---
I'm not saying that you're factually wrong but that's a baseless claim.
---
I mean we are all really playing a multi-player game on a 20+ year old engine intended for a single player experience.  I'm amazed everyday there hasn't been a critical failure and thousands of players lose shit.  If that ever happens even fan boys will have a stroke!  It's like living life to the fullest with a major heart condition, every breath taken... could be your last.
---
Not that much different than a Nuke at the whitesprings IMO, still fun but same location, same chaos
---
You can for a small nominal fee... :p
---
Thats actually a really good point.
---
I demand they give everyone max stats after leaving the vault SCREW YOU BETHESDA 
---
obviously a pretty bad joke right there 
---
I love you Bethesda
---
Bethesda is allocating server strength to all those Fallout 1st empty world's.
---
‚ÄúThanks Satan‚Äù - lvl 2
---
Bethesda has halloween event at white springs.  Isnt prepared for people putting their camps down. The horror.

Your post was linked on a kotaku article about this issue so anyone googling it could end up being led here.

But doesnt everyone have the Plans for the bobblehead stand? It Was part of the displays Update somewhen in the summer.
---
I've sent you a message
---
Ah yes, completely neglect the main point, get so upset and butthurt you decide to go through my account. 
---
This says more about you than it does about me
---
Ah ok. So i realized that you didn't even look at my history, sorry about that m8.
---
20k?
---
Then I can‚Äôt help you or hold your hand while you figure it out. Judging by your replies to others trying to answer your questions, you are either beyond help or you are a troll
---
Oh you have to pay $9.99/mo for that
---
Um, yes? Though define "It", do you mean cosmetics? If I had access to data that showed that cosmetics made more money than utility, of course I'd recant my speculation. But as it stands, I believe them when they say utility items sold better than merely cosmetic items for reasons stated above, not because I take them at their word.
---
Lever for most enemies. Full auto handmade for SBs
---
Wrong...  I mentioned this subscription over 200+ days ago which then seemed where they would go with this. 
---
Fact is it does not change the game for anyone who doesn‚Äôt subscribe but people think it‚Äôs pay to win... right... 
---
It‚Äôs a game... and people are bent on extras they can choose to buy or not. 
---
Many of the same ones mad at Bethesda now are targeting 1st users... wow, how mature...
---
This is treading very dangerous waters.  I want this game to turn around, but I'm weary about how this will play out.
---
O.O
---
Did you get it back? That was the smart thing for everybody to do back when it was pretty clear they didn't get a $60 game for their $60.

All along the cottages by the doors. Also in courtyard (4 of them) by the last pyre. 
---
Looks like yes, clown outfit and hat count.
---
I noticed every bowl is unique to character. I am able to click on em all once myself. So if we lacked a large group as long as everyone trick or treated it would keep things chugging along. Though last phase is freaking awful if you want to get credit for wearing a costume over staying alive in power armor.
---
oh lmao idk why i thought trouble shooter. 
---
man i was hoarding two shots for the longest. i was so proud of my collection. then i noticed they somehow didnt do as much. turned out they got patched :( 
---
i still have to get in to having different characters but it makes sense for the nuke run. damn i always learn new cool things.
---
I, at least, thought it was an interesting story, and am glad he shared it with us.
---
Some players know that others will be upset so they do it for that reason alone.
---
Could you help me? I'm trying to turn off auto renewal but Fallout 1st doesn't show up in my Playstation Subscriptions menu.
---
I never use my Semi Automatic with Explosive Ammo on Legenderies.
---
I am always mindful there are others participating with inferior weapons who want in on the action.
---
Did Uranium Fever the other day,Soon as one of the Dudes present started Splatting Mole Miners with explosive Ammo i got off.
---
Zero point in anyone participating.
---
Those who do it,know what they are doing.
---
Lever action rifle, 2 shot faster fire rate will do nicely
---
Ive gotten this to work. Its a pretty big hit or miss though. Works 3-4 times then refuses to.
---
I say f-it and do it. Devs should have disabled the ability to do this, but hey let's not think...
---
Even on pc it‚Äôs been a huge issue to get forks to work or load. By that time all the explosions and twelve people in one spot going nuts takes its toll.
---
People will claim new things added 10 years from now should have been in the game since launch. My Sims group does the same thing. Private worlds were announced to be at least a year out since before the game launched. 
---
I don't recall Bethesda ever saying there wouldn't be a subscription service. Plus, this is how private servers are done. Unless Bethesda releases server code to us, then we'd still probably have to go through Amazon since that's what their code is based around.
---
About content that they promised wouldn't be pay walled, I assume you're talking about the scrap box and survival tent, because you could always buy atom and cosmetics. The atomic shop was said to be cosmetic only, which they have walked back on. Technically, this isn't the atomic shop, but it doesn't mean it doesn't give people an unfair advantage or that you should be okay if it does. But it does seem like you're talking the atom purchases. Honestly Bethesda could have chosen any model to fund their game, ($20-40 DLC packs, or free DLC and a mtx store) we just got this one.
---
Bethesda- private servers can help to alleviate that.
---
I hoard and collect nukashine. Got a mule filled to overencumberance with the stuff.
---
A mic in 2019 costs to much, you're absolutely right. We need a chat to communicate.
---
1st could have been fine.  Basically limit it to a monthly cosmetic lootbox. Each month gets you 1650 atoms and a 1st-only cosmetic.
---
Unlimited storage should have been a baseline feature from day 1 and private servers should be just that.  Base versions of the game hosted on 3rd party servers .
---
Aww thank you dude. Even if thats not serious, I'll still hope it had some truth to it.
---
I posted it because there is no harm in doing so, some people might enjoy and others might not. No harm done in ignoring someones post.
---
Thank you
---
It's the ranger outfit popular in fallout new vegas. From the cover of new vegas
---
Or they're included in the monthly benefit ala the Ranger Armor.

---
Not working?  It doesn't say there will be a 24/7 sale on all items or any shit like that, it just says you will have access to sales.  Currently there aren't any sales.  Get your head out of your ass.
---
No that‚Äôs not it unfortunately
---
Your very welcome m8.
---
You mutant scum! Just like you to try a trick like that. It won't help you though, nothing will... now.
---
Haha, I wont lie I never even looked
---
The Ant-Agonizer will rise again!!
---
Been good on pc, no crashes so far. I crash when drinking or eating sometimes anywhere on the map, but that's random. I think it has to do with eating while it's still loading the instance after a hop.
---
You can be social. Use a mic
---
It advertises that you will have access to sales.  It doesn't say those sales will be up 24/7 from the instant you happen to subscribe.  Get your head out of your ass.
---
Trynna mass produce nukashine and nuka dark
---
I'd much rather type to chat for basic things like saying pick up these items. Plus the voice chat is botched as hell
---
The area has always been a bit rough. I recall people going in before nukes to blow up the cars in an effort to reduce the strain on the system (not sure it really worked, but people were doing it). 
---
Events there are just asking for performance/stability issues unfortunately.
---
I already commented on that topic. Voice chats terrible and a zone chat would be nice. I'm sure pip boys have the feature to communicate with each other
---
Flip lighter, fertiliser and toilet paper.
---
Why is voice chat terrible? I use on console fine.
---
You DO realize the actual purchase you're making with this subscription is for Atoms... right?  You're paying $12.99 for 1650 atoms... to then spend in the a tom shop.
---
covert ops is buffing melee damage on certain unarmed weapons, bringing sneak attacks from 3.0x to 3.5x
---
That's a good thing. Don't want to be mistaken for a 1st member!
---
No. &gt;:( my nukashine. Mine.
---
Ofcourse but that's too much logic. $100 sub isn't enough.
---
I use campfires with a cooking stove. Then place the campfire on a rug. This makes it easy to manuver imo. Just remember you always sit in the direction the spoon is pointing when you place it.
---
I only have so long to play each day, so tell me why I shouldn't nuke one of, if not the best, nuke spots when I want to grind gear?
---
I'm on PC. It's about as good as esos local voice was. All online games should have a text chat imo
---
You deserve it
---
Lever. I don‚Äôt know why people use handmade
---
Ah, gotcha. Thanks!
---
You'll do fine with a good hunting rifle, but for sure the gauss and the lever are steps up from there.  Not a huge difference, but better.
---
I never could get into the gauss myself, and when I upgraded from a hunting rifle to a lever, it was not much of a difference for sniping.  A good fixier might be an option as well.
---
Don‚Äôt mess with big red, she got tig ol biddies.

---
Feel your pain but what can you do.
---
I do have the plan Tho, still praying for one lol
---
I like PA but I definitely prefer normal armour. PA just feels clunky and you‚Äôve got to rely on cores all of the time.
---
Normal armor unless going into a nuked zone.
---
Legendary armor provides far more benefits for my character.
---
I thought you were leaving Fallout and Bethesda?? Isn‚Äôt that what you were thinking? Oh wait... your post was removed... guess your still here sulking and mad at the world not giving you free stuff... 
---
Find a game you like and be positive and enjoy it... or just be toxic...
---
I sell the nukashine and nuka dark I produce, as I do with most chems and alcoholic drinks. Heck I even sell addictol
---
Yea... except now to avoid confusion on both ends they literally just display the original price crossed out along with the new price...
---
Does your method work for flat surfaces too?
---
Obviously people are doing it to be trolls.
---
Icon, Scrap Box, Ranger Outfit.
---
Did you have a second private server. Sorry if that wasn‚Äôt clear, but my friends were doing it across private servers
---
So Fallout 1st won't show up in my Playstation Subcriptions menu, I just want to turn off auto renewal.
---
&gt;That's exactly what you said.
---
Please quote the exact line where I said this. I have not edited any of my previous posts as you can see, so go on. I'll wait.
---
Also I'd like to remind you of rule #4 of this subreddit.
---
Of course I do. But 1650 atoms is not enough when you have armour paints and bundles that cost 1800+ atoms.
---
You (cough), you haven't won here. You and your mutie-bastard friends are gonna join me in a big ol' mushroom cloud sendoff. I just triggered the self-destruct. (Heh, heh; cough, cough,...) The work will go on. You didn't do nothing here, 'cept seal your own death warrants. Duty, (cough) honor... courage... Semper Fiiiii........
---
maybe it doesnt benefit all platforms and thus wont get priority? idk
---
Sometimes, if I‚Äôm switching back and fourth between my mules, it will be displayed as level 10 or 1 ( whatever level my last mule was) on the loading screen. Vs my main level. But it‚Äôs just a visual thing and usually on the first load in screen.
---
One of us! One of us! One of us!
---
Hmm that's weird. Sorry but i have no idea what to do
---
Eso it benefits all platforms
---
Is this one of those shill accounts a guy described in an earlier thread? There was a very similar post to this one yesterday... Just asking.
---
Looks you can get very rare outfit from this event. I just got a whitespring jumpsuit.
---
Maybe since you bought it with money that was on your account it was just for one month instead of a full subscription?
---
Day 1 reward assault rifle skin ( Bats paint) day 2 reward Pistol skin ( Haloween Paint ) ill list the others as i see themüòäüëç

Where can I make the classic jack o lantern I have it read it but don't know where to make it
---
Haven‚Äôt heard back yet. Not going to hold my breath.
---
Chill man. This is crazy talk.
---
No no please god no I just wanted the stupid atoms, I‚Äôd rather have them bring back the $10 monthly bundle
---
How can one sound like they're an F1st player?
---
Yeah it's strange, I don't wanna have to spend like ‚Ç¨15 / month just for the ranger armor.
---
xD I was thinking the same thing. There is no griefing, least on PC. Todd launches the nuke naked in his office like Matt Lauer.
---
Kindergarten level social skills seem to be in short supply when dealing with gamers.
---
Some players need to immerse themselves into the Fallout Universe. What would a Raider do? They're nuking that event... while it's happening. People need to lighten up and just go with it. Games are meant to be fun.
---
Just like I‚Äôve been waiting for this game I paid $60 to be worth $60 for the last year of my life and it hasn‚Äôt happened
---
I am also one of the poors but may I join in hunting my fellow poors for being poor or will I be murdered like the transient pauper that I am

Ah thanks, I did read that carefully.  Unfortunately he's working with *way* too small of a sample size to convince me that there's something really going on.  It's good information, but he'd need a ton more tries to get a reliable result from that (which he may get to if he keeps it up, so I'm still watching, but there's really a long way to go to prove anything).
---
The only option left is to delete your credit card from your account
---
Power armor is great on defence and it protects from rad and air pollution but if you use perks for regular armor and a backpack you can get the same effects. Saddly once you mod your power armor regular armot falls at end game stuff
---
I typically only solo this event on my private server. I swap to a heavy PA build and blow up all the cars, light fires, etc I usually have about 5 or so minutes to spare.
---
The Bethesda team has read and taken this feedback into consideration, starting next patch, sitting down in a chair or any other seats will automatically open the atomic shop, if you are a ..proud.. owner of the Fallout 1st suckscription, you will automatically be redirected our Fallout 2nd suckscription, this one does nothing, but you get to feel good about yourself for sending money to our oh-so-hard-at-work team, who definitely need your additional monetary support to sell you the next atomic shop convenience to circumvent the intentionally inconvenient features of the game, after all, we heard your cries for more gameplay shop items (Because we listen! And! It comes with free bugs for all!) Such a good samaritan, you!
---
I've crashed ince si far. It was at the end. Didn't get any of the rewards.  The servers cant handle everyone in one place at a time. Really frustrating.
---
It would be a nice feature to have, but I rather talk to people.
---
take your private server and stick it where the sun doesnt shine.
---
Me, Frank Horrigan, that's who. United States Secret Service. You aren't going anywhere from here
---
The amount of shit posting in these threads is fucking ridiculous.  It says there will be discounts. it doesn't say everything will be discounted... or that the discounts will always be available.  On occasion there will be discounts available if you're subscribed to 1st... that's it.  No conspiracy... no broken promises... no bugged atom shop.
---
That made me chuckle. Take an upvote.
---
It's too low, can't hear in teams but my hearing is not good. Discord is the way to go.
---
It does not. But doesnt require a flat foundation. I'm sure if i used the staircase method with a cooking stove it would work similarly though.
---
Mine is gernerally the one I use when interacting with cliff faces
---
Lol you can do that without giving Todd money.  Ya rube
---
Yup, immediately deleted my paypal from my account. The payment hasn‚Äôt come through my bank yet though so that might be why.

If you think $100 makes you rich i good very bad news for you

If you say you‚Äôre hunting poor people that‚Äôs how üòÇ

Easy solution : 1st members place tents all around WS. Problem solved.
---
I like using flat surfaces and i dont think the cooking stove works for mine
---
Great work ! Make them suffer for their financial instability !
---
Betheda priority laziness probably.
---
They only acknowledged the possibility of text chat like a year ago almost.  They haven't said anything since then, and it kind of makes you wonder if they're not adding it because maybe they want to be assholes and keep people communicating only through emotes if you lack a mic.
---
Either way, it's dumb. It's an integral PC feature and we don't have it, that's pathetic.
---
Another lie. **inserts shocked pikachu face**
---
The atomicshop sale timeline is speculative but sure seems transparently obvious. They unloaded items that should have coincided with the release of wastelanders. But since it wasn‚Äôt ready and they had no backups they were  haphazardly released anyway for continued income. Again it‚Äôs almost insinuated that wastelanders could have been planned all along but their communication and execution of everything has been just terrible.
---
You will need the Fallout Seventh subscription. Should be available Q2, 2025.
---
The higher ups aren't going to care about nonmonetary numbers, and they definitely wouldn't look at the data as breaking up the packages into individual kits, because they're not going to see them as individual transactions. They're going to see people buying the 5 pack, the 20 pack, or the 100 pack, and THAT'S what they're going to be evaluating: Which *pack* sells better, because the cost to the company is relatively upfront: Develop and release the kit packs. When presenting data like this, executives are going to want to see monetary cost, they won't care about development process.
---
So if two purchases by a player cost $5 each, they're going to see $5 for a skin and $5 for the scrap box pack as if it were a single buy-because it is.
---
But the kits aren't even what they're seeing. They're seeing the fridge and the robot as being the fastest-selling items in the shop, more than any individual shop item.
---
So there's also the perspective of "People buy this item more than any other" rather than seeing "People buy lots of this item, but if you categorize the rest, the data tells a different story."
---
Still, the fact that these utility items apply to more people in the game is the biggest reason they sold so much more.
---
Worth sending them an email pal just to clarify it. Hopefully they sort it for you üôÇ
---
It's not supposed to be "enough" it's literally just supposed to be what you paid for.  If you want to buy more then you buy more atoms.  Thats how the atom shop works.
---
lol One-sec Ill add proof Just for you
---
First, It would be relatively safe to say that a Fallout 1st subscriber wouldn‚Äôt have posted a long post like yours saying what you did... 
---
Second, I highly doubt a subscriber would post anything positive either especially on here in this subreddit unless they like getting downvoted (which many haven‚Äôt a clue how Reddit votes work) or getting trashed.
---
I suppose a pet poor could be could be amusing. We shall call you Toby.

Big B dropping sub hoppers Big D style.

Lmao "the poors", this post is asking for it.

How is the image proof?

Step right in good sir.. No it's not a trap.
---
It's not only you, there seems to be a general issue. I have the same problem and I my subscription is still active.
---
Well, it is the best and brightest of Vault-Tec we're talking about. Pretty low bar there.
---
Yes but we don't see the time of the images.
---
Trust me, they've looked. It's more a case of "what can we rip off without being accused of outright thievery?"
---
Even then, they tread a thin line when it comes to abusing the work of mod authors.
---
the only build that really should use power armor is a heavy weapons build
---
aside from that, Power Armor is only useful for new players who dont have a full set of decent legendary armor
---
thats my opinion at least
---
Swiss are just Germans that took their love of mountain climbing a little to far.
---
i dont care about what build im running, my base is not build to accomodate you and your needs but it is MY base. If you dont like rad showers then just stay out of the base. Simple as that.
---
im logged in but it says im no longer a member of fallout 1st
---
Go here and say 5 praise todd howards:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/PraiseToddHoward/
---
I dont have my subscription anymore either
---
I don't have any password problems but I too am not receiving my Fallout 1st subscription perks. Shits stupid
---
Both my room mates paid for theirs and today they are unable to access their private server option or any of the other goodies . This isn't a great way to start this
---
Shit the bed
---
Same here I just paid for it a few days ago and I logged in today and cant access private worlds
---
All randomness in anything for the computer is pseudo-random. Most algorithm are variation of this one  
---
You can imagine like 5 numbers with a sequence like  
---
rng = \[ 5 3 4 1 2 \]  
---
take the rest of the division between seconds and 5 to decide which "part" meaning if seconds is 34, you get 4 and take rng\[4\] = 2 as the result of the rng.  
---
you can take a value from the ram directily, the variation of of some measurements inside of the cpu, a value from the server, etc. or use it to decide which number of that sequence choose.
---
You can see the yellow fps counter in bottom left as well. If you really want I can take pics in game to show that I do not have access to the scrapbox, tho it looks like its a bigger issue and multiple people have problems with the service right now
---
That person is crazy and delusional. Upon being shown a video of a character that used a shotgun from hundred meters to OHKO full HP target via damage-over-time, he said shotguns bypass 110 damage cap and can one-shot people at the distances. To make things funnier, the character used for the video had all the perks taken off, and the shotgun itself was QE DB.
---
I‚Äôve had 4/5 crashes
---
Lol @ all the fallout 1sters that thought Bethesda wouldn't drop the ball on this one.
---
It says:
---
 Fallout 1st will be available as a one-month membership, or  you can purchase a yearly membership for a 36% discount over the monthly  rate as shown on our website. **If you cancel your membership** ***or it  expires*****, you‚Äôll still be able** 
---
so its a 1 month membership.....? and then it expires? But then...what membership can you cancel? kinda vague. but if its not shown in your xbox subscriptions i guess youre fine. maybe check again tomorrow lol
---
It should be obvious, but you could check my post history.
---
That is true i skilled into max strange and int. To use heavy gunner and piwer armor mods that regular armor makes me lose stats
---
That‚Äôs literally my point. You‚Äôre already paying for a premium service, and yet they want you to spend even more money.
---
Will you do it from a new account as well? Yet another reason...
---
Someone's got an admirer! :p
---
‚ÄúWait a minute. This isn‚Äôt miracle tonic. This is snake oil! I‚Äôve been hoodwinked! Bamboozled!‚Äù
---
K thx
---
people care about text chat on console? i didnt know that tbh
---
Just curious if a sample size of a few thousand whitesprings drops and a few hundred purveyor drops isn‚Äôt a large enough sample what would you say is?
---
I only use power armor for nuke zones and collecting iron ore. Normal armor has legendary variants, allows for more flexability with the build. Nearly as strong as power armor. Don't need fusion cores. Also being in the power armor kind of annoys me, its loud.
---
Get what deserve
---
Oh okay. I'll add this info to my post so people who see it don't think there is something shady going on.
---
Genuine question - how does text chat translate to consoles where typing is a lengthy and annoying process?
---
I can see the benefit of you have a keyboard, 100% but on my PS4 text chat would be so difficult
---
In the Texture Files and Meshes there are files for 9 total Ranger variants - The Standard, Advanced, and Elite. With each of those versions having a Gray, Desert, and Riot variant. The one unlocked currently is Standard Gray.
---
And Interestingly the "Atomiccamo" is in the base game files section and not ATX or Babylon (NW).
---
Eat me
---
To be fair, it should not cause an event failure. It's just a minor inconvenience. And if a minor inconvenience ruins the whole experience the issue likely isn't the minor inconvenience but more so the person experiencing the frustration. It's not the end of the world. Just go with it.
---
It is the most fun you can get from the game right now. I might consider returning to the game just for that. Thanks Bethesda, at least you are not stopping any kind of griefing or exploiting the game systems.
---
Just kidding. I'm running into same issues. smh
---
Thanks for giving me the idea! This sounds like a bunch of fun to do mwahaha
---
I'm reading the forums Apprently thousands of people are having this issue
---
I always get a kick out of having players attack me. Lately, I just wave or do the finger guns emote. I've been attacked in railroad stations, when I'm just walking down country roads and even at events like the time I was at meat week and there was this kid shooting everyone and saying "wanna fight" on the mic. I've even had someone sneak around and try to bring enemies to my CAMP to destroy it, which was pretty humorous because my base is in the mire right by a super mutant spawn so it's always under attack. You'd think if people were scoping out people to PvP with, they'd use the "Wanna PvP" emote, but hey, maybe they are just roleplaying.
---
1) Don't subscribe to it in the first place.
---
Cause I'm one of those damn firsters.
---
Yes true enough, I like using other people's music department, still no Jew's Harp :(
---
Or you can pummel or blow up everything into submission, crank it up to 11.
---
Destroy Everything, robots n all, Nick candy, break some ghoul skulls and paint stuff till all that's left is the wreckage of your enemies.
---
 Tactic Seems to be working the 8+ times I've done it
---
Did you contact Microsoft?
---
 Fastnacht masks were fixed thankfully.... but....
---
Presh
---
Yeah I'm like 99 percent sure that all of the basic display cases and stands are free in your camp build menu. There are also some you can purchase in the Atom Shop (I think), but most of them you don't need a plan for.
---
I would like that, didn't we have that in Fallout 4? I've kinda forgotten.
---
Except for the fact that if you know anything about how the game works that the more items of that nature you have in a confined space the lower the frame rate is going to be and it can only go so low until the game crashes.
---
Don't forget that other people and and will (sometimes accidentally) kill your cow! Woohoo!!
---
...I got rid of mine. I'm not bitter at all ;)
---
No, I may later if I don‚Äôt see it pop up in my subscriptions though
---
Dragon is my sniper!! I just put my graphics setting to low and fade distance to max
---
I can‚Äôt stand the ‚Äúbig lump‚Äù. They need to fix some things related to vending but putting everything in one long list was not what anyone had in mind.
---
Damn, thats something you usually never hear anyone say. lol
---
The problem is it's no longer complete silence, I chat with some of the Community Managers daily / every couple days, and have "firewalled" communication slowly to the Devs (info passed from CM's to Dev's)   
---
It's just enough I'm holding on by my fingernails, but I won't lie, it is frustrating at times.
---
They do this in the Black water mine also and it's so frustrating.
---
As I put above I agree with this very much, then I'd enjoy sitting on a chair enjoying the view or reading my pip boy :)
---
Perfect if you have the build for it. This is just my experience from soloing. But yes this would work if you got the build for it.
---
If I remember right, when we sit down in FO4 we could have time pass more quickly.
---
You can only put camps so close together so they arent really in a "confined space".
---
Good info, thanks, question is if you miss a day do you miss the Skin?  
---
Where did you find the info?     
---
Sorry must have skimmed over it.
---
I'll do better than quote you. https://i.imgur.com/26EHs2a.jpg As I said in my previous post, I could have not understood your thought process on this.  However, you're still trying to mix an intentional design (button designed to wipe out players) with an unexpected backlash of hate (you wanting to target 1st players) from trash players simply because they purchased a service.
---
You can remind me of rule 4 all you like. It wont change the fact that you're justifying the targeting of players because they purchased a service.  You seem to be okay with making the game experience terrible for other players. So you can report me if you like, but it wont make what I said less true about you.
---
I like this. I only sit when I am AFK. I figure sitting is a pretty good indicator. I suppose pictures, but... how often do we take pictures of ourselves in chairs? I want pictures of me, standing on the corpses of my enemies!
---
But yes, some other function would be nice.
---
&gt;shotgun 4Head
---
Sorry what it that exactly, a shotgun mod or something?
---
Thanks for the thanks!
---
Right. It seems most of the camps surrounding the area are fo 1st people anyways. You can tell by the emblems and the contents of their camps. It‚Äôs like the just deliberately want to ruin the experience for people who don‚Äôt want to pay for the subscription.
---
I hope this is satire, otherwise you sound like a pathetic loser
---
Thanks for the comment, will log and submit later tonight (now on my phone!)
---
If you're flipping a coin (2 options), that's plenty to get a reliable sample.  But given how many *possible* drops there are in 76, it takes a *lot* of samples to get a clear picture what the actual odds are of specific drops.
---
It depends on what you're looking for specifically, but there are 'acceptable' sample sizes for determining whether or not your sample size is enough to get a good idea what's going on, and they depend on the number of variables you're looking at.
---
I'd be happy to get into it a little more if you'd like, but I'm packing up to start my commute home, so it would be a little later on tonight before I could give you more details/examples.
---
Anyone who is willing to pay for it. Basically players like myself who really enjoy the game but would like a solo experience. Also literally anyone who buys at least $10 a month in Atoms.
---
Thanks for the comment, gotta work together to get these things fixed!
---
It's only a perk card? Swap in for fighting a SB, what's so difficult, then swap out again.
---
I never have it loaded most of the time.
---
Gl everything is broken rn
---
The NPC's need to be able to attack it for you to lose the "defend workshop" quest.

No, she was just playing normally, then the game crashed, when she got back into the game, it wasn't in her inventory any more. We all checked around incase she had dropped it, but it was nowhere to be found

You are not the only one
---
I can take the same screenshots right now with FPS in the corner.
---
Same
---
Agreed. Less cost per item, but made up for in greater volume of sales.
---
I'm pretty sure it wasn't me, but I did do this the other day to someone bec I liked their camp. Lol I have a lot of bubblegum to give out!!!
---
It seems perhaps you don‚Äôt actually play the game my friend. You can put player camps right next to one another so long as they don‚Äôt overlap. That‚Äôs one of the things the devs actually bragged about at release was that they had their own little city of camps all clustered together. In theory it can be good for role play but with the lack of server reliability it‚Äôs not practical and even game breaking.
---
Not sure if you're calling me a Police Officer or a Security Guard but there's nothing wrong with either profession.
---
My latest thing is walking into someone else's CAMP and sleeping in their bed... whether they're there or not.  
---
Pushing social faux pas to its limits, I know.
---
Yeah, I know. Why can‚Äôt we just have nice things?
---
Thanks for the comment!  
---
I've got the vending machine issue logged on my [Patch 14.0 page](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm9q59/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/) (Think I do atleast, will check tonight)   
---
Been hearing more reports of the NPC issue(s).. What hostiles were they?
---
My build is so so, armor a  couple of vanguard pieces. 
---
Having no problem dispatching everything and anything in this event with only a ghoul slayers explosive gattling gun and normal grenades
---
It depends on whether or not there are or eventually will be multiple entries for these items in the atom shop.  One of the perks for subscribing is "exclusive discounts" and this particular offer may just be the option available to 1st members at their discounted price, while there's a separate entry for everyone else at the full price.  It does specify that the "offer" is exclusive instead of explicitly saying the "item" or something more specific.
---
That's not true. They have to be a certain distance apart. I know because my fiance and I wanted to put our camps "right next to each other". You are demonstrateably wrong.
---
Jokes on them.  We're all on private servers   ;)
---
weird
---
Thank you for that.
---
No need. Heres the proof you ordered my friend. 
---
This is 100% proof that you are not a fallout 1st subscriber. You red menace you!
---
Because they already got our money they could care less if we enjoy the product
---
Thanks for the confirmation and comment!   
---
1) Hmmmm bunch of reports of this...
---
2) Got it, logged above, I'll edit it to mention it's not limited to "Lag"  
---
3)  Ouch, yes Patch 13 and 14 brought the damage bug back in force, and it's weird what triggers it, have it logged on my Patch 13 and [Patch 14](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm9q59/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/) pages but will resubmit the issue again.
---
Ask the 3 people who posted just before you, they have the same question.
---
(Seems to be a system wide issue right now, you're not alone)
---
It's actually been the other way around lol.
---
Have heard of 1st hunters. Not this type of thing though
---
Personally have seen mole rat, scorched and super mutant
---
Added two more photos with me in a Ranger Armor and with the text that Scrapbox is unavailable because I am not subscribed to Fallout 1st. I hope it's enough for you
---
Wasn‚Äôt something going on in Russia this week to limit external internet access?

I dont mind getting downvoted its not that serious
---
Why would you believe anything Bethesda says anymore? They continually make promises they don't keep.
---
At what point is it not Bethesda's fault? Because I've had no issues playing.
---
whaaaaaaaaaaaatt?? that scares me... 
---
like i heard about some people using their entire character by doing the vault raids.. made me not even go in there. lol
---
Are they both max lvl
---
Upvote for the second edit.
---
This is a response to those pathetic poors calling themselves "1st hunters".
---
Al I can do is pull off a Nelson. Just point and laugh "ha-ha!"
---
Bugthesda already ripped you off when you bought the game. What made you think this time was different?
---
I at least made the right choice by uninstalling. Sure, 60 bucks down the drain, but I freed up 50 gig on my ssd for a game that works.
---
Good luck getting an answer on your support ticket within a week or 2.
---
Get a sense of humor

Nah, i can log into the game and play on Adventure. Otherwise everything is fine and dandy.

dude you have no idea how deeply you hurt me. Im devastated.

This says more about the price of tea in China than this entire sub-thread.
---
**"Give us some device that functions similarly to ‚ÄúDragonrend‚Äù from Skyrim and forces them to land."**
---
This was in Fallout 3 - It was called the Dart Gun, 100% crippled all limbs.  Can't fly with crippled wings üëç
---
Could add a dart gun like syringe to the syringer too, would give it more viability.
---
I actually don‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt downvote you at all, not even the original post since it was about Fallout in a Fallout sub... 
---
Many users don‚Äôt understand the vote system, it‚Äôs not if you like it or not. No one wants to take the time to read any longer. 
---
So let me ask... why did you buy it but write what you did... I‚Äôm curious...
---
Oh god they actually still read the sub...
---
They could care less?
---
We weren't doing anything major, i think we were heading to one of our camps, and i havent heard of anything like it since, but the experience put me right off the game
---
500 people spend at least $10k on buying the game. You think one person is going to spend $10k in one week?
---
This is where ghouls come from... 
---
Should have read that fine print indeed. lol
---
Sorry but I don't feel like hearing the wonderful assortment of voices and bodily functions and screaming relatives and mic static of other gamers. Doesn't really add to my 'post-apocalyptic' immersion, ya know?
---
Lol they must be special
---
To be honest, I really wanted that Ranger Outfit but now I regret it.
---
You use demo expert dont you? And run power armor? See I dont so I cant spam Stimpacks.
---
lol :D
---
But texting does?
---
Bethesda said everything except cosmetics would be free. That model can work, believe it or not. Guild Wars 2 is still going strong.
---
Grief someone for days for destroying my club. Nukes, everywhere...
---
Thank you for sharing. There was another blue and grey camo skin for all Armor sets in a previous datamine. I wonder if that is going to be 1st exclusive as well.
---
My best guess is they knew the game would be blasted with toxicity and didn't want to see the entire game become Barrens chat. 
---
Still not a very good excuse IMO, but at this point it's all I have, because it is definitely absurd that this game has no text chat one year after launch.
---
Except this is not a free to play game
---
There's probably two issues at play.  One is the packet issue the poster mentioned and the other may be related to processing all the particle FX from explosive weapons, energy weapons,  and SB sonic attacks.  They are all fairly math intensive and may not down the smooth flow of combat and as the system tries to crunch all those numbers at once along with calculating the current health.
---
I had this happen the other day and weirdly only a system reboot took care of it. No amount of server hops worked...
---
Also, all of my mutations were inoperable, but my level showed correctly on screen when I was in a team (but not in my PipBoy).
---
That's better  üëç
---
Or WS is a popular camping spot and there's a lot of Fallout 1st subscribers.
---
Demo expert yes, power armor no
---
Lol I‚Äôm aware your job must be hard trying to uptalk the game bud but my brother and I have our camps right next to each other and with collectrons range exceeding that normal camp area that creates an even bigger problem. I respect your attempts at trying to put down negative feedback on the game though brother.
---
The best and brightest part was a lie
---
Same, make sure to put a support ticket
---
Interesting. One of those strange mechanics no one brings up. Thanks.
---
Texting allows me to communicate with others without all of the extra annoying variables of a mic. It also lets me communicate with others without being right beside them, because I typically play alone, and that has various advantages.
---
Text chat is essential and a no-brainer in 2019.
---
To be honest, the jacket part is kinda cool but the eyes don‚Äôt glow red... little disappointed on that...  but it wouldn‚Äôt have gotten me to get the subscription.
---
Server side is decent... I had my son and friends fill it up, launched a nuke, did events and all that and it was smooth. 
---
I think mainly due to only 8 people playing and no one constantly hopping worlds or doing other things or glitches.
---
It's on many console games
---
It's Fallout. Power armor all of the way, man.
---
Lmao. Show a screen shot of both of your green circles "right next to each other". You're straight up lying.
---
I play eso on console people were furious when it didn't have the feature
---
Yeah, just did. Honestly it‚Äôs so upsetting. But, I think, at this point bugs were expected.
---
well depending on how long it takes to fix, this is just gaming in general these days... online is hard.
---
The un-subscription fee is 12.99 (per month). Maybe you should read the fine print next time.
---
I think that one *should just be Atomic Shop and also sometimes they just don't release stuff they have marked as atomic shop. Like the Nuka Shine kegs have now been marked ATX like 3 months now and they're still not released :(
---
Literally everyone is effected rn
---
Please wait to Nuke WS until 2 minutes past the hour. Thus forcing everyone to leave the event or die.
---
7/8 of the new posts are regarding this. 
---
They borked something on their end, supposedly looking into it.
---
Oh man. To think you paid so much extra to be no better off than the coach class.
---
At least Bethesda responded quick to their real customers. I hope you get this issue sorted soon. I really do.
---
Ah sorry will do
---
Douchebag says what?...
---
Eh I‚Äôll be upset if it takes them more then 12 hours to fix, otherwise it‚Äôs just how online games are... online is hard
---
Felt the same way last night and bought Outer Worlds.
---
"it was one of the happiest times I've had in this game." You're easy to please huh?
---
What rank of demo?
---
I guess
---
If you're certain of that √©_√®
---
Yeah I heard bugthesda will be releasing a fix for $5.99 today. Get your credit cards ready lol
---
I was going to start doing this tomorrow. I'm going to do monster mash and then give away all that candy
---
Thanks, happy mischief night if you still play
---
They have to care. It's an ongoing subscription they'd lose otherwise.
---
Yeah, I haven't played any with it, I'm just curious about how well it works, yknow?
---
Find a fallout 1st player. Beat a fallout 1st player. Easy as that.
---
thats pretty cool. but you type with the controller? or do people play eso on console with keyboard/mouse?
---
Edit: responding to multiple posts my bad lol
---
Yes, certain.
---
They should hire you to get rid of the bugs, honestly.
---
Haha this guy had maga, trump, a prison with a vault girl saying lock her us. But what annoys me is when I fast travel to a place to look up what they have and they have their doors locked and a sign that says sucker over the door. Hence why I brought the scorchbeast and 20 scorch to level it
---
Please let us into your homes while we are stranded
---
Here's a decent video that explains how counters can seem to go up and down when they should only be going in one direction.   It is about 'Like' counts but the concept works with MMO health numbers as well.  https://youtu.be/RY_2gElt3SA
---
No controller.
---
They‚Äôre looking into the issue. I suggest you file a support ticket
---
Probably coming later. They should have advertised that portion later as well, but hindsight and all.
---
Insufficient.
---
Just last week I saw a guy travelling around to the most populated areas in the server, trying to find players for a Vault Raid. I felt bad for him, and agreed to go along.
---
Why can't we have a fucking server-wide text chat?
---
I have this happening as well...
---
well i dont know why. they are entirely different games!
---
Seems more like 1986 but you do you.
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool
---
Never thought of nuking whitesprings during event
---
Thank you for reporting this issue to us, we are actively looking into reports of this occurring. In case you haven't yet, can you please [submit a ticket to our Customer Support team](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) so that we have the best possible report and account information for our investigation? 
---
I'm not
---
Good thing I get unlimited junk in the trunk
---
Whenever I visit another camp and trade/buy something I leave a vintage Nuka shine as a gift
---
I honestly am contemplating doing it right before it starts or in the middle of it. Get a nice kill streak going
---
I subscribed for 1 month in PS4. It didn't count it as a subscription. I actually called Sony. They said 1 month is just 1 month, not recurring.
---
Hope they fix it soon enough. I suggest you file a support ticket and wait.

What can I say? It just works that way.
---
Look Shill I don‚Äôt have to prove anything to you people who actually play the game know how it works. Lol like I said. I respect you cause you have a hard job but you‚Äôre not going to win in this community bud.
---
I have, I'm still pretty confused on how this happened
---
Let‚Äôs me play how I‚Äôve wanted from the get go, having access to a private world when I just want to chill and be antisocial. The stash box is a huge one and then you also get a good amount of atoms, having a second fast travel point with the mini camp. 
---
Good value and features IMO
---
Maybe Bethesda should do something about that...?
---
Console users also have the ability to message through gamer/player names in the console itself if you really have something to say.
---
PC users do not, because why would we want to right?
---
So you immediately assume it was intentionally done to you and come here to rage instead of just doing a little research into whether it's a more widespread issue?  If you had it it seems it should be obvious you've encountered a bug as opposed to them 'revoking your privileges'
---
As far I can tell, the information isn't posted anywhere. I earned two skins (Bats + Halloween) yesterday, if that data point matters.
---
Seriously mods.  Can we just ban people like this?  I understand the critique of fallout 1st but people posting stuff like this is completely counter productive to the subreddit.
---
Your comment is nonsense. Just because text chat was introduced a long time ago doesn't make it less functional or useful now.
---
Or do you avoid other basic utilities of life like chairs and telephones?
---
Same thing here. Was going to farm some sweet legendaries in horde events. Guess not today
---
I just brought the Samaria outfit and the helmet is awful. The bottom bit at the back of the helmet and the ribbon are stuck in place meaning they keep stretching when running, jumping, any action really. Looks horrible, it‚Äôs really distracting. I don‚Äôt understand why they even made it that way. Why couldn‚Äôt it all just stay solid when moving?
---
/taps forehead
---
Can't cancel Fallout 1st if you never purchased the game anyway.
---
Sounds just like all those people hating on all of the fallout 1st subscribers
---
Everyone complains when they put items in the atomic shop "bEhInD a PaY wAlL" and complain when they DON'T put new things in the shop. This subreddit is a joke. Most of y'all will just fucking complain no matter what happens.
---
Ya, I've crashed 5/7 times.
---
No doubt.
---
Yea ok todd Howard
---
What did you honestly expect?
---
Still loving it. I'm having no issues and just did Mishchief Night on my private server and stored all the robots junk in my scrap box.
---
Wow that is a huge write up about what mmogfails wrote like 12 hours ago.
---
At least give credit where it is due.
---
So while what you say makes sense, let's give it a while and see if the stuff he said will come true. If they miss the Steam release this year, I will give his words more value.
---
I'm usually playing in a team with Steam Chat open with everyone in there. Using mic in-game annoys my teammates by echoing everything I say.
---
i just wanted to finish moving over my scrap because i decided to wait after i heard people got a lot of their junk deleted by mistake, even when i decide to be safe something seems to always go wrong
---
Yeah cause obviously they won't bother to fix it?
---
Damn. Beat me too it.
---
I'm right there with ya concerning the game world and lore. Started playing just after release and I already know the game is buggy, and the company is taking our ideas along with putting some of them behind pay walls, yada yada yada. Regardless, I'm still enjoying 76 and will continue to play for as long as I want to.

But let me guess you know better than him even though he was literally flown to texas by bethesda to go over bug issues in the game and test NW.
---
My background is in psyche research. The data analysis stuff is new for me. Not sure how variables interact in this case. (Are all stars independent or is the roll of the second star in some way dependent on the first)
---
Good job on this event Bethesda. I like it.
---
Ya Bethesda releases some buggy games that‚Äôs true. But from everything I‚Äôve read, watched and listened to from people who actually develop games, online stuff is just really friggin hard.
---
Todd, you know i love you, i bought skyrim a few times, Please Todd. I need my membership back, ill even buy skyrim again but for the switch even though i have yet to own one, Toddy Boi, Pls.
---
Would‚Äôve thought you‚Äôd be used to this by now.
---
Sounds like fun to me tbh. And they couldnt do any damage anyway. Free show!
---
Proof?
---
It's gone now.
---
Stealth-Nerf with the latest patch.
---
That‚Äôs how we live in Appalachia. Here‚Äôs to hoping they fix it soon and we can go farming
---
So many people are getting affected by this, I wonder how long it take for them to fix this.
---
Unreasonable hate bandwagoners like yourself are to be expected. I'm just stating a fact.
---
I was enjoying it, until this happened. Todd has forsaken me.
---
You can camp in the parking lot of the miners monument south of white springs.
---
Yeah mate, you're gonna get scammed.
---
Fact is, paypal offers no real protection for sellers. 
---
If a seller claims you didn't supply the product or whatever, they'll refund the money without even contacting you.
---
Paypal are fucking shit. 
---
eBay are not much better.
---
You on xbox? I'll invite you to my private server
---
I end up at Flatwoods for milk mostly.
---
whose Kanye?
---
Right on. I'm a 1st member. Was expecting some hunters last night. Would have been interesting lol
---
Yeah, sure. I surely believe you even though you didn‚Äôt provide proof. Still if true, I suggest you buy a lottery ticket. You‚Äôre a lucky man today.
---
They better extend our memberships cause this is fked if I'm going lose day(s) not having access to content paid for..............
---
I have the same problem. Can access my scrapbox, but cant add anything new. I cant place a tent, nor can I access private worlds. Crazy lag in the public server I was just in as well, wonder if someone is attacking their network right now.
---
Does the space suit and helmet count?
---
They broke even their premium subscription. Bethesda is looking into it. Relax. Maybe stay off the sub for a bit because you're going to be the target of ridicule.
---
I should of expected more problems, i expected a second wave of Stash box deletion but admittedly, didn't expect this.
---
Do you play on console or pc?
---
Let's not forget, fuck zenimax too
---
Yeah. Tons of us who bought the sub. 
---
Todd has forsaken us
---
Haven't seen anyone else mention it...
---
He generally puts off a real Oscar the Grouch vibe in general, so I'm going to say... probably.
---
I hope you got the attention you craved so badly. lmao
---
The 1st Sub model is just copy pasted from ESO sub model.  
---
I'd say the discounted items will be rotated monthly just like in ESO.
---
A bloodied ffr lever action
---
Hah, really? I'll check him out. Never heard of them.
---
Dude, take your millennial passive aggressive self somewhere else.  You're not impressing me with your insults.  I make way more than enough money to spend it how the hell I want.  I invest fully in my 401k every year.  I should be able to retire nicely, assuming the government doesn't screw things up beyond all recognition.  You want everything free.  I get it.  I, on the other hand, understand that life isn't free.  Someone always has to pay for it.
---
Yeah, I do realize this. Just kinda sucks how it goes sometimes. On a side note, props on watching this creator. I do really enjoy his content
---
What if they made an option to enable our preferred types of PvP on private servers, would that help you get what you want from the game?
---
Yea... getting you to buy more at oms would be their business model.  You don't HAVE to buy more than your 1650 atoms allows... that's up to you.  The fact that there's more stuff in the atom shop than those atoms allows you to buy doesn't mean they have to start giving it to you for free.
---
How so?
---
PA for carry weight and lack of strong ‚Äúnormal‚Äù armor that also has weight reduction perks
---
I dunno, they seem pretty brazen with the "Creation Club".
---
I don't mind being the target of ridicule, at least people can look at it as a cautionary tale, But I'll still be on the Reddit anyway, just lurking as always
---
Todd, we know it‚Äôs you
---
When did you submit it?
---
22 aussiebucks
---
On positive side, its free fluxes :P
---
It's working for me on PC. I've been logged in for a couple of hours so maybe access stopped for new logins after that?
---
I‚Äôve been dropping loot bags of Halloween candy on camp beds (or front doors if locked) all week! I switched to the pumpkin loot bags yesterday so this one wasn‚Äôt me. But hopefully people are getting the same fun factor out of it. It‚Äôs been cool seeing everyone‚Äôs camps (not just to shop) too. 
---
My favorite drop was a camp with a locked door but a wall that had been destroyed by a super mutant. I walked in, dropped the bag on the bed, then fixed the wall on my way out. Would like to have seen their reaction!
---
Ya. It's a combination of button smashing, forced disconnects, and someone else trying to also get in the machine. That's as specific as I'll get, there's a bit more to it. Bottom line, it causes errors in the save state for the scrip machine, which can lead to localized server instability.
---
There are guinea pigs for a reason, no offense, but I don't buy things immediately until someone else deals with the "small print" first. Thanks for the heads up none the less.
---
Some of us still slum it on public.  Who else is going to buy all my legendaries?
---
Yeah
---
Half isnt even enough.  ONE power armor paint for ONE style of power armor is 18 bucks.  Ridiculous, 9 dollars is still ridiculous.  I'd say 5 dollars and the paintjob is unlocked on all power armor models.  5 ars is reasonable to high still considering your buying a peice of non tangible code.  But people spend 6 bucks on a coffee that gets pissed out so I think 5 is reasonable.  
---
Oh and to add to this there is should be 50 paint jobs in the base game to unlock through quests and grinding and thr atom shop paints are add ons.  
---
I'll.play this game again if the content at least doubles, bugs and lag and network issues actually get fixed, and the management teama does a 180 and actually show a consumer first style of operating a business.  Till then I'll stick with fallout 4.
---
Agree, very dangerous waters indeed, it's either become a whale and get everything you ever wanted in this game or live with bog standard basics that Bethesda gives out now n again. That's the sorry state of affairs this game is and will become.
---
This sucks bad style
---
I think the strangest thing about this is people are talking about people who didn't cancel the Sub are still having this problem, how does this even happen?
---
This is Facebook 2.0 to a lot of people

The ghouls turn into glowing ones, but they don't drop stabilizing materials. It's an OK place to farm for XP and legendary stuff, but if you're looking for mass and fluids it's pointless.
---
Yup! Funny my comment got downvoted...haha!
---
Not good.  I mean it's bad enough that people who are against the current business practices are allowed to harass those who chose to subscribe and never bother anyone, but when you pay for the sub, and then cannot even go to your private server to get away from the assholes out there, and cannot because of some issue like this, that's just insulting.  Time to get a refund on the sub.  Knowing that Bethesda won't willingly give the refund, I'll have to go through my bank to advise that I need the charge reversed due to non delivery of promised goods.
---
Getting really tired of people coming on here and hating on those who chose to purchase a service because they want a different experience.  There are even people posting asking how to target those players in-game, simply because they purchased the service.
---
I just logged on, everything is working fine for me.
---
Oh dang I didn't realise you couldn't do that - I've messaged people directly before and it's been time consuming without the app. Sucks pc people don't have that, you deserve some kind of text chat method
---
I don't really think they're gonna give us anything for this happening other than a lukewarm "We're Sorry"
---
Yup, file a support ticket and wait. There are tons affected.
---
I want it ....u willing to part with it ...its the only item from this even i want and all i ever get are the stupid pumpkins and a firefighter outfit so far
---
I don't think so. I literally just logged in with no issues at all. Seems random.
---
Try to keep up with the discussion then. I never once put the blame on the players, or even remotely implied it. The whole discussion started with me *specifically* *saying* that it's up to the developer to prevent any unwanted behaviour in the game. There's multiple quotes:
---
&gt;No, that's Bethesda for allowing for it.  
---
&gt;I could blame the players, but ultimately it was Blizzard who designed the game that way.  
---
&gt;As long as Blizzard allows for that to happen, I can't really blame players exploiting that "feature".  
---
&gt;Which is why I never blamed the players for doing it, but the developers for making it possible.  
---
&gt;How is it 100% on the players if the designers left that in for players to exploit?
---
In almost EVERY post I made I said it was on the developers, not the players. It is actually amazing how you were able to misunderstand it so severely when it was crystal clear right from the start, then literally spelled out for you and REPEATED in almost every post I made. Wow.
---
I got you with those "likes" don't worry
---
You can expect something on the holidays at least. Bare minimum I can see another meat week around Thanksgiving with a huge purveyor sale on black Friday.
---
Twitter has already posted about this via Bethesda and Fallout pages.
---
I agree I hate hearing peoples voices breaks the immersion for me.
---
Todd, I'm begging you, please, I've already ordered skyrim on the switch for you, please Todd, i can't afford to keep buying skyrim
---
Damn. Sweet Melee glory. I envy you.
---
I repurchased fallout 1st because I thought it expired (bought it 5 days ago and didn‚Äôt realize this until after the fact waiting for Bethesda to get back to my refund) and it still doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Probably resetting it to shake off all the scammers who charge backed and still got to keep 1st
---
Funny part is I'm building my melee character right now
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking as well, that‚Äôs why I think it would be good that if it only applied to the owner. The camp placement somewhat affects the spawn location I know that much.
---
Someone with an equal IQ level to you

The little happy things are there in life to bring you a little happy moments in this sucky world, and those little happy bits add up, for reals. Go check out some of the wholesome subreddits.
---
Sometimes it really is the little things in life whether real life, or while you're playing a fun game, that can bring a smile to your face, and make you feel physically better for that smile. Whether you're the one doing the nice things, or on the receiving end.
---
I'm sure there will be a little something for Thanksgiving and Christmas.
---
I‚Äôm genuinely curious and not trying to start an argument. Did you pay for it or did you do the loophole that lets you get it for free?
---
Yea I admit Im a fool for that one :(
---
I've been close. Lower middle class. I grew up lower middle class. What am I supposed to be imagining here? Are you trying to say I need to feel ashamed that my Dad walked out when I was young, and changed his name, and my Mom worked three jobs to support us? I really don't get what your intention is. Or is that the only way you can feel good about what you have?
---
I mean, I live in a nice penthouse condo now. Beautifully decorated. Rooftop access. The view is so amazing I can see several towns' fireworks miles away, every 4th of July across the horizon. I have to imagine what it's like to be a lot of things. I don't have to imagine being poor. Do you have to imagine it?
---
While you're dreaming, try to imagine a comeback that doesn't utterly suck.
---
Some will say no, I say yes.   The community is full of great people and the game may seem like an endless grind but I promise you, you will have some great memories.
---
Another thing that bathesda didnt test before a release
---
They stay in the box, you can use them, you just can't add more :)
---
I once had to complete a large trade in game (involving multiple characters for both of us) using Reddit Chat. Pretty fucking obtuse.
---
Thank you everyone for your input. Seems that many people load out a nice set of normal armor and keep a PA in the pocket.
---
I thought it was separate from your stash so lose everything?
---
I wish I had that luck. My stealth commando is still using a zealot lever rifle with 10% more accuracy. Have fun devastating everything in Appalachia!
---
Cool, thanks. I'm thinking about giving it a try.
---
Its $16 on Amazon right now. So if it's cheaper than that sure. Its a alot of content for that price.
---
Honestly id check ebay to saw a xbox version for $4
---
Keep in mind tho, the game can run like $15 game at times. As long as your aware of that and accept it, its a fun game.
---
Another deleted post from op
---
I don't know whats more stupid. The fact that:
---
1. Bethesda keeps breaking their own games. 
---
2. They feel the need to charge extra for content and fixes that should have been free.
---
or
---
3. They refuse to even acknowledge that regular users are upset by all this, but trip over themselves to bend over backwards for people actually buying into their shameless cash grab.
---
That...actually sounds fun and hilarious. I'm going to do it tonight.
---
Lol, I usually leave a jarred scorched limb or supermutant body part.
---
Yeah I don't have it but I've been thinking about it so I've been keeping an eye out for info lol
---
Ummmmm. I‚Äôve got proof. Check my tread. I legitimately bought the game and now I‚Äôm basically locked out of what I paid for.
---
Outer worlds kind of scratches a separate itch to me. But I like conspiracies so upvote.
---
A lot of people seem suspicious about stuff like this, I do some random things like this. I've had people do some random things like this for me.
---
Instead of accusing people of making it up or calling it a bogus account, accept the fact that maybe there are some good wholesome things in this world. Real and Fallout.
---
Thank you op for the smile inducing share :)
---
The cash grab argument doesn't really hold. If they were just doing it for nothing other then quick money then why would they updated if
---
T and keep an entire game studio employed to work on it? Seriously you trolls have real issues thinking for yourself. It's a shame logic and reason gets through out the window for the angry mob mentality. People like you are the reason I signed up for fallout 1st. I'm not going to let a bunch of assholes tell me what I can and can not play. Go away!
---
Probably a couple of events and a new map in nuclear winter
---
I super appreciate the update. I should have googled first.  I expect to have my sub extended for the full length of the downtime &lt; insert laugh track here &gt;.  Yeah, yeah, I'm a comedian.  I know that isn't going to happen.
---
I already canceled the auto-renew.  I won't even begin to sub again.  I did it because I'm new to the game and didn't understand all the lies they told, and the fact that there are a bunch of jackasses in the game harassing anyone who bought a sub.  ROKU_TV was the one doing it.  I guess he thought I was dumb enough to fight back since he was shooting me and hitting me with his hammer and shooting at my camp stuff.  I understand the mechanics, so I just gave him a thumbs down and went to play on my private server, only to find that I cannot.  I'm not a happy camper.
---
I hate to admit it, but it appears that everyone who hates on this company has good reason.  They suffer from erectile dysfunction.  They can't keep it up when it comes to paid for services.
---
Hi, thank you for reporting this issue to us. We are actively investigating and we believe it may now be resolved. 
---
For those of you who were affected by this, can you please log back into the game to check if your membership benefits are now available?
---
Thank you very much!
---
&gt;Thank you for your patience!
---
Patience? That's a funny way to spell money
---
Yes, both my Fallout 1st accounts were inaccessible earlier, but Bethesda seems to have fixed it and I can now log back into my Private Servers.
---
I find it more strange that this is affecting people really randomly, even people who didn't cancel the recurring membership are having this problem
---
The skins are releasing 1 per day until nov 4th but all skins will be able to be earned and unlocked until nov 12th, and found the info on another redditors post, cant remember the name. I'm sure youll find it if you look it up in the sub.

Where else is going to be decorated up for the holidays but a place that still has a functioning robot staff though? Maybe the Pumpkin House.
---
As an update, we believe this issue is now resolved following investigation. Can those of you who were affected please log back into the game to see if your Fallout 1st membership benefits are now available?
---
No that game is good dont get me wrong but it's only about 30-60 hours
---
I said I haven't seen it, but I'm definitely willing to look. One moment please. This load time may be longer than usual. (Lol ESO)
---
Never got to play Destiny so I hopped right onto that deal. Had a shitload of fun with Destiny 2 even if the story was kinda meh for base game
---
Normal armour&gt;tin can unless using heavy weapons for stabilized 3. Unyielding gives a 15 bonus to every stat besides endurance. 3 of them give me increased appetite refresh as well. I can also swap one out to get 0% fall damage taken
---
You guys are fucking stupid.
---
When the legendary mob didn't bug out of the map and disappear, lol.
---
*PC, Public, Adventure, no 1st membership*
---
* I have been experiencing CTDs on two machines (i7 4770K+16GB+GTX1060; i7 8700+32GB+GTX1060) right when the event completes, after the fighting is over and no further shots/explosions happen. 10+ players with explosive (legendary) weapons. I get the event rewards but missed a few legendary loot due to the CTD. (I'd assume there is an use-after-free cleanup bug due to the high volume of events from other players.)
---
* Fast traveling to the event from the WS Train Station or from inside WS sometimes doesn't work (nothing happens).
---
* The "Deface" wall locations lag a lot to show a menu (and when it shows, I'm already fighting the robots/ghouls spawning in).
---
* I died once from a Ghoul, respawned at the resort FT point and was stuck without controls, only a Respawn (Space) was available. Respawn acted like fast travel and wouldn't let me leave due to the robots attacking my me. It took them a minute to kill me again (full set of Troubleshooter's armor), at which point I was automatically respawned and got my controls back.
---
Yeah I feel ya. I got suckered on this one. I usually follow the same mantra but for some reason I jumped on this one thinking "What could happen?"
---
I'm in the complete pint sized slasher outfit and mask and haven't gotten any progress on the challenges. 
---
Honestly though, I'm not surprised. This event is broken for me anyways. Have crashed 5/7 attempts.
---
Eh, they can't even keep the subscription benefits running.  PC users are currently without their subscription benefits... no ETA on when they'll be restored.  Ok all you haters.  I'm a hater now too.  Bethesda sucks and sucks hard.
---
After looking into this, we believe it is now resolved. If your membership benefits were unavailable as a result of this issue, can you please log back into the game to see if they are available again?
---
Just spawing at whitesprings station it was Reeal laggy last night.
---
That sucks man, hope it‚Äôll get fixed soon.
---
U r dum dum?
---
I managed to do the event 2 out of 4 tries, and both times I got a happy pumpkin plan, which is exactly the same pumpkin I got for free in the atom store. I think this whole thing is more trick that treat.
---
Yesss the memes are beginning
---
After looking into reports, we believe this issue is now resolved. 
---
If you were affected by this issue, can you try logging back in to check that your Fallout 1st membership benefits are available now?

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dpd8hh/for_all_the_people_claiming_fallout_1st_is_broke/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Yeah no. I'll remind you of rule #4.
---
I never once said you blamed the players, appears you assumed incorrectly and while you're telling me to keep up with the discussion, you might want to catch up yourself.  At most, I asked for clarification because the two posts made it appear that you woudn't, then would blame them.
---
I love that you tell me I can't follow along when you seem to stumble over every comment.  I made it clear in every instance where and how you could blame the developers versus the players but no matter what the example is, you want to blame the developers.  Wow.
---
I just bought fallout 1st again (waiting on refund idk why Bethesda let‚Äôs you purchase it twice in one month) and it‚Äôs still down for me
---
I would love to be able to smoke a cigarette while sitting.  I like when games add those little things.
---
So you get fresh fields, while we have to deal with farmed-out shared space?
---
Stop the gloat!
---
True. You don‚Äôt have buy more, but companies always play with your psychology to entice you to do so. So it‚Äôs not entirely up to you.
---
That‚Äôs true as well. They‚Äôre not obligated to give Fallout 1st members atom shop items for free. However, with all backlash and blenders surrounding Bethesda and this game, it would go a long way to gain back some good will if they did.
---
Okay, but still. Many can‚Äôt really access the server.
---
I stand corrected. It's a PC issue then? I'm not seeing anything for consoles.
---
They won't fix it, they want you to pay for private sessions.
---
They definitely have improved it. If you really wanted to know that it wouldn't take much digging to find it out. Check out forbes for example. Their writer hated it at release but just released an article last week that admitted that it's been vastly improved. You can believe whatever you want but I am guessing you honestly don't want to know the truth and would rather just bash the game.
---
Gotcha, thankyou
---
Ok thx
---
Where can you see how far along you are for each challenge?
---
Ironically I was gonna put Outer Worlds aside for tonight and try and grind my FO76 Character on a Private Server since I haven't played for months.....oh Bethesda, you giveth yet take so much away.
---
You mean Elle's research, right?
---
I truly don‚Äôt have any idea. I just sit here waiting for anything on Bethesda‚Äô part.
---
I paid for it.
---
It proves that for some reason you can see something that should be private, anyway.
---
It's Fallout 1st members on PC that are having the issue.
---
How do I get a fallout first reddit badge?
---
Level 700 right..
---
whats my IQ?
---
What's Kanye's IQ?
---
Just to like, chill.
---
I think I figured it out - It's another one of those "You went into NW first" bugs
---
That's what I'm saying about lazy or understaffed. Ever consider a new area? Or adding a mob spawn to an area.
---
Lol, same. Just without the Outer Worlds part. I don‚Äôt really like the game. No free roam is a killer for me.
---
Bruh https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1189653753659609088?s=19
---
Totally unrelated question, whats your IQ?
---
I made a post with nothing but links to all the news articles that came out the day after private servers launched and a couple days before outer limits was released all saying how bethesda messed up and the fallout community would enjoy outet worlds better etc. There was like nine links. And of course i get nothing but downvotes. Then i started looking at who makes the games and who owns them etc. Was pretty obvious they were trying to get us to buy outer limits and push wastlanders back a few months for that reason. Yea i see your wink
---
I know I wont ever buy a online game from them again. They better not ruin starfield and es6
---
By ruining the fun of everyone else at the event, huh?
---
look at the way other posts are formatted.   It's not rocket science.
---
Oh yes! This was my experience as well.
---
The honest truth is people are just looking to provoke Bethesda into making the game better...The Outer Worlds might be a nice alternative to FO New Vegas but 76 is Online open world with a battle royal option so to compare the 2 is not really fair.
---
On market you have to put the platform code pretty specifically for it to be approved. For example if im on Xbox it would be
---
"[XB1] W: js djejddbsu H: sbshdudnsb"
---
Pretty sure the pc code is [PC] checking it now
---
Huh, that true? My pal refunded and tells me he still has the tent deployed...
---
Jokes on you, it gets worse after you pay.
---
Ok so we can do the previous ones though? Ya had me worried there for a second.
---
Witch hat and Halloween costume works for lady costumes.
---
I can reasonably pull down 120-150 atoms a week from daily challenges. I'll get another 60-80 from weekly challenges. That's about 200 per week on average, or 9 weeks of playing per PA skin if I buy nothing else with my atoms. Of course there are limited-run items and sales that I'd be daft to not take advantage of, but that stretches me out even further.
---
For me the skins and decorations just make the game look nicer. I don't need them and they're not even close to being a goal for me. I paid $60 for the game, but I haven't given Bethesda any  additional money since release, nor will I if I feel a purchase isn't worth it. Same reason that I have no interest in Fallout First; it's just not worth it to me, nor to a lot of people it seems.
---
Again, I'd gladly buy $20-$40 worth of atoms a year to buy skins and decorations I like, but not when the best deal I can get is $40/5000 atoms. That's 125 atoms/dollar. Going back to the power armor skins I can spend a minimum of 2 months collecting atoms or spend at least $14.40 worth of purchased atoms. Either way it's a raw deal for people who aren't hardcore 76 players.
---
All I'm saying is that if atoms were cheaper or if Atomic Shop prices were lower they'd get people like me (with full-time jobs; who also enjoy other video games or have hobbies besides gaming; who have families; who love Fallout and want to see the franchise flourish) to pay them real money in exchange for digital goods they've already made and which we otherwise wouldn't buy from them.
---
They're under Character challenges, you can only see one at a time though.
---
There is a Indside the vault tomorrow. So hopefully we get some info there. But I think it will be just hype and talk about the current event sadly.
---
I hate you mom!
---
I know i sound so stupid but I‚Äôm literally doing everything right. It either deletes my post or i‚Äôm not doing the format right :(
---
I agree. Doesn't happen often enough for me to really care anyway.
---
That's entirely reasonable.
---
You should at least tweet something about this the minute you know something is wrong.
---
It's just vague enough on the wording, that they can get away with offering damn near nothing. They offer one discount a year and they still told the truth. Also vague enough that even 1% is enough to quality.
---
Note: I'm not saying these two things will happen, it's purely hyperbole. I'm sure there will be more discounts and higher percentages. But the idea is that they can get away with the bare minimum.
---
"Hi, thank you for reporting this issue to us. We are actively investigating and we believe it may now be resolved. 
---
Thank you very much!"
---
This is the text from a comment on another thread, about 5 minutes ago, from the Bethesda Reddit Account. Maybe it's fixed?
---
I love this new drama.  Lol.
---
Thank you, but i‚Äôm doing everything right i‚Äôm pretty sure, i‚Äôll keep trying, but thanks anyways.
---
I think you mean ‚Äúforget‚Äù
---
Must be an oversight. They are usually soooo reliable
---
Not asking you to remove it, just wanted to know the thought process.
---
Idiot tax.
---
I guess the one benefit to this i can finish up the fate go Halloween event, so i mean, that's cool...
---
And how about a revive when you see someone down.  Sheesh.
---
Make sure that both p and c are capitalized. Dont really know what else it could be
---
Yes, a new challenge isn't replacing the old one each day they're just unlocking access to each successive one.
---
I thought asshats got their own servers now?
---
I'm having a hard time translating too. Seems like some weird dialect of... gibberish?
---
Yep
---
That‚Äôs pretty sad.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve done exactly that, Thanks anyway! :)
---
To be fair, I learned when you don't have FO1st anymore, I can confirm you can still access the chest and remove stuff, just not put stuff in.
---
So they did get that part correct.
---
Re-logging has indeed fixed it.
---
Oof. OP,that must sting.
---
daily events and legendary farming.
---
Your comment regarding the "win" being having a rare weapon made me do some thinking.
---
The main problem is that the game is not balanced for the prices some players may charge for in-game items.  However, if an item costs 100k caps or 100k 5,56 ammo, there would be at least 2 ways of doing it:
---
1. Caps on 4 characters.  Would take 22 days to reach max caps on 4 characters (assuming no additional income from player-vending).
---
2. 5,56 Ammo: would need to reserve 50lbs of space and Bandolier-2 to store 100k ammo.  Considering running weight of 200lbs and Excavator Armour capacity of 400-450 lbs this is doable.
---
Of course, to simplify things, it would be easier to dedicate one of the characters to farming, making and storing ammo.
---
So even the goals of 100k+ caps/ammo are reachable.  Main task would be farming for materials and the premium service does not offer a major advantage for this.
---
Hey, if Bethesda doesn't care to make things right even when they benefit from it, they are the only ones to blame.
---
I canceled through my Microsoft account, not through bethesda or Xbox.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to playing it. I usually get heavily into a game then all of a sudden stop for a few months, then get back into it, etc.  right now I‚Äôm on a 76 kick, but  next up will be OW.
---
Native English speaker I take it?
---
That's not the way that works actually. Subscribers are still limited by spawn rates and global cooldowns, just like everyone else.
---
What did your title say? Exact wording.
---
Of course
---
A lot of companies skew data to push an agenda. Did Bethesda do it here? I can't say. But it wouldn't surprise me. This is a company that has the worst QA. Or, the managers fail to listen to the QA they have. So the idea of them only listening to data that supports their agendas, wouldn't come as a shock.
---
Well, if they removed it, then they own atoms for those of us that bought it.  If they made a mistake by putting in a bundle before they were supposed to, then those that had it should be able to keep it.  
---
Btw, was it stated in the patch notes that they were removing it?
---
Im stealing this video when i need proof.
---
The subscription status isn't private. Also, anyone on your friends list can join your private server at will, ad long as it doesn't go over 8 players.
---
Dude. He's not wrong. Im in my private world as well. If op didnt delete so many of his posts/comments, you would see im not his biggest fan but he is correct on this one
---
Glad it's not taint the name of outer worlds like that smh
---
Do you expect anything will change with the same upper management?
---
You should type that same question into the search bar, it‚Äôs been asked a lot in this sub.
---
They are having issues with charge backs.  It should sort out soon
---
You don't believe he's level 700? I've seen higher on PS4.
---
When you give Bethesda money, you tacitly approve of their actions. The anger is only slightly misplaced, but it is misplaced
---
Sell now!
---
I dont know. You seem to, so I was asking.
---
Agreed. Many smaller sales over a few big ones. Over time, this can net far more money and create goodwill which will lead to more sales. People are more willing to give companies money if they monetize in good faith. Especially when you're selling assets that were already paid for years ago.
---
I put over 300 hours into this game. I'm not sure I can say I didn't get what I paid for and I've been playing since beta. People can say and feel however they want about this but the simple fact is these games aren't free to support so unless their is cash flowing in it won't be sustainable. It's because of this I always tried to spend at least 20 dollars a month on the atoms store to make sure they kept developing it. Sadly I don't think enough people had my mentality about the game so here we are with a subscription fee but on the brightside for me now I only have to pay 13 a month.
---
Wow i was trying it again as you sent this, now it worked :/ I‚Äôm not sure what i was doing wrong but i put ‚Äú[PC] H: Whitespring Jumpsuit, W: Caps‚Äù
---
You're right I did have the ability to craft it lol. Thanks
---
Some people were making it put like it was a blanket issue across all platforms. It was definitely an issue on PC. Pne of the Bethesda community managers just commented on another post that it should be fixed now though.
---
Such a nice thing to do.
---
Glad it worked! It‚Äôs very picky, but you got it :)
---
Yeah haha, thanks man!
---
Reminds me of an old video.

It's in the challenge section of the map. Under character. Earn 250 exp for bats paint and 759 exp for Halloween paint

I doubt they literally said that.
---
Oh boy - is this the first BSG post since the 1st drama started? Where's my popcorn...
---
Isn't that a New Vegas reference?
---
Ah, yes. The classic retort.
---
As I'm pretty sure I saw these comments... Your friend made multiple posts talking about gathering groups of fallout 1st players to hunt down people without subs. Pretty sure that's against the rules here. (Witchhunting?)
---
Wow I've heard of many lies in my time but this takes the cake in the most idiotic things people lie about category.
---
...snap! üì∏
---
Gotta wait till 8pm I believe
---
Why did you buy a broken product for a broken game?
---
Didnt they say this was coming next year? It was from the panel they did about a month or two ago where we learned more about wastlanders
---
Nah i havent a clue
---
Lmao get what you deserve my guy
---
Cheers I'll check it tomorrow
---
Thank you! Is that eastern time?
---
&gt;Yeah no. I'll remind you of rule #4.
---
I'm not the one who's been repeatedly calling the other person "trash" or "garbage" in this conversation. Or implied that they were bullied in the past. Or that they want to make the game unplayable for others. And all the other bullshit you've been assuming about me.
---
Go to wikipedia and look up the article on ad hominem. This whole conversation you've been more interested in discussing me and my "flaws" that you've been assuming than sticking to the actual topic of the thread.
---
I am so done with this idiotic discussion now. Don't bother me anymore.
---
Try throwing some money at it.
---
Bethesda-Playing solo in private servers can help alleviate this issue.
---
Just please dont be those guys paying then asking for a refund after youve used your scrapbox.
---
If you got nothing else to spend your money on I guess
---
I think you can wear your PA and just take off the PA helmet to wear a costume hat. You only need one costume item for it to count.
---
Hilarious! Great contribution to the subreddit, my guy.
---
Horrible attempt
---
When I cashed my scrip in after the sale one of my accounts received three 3-Star plasma pistols in a row.  Each had different effects, but I had to stop because I don't use plasma pistols and didn't want 10 of them.  The Purveyor is super rigged to give whatever you DON'T want or use.  Every once in a while it will give you a dream weapon or really decent weapon or armor, but it's like 1:100.
---
Yeahhh that's a pretty sketchy move lmao
---
The junk jet in FO4 used to be awesome if you loaded it with Pre-war money... ;)

Why? That's not going to solve anything

Ancient France?

Good going, I tried but ran out of time, it is not easy so well done :)
---
I don‚Äôt still use a landline. I use a cell phone. As you said... it‚Äôs 2019
---
Because it‚Äôs *not* a broken game. 
---
You just don‚Äôt like something so you‚Äôre jumping on your little internet bandwagon to express outrage cos some meme told you to, half the hate this game cops is STILL from people who haven‚Äôt actually given it a go
---
Theyre always slow as hell releasing roadmaps imo. I would suspect some events and maybe a small questline.
---
BSG should pay you for spoon-feeding them like this.
---
You have to leave the event area or you die, so the event fails. It's not a "minor inconvenience".
---
It's just a way to grief 20 or more players at once, while claiming the standard "the game LETS me do it / Ima RPG Raider" excuse to be a douche nozzle.
---
Ah okay. I was gonna say that if you had done the scam thing then maybe they found a way to start cracking down on it, but since you paid for it that idea is out the window
---
Things are $8 because of MS &amp; Sony take 30%+ of the transaction, Bethesda wants $4-5.
---
Looks like they fixed it already.
---
Many world food counts: Fancy lads cakes, Bubblegum, Gum drops, Funnel Cake &amp; Dandy boy apples if I remember correctly.
---
Nope, just can't add more once the subscription is done.
---
Correct, if you're already spending about $20 a month on Atoms, you might as well get this.  You get the 1650 atoms and everything else free on top of what you'd already be paying anyway.  
---
I haven't paid for any in months, and still won't, with the decisions Bethesda keeps making though.
---
I think it‚Äôs more an issue of your particular market drying up. I‚Äôm still selling outfits and plans like hotcakes.
---
Did you check if the other user was banned?

Cuck.

5 out of 6 crashes here.. Similar goes for teammates

We are the Red Guard!... ^whoops ^wrong ^series...

I loved that gun.
---
I though it was funny I was playing along, I was sad to see that post deleted
---
That's the thin line I was talking about. Creation Club was the biggest wrong step they took in almost a decade of fostering goodwill.
---
I can see why this got removed.
---
Try clearing your cache/hard reset?
---
I've also seen it in here that dropping your resolution from 4k to 1080p makes a big difference.
---
Legendary farming with high Intel and cranberry relish is fantastic. Kinda suprised we didnt get a 2x xp for the event honestly.
---
What about 50 Dollar psn Gift card ?
---
Thats either Randy savage or Russel brand
---
hah. mischievous
---
I think the atom shop items need to be a lot cheaper than half-off. Nothing should cost more than $5. Most camp items and skins should be around $2 each. At that price most players would probably fork over $10 or more per month.
---
*The image you are requesting does not exist or is no longer available.*

How ironic... The image is as broken as the game.

Well no , i just hope the 2 games that I mentioned are single player rpgs

You seriously can't remember things you typed 30 minutes ago? That's a shame. :(

After they seized a workshop from me, and killed me once, their turrets attacked. I left my corpse on the ground, continually and deafeningly getting shot by their turrets, until they signed off.
---
There's a huge difference between visual bug and bug that erases your inventory... 
---
I'm not, the last part of this post clearly indicates you're mocking naysayers
---
That was causing me the same issue
---
I play 76 on an empty SSD. I've hard reset dozens of times since NW release. I play on 720p.
---
Na add initial intro of how its a great/fun game however....your info. Lets be honest with everything not just your opinion.
---
No, I mean even as a single player RPG. Do you expect anything to change without a change to upper management.
---
Hmm really? *Looks at explosive reduced weight shotty and enforcement 3 perk*
---
Same here. I started this last week as my new thing to keep the game interesting. I purposely hop to camps when the owner is there to do this.
---
I really doubt they give an F about cheaters. I've been reporting them for months and no one's getting banned. It's like they consider hacks as some sort of mods
---
Did it four times yesterday including two that were nuked. No issues. On PC.
---
I blow up cars so I have a safe place to stand (good for low level taggers too)
---
Dropped my controller on the right trigger. The Fatman I was holding while exploring this poor kid‚Äôs camp went off.

He didn‚Äôt believe me and called me a griefer
---
Well for one, RWT is against the rules, and two they‚Äôll give you a code that is either null and void or they‚Äôll give you a code with 5 bucks rather than 50.
---
Have fun. Been hearing fantasic things about outer worlds.
---
Thank you for the link. It's interesting but a small sample size. Also what exactly is the point of seeding? I don't see how it improves the game.
---
Oh and for what it's worth after all this purveyor talk I turned in 500 scrip on my last roll I got a JE Gatling with 15% reload. Being a Junkies build I'm very happy with this.
---
They never stopped reading. They just stopped listening.
---
Me too, it just really sucks considering fo76 NW was such a surprisingly good battle Royale mode. To have half of your matches ruined because some dweeb is fly-running with a laser rifle, there are no words for this kind of frustration.
---
They better start to care, because if it continues as bad as it‚Äôs been recently, a sizable percentage of 76ers are going to give up and leave.
---
Wait what? it ain't accumulated? You sayin it's better to do 14k exp after all the skin's been released, Correct?
---
Evil mean dum dum precious, stupid fat hobbit.
---
As far as we know Wastelands is going to be a free update not DLC
---
I feel Iike everyone who still plays that game is newer to it. Like I‚Äôve forgotten more about it the current players know. Leaving backs of crap on beds was hip last November
---
Lately I've had luck not even 10 minutes ago I got a JE Gatling with faster reload. Also of note is I'm a Junkies Build so I'm quite happy.
---
OH NO ONE OF OUR PREMIER SUBSCRIPTION MEMBERS NEEDS HELP! BETTER GET PREMIER SUPPORT ON THE CASE!
---
Ah jeez I didn't even think of that.
---
Still too expensive for end user. 30% of 0 is 0.
---
Thankyou se√±or
---
It‚Äôs sad, I‚Äôd rather play 76 but it does not work, at all.
---
Lol using his sub to spread the wealth. Still call him bad names.
---
Right. And the meta discussion he was responding to is about FALSELY accusing people of giving positive feedback.  He's missing the point.  No one has arguing that there are paid reviewers out there.  It's the blanket statement that it's all there is.
---
fair enough, in my experience condescension always prevails online, so at least you are consistent....
---
*OOF*
---
I once found out where one guy lived and set fire to his car and smashed his windows. Teach him not to back out on a trade the mofo.
---
With all due respect, your buddy should've thought about the repercussions of calling people who don't pay for an online subscription "pathetic poors."
---
I started with calling the person trying to target certain players as trash, followed-up with calling people who support and justfy that action as trash.  You defended him and attempted to justify it with describing you experience being gawked on WoW. Which I would have said I feel bad because I hate players that target specific people because of their lower level.  Instead you decided to start trying to blame the developers for leaving that flaw in the game.
---
I haven't been interested in discussing your flaws at all. I have been however been interested in why you're justifying the targeting of specific players.  THAT was the actual topic, so you might want to check yourself.
---
You keep saying your done, but you keep coming back.  If you didn't try to defend the targeting of players, you wouldn't be in this mess.
---
I gave it a go for a month. An $80 dollar go. I convinced 2 other friends to get it. We all played and had fun for the first month ignoring bug after bug. Stealth nerd after stealth nerf. The game kept getting worse. This is not a bandwagon post. This is an upset customer that believed in something and was completed disappointed and taken advantage of.
---
Its like they lied....again
---
Supposed to be a survival game at heart, the less "conveniences" I have the more dire shit seems, nothing in the Atom Shop interests me enough to spend a cent, if I want something I can wait it out and gain them from in game resources, even then nothing interests me and I would only buy cosmetic items, no convenience items at all. I don't promote this game becoming a weird,apocalyptic Sims game. Keep it gritty and real as possible is all I'm looking for, too many items of convenience is a take away for me personally.
---
Fallout 1st is last on the list as far as I'm concerned. Just not for me. Only real problem I have with the sub is it promotes more paywalls for content I may buy in the future. Other than that, money is yours to waste. You could buy 3 to 4 new games for the price of sub, you don't get much with FO 1st tbh.
---
The caaar is in the front yaaard. Im sleeping with my clothes ooon.
---
Skew what to who? My entire post is speculation, and not based on anything concrete. They have no reason to lie; if cosmetic only really is their best seller they have no reason to change direction, because development of utility items is higher than making skins.
---
You know what would make me team up more? Shared xp in a group whether you tag the mob or not. My wife plays a stealth sniper build and there is absolutely no point in playing with her if I want to progress my character because she one shots everything.
---
Anti-cheat lobbies are an upcoming feature of Fallout 1st.
---
Stars yes. A level 6 asked me to help grind him up and it was such a chore. We hit him all the way to 7! Woo!
---
Dude get a life lol
---
&gt; refunded
---
If you cancel the subscription (if you signed up for the monthly option) the you still get your Month of membership just the next month wont automatically be charged. And with the sub running out you keep the Atoms, The Outfit, The Icons, The Emotes, and Scrapbox (withdrawal only). You lose the Tent and Private World option.
---
If you sign up and refund the purchase (getting it essentially for free) you should have the 1st benefits all removed. If it was done intentionally trying to get those things for free you are committing fraud and theft and your account should be banned. Steam Restricts any account that does a chargeback so does Origin. Bethesda should do the same. But Bethesda is too cowardly to take that stance as they are afraid of the bad press that would generate.
---
I'm sure News Sites, Reddit, and Youtubers would be falling over themselves to run the story - "User banned for canceling 1st Subscription" While conveniently leaving out the fact the user fraudulently got the features (and Atoms) of the Subscription for free in the first place.
---
Chairs are there so if you go afk it won't log you out for 10 minutes. Lol
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm not positive but it‚Äôs been there the past two nights after 8.
---
Good tips! Also, make sure you have completed the objective to wear a costume. I'm running the Confederate Uniform and Confederate Hat with a Two Shot Explosive The Dragon (for show, I usually use my Junkie's Deathclaw Gauntlet).
---
The weird part is that, long story short, my character is black right now and has the grime on his face which kind of looks like blackface.
---
Its okay to take breaks from games. I come and go from fallout pretty regularly. Sometimes you just need a break. Makes new content last longer too
---
I find the fastest way is taking over Workshops and defending them. Not only will you fight a bunch of level appropriate enemies, but you'll also get the xp from the quests to take them over and defend them
---
Yes, but need someone to confirm since I already did yesterdays challenge and I can't check until tomorrows unlocks.  There is a chance the VTU stuff wasn't supposed to be cumulative and they've fixed it for this one but won't know until someone can check.
---
That's true only if FO76 is not your main game. Anecdotally, dor most FO1 subscribers, it is; they don't play anything else.
---
Also a Fallout Sims game would be awesome.
---
Many thanks ....grateful cheers.
---
The emote was free
---
Wait, did you just reverse uno card me? xD
---
100% of Bethesda replies today were to posts made by Fallout 1st members.
---
I have 2 cats and 2 dogs, both happy as can be, just like their owner.  I'm sorry that me enjoying pvp in a game that has pvp in it makes you so upset that you need a tampon, so much so to the point that you make astringent comments about my intelligence and character.
---
And if 'busy doing stuff' is them walking around, setting stuff up, then they should also be aware that every moment they're in the zone is another chance for them to get shot.  If they're sitting afk in a workshop, I'm killing them anyways for being stupid enough to afk in a zone that people can kill you in...
---
I bet if you played rust and walked out to grab stone or wood, and got killed, you'd do nothing but try to bitch at the person you got killed by instead of thinking bout what you could do better to keep yourself from getting killed...
---
I just love how I haven't said a thing to you once, and you reply to a comment of mine with nothing mean or harsh said, and you come out the gate swinging with "you probably lack character and intellectual complexity" lmao wtf
---
But remember guys, pvp'rs are toxic.  LMFAO
---
Private worlds are asshat free zones - so we won't see you on one.
---
In business you take care of the money first.
---
This is the same as when Delta lets 1st class passengers on the plane first.
---
You do not pass up the guy that pays you for the guy that doesnt.  Its not how business works.
---
I know this is still lost on a lot of you, but Bethesda is not a 501c3 they are a for profit company.  As a for profit company, they make sure the bottom line is still there, this means assisting those who paid for the service first.
---
Where did this mentality come from that for profit businesses should bend over and give the consumers everything for free?
---
This is not shocking, or breaking news.  This is normal business operation for any buisness that is created to make money.
---
That means i like you.
---
I'm not sure about them being used but I do find a ton more empty spawn locations for bobbles mags and cap stashes and my main complaint it seems like everywhere I go from the mire to to the savage divide every creature is a stupid low level WTF if I'm 273 and my Gf (Only other player on with me) is 190+ why do we see level 20 or below on every horde event and all over the damn map...
---
Maybe if we lived in a fantasy world where everything was free but since it's not then how on earth to you suppose Bethesda keep the servers up?
---
&gt;You keep saying your done, but you keep coming back.
---
I respond because you always want to have the last word and try to extend the discussion by saying something incorrect about me. Otherwise I was done a long time ago, and I even told you so twice yesterday.
---
Thanks again. Yeah i had been unlocking them in the evenings too. Makes sense!
---
Well, there‚Äôs a limited time event right now that I‚Äôm missing. They really screwed me over.
---
If you're playing on an OG XB1, it's going to continue being an issue. I have several friends who stopped playing NW because of the resulting lag. This game is in desperate need of some optimization.
---
I have an X, and an S, and aside from minor latency issues, I don't have many problems.
---
Crap I responded to the wrong post. Apologies! I'm quite drunk.
---
Why is that.selling for 10k?
---
Yeah thats what i do lol
---
I dont care what they have to say, its already said. Tired of seeing it.....so take your lack of intellect elsewhere. I didnt target anyone but if your feelings were hurt i do feel good about that lol. Stop complaining, when you have no knowledge of its inner workings. I just urge people to analytically think before making a shitpost that follows suit like good doggies.
---
I‚Äôd rather wastelanders didn‚Äôt release broken 
---
So it‚Äôd be preferable if it‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs being worked on 
---
But they‚Äôll probably do something for Christmas
---
Again I must have some kind of luck because I DO see people swarm to help ... are they friends? strangers? just happen to be near? Who knows. I like to think if I fell, there'd would be a "you" there to help me.
---
Was it?  I thought it was part of the scavengers bundle.
---
That's too bad, then.
---
I actually never have to grind for anything but lead at lucky hole mine, strictly because I get all my junk from killing people at workshops.  (And that's why this will get downvoted lmao)
---
Sure I don't have 2 mules stocked full with extra materials, but I sure as hell don't ever need to grind for the materials I need.
---
So Bethesda has another thing to sell Reskins of.
---
Your example is stupid, so I wont even take it's bait. looks stale anyway.
---
There are lots of posts from people having issues today, but the only replies are to people having issues with Fallout 1st. That's not 'taking care of money first' - thats 'taking care of money ONLY'
---
There are definitely better games out there. But if you've got friends who play, and its cheep then go ahead.
---
Personally, i feel the gameplay its self has gone downhill since launch, and i find the storyline hard to follow since everything is in holotapes mainly, but i know a few people who actively enjoy the game.
---
My one, main warning is that if your expecting to play an online fo4, your going to be disappointed.
---
But delta doesn‚Äôt just ignore a regular passenger when they try to get your attention.
---
Shouldn't the plane load back to front?  And why would u want to pay more to sit in a plane longer?
---
Is it possible to add bug with V94 armour solar and thorn causing all miscellaneous mods listed as arms or legs being not available to install.
---
To clarify limb mods like ultra light can be installed on arms and legs. mods like brawling for arms can not be installed, sleek for legs can not be installed and so on
---
You are creating a false dilemma. They could do both. And you can aim to increase  profit through developing quality rather than developing new ways to get cash from existing customers.
---
It isn't the videogame, it's the fact people are selling themselves to corporatism and fuelling a damaging cycle of greed. And wasting their money. Someone said on a YouTube video that everyone still playing Fallout 76 is braindead, I disagreed, but the people on this sub reddit are making me reconsider my choice, especially you, who I stand by my earlier statement, you are the lumpenproletariat.
---
Sorry I‚Äôm hooked on Outer Worlds.  Haven‚Äôt checked Reddit lately.
---
&gt; Autustic Shit Fits
---
Wow I agreed with your comment until you decided to be a total fucking douche
---
How so? All things stated previously are not good reasons. Remember to ask why to your own respnse before responding. Secondly, if its an opinion of a business  keep it to yourself, its called freedom/capitalism....so on and so on, think before responding.
---
Also people who write negative article get thousands of up voters so I have no idea what you are talking about when you say the opposite happens. How long have you followed this subreddit?
---
What am I incorrect about?  The one thing I may have been wrong about, I said I could have been.  I'm usually one of the first people to apologize if I'm wrong about something.
---
No idea, some guy offered me 5K but i said 6K instead, he didn‚Äôt respond but it‚Äôs just quite rare apparently. It looks very boring though haha.
---
Na you are confused lol.
---
To post images you upload to imgur first then post the link in the text section.
---
Evidence?
---
How old are you? Above 18? I play with a adult only player faction
---
No clue
---
I really hope you understand i wasnt serious at all. 
---
I cant tell if you are either, but if you are serious then id say we got a -184 IQ situation goin on here
---
Nah dawg I don't think I am
---
Bullet Bulking was datamined so it might come soon or with Wastelanders
---
Why should they be obligated to help someone who isnt a subscriber?
---
They dont work for free either. 
---
Im betting Bethesda made a managerial decision to assist paying customers with active subscriptions first.  
---
I would have.
---
i didnt think either one of us should be taken seriously.
---
Fucking thank you. I hope all these children always complaining read this.
---
Gratz on lvl 7! Probably took 3 hours of accidentally killing things first haha!
---
Excuse me but what about the money I paid for the game? This is not a f2p mobile game.
---
Seeding is done as a way to make psuedorandomness. Chances are what is happening is they are using the characters name as the variable in their randomness algorithm. It is a lazy way of doing, better way to do it is to use things such as cpu temp, gpu temp, time, etc. stuff that can't be repeated, that gives better pseudorandomness.
---
Basically in programming it is impossible to create a truly random number, as it has to get its variables from somewhere, so if you use easily controlled variables you lose a lot of "randomness".
---
Here is a pretty quick overview on how hard random numbers are to generate vs "pseudorandom". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtOt7EBNEwQ
---
We ( the 2nds) also paid for the game as a service, so the idea that we're asking for something free isn't a useful argument.
---
Yeah I find Bethesda support always just tells you to delete and reinstall. When I did that it actually made my game worse.
---
&gt; Why should they be obligated to help someone who isnt a subscriber? They dont work for free either. 
---
Im going to wait for legitimate replies from here on out.
---
It's not about whether or not you feel like you got what you paid for. It's the principle of the matter. Promising things, and releasing broking content. Only to justify it by things like this. "Well, I played it a a lot, so it's fine.". But it isn't fine, it's still unethical for the company to sit back and charge players for a stable server when everyone should have stability in game. For free, an online game needs that stability. Because that's what is expected when you're promised to have the stability. Even without promises, its not right to release broken stuff and then expect the players to pay for things to be less broken.
---
All in all? You clearly missed the entire point of what I said, and should definitely reread the post. Your entire response is irrelevant to the context at hand. The context being, unethical business practice on Bethesda's part. So although I'm glad you're pleased with the fact that you "got your money's worth"? It has zero relevance to the subject matter in this thread of discussion. Literally none.
---
Truly though, I am glad you don't feel cheated. But it does not change one bit, that this sort of shit is horribly unethical and just bad form for a company. And, if they get away with it? More and more companies will follow suit, to get away with more and more shit. We've seen it in the past, actually. Microtransactions used to never be a thing, but once companies realized they can make more money from them? They all jumped in. To the point where some companies (EA) took it too far and received A LOT of backlash, and loot boxes became almost not allowed in games due to the predatory approach they took.
---
Unethical business practice, paving the way for more companies to do the same. Because here's the secret that game companies don't tell you, the same "secret" about all big companies. The COMPANIES? Don't give a shit about the players/consumers, not usually anyways. They care about their bottom line. It is the developers themselves who generally care. Which is also why it's safe to assume? The Devs are just doing what they're told. Because it's their job.
---
Let's use a different game as an example. Gearbox, seems to give a shit. 2K? Definitely doesn't. Their decisions are made on maximizing profits. The difference though, is how desperate are they? How far are they willing to go?
---
I'll leave this here on a final note, addressing your comment on "it's not free to support". And you're right, but that's also my point in its entirety. And proves you didn't actually properly read what I had said prior.
---
It isn't free to support, but I am not talking supporting things. I'm not even talking free CONTENT. I'm talking, the servers that are free and SHOULD have been stable at launch but still are not. That is the point I built my unethical argument on. The point that expresses why Fallout 1st is currently awful. (Fix the game, and then I don't care about 1st anymore. Because it stops being unethical.) You see, my entire platform is surrounding the fact that people are stuck paying for a service that gives them something (stable servers), that everyone should have as a result of buying the base game.
---
And the joy about this standpoint? You can't ACTUALLY argue against it, because it isn't wrong. That practice IS unethical as fuck. It's not fair to the consumer, and it does pave the way for others to possibly follow suit. These are all things that are not opinions. They're things that HAVE happened in the past in gaming. And they're things that ARE by definition, unethical. People should not have to feel like they need to buy fallout 1st, just to have the gameplay experience that was promised to them before launch. Functional, stable servers. They just shouldn't. This isn't some corrupt internet provider in the USA, who gives you your service but it's absolutely shit quality network speeds unless you want to buy services from the parent company for obscenely high rates. (Makes me glad ISPs having monopolies in Canada is illegal). This is, a company that made claims and set expectations. But never met those expectations. Which is false advertising.
---
Cause that can't be monotized
---
Yeah they fixed it for current members, unfortunately I signed up during the issue and it still hasn't processed for me though I was charged. I submitted a ticket, lucky me.
---
That's the hope, but unfortunately, it usually doesn't turn out that way; games still end up falling into the whale trap just because of the sheer volume. That's what happened to Kixeye; they started with lower but more loyal sales. However, whaling was just too lucrative it seemed. A couple years later, they were struggling. I think their War Commander game, which was developed along more traditional lines, ended up saving them.
---
If BGS wants FO76 to survive, they need to figure out what FO1st's core value is, and how to keep subscriptions longer than a month. Ranger coats won't do it.
---
you got a year free didnt you?  Thats what you paid for.
---
Look at the issue they were experiencing. It‚Äôs pretty severe and urgent.
---
I'm pretty sure (just as it was with the VTU rewards?) the next challenge will not unlock till you've completed the 1 before.
---
So actually, in this case it would be a horrible idea. The final challenge goals are much higher than with the VTU rewards, and there's a shorter period of time.
---
If you complete the previous leading up. You'll have 8-9 days to earn 14,000
---
But if you wait then with those same 8-9 days, and the game doesn't accumulate xp from the previous challenge to the next you'll need to complete 27,000 xp. 
---
That's a big risk.
---
Because the other people are customers too? They paid money for a product. There is also the fact that the community managers spent days on end not responding to any of their customers.
---
I have 3 decades of gaming experience under my belt.
---
Bethesda are con artists to let one of their smaller development teams to handle a rushed project built on a shitty engine framework that can't work well with a MMO format.
---
If anybody outside trolling, actually thinks Bethesda's problem is only "Bad PR", you are mentally ill.
---
Drum skeleton pony... Beat skulls... spooky... beating a dead... BEATING A DEAD HORSE!
---
And posts like this are gonna have the opposite effect. xD
---
I thought you wern't taking the bait.   Looks like it worked to me.
---
Omg You're drunk?? 
---
...Awesome!! Cheers mate!
---
Eventually I just got frustrated and said "Go questing!"
---
I'm 25
---
You also spent the last week trying to put Bethesda out of business.  
---
So there is that too.
---
Look in challenges in nuclear winter.
---
No. I paid to own the game? Purchases don't work like that, dumbass.
---
Locked up 1 out of every 3 times for me.  Severe lag each and every time.  :(
---
It is very very likely the drops are seeded based on character/account. Here is someone who tested it with 25 characters and nearly 15k scrip testing the pseudorandomness:
---
Sell those while you can. They are a lot more common now
---
China needs some Tegridy
---
This was a very well thought out piece. I hope people read it and take it in for what it is.
---
No we purchased what was supposed to be a fleshed out game. Not a half released game that took a year to fix and a subscription plan that wasn't even discussed until the last month or so.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what i was thinking üò¨
---
I‚Äôll be sure to light a candle for ya
---
Yes it is a great game
---
ever thought maybe they dont want a big fancy mansion camp?
---
Bro. I'm anti-social, and don't have many friends. That's what I was saying
---
Cool
---
I can‚Äôt sign in today, even though last night I played for hours. I‚Äôm a Fallout 1st subscriber and I have no access to the game.
---
Fallout playerbase is full of chuds who dont realize how online game are meant to be and would rather bitch on reddit about it rather than just deal with it
---
You‚Äôre seriously using the word scrub in 2019? Not everyone wants to live in a McMansion
---
Oh are you triggerd? Was someone hurt cause I dared to say Autistic on the internet? Virtue signal all you want if it makes you feel better but that's all that's gonna do dosent help no one, just makes you feel good about yourself. And frankly these people that ruin shit for other people cause things aren't made 110% exactly the way that they want are just pathetic üòÇ so Ya Autistic shit fit is a pretty good term for way they behave
---
Just by looking through the comments the OP is my new favourite person also I‚Äôm glad someone was kind and did that for you I might start doing it if I play tomorrow
---
Maybe you shouldnt have spent the last week trying to put Bethesda out of business. 
---
You know what I would do if a horde of angry people were outside my door screaming at me to go to hell, and making death threats and being violent.    I can tell you, I would not ask them over for a beer.
---
You're an absolute idiot not worth arguing with.
---
When you buy something, you are not renting it. You are supposed to own it forever. Bethesda didn't say anywhere when buying the game that this would give me ownership for one year. If they do that now, it would be absolutely illegal.
---
Sorry about your premium services. If you post about it, Bethesda reps will reply to you. All other issues and concerns are being ghosted.
---
I forgot about that gun! We need this! lol
---
Me having fun nuking your event &gt; you having fun at the event
---
Sorry pal I dont give a shit about other players in the server
---
Try lowering graphic settings. No offense meant. I'm running on low all excpet shadows medium all the time and im ok in any situation.
---
Cant wait!
---
This is the company that you put for faith and money into. I hope you learn something from this experience.
---
Lol @ giving kids Instigating Fat Mans
---
You cant join NW with mods enabled xd
---
Who needs a mansion when I can have 50 razorgrain? Kinda wanting a big stack of doughnuts for my bank account.
---
Did the server crash or just you? I get the odd blue screen but usually when I load back in everyone else was ok and it was just me and I‚Äôm wondering is it something to do with my console?
---
Or a blanket issue for all pc players which isnt true. A lot of complainers dont play and are karma farming, according to others. I couldnt prove that but it is an interesting thought since a lot of the complai ts hold no or little truth.
---
Why do you keep pretending like Bethesda is doing is a huge favor by letting is play their (broken) game? We are doing them a favor by buying it, not the other way round.
---
I've see  shilling but this is straight up dick sucking.
---
Man, I wish!  
---
I believe the usual way to get them to land is to cripple both of their wings.  Ranged weapon perks that have a chance at auto-crippling will help with that, as will increased limb damage lengendaries (somewhat).  Doesn't help with melee builds, though.  Otherwise, it's a matter of guiding them to a spot where they can land.  If you're on broken terrain or in tightly-packed buildings/ruins, they'll happily stair airborne indefinitely.  Leaving cover for flat land or roads seems to encourage them to land more often.  Not real keen on the "fight like an idiot" tactic, though!
---
Come play with us bud- we use discord. I‚Äôll send you a link
---
It‚Äôs the Madden approach to game development. Don‚Äôt add features or improve the game just focus on micro transactions and annual subscriptions.
---
No stop you can‚Äôt have fun like that because it‚Äôs not MY kind of fun.
---
Lol fantastic!
---
Basically. I dont even ask people to play the game with me and they have this constant urge to tell me how bad the game is. 
---
Like they will find any excuse to come see me, just to point out that the game I'm playing is terrible.
---
The issue that the game fucking sucks is also pretty severe. And it wasn't anything severe, they just couldn't access their pay to win stash for a while, and Bethesda replies to *every* one of those posts. This clearly shows where their priorities are.
---
Ah yes, the same picture we used at launch. Too bad the game turned out to be a disaster anyway.
---
When other companies have that they try to satisfy their customers. It‚Äôs called a Tylenol moment where a company realizes temporary losses in the face of trouble can build brand loyalty and confidence and lead to long term growth.
---
Me and my friend would lead people down a creepy path with the stuffed animal bunny and moth man cult skull stuff in the munitions factory we would lead them up to a room where we would both lock the doors with them and us in their and we would both slowly walk up to them and hit them several times until they hit us back they were then hacked to death and some loot not all was stolen
---
Not accurate. I haven't been outspoken about Bethesda's anti-consumer actions.
---
I believe it‚Äôs a Poe.
---
You can still play the core game right?
---
Then go do it and stop complaining that someone has a bigger pocket book.   People have been bitching about haves and have nots since the beginning of time.  
---
You know what has changed.    Nothing.
---
The actual outfit not so much, the plans yes. Hope that helps.
---
Someone update this with Fallout1st  mentions.
---
Yes, they both should count
---
oh\_you.jpg
---
That not what the problem was today....
---
I agree with what you are saying, but that is exactly what i mean with the raw data can be made to say anything. 
---
For a marketing viewpoint they can say X items have sold. From an internal viewpoint they can see this category sells well.  They can use the numbers to justify whatever they want to do, ultimately we do not know the internal numbers. I see posts all the time that the fridge etc etc has sold massively.... we can see them in the game, however only Bethesda knows if the user who purchased it purchased atoms to afford it, or has previously bought atoms, or used "free" atoms. However on the forums, every sale is assumed to have been purchased with cash, and not the free atoms. The only data point we have solid "they paid cash for it" is a Fallout 1st membership... but even then we have no idea how many have purchased it, unlocked the items, then cancelled.
---
It is also important to consider that you have to buy something to evaluate it. Every youtuber who wants to complain about something with anything other than complete speculation is buying the items. How many people complaining on the forums bought something so they could see for themselves? 
---
Any online game is going to have gigantic amounts of data about player data, player habits etc. They will be sending a ton of time, and money sorting thru all that data to maximize sales.
---
The different pack sizes are marketing in themselves. If you have five of something..it is rare and to be used wisely, you have a hundred of something, they start being throw away items.
---
You get the improved repair kits ingame, from the SBQ. So to high levels they get used to just using repair kits...it is kinda annoying when you find out you ran out, or are short of something needed...tempting to send some of those atoms you have to fix the problem. To the lower levels...who actually are short of some hard to find scraps, it can be tempting to grab some kits. All of this information can be gather, sorted and extrapolated into future sales.
---
My main concern with any "utility" items is where it leads to. Any game mechanic change, any alteration is not being done for gameplay or balance, but likely to slowly push the need for those exact "utility" items. They can claim whatever they want to as the reason, and will spend some PR money on pushing that narrative in the press releases. 
---
People will always defend something, no matter how blatant, because they do not see the other side of it. I hate that this game/forum is moving into the haves and have nots. Anyone who doesnt pay the money must be "poor" anyone that does must be a "whale". The fact that some people just object to paying money into a game not living up to what it was sold as, does not seem to enter the conversation to most posters minds.
---
Meh, you can get a plan to make them and once you do you can mass craft them to sell to a vendor. One set isnt worth much.
---
I had an issue with a bandit quest once in GW2 that wasn‚Äôt registering properly but really very few issues exploring the world and going through the main quest. 
---
I‚Äôm still having trouble hourly with FO76 with endless fire, bugged affixes, terminal lag, and dailies that don‚Äôt register. 
---
On the other hand I wasn‚Äôt a fan of GW2‚Äôs alternate modes while I find NW quite well done, if not for all the cheating.
---
Every time you server hop, look around the map to see if any of the people have the same name as the last server you were on. I've had issues where it just kept putting me back in the same server.  
---
Also, you know where he spawns right? Sometimes you have to get really close for him to pop up.
---
Yes. I maxed my budget putting comic books in a display yesterday.
---
I‚Äôm 90sMemelord
---
\*Applauses\*
---
The sad thing is that they removed functionality from Fallout 4, where you could do precisely that. Seems dumb. Hope they eventually fix it.
---
I don't want anything for free.
---
I want support on the game I paid full price for at launch. A game that could have been purchased new for less than 20% of it's launch price within 3 weeks of day 1. I want support for a game that I stood by and defended no matter how poorly it performed. I want support for a game that we were promised would not be pay to win, only micro transactions for cosmetics. I want content updates to not be pushed back over and over again and playability issues to go unpatched so they can develope a premium membership priced far beyond its worth.
---
Yes, Beth is a for profit company and yes they have expenses to continue to provide the service of maintaining their servers. But I don't think people expect a handout. I do think that people who have purchased a product should receive support by its producers. Especially when the product they launched was of a quality somewhere between alpha and beta and hardly a finished game.
---
The issue ultimately boils down to, for me at least, the constant lies. They lied through their teeth about stash limits and too much scrap crashing their servers. They completely lied about not selling premium content. 
---
The fact that they prioritise premium accounts over the poor wretches who, mind you, purchased their product, isn't a surprise at all. It's just yet another hot load in the face of their unsuspecting customers. I pay for my entertainment, I purchase in game currency from time to time in games. But I cannot stomach Bethesda's FO76. I'll be switching to Outter Worlds when I'm tired of farming Borderlands 3.
---
Ok, thats all the ranting I can type in a single poop
---
GG Beth, how long do you plan to host servers? Maybe I'll be back when new content drops if you dane to provide free DLC and/or finish making the game you sold me.
---
Kinda surprised actually. With all the posts and comments where people seriously accuse fellow players of being actual paid shills with no evidence, I assumed this parody post would be fine!
---
Its not hard to get Bethesda to take hackers serious, for about 10k atoms per player per match.
---
Bummer thanks for the answer
---
Do you find that other survivors seem to have put one too many points into their Science skill and now have an enhanced advantage in your rounds of simulated combat?  Well now you can take B.A.C.K. your mountainous, moonshine-soaked shithole with Fallout 1st's Bethesda Anti-Cheat Key! For a moderate fee of only $12.99 a month, you can sometimes enjoy a more even playing field!  Remember,  with Fallout 1st, we've always* got your B.A.C.K!

oh, i thought that was the joke
---
On the xbox here. I did the event last night and it went smoothly. In fact. I had 5 legendaries to kill as I waited for the event to go. It was laggy but doable
---
No, the vocal minority ruined it for the non subscribing base. 
---
Maybe you should direct your hate towards them.
---
It's a temporary event, like Meat Weak. The event is every hour on the hour. Wear a costume. Tear shit up. Rewards include unique outfits and plans.
---
Pandering? I approve!
---
I'm on a pretty hefty PC (9900k, 32gb of ram, and a 1080ti with 11gb of vram) and I crash in the middle of nowhere, with no cars or explosions, on a private server with no other players around. The game itself is broken, it has nothing to do with platform.
---
Edit: I usually crash once every two straight hours.
---
You have to buy the subscription again I guess
---
‚ÄúSomeone paid for it? I wanna hear their reasoning. Should make for good conversat-.... oh, they‚Äôre being sarcastic‚Äù
---
-Me, upon reading your post
---
It wasn't anything game breaking, was it? Compare that to how long it took them to fix the absolutely game breaking PS exit freeze. And the thousands of other bugs that are still present from the beta.
---
Lol bro
---
Have fun with the 20 hours in total of content that Outer Worlds has. 
---
The game is great, but you will be back in a week once you played it out.  Its very short.
---
Some people loved the pinto. Stop complaining about the exploding gas tank and let me enjoy my sweet ride.
---
The waterfall and outside the door?  What's the best approach, I'm reaching my boredom limit.  Thanks.
---
Yes it was. They weren‚Äôt able to even log in. 
---
Do you even play the game?
---
Guild Wars 2 actually does bundle items and sell them at discounts which is awesome. Sometimes they are meh, others times it is like oh shit I gotta get that asap cause of the items like the infinite use mining/axe/harvesting sickle and such.
---
I like kindness.
---
No it was free we all have it &amp; I still have it so not sure why that person said it was ‚Äúremoved‚Äù
---
I just did it today on the first try. Now Top of the World has been completely dead
---
The problem is, creatures in an area don't respawn unless the area has been fully cleared. People doing the challenge head straight for the wendigo, and don't fully clear the cave. So the wendigo won't respawn.
---
It‚Äôs not his fault you‚Äôre stupid enough to give Bethesda money lol
---
What happened, was everybody unsubscribed.
---
Spend 1 or 2 caps and be at the station. Just three clicks.
---
Bethesda happened
---
Are you going to ask more idiotic questions? I'll answer them together then.
---
They couldn't log in *on the website*. In the game it just said "Fallout 1st required to use the Scrap Box" when they tried using it. Done shilling?
---
Thats ok. 20 hours of content is more than I got out of past year of FO76. The shitstorm of java script that is minecraft is of better quality than FO.
---
I couldn't help it :( everyone but me was invited,  and my party left me half way thru the dungeon crawl.  
---
It was too tempting not to do.
---
No, it‚Äôs not his fault, nor his business what I do with my money. It‚Äôs neither his business to berate people when there‚Äôs a legitimate issue instead of trying to help them. Grow the fuck up lol.
---
How about the Rocking Chair? It doesn't rock so it is a complete lie. Literally unplayable.
---
Again, that wasn‚Äôt the problem. 
---
Now are you going to deflect again? Do you play the game? From your post history it seems like you just like to troll.
---
I loved the dart gun. It turned deathclaws to swiss cheese
---
I'd say a skin that does literally nothing but change color shouldn't be as expensive as some other games *season passes*.
---
Heck I'd argue it should already be part of the base game or alot cheaper because this is SNES level palette swapping.
---
asshorrre!
---
I remember you. I fought you back at the junkyard and followed you home.
---
Bethesda: now dont you wish you purchased a \*private\* server?!?!
---
Damn you must have the "my npcs are deaf, dumb and blind" mod for all your other fallout games, or your immersion might break.
---
Why do you care if he's pro trump?
---
Before the Survival beta came out, I went hunting with my bloodied, fully modded Gamma Gun. I crept up to a low level dude in Power Armor inside the Morgantown Airport building, in the area near the NPC's corpse. They had no idea I was there and I must have scared the crap out of him when I fired at him because he panic fired and promptly died.
---
Also, the day Private Servers came out, I joined a friend's server and contested his workshop (and took it). I now know this is bad etiquette but it was fun while it lasted.
---
And lastly, I fast traveled to a friend's camp, did the follow me emote, fast traveled to West Tek, went to a 3* legendary enemy, and promptly killed it before he could get off a shot.
---
Really, moron? How many of my posts did you read? There are dozens of photos of my character, and hundreds of questions and discussions and suggestions and you get *you just like to troll*? Did *you* ever go to school?
---
Please, explain what's been ruined by the vocal minority.
---
 My hate is directed at much worse real world issues, don't have enough energy to divert my hate towards Bethesda.
---
Either on or right under the column next to the waterfall. If you're sneaking I think he's clinging to it, or the ceiling. I'm pretty sure the fastest route is to follow the passage to the right, just keep going to the right and forward.  
---
If things are alive in the cave, the wendigo should be there.
---
I still can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm seeing my favorite franchise/IP being run into the ground. Bugs and bugs galore but hey, pay up for some more bugs and you‚Äôll get a skin.
---
Pathetic
---
keep that plastic coming!
---
No sarcasm intended. I am very relieved that my first two hours in Fallout First only had that one server crash, which had absolutely no bad outcome. Cannot say Adventure mod is as stable as what happened to me today. Even placed my Free Fast Travel Survival Tent way East in West Virginia. Everything seems to work exactly as advertised, maybe better.
---
Alright we‚Äôre done here. Go yell at a wall somewhere.
---
It was the server. Because someone else I was playing with/talking to also got the boot. And we weren‚Äôt in a team or anything. Ever since Bethesda‚Äôs last update/maintenance, it has been worse for me. Never this bad before. I don‚Äôt get it.
---
Not so long ago, bases were openly destructible. Someone could just walk on up and start going HAM on your hard earned CAMP items. Destroying things like rad showers, fusion generators, you get the idea. It used to give you a bounty too; which in turn, would attract even more attention to the scene!  It was a great mechanic and I loved it, even though my base fell victim a few times I never complained. Well, before they took it all away, I belonged to one of the most hated groups on PC. You might remember a player by the name of TacoCatRaceCar. He was our bounty bait. He was the best at getting folks riled up too! So imagine you're having a nice peaceful time trading at your beautiful CAMP, and all of a sudden a group of players with the best insults were tearing your base down to the very foundation. You could try and fight back but 99% of the time you'd be met with a quick death and left with 2 options. Immediately stop what you're doing and log off , or sit and watch as your Home gets wiped from the map! I truly miss the days of base destruction and it is an absolute shame that it was taken away. I miss having that 1k cap bounty. My name is RockMorty, and if you were ever a victim, YOU'RE WELCOME!!
---
thats when the timeline scewed off in a tangent.
---
You need to read my post...
---
totally fine on private servers when your alone tho ;-)
---
I've over 1500 so I definitely don't need anymore lol
---
Duuuuude. I've been buying somethings out of lower level venders and then just giving it back to them. I cant actualy give some one caps so I curved the system. I'm usually at max so it's fine by me. But I love this gory gift bag !
---
Im pretty sure they said a while back that they were working on a Christmas event, but beyond that probably not a whole lot. Tomorrow‚Äôs Inside the Vault will hopefully shed some light on what‚Äôs coming. Maybe they‚Äôll finally release Vault 96 or something.
---
Public Events like Mischief Night at Whitespring, Project Paradise at Arktos Pharma do already have free fast travel though, that change was made a couple of patches ago. Way before Fallout 1st was launched. Nothing has changed this. Other events like Monster Mash (in Watoga) will still cost you caps when you fast travel. 
---
I don't agree with Fallout 1st either (in particular the unlimited scrap box for subscribers only) but please check the facts first. But don't give up hope just yet. When they see how unpopular they've become because of F1st, they may give way on some of these issues.
---
Haven't tried it recently, but you used to be able to force a wendigo respawn in the room with the waterfall by tossing a grenade. No idea why it worked that way, but it did. Might be worth a try.
---
The YouTuber's are going to cream their pants over this.
---
paying money for server stability?
---
So they still haven't released us skins for the marine or wood armor, probably because of the issue with helmets (we had datamined skins months ago but they included the helmets, neither of which are obtainable in game). Wonder if those helmets will become exclusive to fallout 1st, or if we will FINALLY get them, or if those skins will stay unreleased like the rest, or if it'll just be released without the helmet. 4th option seems possible, they already had misleading pictures for many past atom shop items. 3rd might be interesting, makes me wonder if somebody at the department has just been trying to constantly slide it under the rug and the artists aren't even aware that those helmets are not available in-game
---
Oof I can admit to being a culprate. I'll clear it out next time. Thanks for the tip.
---
I no longer have it.  And it no longer appears in the atom shop as "owned", as it did before.
---
As someone who quit i can tell you. Is it worth getting into? In the short term, YES. In the long term, NO. Leveling up was very fun, but once i hit max level and did most quests, all my endgame consisted in repeating the same boss over and over and over again. I never in my entire life encountered a game with only 1 endgame boss and nothing much else to do. And it's not even that fun since it's a very bullet spongy flying bat that requires you reparing your weapon to 200% durability then wasting 1500 bullets and break full weapon durability with more then 10 people around you, so you can loot a random 1-3 star legendary crappy piece of armor. You will defenetly have some fun but don't expect it to be a game you can play forever. Or hope they will ever improve it.
---
Non subscribers with bad reddit posts:  
---
Your really spending $0 a year but have scrub reddit posts?
---
considering how much other forms of entertainment costs a month of fun is worth 80 to me, but i personally have had 6 months of fun playing with friends
---
hahahhahaha your own fault for keep believing Fuckthesda
---
Thanks for the clarification, and again for being some of the best mods on Reddit!
---
There‚Äôs too much shit in the build mode UI as it is. I have to scroll through half of atom shop locked items to build my shit.
---
It sounds like they are trying to make it right. What exactly do you suggest they do?
---
I honestly think that's insulting to actual autistics. *they* can't help it. *they* can benefit from guidance and education.
---
I wonder what if we got the exact amount of scraps we had with screenshots and stuff? I had 8.2k steel and 1.1k lead. 600 acid 154 ballistic fiber. 2.2k springs, 168 screws among most things.
---
That's not how the VTU challenges worked.  With VTU the challenges were cumulative because they were all active from the start but you could only see one of them "active" at a time.  When you finished the first challenge to get 250exp the next challenge would pop up at 250/750 and so on instead of 0/750.
---
I can't check this until tomorrow though which is why I asked for anyone that didn't do the first challenge yesterday and would have two challenges today.  If someone does the first challenge right now and the next one pops up with experience already toward it then it's best to wait.
---
That would mean they work like the VTU challenges did and if you wait for all of the challenges to unlock then you'll only need a fraction of the total exp rather than having each challenge start from zero every day.
---
How do you fork the lawn? I haven't worked that one out yet.
---
Why? The loot gets better. I did it with and without the nuke. Nuked is better. At least in my experience.
---
Test servers would be a splendid start. Realizing they have horrible SDLC issues and making some serious management changes would also serve them well moving forward.
---
Instead, it's just predictable fuck-up after predictable fuck-up. Like I said, sad.
---
It's funny cause 9 hours later and that's almost exactly how this thread has gone, and you still got downvoted as well...
---
Don't you love how carebears are the majority of the reddit and fallout population?  lmao
---
I thought they were unable to replace missing items. Now they can? Weird, almost as if they are being deceptive.
---
They already have your money, why should they care about you, a new money stream on the other hand... 
---
I mean that btw, I've seen posts from "first members" who canceled (only getting the first month) and Bethesda straight up deleted their posts off their forums, or marked their issues as resolved (you know they weren't). The second you're done giving them money, is the second they stop giving a damn.
---
Well public test servers are coming early next year. But I don‚Äôt see how that would help you now. You are complaining about how they handled your ticket
---
Ok cya
---
this whole exchange, you have +5 and he has -5 on all comments. When you see a long string of even numbers like that, someone is using multiple accounts to boost their score.
---
Are you using multiple accounts?
---
Hell yes, deathclaws were much more of a threat, and 1 dart from a toy car and you could walk laps around them.
---
You will see box sitting on the ground in the courtyard, walk up to them and they will give you a prompt to fork the lawn. Theres a semi circle at the front side upon entering the courtyard, where you spawn in if you ft on the resort, and a half circle of them on the other end.
---
you can play an instrument
---
I agree that the loot is better. Nuking the Whitespring BEFORE the event is cool and encouraged.
---
When it‚Äôs done literally in the middle of the event and timed purposely so it coincides with the end of the event, then that‚Äôs a total dick move. And that‚Äôs what happened.
---
Nuke before, cool. Nuke during, not cool.
---
No. Also scroll up.
---
Its not The Sims: Post Apocalypse *yet* come on now
---
An endless grind with no point to the grind. It was fun while I played it, got bored quick
---
FFR is more damage than Explosive, all other attributes the same, FFR will put out more pain.
---
Tried, nope, but appreciate the advice.
---
That happened to me at the purveyor a few weeks ago or so. Went for a 2* melee, got a bloodied SS DCG. Insane
---
Completely missed the point.
---
I'm not complaining about anything, I'm posting this as an update on the missing scrap situation. If I have any complaint, it's that the scrap box bug happened at all. Sorry if that rubs you the wrong way.
---
The real question. I want to know also.
---
Your commentary sure sounds like complaining
---
You should get out more. I‚Äôm sorry your all twisted out of shape over this game.
---
Do you know anything about Fallout 2?
---
50 cal heavy weapon? I would probably say ffr. 
---
If youre talking a 50cal hunting rifle though I would go explosive.
---
The 50 cal RTS BFG FFR rocks......üé∏
---
Whatever takes the least amount of work to design (modern art statue, anyone?), or items which can be recycled with slight modifications (raider mask, followed by the _armored_ raider mask, for example).
---
YES 1000% I have no earthly idea why this hasn‚Äôt been a thing since launch.
---
Nope again! Took my frustration out on the column. Had enough plus ive gotta get to the halloween event !
---
Shhhhhhh dont give them more great ideas to stick behind the pay wall
---
My expectations for Bethesda are not inappropriate given their track record.
---
I let the timer run completely down while three or five ran right by me.  Second time in two days I was in crowd and no revive.  I always try to get to people when I can.
---
&gt; I am very relieved that my first two hours in Fallout First only had that one server crash
---
It's a fucken sad state when you start thinking like that.
---
The community comes through again. Wish Bethesda would say something.
---
Troll much?
---
Ok. Still seems like whining. It‚Äôs a video game.
---
You do realize we all know how the game works, right? You can leave the nuke zone then waltz right into the event area. Or you can die, then respawn. And because it's a global event, you run zero risk of losing anything. 
---
I think you have me twisted with someone who does this. I dont. But I also dont think its a big deal if someone does it to me. So yes, it's just a minor inconvenience unless you're delicate.
---
You put in several hundred hours and didn't enjoy them?
---
I was actually going to mention Guild Wars 2 but decided against the anecdote. When Angry Joe reviewed it, he lamented that there wasn't enough good stuff in the store but he wanted to buy more stuff. That was the moment I accepted it was OK to buy in game stuff, there was a sort a taboo about it at the time.
---
I want to buy stuff in the atom shop, but it's too expensive. So I get stingy.
---
I mean, you're here whining about my post, so...
---
FFR because of the better damage per second and you can still kill enemies that are in your face without damaging yourself üëç
---
idk i dont agree. i like the world to evolve. we just got out the vault, and as we build and things change in the map and the "factions" evolve there will need to be additions. i much prefer that to stagnating.
---
I player porn into the microphone. I made a lot of people server hop lol. Especially idle players
---
I honestly doubt you even subscribed
---
Actually since yesterday you can. I'm not sure if there is any filter about which mods are accepted since I just use perk load out, but I didnt had to disable it to join NW yesterday.
---
This also.
---
Have him send you Bitcoin. There is no reversing Bitcoin transactions.
---
Wow the Beth fanboys really got upset by this post...
---
Lol. Ok. All I asked is how they could have handled your ticket better.
---
10th crash
---
I started a new character and when I started doing the first responders mission someone teleported to my location without me noticing and left a power armour chasis right in front of the building I was in. Mighty kind of them. Thanks stranger
---
Apparently that hasn‚Äôt stopped you before.
---
I was under the impression that most of the negativity was people who wanted to enjoy the game, but their server crashed again and every other server had a nuke on Whitespring or an unlootable ghoul officer beeping next to their camp.
---
It doesn't save
---
Thanks. Good read.
---
Damn, I was really hoping for them to come to Steam this year and have crossplay. 
---
I play on Xbox and really wanted to buy it on Steam. Oh well, guess I can wait some more.
---
The damage control is real.
---
Yeah..I still expect them to put out good single player rpgs and I have a feeling they will
---
i think the wait, personally, will be good for players and company.  Lets the year of go go go, calm and simmer down. Not everygame needs content every waking week or moment
---
You can sit and play an instrument, if one is present? But agreed, let us do more things while we sit.
---
Must suck hard for people who lost a bunch of vault steel and flux, because you know they're not going to replace that.
---
Can sit and voice chat with new and old friends.
---
Oh this brings back some custom server UO feelz. Would love it so hard!
---
Wait you‚Äôve played 76 less than 20 hours? Lol
---
Lol context bud, at no point did I say anything about people with Autism. I just described the behavior of people who can help it, and are choosing to behave that way. Welcome to the internet where people will say things that will offend you üòÇ also "honestly think" what were you  dishonestly thinking before?
---
That would be amazing.
---
I would definitely like to know if anyone confirms this with you, so keep me posted
---
I did hesitate for a full week, but I am pleased with my first two hours. Hope it continues forward the way it played today.
---
Lol, the 100s of thousands of 5.56 ive crafted and sold would say otherwise. I just ment in terms of story/quest content.
---
No because it's just a private session, not a private server.
---
When I found a fresh server and went through and cleared the cave I couldn't find the Wendigo, so I tossed a nuke grenade in it's room and killed it, was stuck in the ground.
---
Got the Assault Rifle and 10mm skin. Don't know if they Fubar it but I found the 10mm challenge under character challenge
---
Cool!
---
&gt; Yes it's a PTW aspect but most games that are multiplayer are PTW
---
So we have passed from denial to acceptance, huh?
---
I don't know if that's possible. I was out of ammo constantly in everything except the weak guns. Near the end of me playing I was doing better with a melee build but fusion cores became a burden of a loop. I had to go to areas where they were (around some mine if I recall? Kinda southwest but not a lot? Anyways, I had to do that since it was a tedious pipe repair thing which then caused a ghoul army IIRC? Or the scorchbeast? I feel like I'm mixing memories at this point but I did not do a build favorable to me. Everything became a tedious grind or challenge early on. This is probably since you're supposed to be in a group and I was not. Others seemed to not have difficulty so it's also possibly due to how easy the other games were that I overestimated my actual Fallout skill. 
---
Regardless, I'll never forget the rebuilding of that fusion core generator thing and somehow it being destroyed by a Scorchbeast like 4 minutes after. 
---
I don't recall specifics, just bits of memories and an overall thing. Building the turrets and using them to fight ghouls, but I'm unsure if this was the same one. I remember running behind a train station with an awning while fighting it, but no idea if it's the same SB. Fuzzy memories. The feeling of achievement from using everything my low-ish level self had and a long obnoxious hide and shoot was great. Repairing it and finally getting my rightfully earned Fusion Cores felt awesome. Another one appearing shortly after and everything going to hell overshadowed that feeling. Ugh. That feeling I remember. Disappointment and defeat and just, bummed.
---
I just wish there was another term for PTW. Having played Final Fantasy XV ANE, and Star Wars GOH, I have a hard time when anyone calls Fallout PTW
---
Probably because they want to charge another $20/month for it.
---
I hope you're right, I really do. The trend says otherwise though. It's been a downhill slide since Fallout 4.
---
It works, it just works!
---
DLC content? What do you think stand the C in DLC for? 
---
Other than that I agree with your post.
---
Found it
---
Yep, done this event 9 times now, 3 of which resulted in crashes.  33% CTD on an event that shouldn't last more than 15 minutes, a year into launch.  Great job, Bethesda, I'm burning some of my hard-earned money in your honor.
---
If it's anything like ESO Plus, there might be one or two things that are discounted each month.
---
1st shares a lot in common with ESO Plus so I could see that happening eventually. I just don't know if it'll happen in the first month.
---
So first you defend Bethesda, and then you use the last half of your post contradicting the first half?
---
Ok so let's just pay another 60$ for wastelanders if you wanna go down that road.
---
I saw this chick player (female avatar)  in her camp and she saw me. I looked at her store, and then I went into the porta potty in her camp. Took off all my clothes, and waited. Sure enough, she opened the door, saw me "naked" and I died laughing. I only wish I could have seen her face irl. She gave the the confused emote and then I ran off into the wasteland.
---
Explosive has higher DPS if you have demo expert 5. You can check for yourself- [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Ok thank you.
---
Ok? Nice flex. I was just going off what you said.
---
You're missing the point.  Bethesda has lied since day one.  They stated in the past all updates and dlc post launch would be free.  Also people paid $60 if not more for this game and now you add a subscription service?  Bullshit.  And private servers don't necessarily need to be hosted by bethesda,  make it peer-peer, but they won't do that because bethesda is tarded and likes to ruin their own rep.  This whole game and company is complete BS.  Don't support them
---
If you talked like that to people IRL, you would get punched in the face, beaten to a pulp and left in a dumpster for dead.
---
Btw if you hate it so much, why have you invested so much time in it?
---
Ciao
---
Guess anyone who can't speak is screwed then.
---
I'm sorry you wasted your money
---
NO he's not.
---
Miller just has more friends than you who understand things.
---
Except those are, in fact not servers. They‚Äôre private matches. Think MW2 matches. Host leaves, you‚Äôre back at the lobby. Same goes here. Those are very cheaply maintained.
---
I think an age gap is showing here between a generation that grew up with PS2 vs one that grew up with PS4.
---
If Todd says it's fixed, then it's fixed kapeesh.
---
Fucking, preach.
---
You mean does it sound fixed. No, no it doesn't.  However,  I actually haven't experienced this bug in a long time
---
Now that I think about it why the hell is it DownLoadable Content when downloadable is one word. 
---
That's it, right? Wait..
---
I wish more people understood this. 
---
This is how business works, stop paying = no service. 
---
Dont pay your phone bill for a month, watch what happens.
---
I used to run a drunk Vanguard Powered Cavalier Melee build, with a instigating deathclaw gauntlet, or with the unstoppable monster. Its less damage at full health, but you still one shot everything, except for a few selected things
---
you still have it, and can still play the content you paid for.
---
I get it for accessibility. That‚Äôs a decent argument actually. Most people posting about it though that‚Äôs not he case.
---
It's almost like... I'm stating things and then giving my opinion??
---
It's completely RNG, one moment you get something different the other time you get about a thousand of the same thing(metaphor).
---
I'm trying to get the rest of the pumpkins(I have about 5 more left to unlock) and the rest of the stands(3 out of 5 I think) as well as the pumpkin suit(got the pirate one) and fireman one.
---
Not all PC users. it's running just fine for me
---
That's becau... wait a minute ü§î
---
ü•Å‚ò†üëÄ
---
Do they get close to the damage you can do with other weapons? my other weapons are doing 600 to 1000 dps whereas the science weapons seem to be maxing out around 200.
---
Might be due to the sheer volume of the event with explosives and such.
---
The fix seems to have fixed it everywhere else. I can see how the event can break something like that though.
---
you can abandon a quest that is not progressing.  That said, I've completed dozens of biv quests with no problems.
---
Good one my dude
---
Never said I hate it. I hate that bethesda is flipping the freemium script on its customers. I have other issues with the game, but stood by through all of them.
---
For some reason the only way I can get the Wendigo to spawn in the cave is to throw a grenade at that one pillar where it normally drops from. I just throw it at the ground near there and then poof, he shows up. Maybe it'll work for you?
---
PREACH BROTHER!!!
---
&gt; What am I incorrect about? 
---
Well, for starters I don't even play the game. That's just something you've been assuming. I got my refund from Bethesda a year ago and haven't even touched the game since.
---
You went on and on making assumptions about me personally, saying shit like:
---
\&gt;You are okay with making a game unplayable for others.
---
...because you had decided for yourself that I wanted some kind of "revenge" for being "bullied" in WoW a decade and a half ago. As if I had never played an online game before that and was somehow traumatized from it.
---
I told you repeatedly that I was never bullied, but you just went on and on. I even said: if I knew this discussion was going to be about *me* instead of the topic of the thread, then I would never had said anything.
---
I made it very clear that I only used WoW as an example of another game in which you could get attacked for *no justified reason*, and how frustrating it could be. But getting attacked was part of the game, and I told you multiple times that I did not see any difference between getting attacked in WoW for &lt;insert whatever reason the attacker had&gt; - OR getting attacked in Fallout 76 for being a Fallout 1st subscriber. I said the *reason* for attacking someone in a game based on PvP is unimportant to me. I don't care about the *reason why* somebody wants to attack another player. It makes no difference to me. Get it?
---
So If OP wants to find and kill Fallout 1st subscribers because he finds it entertaining, then that's fine. He is allowed to. Just as a group of level 60s in WoW are allowed to find, chase and repeatedly kill players who are 30 levels lower than them. It's allowed in the game. It may be annoying AS FUCK to the other player, but it is ultimately allowed. Get it? Am I making myself clear?
---
So my point the whole time was that IF someone has a problem with this - you for example - then it is ultimately up to the developers to prevent it from happening in their game. That's it. That's all I wanted to say.
---
You can go back to my very first coment in the thread and re-read it. I said:  
---
&gt;No, that's Bethesda for allowing for it.
---
...in response to your:  
---
&gt;People like you are what turn online games into trash. 
---
Did I make myself perfectly clear this time, or is there still anything I said that you will misunderstand or misinterpret? Also, did you look up ad hominem on Wikipedia?
---
You said it‚Äôs lower quality than a shitstorm
---
I enjoyed fallout4. Not as much as fallout 3 but it was a lot of fun.  I'm really excited for starfield and es6. If they fuck with either of those that's the last straw for me.
---
I think it would be fair to politely request that she use an ordinary lower level rifle when playing together... and I say this as a fellow female sniper build who loves the simple joy of the one-shot ;) But I also strongly agree that shared xp would make a big difference. Plenty of the people I've tried to game with would also one-shot everything immediately &amp; it's not always possible to talk a total stranger into using a weak weapon for purposes of sharing xp. ;(
---
You don't have to buy it. And games go down on sale all the time, That's a year ago's price. You can get it for much cheaper now. The game is not BS. It has its flaws that are being worked on. I love this game. The community is amazing, I love this game. Everyone is helping each other. If people actually took a step back and realised how far it's come from a game that was broken to a game that... Works 95% of the time.
---
I don‚Äôt know nobody that has it , do you?
---
What weapon are you using to get the critical? I use a rifle and use vats to get a critical shot. Works everytime on a full critical meter. Hope this helps.
---
Survival servers got nixed at the start of the month yeah? Then after a couple weeks of survival players being forced back into adventure, out comes FO1st offering private sessions.
---
So yeah, they cut out survival so they could use those servers for private sessions to be sold to the players that don't like getting their workshops taken from the PvPers.
---
It's as fixed as the power armor bugs ...
---
ESO was full price too, right?
---
I mean no not really, Bethesda left in the ability to do so. So why not. Thye could have disabled the nuke area for the duration of the event.
---
A fun disaster. Just like the looming real apocalypse!
---
I get excited seeing lead and adhesive.
---
I'm not denying people are having fun, thats great.  I'm just saying bethesda is a terrible company at this point.  Play the game, have fun, just don't give them anymore money ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Outer worlds is great.  Its just really really short. 
---
Outer Worlds players will be back in a week or shorter.
---
People are already posting 4 hour finishes.  One guy did it in less than an hour. 
---
If you do all the content in the whole game you have about 20-22 hours of content.
---
The action hero, that might be part of the issue
---
It's fixed if you turn the speakers off.
---
Whatever that girl with the research on it in the top part of the house. I think you find out about her at abby's if I remember correctly. Been awhile, you're probably right.
---
Well...actually its not more dmg, it's more dps while unloading ammo faster out the gun.
---
Explosive actually adds 10% dmg however the dps is a lil lower then ffr due to being 25% slower in fire speed.
---
It's this misconception which gets people haha
---
Even if that's why most people are buying fallout 1st, that sounds like a huge waste of money still.
---
You can get any resource that any of the workshops give you somewhere else on the map.
---
Odd, I too have been in it since the start, heck even the beta, hell I too can go back all the way to FO1, and I'm still loving it. And now with my own private world I'm having even more fun! I mean sorry you're disappointed, but personally I'm having a blast!
---
And I think in some ways Bethesda are an okay company all the base game content past and future will be free.
---
That's how a monthly paid service works. You would have a point, IF the monthly service is what they sold to us in the beginning, and you know it wasn't. 
---
This is like if they sold us Skyrim with no mod support. Buggy as all hell, and if we want patches that deliver fix on issues/content promised from the start (or mods) we had to pay an additional monthly fee they never told us about. People need to stop defending Bethesda on this one, they are dead wrong and you're just enabling their bad behavior.
---
Put in several hundred hours in a game you hated? Also several hundred hours is not "hardcore numbers" whatever that is?
---
Yup I see what they meant about trolls on this sub, either that or you like torturing yourself playing games you hate for several hundred hours cause you hate yourself or something. Either way no need to announce your likely fictional departure, it's not significant in any way.
---
Its a lower quality (relatively speaking) than minecraft. At least they allowed a mod community to exist that did wonders for it. That also doesn't mean that I hate it. I've stood by worse games and enjoyed watching them improve with time and development. Saying sonething is bad doesn't mean I hate it. Myndog can be a bad boy sometimes. Poking at the trash when he knows well better. Still live the little fuzz monster to death.
---
Well you can if you have friends to invite.  I tried it by myself and failed that is too hard for me to do solo.
---
What part of "Bethesda's greed drove me away.", is too complex for you to comprehend?
---
I was on a server today where this happened.   
---
I'm playing an alt low level character who only had a damaged hazmat suit. Died in the initial blast, then died several times just trying to put it on &amp; then proceeded to die a bajillion more times while attempting to fight anything cuz nearly everyone else left.   
---
But for whatever reason, I still thought it was funny.
---
Someone posted all the items with the xp.  I cant provide that link since i am on my phone.
---
I like this game, I am over level 200 but honestly, I haven't logged in in 3-4 months now. I will try again with wastelanders. Just the money grabs and bugs and griefers and cheaters and hackers, blah blah.
---
Sounds like your just complaining to complain. It is obvious they didnt mean you will receive a discount everything
---
It was. At launch. A long time ago..
---
I was having issues with my game also. Everytime I went to server hop it hung on "finding a world" and never found a world. I'd have to close FO76 and reopen to get another server. Uninstalled and reinstalled and fixed no problems. Just be aware on console if you delete and reinstall you will lose all your photos.
---
Okay, there are a substantial amount of things here that from a logical point, ignoring all the Fallout things, are flawed. 
---
Firstly, the post is clearly defending Bethesda. You list defenses and supporting arguments for a Bethesda product. You can't just say you aren't defending it then defend it then not call it a defense. 
---
Secondly, 'most games are pay to win' is lacking any sort of supporting evidence or specification on where the line is drawn for most games. Throughout all-time? No. Even modern games have mostly cosmetic rewards, even if they're free to play games like Rocket League. Regardless, none of that matters since the very notion that something is acceptable due to being commonplace is inherently flawed. I don't think I need to point out any examples of that. 
---
You go on to say that it doesn't affect anyone who doesn't buy it before discussing the pay to win aspects of it in the next paragraph. This negates the entire second point basically. 
---
The first point is true, servers do cost money to run. However, Bethesda had plenty more servers at launch to handle the amount of people playing at launch. It's likely Bethesda still has these servers and due to decreased player count, they're sitting dormant. That is however due to the game quality that drove players away. So quite frankly, it's on them. 
---
They made money from sales. It seems people forgot this game was not free.
---
Have you ever heard of a game charging for their server? Imagine if Halo made you subscribe to play multiplayer after you buy the game to 'cover server costs.' Maybe we should fund the employee salaries too since we're the ones enjoying their work.
---
I think I do have it, I have seen it too, it's just RNG plain simple.
---
Remember, you have a 1/20 chance to roll on that plan, could even take 1/40 if you're super unlucky.
---
Hard to find IMHO.  
---
L148, have only seen the wetsuit plan once.
---
Downloadable ^Loser Content
---
I did have some problems with biv a long time ago, same sort of thing. Hit space during vats, if that doesn't work and it says you scored a critical in the corner, it maybe bugged.
---
The explosive effects are also privy to their own DR computation.  Its not a straight +20%dmg, its a second hit at 20% base damage (this explosive effect is not affected by bloodied, mutants, ect).
---
but you are right, i should have said DPS.
---
I was thinking the same thing. Got booted immediately.
---
That's it exactly. I've been a diehard Bethesda fan since childhood. Now, seeing what they've sunk to, it hurts.
---
I pre-ordered 76, knowing it would be rocky, but seeing so much potential. And they've done a lot to fix things and improve on others, but the things they've done outside of the game, and then this lackluster subscription full of things that they promised would be free, just doesn't feel right.
---
I do love the community that's come from it though, and regardless of how I currently feel about Bethesda, I can't fault people for enjoying the game as much as I wish I could.
---
Sorry to ramble, just venting that frustration like you said.
---
Yes a bag mixed with raisens, nails and toffee, some with ketchup inside, some with mustard!
---
They didn't say they hated it? They said they defended it and greed drove them away.
---
It was sold out at Best Buy. I‚Äôm going to get it though. Already starting Borderlands 3.
---
So if you put everything in you're screwed?
---
You literally do not have to buy it.
---
Why don't you go play some other games... Like black ops 4, red dead redemption 2, grand theft auto 5 and then have the audacity to call fallout pay to win. It is NOTHING compared to other games. And you can still play the game for FREE with friends. You want the game to be F2P? Good luck with that
---
They fix that exact bug every patch lol
---
Explosive is higher dps with demo5 in case you didn't know.
---
Even when someone visit is and compliments the camp or buys something they get one it‚Äôs like a complimentary gift
---
I'm pretty sure it would work but you'd have to have your critical meter filled and in vats. The only problem with heavy weapons is that it uses up AP quickly. Even a regular rifle or pistol would work. Just go vats kill something low level in the forest.
---
Theres this place in the Mire, something medical supplies which has a fuckton of bones of all kinds, try there.
---
It's south of thunder mountain if I remember correctly.
---
Yeah like I want to hear. 9 year olds squeaky voice cursing lol .I‚Äôm not sure why I get downvoted for saying I don‚Äôt prefer something
---
I'm happy I'm not the only one who noticed that
---
Someone is having a shitty life
---
Yup. There is many items there that i want. But in the end its only virtual items. So for the most i use atoms earned ingame and only f there is good discounts. Bought atoms only once. Again only used on discounted items. 
---
Battlepasses in Fortnite and pubg give the players a lot of items and outfits during the time each battlepass. Drawback is that you dont get to choose what you get.
---
GTA 5 had a huge single player campaign? 
---
Did you play games before those games? You know game companies didn't go bankrupt before DLC was a thing? 
---
You can play the game for free? You mean after you and your friend buy it? The hell? The game can't be F2P because **it costs money**
---
&gt; The second you're done giving them money, is the second they stop giving a damn.
---
That directly contradicts 100% of their replies being to 1st members having trouble. Now I don't know whether OP is correct, I frankly don't care enough to check. I'm not defending BGS or their recent decisions in any way, but you're clearly just being overtly cynical here.
---
I usually leave a Cranberry Cobbler and a Propaganda Flyer behind after making a purchase lol
---
i‚Äôll check it out and update if i find it there, thank you!
---
Thanks for the update. Just earlier today I was wondering if you was going to quit playing or not.
---
Good PSA but honestly... most people can farm more scrap and junk in an hour than one workshop uninterrupted. 
---
Before anyone says fusion cores... farm a nuke zone and you can make your own also... 
---
I‚Äôm far from a great player but even I can do all that pretty easily...
---
Look for those bone nose trap.  You get random pieces from each.  Bound to get all you need like I did.  Hit up known super mutant locations
---
if you want mutations, find a vendor and buy the serum.  its guaranteed to give the mutations. 
---
They are permanent until you get rid of them with rad away or a rad shower.\]
---
Starched Genes 2 (luck perk) prevents Rad Away and the Shower from curing your mutations. 
---
You can have all of them at the same time if you want. 
---
The "best" mutations depend on your build.  Different builds use different mutations.  Though everyone uses  marsupial.
---
Two issues here:
---
1. Bethesda asked us to report bugs and suggest ways to improve the game, yet most of the bugs remain and very few quality-of-life changes were implemented. There is still no chat or perk card loadouts.
---
2. Bethesda said everything after launch would be free. We could look the other way if Bethesda fixed the bugs and added the QOL changes (that most MMOs have), but no.
---
On top of this we have a ridiculously-overpriced Atom Shop and mostly underwhelming new content (the Burrows "dungeon" and the Vault 94 "raid"). The improvements in the game since launch are vastly outweighed by these negative issues, so you can understand how disappointed we are (especially those that paid $60 at launch).
---
Wendigo cave has a lot of bones
---
- Yes you can server hop still, usually rule of thumb is wait 5 seconds after getting into the main menu.
---
- As many of the mutations as you want.
---
- No it's random to whatever you get, better to just try and buy them off player vendors instead.
---
- Best? It's subjective to player style so google the mutations list and judge for yourself.
---
Thats exactly why nukes exist lol xD Nuking events for better loot is fun
---
You can turn off reoccurring billing, that way you wont be charged when the next year rolls around.
---
Pay to not crash? Oh they can't do that too incompetent lol.
---
I'd have to agree with you on the 9 year olds with squeaky voices, but as of yet I have never seen or heard one.  Everybody I talk to seems to be a young adult (20-29) or middle aged (30-50ish).
---
But I honestly don't see how hearing other people in your world talking (as long as they aren't little 9 year old squeakers) would break your immersion.  For me, seeing a bunch of random people sitting and staring at you without saying anything is the more immersion breaking thing.
---
The medical supplies building in the more. Got them all in one trip.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Agreed... if anything Pay For Convenience since literally nothing in the subscription enhances any part of the character to allow them to win anything more than any other player.
---
Wait why did you post an image of a video in a post about audio? Why not a link to the video?
---
Love this game, been playing for an hour or so every other day and I've had so many cool experiences like this.
---
It's an online only game, what do you want? It has a campaign. You can play it solo too.
---
It's not charging you to play online. It's free. The DLC is free. You have to pay for the game. I don't see why you're moaning. Its getting FREE updates???
---
Yah. Paint jobs should be bundles. Like 18 bucks buys 5 schemes across all relevant armor styles
---
Again let us pay to host our own servers through there client but give us the actual privilege to eddit it as we are fit.. you know like how every other game that host community servers work..
---
It's not as broken as it used to be even though still has issues, but it is almost completely devoid of anything to do...the dlc has been god awful and now they're cash grabbing with 1st BS.. My group  of friends have been asking why we still play this game  so yeah I get what you're saying
---
I'd hope not, but it is looking like it. I'll take a breather from Fallout 76 for a bit. See what move they make next.
---
That's exactly this.
---
You're probably right. I still haven't bought a sub, but trying to pvp in workshops- no one shows. The private server works against my vendor, probably why don't think need it. I looked on my mule account's friend list which has buyers and sellers from past trades, I see a lot of them play private.
---
Many players have serums for 200 caps... google search them so you can buy the ones that fit your character.
---
Do you lot ever get bored of ü•Å the ‚ò†üê¥? Pretty sure most people do now.
---
I'm creaming laughing
---
I agree with you, for the amount of resources that the workshop give you, it's pretty lackluster.  I can run around WesTek and grab all the mutants weapons, slap on scrapper, and scrap them AT WesTek for 300+ steel in less than 10 minutes.  You get like 15 steel ore at grafton steel in the same amount of time.
---
A problem I think contributes is that you could earn Atoms ingame from the beginning; I'd say 10 atoms per hour on average. Play 50 hours to get the Collectron, Play 180 hours to get a PA skin. Given the leveling speed of 2 hours/level on average, these play times are just about at where one would do a cosmetic. I speculate most players have not bought atoms, therefore, the sales data is skewed and is overall bad. Why so? Because you have to buy 1st membership with real money, not some 1000-1500 Atoms equivalent (\~$12) per month. If people could only buy atoms, there wouldn't be a need for the extra infrastructure to manage 1st membership payments for example.
---
So why do people bring up $60 then?
---
Exactly! Even low levels can farm WV Lumber and earn caps from mutants and even weapons to sell if they don‚Äôt scrap them. Not too mention the xp they earn while doing it.
---
Depends on what it is. You‚Äôre spot on regarding the paints. Some things at half price would be fine. Plushies, glow in the dark map, whatever. I‚Äôd like to see more camp stuff. And access to stuff that was in the store before. Not everything needs to be vaulted. Example, I want the Roman columns to put my two little statues on. Not in the store and no other way to get them so my statues, which I bought in the store, sit on my floor. It‚Äôs frustrating.
---
These fraudsters are ruining the game! 
---
Said no one ever. I couldn't care less about whether he keeps a silly emote and a worthless virtual item and neither should you. If anything, he made a smart choice and got something for free - unlike people paying 120 Eur per year.
---
Best tip. Don't play 76.
---
Lol that fixes a lot of things.
---
They saw Fortnite sell $20 skins and they wanted in on that. It‚Äôs a shame the game was bugged from the start.
---
Idk maybe they're searching the deepest parts of the Internet to find the most expensive price for fallout??
---
If you are in range of a terminal, and you use the terminal when you are sitting down and then you exit that terminal, your character breaks (can't move only exit world) atleast it always does for me.
---
They might not be an unsuspecting new player. I sometimes deliberately buy things like that from vendors when I like their camp and/or just feel like being nice.
---
yup, found it. thank you again!
---
What's the point of private servers when you can't have access to them unless you pay $100 a year?
---
"Stealth Nerd" , Hehehehehehe. üòéüòéüòéüòéüòé
---
Yeah I don't see the point in taking and using a workshop unless you're too lazy to farm, or looking for pvp.
---
Marvel Heroes did that to an insane degree. Gazillion literally banned anyone who dared criticize the company. Eventually they ran out of money and were forced to port to consoles. A month or two later after the console launch, on the day before thanksgiving, everyone was laid off a month earlier than scheduled. The employees didn't even get their severance or paid time off because there was nothing, and the CEO made off with the lion's share of what was there.
---
He said the several hundred hours he spent in-game is nowhere near hardcore hours (again no clue how an adult with a life doesn't consider this a huge amount of time) but ok...
---
If what he's saying is true he got his money's worth in playtime alone, also I fail to see how the sub would drive someone away since it has no real effect on his gameplay whatsoever.
---
I just dislike when people talk like OP like they're some crusader fighting corporate greed. Don't like the sub? Don't get it, don't like the game anymore? Uninstall it and move on and don't  buy future Bethesda games if you no longer support them. No need to inform us in a dramatic fashion.
---
I never said you played 76, you assumed that. So you're incorrect there.
---
You kept describing how badly you were treated on WoW while trying to justfy allowing players to target people that purchased 1st.  You, YOU went on about how is it fair that you were always ganked by higher level players.  That's not me deciding anything, that's going off the info you're providing.
---
I know you used WoW as an example, just as I did with GTA. Not sure where you're unclear about this.  There is a big difference (which I attempted to explain several times but you refuse to get it) between normal PvP and coming on here and asking specifically how to target 1st players.  Get it?  Trying to target someone because they purchased content for the main purpose of making the game un-fun for them to play is far different then randomly attacking players in a game simply because they're lower level.
---
I never said, nor implied that it's not allowed. Again, not sure where you're unclear about this. I only stated people that do that are trash, just as the people you described that hunt down lower level people. Sure it's part of the game, but that ruins the experience for lower level people.  Am I making my self clear?
---
Apparently you're smarter than Bethesda.  I can't believe they would sit there and develop this content and fathom the idea that shitty players would in turn target other players because they purchased the content.  Maybe you should get a job with them and help guide them.
---
Quite right, I thought it was 10% explosive dmg not 20%+demo haha, but ye dps rather then dmg
---
I wasn't trying to correct you, or criticize you. Just my thoughts on the matter. I apologize if I came off that way.
---
Oh aye I know just forgot to mention it, gotten used to using stabilized over demo which explains why I forgot
---
:\[ I like it
---
Isn't there a general consensus that it's an incredibly short game?  Something that I most certianly could not say about kotor 1 or 2. Kotor being some of my favourtie games of all it might be worth the buy even if it brings back that feeling for a little while.
---
If you want to hear more about the good deeds side of random interactions, [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/) has some =\]
---
I did? Click the link? Works for me.
---
No its because a majority of players of fo76 paid the 60 at launch, myself included.  I know there's new players that paid a discounted price, but you can't exclude the day 1 buyers that make the majority
---
Why the fuck are you still paying this game people
---
I dunno man, buy a phone and see how many times you get asked to pay. Do you not even understand the basics of money?
---
with fully maxxed out Demo Expert it comes out to be 32%.  FYI
---
I put a portapotty next to my camp so if I have to go, I go in there and close the door behind myself.
---
Why I brought up ESO.
---
$60 at launch... Sub later.
---
Did Fallout 76 introduce a sub sooner into its life than ESO? (I have no idea)
---
The best way to don't when you already did is to undo
---
This sub is getting ridiculous.
---
Rage rider lmfao
---
I own a house and a car, and have thousands in stocks. 
---
So I would say yes, I understand money. 
---
Do you?
---
They really are lol I stopped playing this game months ago but still come here for a good laugh. The people defending these decisions are in so deep they have no choice but to stay by Bethesdas side, so Bethesda will keep pushing and pushing.
---
Anyone paying extra for this game deserves to be targeted.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt judge the quality of someone else‚Äôs life by your own. Everyone lives according to themselves, and though some people may have genuinely bad lives, I am certainly happy with mine.
---
sounds like you didnt even give the game a chance, just jumped on the hype train.
---
I have an online acquaintance who started locking his doors cause every time I saw him online I'd leave toilet paper and fertilizer on his bed, I tried twice after.  Being wanted sucks.
---
not bugged on xbox
---
What a dumb fucking answer
---
The Maw, for half of them.
---
Was the DLC free? 
---
And I understand. I know how shitty it was. I bought fallout 76 day one too. I remember leaving the game for a whole while because it was unplayable. Its a playable game now. But I get it.
---
That took me a minute.
---
I feel you, I was excited of coming back for wastelanders and then this shit happens. But the outer worlds is pretty damn awesome and I've only played it like 4 hours so far
---
Enforcer for shotgun,  tormentor for rifles,  renegade for pistols,  one gun army for heavy weapons.   These are the cripple perks and they all make the scorch beasts land.  Twisted muscles for melee (mutation) but obviously different help lol.
---
Hmmm.... I dont see them. Are they in NW or in AV mode? Perhaps I need to be in AV mode to see them? Im looking in NW right now and I no see :\[ I am unlocking them strangely....
---
Imma just call you a PR shill cause I lack the intelligence nor logic to win in an argument with you. This won't be the last of me
---
You barely even played the game lolol
---
I think my only objection here, is that people wanted to be able to host ‚Äúservers‚Äù locally through their own hardware, like how Minecraft works? Not like the Realms because that‚Äôs pretty much F1st servers to the letter but genuine, home grown player hosted worlds where you decide if it‚Äôs an online session or not, whether it‚Äôs invite-only or public. As far as I‚Äôm aware it never looks like it has costed anything to let players host online games in Minecraft
---
As for the the third issue people are having, Pete Hines did say that they‚Äôd use the atomic shop to fund future content, and something like this, or least the tents and scrap box is seemingly big enough to warrant being funded through the atomic shop instead of through a subscription which is what I‚Äôd assume is the trigger for some players because it doesn‚Äôt suggest free dlc in the future the way that‚Äôs being treated currently but that‚Äôs my impression so far
---
Then why did you make a post about digital advertising and try to pan it off as a financial comment?
---
You can also be a great community on some other game that is great and not a shitfest.
---
Yes when someone does the event  death blossoms everyone on server gets those and they are used to make super stims
---
Wow, that's a great tool!
---
I place my survival camp there all the time now :)
---
I found that out earlier. I was getting the radiation from a glowing creature and thought it might be him having trouble spawning. Tossed a frag and he popped up.
---
I got it on Xbox.
---
I think the queen negates explosive damage.
---
