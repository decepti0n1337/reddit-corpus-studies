GOD YES
---
Yeah its nice to see YouTubers who can tell the "storie" for u! I enjoy it to !
---
lol u spawned into a nuke and it didnt look like u were in a nuke zone at all and that is what actually happened..was this the golf club?
---
Please let all the well known gaming sites start picking up all the bad bethesda news so the casuals can revolt too. 
---
...shit.
---
As someone who has been, um involved in gaming, this whole thing sounds like an mmo that is going into maintenance cycle. 
---
People raking the game on this forum.
---
My camp rarely gets attacked, but I have a 99% of spawning in the water and getting parasites every time I join a game or fast travel to my camp
---
I don‚Äôt know if it still exists but there was a large active ( 300 members ) discord brotherhood RP group , I don‚Äôt know what happened but I couldn‚Äôt find it on my server list one day and I haven‚Äôt heard or seen anything about it since , maybe try looking for it idk. üóø
---
Games fun. It feels a little soulless but it has good systems and plenty of content.
---
Never explored in the Lore iirc 
---
Well u obviously weren't playing the game since the stress test my man. Game ran like shit but it was fun now it runs a bit better but its repetitive and boring. Not saying that i want content i dont care abou content i want the base game to be fun. Even in rust u get scrap faster. 
---
Changing the frequency of attacks for scorchbeast's is probably about 4 line edits. I sincerely hope that they're putting more effort into these updates
---
pitboy 
---
They can get a new job somewhere else, like the founder and former president of the studio working on 76 did... a month before the release.
---
In the end none. It went from legendary visible in my pit boy to gone..... even checken 10x if I maybe dropped it.
---
Nah, I'm going all over the map right now and I'm still taking rads, must be a new feature.
---
The combat feels no better than Morrowind. Not sure why anybody in the world is concerned with PvP in a Bethesda game.
---
Because, like the rest of the game, no testing was done before release.
---
There may be a QA group, but it is painfully obvious that no one within Bethesda is PLAYING the game.
---
Tiering was screwed in FO4 and wouldn‚Äôt work properly for a MMO.  You needed mods to make things right.
---
I said that the other day! All they had to do was make a regular fallout game and just add co op. Retards
---
But seriously....
---
What if?
---
This is not a stupid thought- it's been brought up a whole bunch here, but you can't be close to other bases. If you've ever gotten the pop-up "We can't place your CAMP in this world" it's because someone elses' camp is too close to yours. 
---
But, yeah- it'd be awesome and the community has been bringing it up since about a week after launch, but radio-silence from B.
---
So first they overnerf the weapons, now they are nerfing the scorchbeasts to make a net result of zero.
---
Comical.  This is how they are wasting their time. Meanwhile tons and  tons of QoL changes continue to go by the wayside.
---
As a casual player and, this being my first on line game I don't know anyone / I don't have any friends to campaign with. ( wow, does that sound sad..). It'd be cool to do some of the events with a group and sometimes I've randomly reached out to players that I see only to be ignored. I was attacked and killed by a wanted player once, took my loot of screws and titanium scrap which pissed me off. Most people seem to be like me, a Lone Wanderer.
---
That is actually a cool idea. Have an upvote.
---
Golf and pool balls, clubs and cues!
---
Not interested in causing an argument or anything, but I just feel like it's necessary to point out that your first sentence is quite the opposite from how it is. Pretty much every single time I've checked this subreddit, it's just a shitstorm of complaints, issues, and statements about quitting the game.
---
Anyway I'm sorry you've had so many issues with the game (as many, many others have). I haven't had half as many of the issues you seem to have had, and you're rightfully upset about it.
---
A lot of people that were banned did not get an email or right away, so if you maybe had a lot of weight on your character its most likely that
---
Yep. I am level 20 and i got completely wrecked when one appeared out of nowhere.
---
[removed]
---
Pro tip; got killed by a griefer more than once? If it happens again just literally do nothing. Go grab a coffee or water while the dickhead just watches your body, unable to do anything about it
---
They are breaking the game every patch :(
---
And why did they leave out an effect like incendiary, save for one weapon, when it could've been one of the secondary effects? My weapons can magically deal more damage if I'm almost dead but I can't have incendiary ammo which actually exists o.o or bullets that cause bleeding... But I can magically deal more damage if my target isn't hurt yet
---
All anyone ever asked for with a Bethesda game having multiplayer is being able to play with their *friends*. Not with randoms, not to meet new people, not to PvP, of all things, but just to hop into their buddy's match and play out the adventures their favorite imagined characters might have. Or even just join as a random scrub follower like in Fable 2.
---
This was never asked for. I'll admit it's interesting, but...
---
I was just pointing out that the thing actually exists. I‚Äôve used it a few times and it kills just as fast as any other melee‚Äîmostly it‚Äôs situational but it‚Äôs how you build around it. But my statement wasn‚Äôt a personal attack, my dude.
---
And while I‚Äôm quite certain he‚Äôs either exaggerating, misinterpreting the problem, or simply lacking the necessary facts to adequately prove his assertion. I just think we can‚Äôt know the circumstances, regardless of our perceptions of the story‚Äôs believability.
---
and i want to be a beastlord :P
---
It‚Äôs probably the next nerf
---
Can you offer a suggestion to me, then? How the hell have you leveled up so much so fast?!? I've played over 100 hours and have found/cleared almost every location on the map (I have 11 left to go) and I'm only level 59! What on earth do you do?
---
What's really fun is that this didn't used to be an issue and it popped up after one of the latest patches.
---
You already can wasteland whisperer ;) 
---
Is it possible that this game engine just cannot support the type of game they created? Every fixed bug causes 5 more.... Meanwhile Respawn can release Apex and have nearly ZERO issues on day one with a super polished game. 
---
You haven‚Äôt been duping for months *or* you haven‚Äôt duped at all?
---
If you actually did dupe then your ban is fully deserved.
---
Imo its just visual lag.
---
It only happens to me when i go into vats and shoot instantly.
---
Of course two shot and twisted muscle accuracy drops aren't reflected in the vats %
---
This is pretty old but when you nuke a zone all enemies move to their max levels. This means 68 for Scorched/Mutants, 58/62 for ghouls, and 40 for mole miners
---
I want a drawn out engagement. Think line in the sand, but bigger. The brotherhood's last stand was at defiance. (With defenses facing away from cranberry bog but w/e) anywho an event that draws in entire map and server. Scorchbeasts queen or king? Spawn and begins to build a army.. a location on the map is marked as our last stand. Whitespring is obvious choice but doesn't have to be here. Give us incentives to throw up our camps as firebases in its path. As force moves it gathers strength. From scorched crop dusting. And scorched doesn't need be the only enemy. A huge force of super mutants. So much potential.
---
Thank you for posting the link
---
Cutting a shrinking population into pieces seems like a bad idea
---
My same thoughts exactly.
---
I‚Äôve only ever heard of plans for power armour that isn‚Äôt excavator or ultracite coming from treasure maps.
---
So it‚Äôs lucky you enjoy treasure hunting.
---
yeaaaah... but im still from a vault... not from woods i want to hunt for vault dwellers not be one of them and become beastlord
---
there is also the event up near the top of the map, the civil war re-enactment. however im talking about a legit arena where people who wanna PVP can PVP without restrictions.
---
an example is the Wilderness in Runescape. 
---
Gonna leave my own feedback in hopes that your post can start some discussion. I agree with pretty much all your points. Would especially like to see aliens at the space station. I refuse to believe the alien blaster could ship in such a dismal state.
---
Which enemies are currently your favorites to fight? Why?
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†large groups of scorched or supermutants. Gun vs gun fights are more fun for me, especially in environments with buildings and verticality. The ‚Äúbig bad‚Äù enemies are also enjoyable: behemoths, mirelurk queens, wendigos for the challenge (though they are real bastards).
---
Which enemies do you currently dislike encountering? Why?
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†mole rats, rad rats, most enemies that attack your shins non stop. I dislike the  constant rad worms and diseases from ghouls but as a whole I enjoy fighting them. Also the big frogs really freak me out but that‚Äôs a good thing. Robobrains are a nuisance and I try to ignore them. Assaultrons are tough enemies so I try to avoid them but I like the challenge when I engage them.
---
What makes an encounter with an enemy or creature fun or intriguing to you?
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†if it behaves in a way that keeps me on my toes instead of just rushing at me and slapping my legs. I like the humanoid enemies or the larger monsters that make you feel like you have to take a careful approach to them. Paranormal/cryptid enemies are fun too because they‚Äôre unique.
---
What types of enemies would you like to see added to Fallout 76 in the future? Why?
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†aliens, I want to see more related to them and the alien blaster. It‚Äôs supposed to be a legendary-esque weapon and it‚Äôs not right now. Content with aliens that drop upgrades or ways to improve the pistol and get more ammo would be great. More big bosses in general would be nice to see  too.
---
Other than legendary items, what types of loot help a fight feel rewarding to you?
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†unique or rare weapon mods that only drop from enemies would be cool. I also like when enemies drop plans for items. Caps, large amounts of rare ammo, and rare chems are a good haul too. I‚Äôd like to see the scorched at Camden park drop fuzzy tokens too.
---
Would you like to see more challenging enemies added in the future, that may require multiple players or a team to defeat? Why?
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†YES!!! A zetan invasion at the crashed space station, a huge mole miner boss, a giant FEV/centaur abomination thing (a la One Reborn from Bloodborne anyone?).  A giant assaultron or robot boss. More Lovecraftian monsters would be a welcomed addition.
---
I mean she'd have the biology for it no problem but yeah I've always wondered the specifics of miss nanny AI being implanted into a mind. My guess is synth Curie is a new conscious person with the memories of what robot Curie did but that programming is now more so her moral guidelines than actual code? So she can physically go against them and of course has emotion and free will but wouldn't want to and has a personality built from memories of being a robot.
---
Brilliant article, sums up so much of what we have all been dealing with and says it beautifully. 
---
The fun, the bugs, the hope, the disappointment, the longing for a complete and realized experience; its all captured here. I hope they really take it to heart. 
---
Give us scorched in BoS Power Armour that is banged up and missing chunks. Plenty of BoS died to scorched so it'd be easy to fit into lore.
---
Are you on PC? If so can you test your build with me? I have yet to find anyone able to kill me with ranged weapons. I say this all the time, I get wrecked by melee though.
---
 I had a friend shoot me with a 4k damage TSE Dragon and it barely knocked a quarter off my health bar. I want to test the stealth build today, need to buy some stealth boys. 
---
Prolly cause you don't use it?
---
I get that you're being sarcastic, but why? You're irritated with the person pointing out the disappointing product you both bought? I can't understand how anybody isn't disappointed in fallout 76 unless they've never played another Bethesda game. I'm disappointed and only still playing because games have become online platforms to improve upon over years, but I don't have high hopes for this one, because it seems like they used their B team to "develop" Fallout 4 Online, and then put their farm team on the job after launch.
---
Charge $60 for a game and you're going to get criticized. I don't give a shit what the deadline was, you don't sell an Alpha game for $60 and hope customers understand.

---
You aren‚Äôt the only one that noticed. Sadly I‚Äôve seen no reply from Bethesda. 
---
Maybe stick it up as a potential bug in the bug reporting post. See if that gets any traction 
---
There is really no comparison. When that happened in Destiny 1 it was a design choice (perhaps a poor one). What's going on with 76 is a bug. I don't think they intend for legendary enemies to not drop legendary loot.
---
Thanks will see what I can find. 
---
For me absolutely. But if they had, pvp would have been one of the top-most requested features, as it usually ends up with online games, and a the lack of it would have been yet another reason why "Bethesda is the worst studio ever". Just my opinion.
---
Yeah thats what I said, they‚Äôre dicks lol
---
For some reason, there are people who like to pvp in this game, yes.
---
Good point tribal
---
People wanted a timeline, or at least an update on the timeline that they said they were going to do. There wasn't an estimate of when the next patch would come out. Like they could have said Feb 19 or 26 and it would have been better received than later this month.  People hated the self promotion of their atom shop items, and would prefer for them to mention it after the game isn't buggy/crashy and has new PVE content. Or to not mention it.  
---
Why are you replying to your own post lmao 
---
\*grunt\* good deathclaw
---
Yes and no. The press it's gotten has been disproportionately bad to the actual quality of the game. It's to the point now that sites like Polygon and IGN won't rest until this game is dead, even if it was taken away from Austin, given to Maryland, and turned into something spectacular. 
---
A game could survive bad developers OR bad press, but not both.
---
Platform?
---
I think Survival mode coming could be fine and move Hunter Hunted over to that. I think CAMPS need to be protected in Adventure an safe zones. I think anyone shooting up people an camps in Adventure should take damage an eventually kill themselves and in fact do damage to their own camp (move to Survival). I think the ONLY PvP in Adventure should be in taking a Workshop from another or in defending one. Then pretty much most people will be Co-Op friendly. I had lvl 128 spawn in an I guess I had his camp an he started shooting wild around my camp an then pointed at it. Forced me to pretty much quit or risk having to replace stuff. Sadly any so called protection from this is silly an it forces most to have to move to another server. Fix that Bethesda! 
---
Get that thin skin on other new guy. Be offended!
---
It had 10 million pounds
---
Was a reply to someone else....just pressed wrong button :(
---
I included that in the post. We're on xbox.
---
Didnt see that post. Glad im not the only person whose noticed this. 
---
I got the manta man suit, add the Halloween skull mask and you basically have skeletor
---
I won't even argue - it could use a nerf. I'm ok with killing things in 2-3 hits as well.
---
I know it is, im talking about the PVE only servers with no slap or any kind of PVP whatsoever. Because the people getting F up all the way to Sunday in PVP servers will want to go back on the current ones to keep getting free kills.
---
Cool! That's not the same game, though. 
---
I‚Äôm with ya bud. Sad to admit it, honestly. 
---
A super sledge. I'm full rifle build, no melee perks. Sledge still kills them in one to three normal attacks.
---
This weeks honestly seemed like they gave up. That was a seriously depressing Inside the Vault. Worries me that they don‚Äôt care any more....
---
Eh, why the coolest things happen on consoles.
---
hey yeah, im interested
---
I'd love to come check it out
---
gt is soureststraws, hit me up
---
They missed a really interesting and genre-appropriate way to add pvp in a unique way: a Thunderdome-type pvp zone with no-pvp spectator areas, complete with betting caps on the winner.  Also lends itself to being a player trading hub.  Could also have different event-type modes where teams fight increasingly difficult waves of 'captured' critters (maybe the team has to pay a cap premium to get into those events).  But nope, nothing new except pvp only servers, woop de doo.
---
Not what i am looking for, this is a easy well known build i have on one of my guys.  Want to know how people are doing soo much damage with those weps
---
A post complaining about other posts, we've more come full circle. But also rule one homie.
---
Sorry. I wasn't suggesting it was a problem, I was just trying to find out if out was worth it.
---
Ah yes. In the time it took between my last comment and this one, I got a TSE lever action. Never using anything else except a pump shotgun.
---
I disagree entirely with some of this advice, although I agree entirely with some of it too.
---
I disagree with this:
---
&gt; Don't build near highly traffic areas like popular nuke sites, such as Whitespring ....
---
That's exactly where I've built, because it's the most economical and convenient. Letting the griefers drive you into obscure, impractical locations ‚Äî places that offer no ready access to merchants and events and the parts of the map for which you'd like to have a free fast-travel target as a waypoint ‚Äî means letting the griefers destroy your play-style. This is capitulation, and I don't intend to capitulate.
---
&gt; If you see him/her/them bringing out the big guns. Either server hop before the damage is done or take them out the moment one gets wanted. 
---
Nonsense. The only way to "win" against griefers is *not to play*. The PvP mechanics and bounty mechanics are FUBAR'd and highly exploitable. When in doubt, server hop.
---
&gt; If you start any problem with a player, keep in mind that player maybe seeking for more than just vengeance. esp. if you came on top.  
---
This suggests it's okay to be an @sshole semi-griefer yourself. It's not okay. Don't start problems with other players, period.
---
&gt; If you can take out scorth \[*sic*\] beasts, build remotely around fissure sites.  
---
Stupidest thing I've ever heard. I'm level 132, 300+ hours in the game, two three-star weapons, and I still find fighting scorch beasts an annoying waste of my time and, especially my resources. Leaving aside SBQ: Unless I'm in the middle of something that I just can't bring myself to quit, like an event to which I've already devoted serious time and effort, when I hear the wings, I server hop. Multiplying those encounters is a prescription, then, for spending my entire game experience looking at loading screens.
---
&gt; I upgraded the room \[in which a decontamination shower arch is hidden\] to bricks though. 
---
If I were a griefer, I could get through those just as fast. There's even a perk to help me do it. If I were a griefer, I'd *especially* be sure to break through anything you've walled off to keep me away from. Your original advice was right: Keep your decon shower in your "Stored" inventory unless you're actually at your camp or, indeed, unless you're actually using it. (A griefer blew mine up in the time it took me to log out, even though I was at my camp and standing right next to it, with maybe a half-second gap between his first TSE shotgun blast and my attempt to server hop.)
---
&gt; Lock your doors ....
---
Again this advice is capitulating to griefers ‚Äî the whole point of my building a nice, creative camp is to encourage visitors to both view and use it, indeed to grab a banjo and join me in song ‚Äî and it's ineffective: They'll blow right through your locked doors.
---
\*\*\*\*\*
---
The sad truth is that until they fix this game so there's a genuinely non-PvP option available, there *is no way* to eliminate the damage the griefers can do to your camp. While I very much applaud the community minded intent behind this post, it's tantamount to holding a quick class on the deck of the Titanic to teach people about how to hold their noses when their faces go under water.

 What does Sharding mean?
---
**Sharding is**  a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases the  into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards. The  word **shard means** a small part of a whole.
---
Nope I didn't
---
Let's not get ahead of ourselves. They should establish a process of running their builds through internal QA and regression first to realize a merge failure brought back old bugs first, then they can start thinking about putting up a public test server.
---
Yeah and how many of those were stupid little things like typos. I would imagine most of them considering in reality it barely changed anything.
---
Right, some sanctuary where it's incentivized to meet up and violence/pvp is discouraged (but still always available). The underground Bazaar, or something.
---
Unless they overhaul everything (let's be honest, they won't) there isn't enough content they could introduce to bring me back.
---
I wish I'd thought of that!
---
Any defences?
---
Ah lowercase, looked right over it. Too bad community sounds sweet
---
High time, if you ask me. I just hope them release the server code so moders can try to salvage something from this.
---
Byeeeeee
---
they literally reply to feedback and posts on this subreddit daily.
---
I understood you well and agree! Like others have said, i want to play Fallout, not Fortnite. I paid 40 bucks for Fortnite in Alpha, 60 bucks for Fallout at release, and thus far, I feel like I wasted 100 bucks. Fucking prove me wrong already.
---
Usually the big drain on base budget is turrets. I know we all like to build fort kickass but unfortunately turrets eat like a good 13% of your budget or more each. 
---
As for power going through, look into advanced power connector plans, otherwise its windows and doors with wires. The good news is that it only needs to be a window or a door to place the wire through initially. You can then select the door/window and select the replace option and switch it out for a solid wall and the game will allow it, the wire will now harmlessly clip through the solid wall. 
---
Much respect for this author.
---
It is clear they play the game and they hit the nail on the head regarding how we are all feeling.
---
I kill everything with one hit and don't wear any unyielding armor. All my pieces are +1 strength and I rarely need rads unless I'm trying to carry a little more weight. Nothing exciting for weapons either. I use the meat hook and junky death tambo. 
---
Yeah this quest line was data mined and it‚Äôs a huge fetch mission across the map that you compete against other people to see how fast you can do it(I don‚Äôt have the source on me) but it‚Äôs absolutely comical 
---
preach it brother üôèü§†üëåüèºüòå
---
&gt; Separate PvP/PvE servers would be a good thing.
---
Why would this be a good thing? Take a playerbase that is already dwindling, then split it in half, then...expect whales to spend in the cash shop on a desolate game?
---
And it will be a maximum interval between attacks, instead of minimum. 
---
Attacking a player initiates pvp with the whole team. Now I assume that most people who go around looking for fights have snipers with them.
---
Fair point. I also kinda forgot.

&gt;&gt; Its a game. Not something to reward you for your time. Its a game I play every day for an hour or two, sometimes a lot more.
---
You‚Äôre drowning in semantics here, dude. If you‚Äôre enjoying the game, that‚Äôs the reward you are receiving for playing. If you weren‚Äôt enjoying it, you wouldn‚Äôt play it - because you weren‚Äôt being rewarded. Your time is the investment. Everyone wants something back for their time investment when playing a game (enjoyment, stress relief, adrenaline rush). 
---
I normally put mine in the cash register by the not, cuz that's where I started finding them at first. Got almost a whole set of ultracite power armor plans that way
---
Clearly you've not been paying attention. 
---
Yeah! By the end of the year we may even get TWO 40 minute empty vault quests! And the pajamas! So many new and enticing pajama textures from the shop to look forward to! I'm giddy with anticipation!

Go here.  Not mine but it helped 
---
I mean... the only reason I run in pacifist mode is because I do so much aoe splash I am bound to hit someone, somewhere and at least six or seven times by mistake and possibly level their camp by mistake too. It is fun the first few times.. but after a while it becomes a chore.  
---
Thanks got it
---
Thanks
---
My assumption is that they at least do SOME testing before releasing these patches to the public, I was simply proposing adding another layer to the process in between this and the update reaching the live server.
---
You're surprised? I'm just shocked it took them this long to cut their losses. I'll consider us lucky if the servers are still up in six months time.
---
Just more variety of existing enemies would be enough. All the scorched look exactly the same.
---
Maybe they‚Äôll add companions eventually, that could be cool. Or it‚Äôs just some code left over from fallout 4
---
I wouldn't waste my time trying to farm pa plans, just hop the 3 pa spawns in watoga a couple times and you should get a full set of 51b. 
---
Do you think scat fetishists sit around telling other people how good it is to have a shit taken on you?
---
I think it's more like you and I have played enough games and seen what works and what doesn't, but the developers played what they played and have been too busy developing ever since, to play all the games in between. No idea, though, but it's less irritating than just getting pissed off at all the "one step forward, two steps backward," in this industry.
---
Once in awhile I come back to a paper bag on my threshold filled with goodies. Guess they could also leave spoiled meat if they hated it :p
---
well the scorch beast is only one of the scorch creatures I could see a massive mirelurk scorch queen or a giant scorched frog behemoth 
---
Honestly what I'd love to see is a scorch commander in some kind of prototype power armor with swarms of scorch surrounding him 
---
has anyone else had the radscorpions just teleport dozens of feet after you shoot them once?
---
That helps some, but it still sorts other stuff after the spoiled food so you end up having to scroll through a bunch of the list anyway.
---
if you arent looking for that build, you want all the +str gear and food/drink/chem buffs and mutations you can find.   
---
This garbage reads like an abridged reddit shitpost superthread. No wonder y‚Äôall like it.
---
Not gonna lie, I actually forgot I even picked this one up. Thought I'd check out the sub after seeing someone mention the game elsewhere, and see if the game had been improved upon. And from what I'm seeing, things are looking rather grim.   
---
Bethesda probably had some internal numbers on retention and long term revenue earnings, just to have it come up very very short. This leads to slower and less consequential updates, which means it's a harder pitch for returning and new players. It's self devouring snake closing in on implosion. If they want to salvage this game, it's going to take a leap on their ends, because us players are still recovering from the fall of our own.
---
I too have nothing better to do than to try to float over my decision not to play a video game.
---
The scorchbeast timeout (or interval) is a few seconds of work to adjust. They highlighted that change as if it‚Äôs the world.
---
&gt;Try their cash register.
---
This is genius! Similar to slowy stealing from Van Graffs or Prydwyn. 
---
I tend to use the Blue Suitcase at Watoga Station and the Desk at Whitesprings Station. Pick a plan, leave a plan!
---
&gt; Anyone else have this problem? 
---
The real question is: 
---
Is there anyone with an investment in the game comparable to yours (or mine) who's *not having* this problem?
---
I won't claim that's a null set. But it's far and away the biggest part of any Venn diagram of this game's user base.
---
I am updating all drivers tonight.  Thank you for the suggestion.

Do you mean Rich Vogel?  He left 14 months before 76 was released.
---
Truth. The gender-specific stuff is a bit frustrating too. Wish they'd launch a toolkit and open a market for user-created cosmetics like they did in FO4
---
wtb that hair-do 
---
Maybe some players want to play a game where they're "rebuilding America" instead of killing all your fellow vault dwellers all the time.
---
I wont be on then but I can add you
---
Being right about the entire future of the game is a pretty big "twice a day"
---
I thought that was just me being unlucky and hitting that 5% miss chance 
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Got 2 turrets mainly to warn me, they are so weak in any case
---
It just is ... farm a liltle for sentinel assasins armor and you Tank way more in pvp and pve than any power armor
---
To be fair, that's 12 minutes more effort than they put into the last patch.
---
Yep. Had a lvl 5 fully modded 44 I had made for a player but they disconnected before I could hand it off. Found someone else in Flatwood who had just turned level 5 and dropped it in front of them with some ammo. They were very happy.
---
I did it that way, i do have advanced power connections plan read, can do conduits. 
---
And maybe splitting a small playerbase in half will destroy any remaining monetisation for the game. You think Bethesda are going to pay out of their pocket for server hosting so people can just 'have fun'?
---
Oh shut up. People like you that think they know how to do everyone else's job are stupid.
---
Even the SBQ, I‚Äôve had more luck when it‚Äôs just me and one other person, or even just me. Because the more people there are, the higher it‚Äôs health is
---
Gtfo! 
---
Stay out 
---
I'm thinking it's not the dev team but the dev part time employee.
---
Actually a new Vegas dev said he really liked the game and understood the unfortunate side of what must‚Äôve been going on behind the scenes.
---
Bruh, take a RadawayüòÇ
---
I totally agree with you, and this article. 
---
Adding tons of SANDBOX content and balancing things across the board (resources, builds, players, enemies). 
---
Balancing things can be difficult, but it just takes a dedicated smart person (or group of people) to fiddle with the numbers to make them all make sense. 
---
Sandbox content can come in tons of different formats, but shouldn't be too difficult either. You just need to make different things interesting to get through different means, and expand on the tools the CAMPs give us already. As an example, imagine you had NPC settlers in your CAMP that leveled up, you could gear out, and that gave interesting bonuses or had their own progression of some type. Or even adding numerical based skills (like previous Fallout games or Skyrim), or that your NPC settlers had as well! I would love that type of content that wasn't just a next big boss to kill (but for sure, add more bosses and things to kill)!
---
Right now, nothing has any "weight" and with little effort you can be swimming in caps, able to kill anything, and actual loot doesn't really matter or isn't exciting. Adding more goals to accomplish doesn't need to be tedious! 
---
Only if you were actually right about what happens exactly.
---
I believe the team is too small for the game and that is why you see glacial progress on things.
---
Some stuck to the canvas bag crap and nuka dark as evidence when they have no actual bearing on a game and their development team.
---
I think of it as west of Bolton Greens, but yeah. I can't say I care for it much.
---
I recently bought the game so I am a bit behind in level and content. But even at a low level I can feel these changes. Enemies can deal so much damage I die but I can't even scratch them. I've lost stuff I've put a lot of time into, Camps and such. I think another problem is that they can't decide to be a MMO, a survival game, or an online Shooter. 
---
The scorched killed the ones that did not become scorched
---
I was one of those folks who was always trying to reply to the negative with what‚Äôs good. I tried to keep thinking positively and ignore the issues. I took a break for about three weeks for a host of reasons, the main being what few quests I had were bugged (I‚Äôd complete them and they‚Äôd show complete but then we‚Äôre back to incomplete on next login). I wanted to give myself a little time off so as not to become one of the folks who was just shitting on the game over and over again. Remember what I loved about it. Miss it. And then come back. 
---
Last weekend I logged in for 20 minutes, got frustrated, and logged back out to try to prevent the bad attitude. 
---
Logged in a few days later. Made it about 30 minutes. 
---
Logged in today. 20 minutes.
---
Each of these times, shortly after I logged in, I headed to a nuke drop. Made some kills, and watched as the bodies disappeared immediately after hitting the ground. 
---
I am trying so so so hard to not become a person who has nothing positive left to say but, I can only continue the wash, rinse, repeat of farming for materials and doing the same events, so many times. 
---
I love this franchise so much and want so badly for them to make good on what us hardcore fans not only expected, but deserve. I‚Äôm going to give them some more time and keep my fingers tightly crossed.
---
Super mutants are the most fun enemies hands down. They work in a much more tactical and composed way than the other enemies. I think it would be nice to see the enemy pool expand as human NPC‚Äôs find their way into this game (which, imo, they eventually should). A Lovecraftian cult controlled by the old gods; a raider army hellbent on getting control of the nukes knowing that the Scorched plague has been vanquished; an army of creatures and people being corrupted by a malignant robotic plague being created by a rogue AI, since a big thing in the game was automation. There‚Äôs so many awesome options out there.
---
Apparently you didn't pay attention to the most recent patch (not the subsequent hotfix) and their stated reason for why it went so wrong.
---
You‚Äôre their boss? ü§î
---
That‚Äôs why /fo76FilthyCasuals is a better sub 
---
Honestly they should of done that in the first place.  Dying Light is the only game that did open world, loot n shoot, co-op well as far as I can recall.  You drop in, drop out, loot pool is the same so no one gets robbed.  I don't mind PVP on this game though, I don't try to take over workshops therefore - no griefing for me... unless I get that unlucky session where someone is destroying my camp then yeah I'll try to defend it... or move, or log.
---
They're already going to have separate servers for survival. Aka, PvP servers. So its happening anyway. Making normal servers PvE based would keep more people playing than it would drive away.
---
Do excuse me, i do not know how to highlight edits on replies, so I will just mention it straightly and hopefully you could tackle on the discussion with me.
---
Whitespring and high traffic areas are the most areas where griefing occurs, regardless. Building remotely around it helps alot, but close to them is good grief bait. 
---
Making problems with other players doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be the one to start it. For example, you could die from mobs of enemies and someone could steal your junk. In my case, I raid factories for pvp. So I am guilty in a sense towards your point here. But that doesn't entirely mean that problems can't occur even if you were playing it cool.
---
In regards to scortch beasts. Melee users one - two hit them on the ground. I am a sniper vats build and I run around with 25% health fof bloodied and adrelanine. I can kill a scorth beast in seven shots. I use a bloody explosive lever action, how do I not die from the beast. His range attacks are explosive, and they do 0 damage of you have fireproof and a dense mod on your armor.
---
The decom arch. Agreed, storing is better. I will add that in.
---
 Ah. I don't suffer explosion damage. That's what that attack is. They damage me not at all with that attack, only the poison is a problem.
---
 BOS Heavy Combat Armor with a Dense Chest and I don't take damage from a 40mm fired into my feet. ;) Its kinda weird but I was trying for max explosion resistance  and I now hunt em' for sport. ;)
---
the mutation only works without armor or weightless armor.
---
What do I think? I think their game is taking on water faster than they could ever hope to bail it out, and what's more, I think they know it. This last Inside the Vault really reads like a team throwing in the towel.
---
Oooooor this a way to continue the players pursuit of loot. This is not a single player game. It is an mmo style online game where you will be perpetually going after something. Good lord
---
So not trying to be an ass but, i'm going to point out the thing that made me say 'Why?" when I was reading your post. Why are you even lugging around 5 Mr. Handy Fuel canisters anyway? I know my play style is totally different from others and your reasons are your own but, I personally do not have an issue with weight anymore on my main or any of my alts (lvl 91 and 12). My main is the only one that might have weight issues but, I built around having those issues for team reasons. My main is a team medic and supplier of food for the team when we go on long murder hikes. I personally find Thru Hiker and Traveling Pharmacy to be needed but, only one really needs to be on while Batteries included is a total must for me as I carry no less than 40 power cores on me at any given time. 
---
As for Junk. I am super picky about what I take and what I leave now, I also have a load out for doing junk runs and I only keep the crap I need to fix my armor, guns, and craft a supply trucks worth of orbital strike beacons/nuke nades. 
---
My lvl 91 is a no power armor, no weight reduction, play through and I got to say, once you learn what you need and what you don't when it comes to scrap, you will never have a weight or storage issue. I would suggest, the next time you go to fix your weapons, make a list of what it costs to repair all the stuff you love and hold, and nothing else. Your camp repair costs should never be factored in because with contractor 2 it should only cost 1 of ever item to fix anything and most camp stuff like scrap concrete, copper, and wood are super simple to find.
---
Any, hope that helps and again... why\~ so many mr handy fuel tanks?  
---
Yeah don't make fun of OP for a simple misclick.
---
Couldn't agree more 
---
Lmao. Good to see you guys are as dramatic as ever. 
---
i understand that..i have a full set of weightless armour..im just thinking i could use better armor and just have one peice of chameleon..would be the same as having the chameleon and weightless armor yeh?
---
maybe i have maybe i havent ;) ive definately done a bloated one once was intense lol
---
Nice
---
At the very least, it could be a torso mod. "Environmental Protective Lining" or something like that.
---
... not entirely sure if the person writing those ‚Äûinside the vault‚Äú things gets to communicate with patch team or just receives an email with a few sparse sentences and the order to write stuff up to sound nicely 
---
I haven‚Äôt forgotten the ‚Äûmisunderstanding‚Äú mr inside-the-vault-author 
---
Sorry I wasn't aware that was a means of farming karma. Today is legit the day that I uninstalled and I only used that phrase as a means of telling people "Go ahead and downvote this thread. I'm just trying to show you all you are deluding yourselves if you continue to defend this company and this abortion of a video game." Hopefully that makes my intentions more clear.
---
Thanks everyone, guess I‚Äôm gonna have to put a lot of time in if I wanna find it lol
---
 I think they are always there. I got them at level 36 or so. They are not all that hard to kill, but they rush you and dealing with that is most of the problem. You can string em' out, they only sprint so far but its a crap shoot for sure.
---
That'd be kinda cool. Adding to that, we could have a group of Scorched Brotherhood of Steel soldiers claw their way up out of the Glassed Cavern. They are the last "survivors" of the final invasion, and they have been warped by the Scorched Plague. So we get a group of 6 power armor wearing Scorched who work together, use a combination of weapons and combat styles, and just generally act like a military unit. Some ideas on that:
---
* 2 mainly Melee, wielding souped up Super-Sledges and charging people to slam into them as if they had 3 ranks of Pain Train. Stagger people and do a bunch of damage on a hit.
---
* 2 with Tesla Rifles that blast away any time more than 2 people clump together. At any other time, they throw plasma grenades *and heal their teammates*. That's right, the Scorched in this squad don't heal faster than normal and are not bullet sponges but they have Stimpacks and can heal each other if you let them get near each other. If you take down other members of this squad before taking down the guys with Tesla Rifles, then these guys run up to them and revive them.
---
* 2 Riflemen with Gauss Rifles and Jet Packs on their power armor that constantly look for high ground and then snipe people.
---
Then you add into that more Scorched aspects. Radiation damage heals them, the Melee ones have "Glowing Pustules" disease so if you hit them it causes a burst of radiation damage. So if you fight them near each other then they heal each other each time you hit one of them. Their appearances are all kinds of screwed up looking like people in full BoS power armor with weird Scorched things sticking out. 
---
That sounds like a fun fight and one that would *require* people to work together without making more bullet sponge enemies.
---
It's not that you're wrong. They just hate you.
---
Fallout 4 sold huge numbers too, it's completely unrelated to the voiced protagonist and terrible dialogue. Let's not pretend Skyrim's writing was anything but garbage.
---
If you accidentally shoot someone IRL they still die.
---
My husband and I have 300+ hours. Some people like things you don‚Äôt. Calling them fanboys just makes you as childish as those you‚Äôre trying to mock. 
---
Making normal servers PvE based would reduce them to nothing in short order. Just a handful of Minecraft aficionados farting around in the build menu. 
---
And it'll still be a 4GB download for consoles, just for a few lines of code being changed.
---
Sorry had to edit that.
---
Pacifist mode is already care bear status. What is the problem? 
---
Gt is Dankpanda710
---
i wait a few seconds and my vats still miss..even if its point blank range..even with melee..i can hit somethibg standing right next to me in vats with melee and do no damage..vats is definitely bugged
---
..the only thing i use vats for now is to find targets..then i back out of vats and aim manually..i find it does a lot more damage anyway..when vats does hit the target it does less damage than when manually aiming
---
I left a couple of days after the last patch, but left the game installed thinking I'll wait and see if it comes around.  But I have to admit that it will most likely just take up space until I eventually uninstall it and then leave the sub.  I love the backgrounds in this game.  I can see brilliance in the creative designs.  But, the program itself is broken.
---
I'm not sure why I am surprised.  I played ESO (Zenimax) and finally gave up on it because they would do patches about weekly and to download them I would have to uninstall the game and re-download the entire ~80gb game.  It seems Cox cable had black listed their patch server supplier and they had no way to fix it.  This went on for months until I gave up.  Their customer service would just tell me it's an ISP issue and I would have to get it fixed.  Yes, leave it to me to fix your issue with one of the largest ISP's in the country.
---
I tried the Anthem demo last weekend, and every other play through ended with me crashing back to the entry screen, losing everything picked up.  Bethesda said that the demo was not the same as the game that would be delivered in only two weeks.  They said the same about FO76.
---
It pretty much already *is* 0.01 considering that sometimes you'll have one just scream at you continuously for minutes at a time, without break.
---
 There‚Äôs PVP?
---
Supposedly if you have 5 peices of chamelon is makes you extra hard to detect. thats how it worked in fo4. but this is fo76 so who knows , havent seen anyone data mine that info yet.
---
Indeed it does. Changes the beam from green to red. Ups the durability as well.
---
Will you be on in 2ish hours?
---
This. The Appalachia map is worth saving. It‚Äôs very exciting to think what modern could do with this.
---
 If they spawned to her level she could take em' out with the Lever Action without a lot of problems. 
---
 She would arrive sneaked and sneak down the cleft and sneak in. The last is important, as they don't swarm you if you go through that door sneaked. Then she would look at the Beast and port out. 
---
Most people asking for multiplayer before 76 came out wanted co-op, not PvP.
---
&gt; In my case, I raid factories for pvp. So I am guilty in a sense towards your point here. 
---
Yes, and I congratulate you for your honesty in recognizing it. 
---
I hope you and everyone else who gets enjoyment out of ruining other people's enjoyment would all go bother each other on the PvP servers, or in some other game that's actually built around PvP (and there are plenty of them). 
---
You and others who do this are exactly the reason I haven't bothered to claim a workshop ‚Äî one of the core experiences intended for everyone in this game ‚Äî since, oh, Christmas. 
---
I consider you a RL enemy, actually. A polite one. But knowing that you're a griefer makes this an incredibly ironic post.
---
Wow . So edgy .
---
Sounds like you have it backwards. There are 5 popular threads about PvE. 
---
I love the mental image of a Vault dweller looking at a picture through binoculars, in the same room.
---
Wear power armor, go to swamps, submerge 
---
Stomping around under water, don‚Äôt need air
---
Catch water disease for no reason
---
Leave water, tick vomits, instant parasite 
---
Wat?! 
---
extra hard to detect?..your either invisible or your not arent you?
---
Wait. You're a raider?
---
Well that's a shame. It's kinda weird cause the trailer for the game kinda lends itself to be a game of rebuilding society. 
---
Yeah, that's not at all true. That's like saying people would only be sitting in the build menu in F04.
---
People would still be out doing events, farming for legendaries dropping and doing everything they're doing now. Just without people murdering them. 
---
Yes and yes.
---
I do agree given the apparent lack of resources dedicated to the game that focusing on one aspect (either PvE or PvP) is better for the game. That said, I think the game is closer to being a fun PvP game than a fun PvE game. I.e. less development effort to turn the game into a fun PvP game, takes a lot more effort to create more, fun PvE content.
---
Not sure how else you would attempt to sum up community sentiment
---
I am at level 7 -- had a few really nice players drop stuff in front of me at the volunteer's office (forgot the name of the place).  It was a really nice introduction to the game.  The trading is still impossibly confusing for me though.  
---
And I really wish I knew people IRL who played. 
---
I agree with you completely on the creative enemies. The other night I was going through the prison, clearing out super mutants, nothing terribly challenging at level 90. I knew there was one that I couldn‚Äôt find, and I was creeping through trying to locate it. 
---
I sneak into a room and he pops out from behind a corner, yells ‚ÄúBoo!‚Äù, laughs and starts shouting me. I killed him easily, but it was actually fun‚Äînot just putting bullets in dumb things. 
---
Another time when I was low level a bunch of high level mutants attacked my camp. I hoped that hiding behind my locked door would save me. It didn‚Äôt. They yelled threats and eventually blew apart my walls, then stood there and laughed as they murdered me. 
---
These things aren‚Äôt groundbreaking, but they stood out in contrast to how repetitive most of the action can be. 
---
How are they broken? My real life repair skill is high...
---
It's the best reason to use VATS, You can close your eyes and fire.
---
I like playing solo the most. I'd say playing with one friend would be the ideal situation. Also add NPCs.
---
I'm DeadPowerPoint
---
&gt;Hard to remain in denial after today :( it‚Äôs all to obvious now.....so sad
---
Reddit is quick to over exaggerate on their feelings and assumptions about something as you are doing. Beside the atomic shop plug all I saw was them making attempts to fix things. 
---
A great quote from a popular post last week: you are not the "average" player of this game. The fact is, the 18,000 people on this subreddit are not a representative sample of FFOO players. This sub is a tiny, a teeny-tiny percent of everybody that plays the game. You all should know it.
---
"giving up" implies they made any sort of effort in the first place.
---
 Not a thing I have thought about. I see you have that well in hand. ;)
---
I‚Äôm certainly among the CAMP taking a break from the game. It wasn‚Äôt something I planned, but I have very little incentive to return any time soon. Haven‚Äôt picked it up since mid-December. Same with all my friends.
---
The onus to build enthusiasm is with Bethesda, they aren‚Äôt some small start up. Consumers have to hold these companies accountable by choosing when and with whom to spend thier hard earned money. I‚Äôm a die hard Fallout fan, &amp; wish them nothing but success but I cannot condone shady business and lackluster production.
---
IDK if they'll put more into Austin after this. If anything I'd say the opposite. This has gone so poorly in so many ways lol.
---
ROTFLMFAO
---
Exactly! The Supermutants are the perfect ones to have this kind of stuff because they are still Human enough to be assholes and creative assholes make MMOs interesting.
---
But you know it before buying the game . It's not a surprise !! They wanna a PvP or coop game on servers not persistent.  You can't buy a game who tell you what you will have in and say oh shit I prefer to have this instead. Like buying a FPS and asking for a STR  
---
FO76 AS  enough issue no need to add some self-made issue. 
---
I think it would be left alone since it‚Äôs not ruining anything but every other post on the forums is looking for that gear.
---
I don‚Äôt see what age has to do with anything.
---
I tend to wear t51b or t60. I have BoS initiate paint. If I could get a higher rank paint I'd probably just wear t60
---
 I ain't drowning in anything. I sure as hell don't look at my games as an investment, do you know what that word means?
---
"Later this month" also makes me sad. It's gonna be small changes that take way too long to put out again.
---
Bro you -emote- in your comments. Sit down boy.
---
[This happens way too often](https://imgur.com/f2G4Fa8)
---
You are literally the idiot I was talking about. I hope you have already pre ordered Starfield. 
---
I've been dumping them in paper bags right in front of the vendor.  Never occurred to me to put them in a world container.  Good idea!
---
I thought this should've been single player with a co-op or multiplayer expansion. Like more end game loot and skills could be earned by banding with up to say 8 players to kill the Scortchbeast or even build a fort and stave off waves of enemies like Scortched, robots or raiders.
---
You lose caps whenever you die from pvp.
---
That's it.
---
I've been killing him with three or four swings from my All rise with 13 strength and 3 points in slugger for a long time. What perks are you using?
---
I meant they can add text chat to the game.
---
OK!  - sits down -  I only emote in response to retarded comments ;)   lol. Reddit tough guys, on posts about video games. Hilarious 
---
This whole Reddit is filled with toxic whiners.  I came on here to find building advice, and all I can see is literall internet tears.  Guess I'll try YouTube.  
---
Not really no but if I found you in game I would love to constantly hunt you down as you sound like one of those players who abuses sentinel armor ruining pvp for anyone who doesn't have a vats crit based build
---
Currently the only real difference is as you say,  carry weight on the excavator (+200 with shocks) and maintenance cost. 
---
T51 is pretty maintenance intensive as afaik it requires screws but it‚Äôs the best pure damage resistance of the basic pre war models
---
T60 is easy maintenance and the most rad resistance of the pre war models as you just need ally and steel and its currently the only model that supports the bos skins.
---
T45 I think is supposed to be an all rounder but I‚Äôve not stepped inside any t45 since my mid level 20‚Äôs so I can‚Äôt recall it‚Äôs maintance fee. Usually mods for t45 turn up more often in the open world. 
---
Ultracite is reportedly high maintenance and the mods aren‚Äôt an easy find and paint customisation wise there‚Äôs nada
---
And the x01 makes you look like a mirelurk.
---
Some more reasons to vary would be nice, currently I rock 60 because I have the bos skin and the maintenance costs are easy. But if I wanted to minmax I‚Äôd probably be rocking excavator or x01 like the rest of any given server.
---
I‚Äôd certainly like the +100 carry weight to be a default accross all the models, given it‚Äôs a suit of nuclear powered armour I‚Äôd expect the boost to carry capacity. 
---
As for unique bonuses, I‚Äôd rather each armour set had some unique mods that only that armour supports to give some forced variety. But the way the meta is right now, there would be a ‚Äúbest setup‚Äù and we‚Äôd end up with what we have now without some balance testing. 
---
That's kinda the point I'm making, it's not in anyway a fair PvP system if you get punished for killing a bounty or defending a wotkshop
---
The theme of the inside the vault is rest and relaxation. Im sure its no concidence. 
---
Quit a while ago and no regrets better things to spend money on
---
See that, that is something I could get behind
---
It‚Äôs an investment of time. You could be making money with those hours you play this game, but instead you play this game. I‚Äôm guessing you use as a way to relax and enjoy yourself. You‚Äôre sacrificing (investing) time that could be used any other way for a game because you enjoy it. 
---
That is literally the definition of the word investment. In case your googling skills are as stunted as your logic:
---
From google
---
&gt;&gt; an act of devoting time, effort, or energy to a particular undertaking with the expectation of a worthwhile result.
---
No Problem
---
I mean prediction as applied to many fields is often backed by statistics and reliable within certain boundaries. This isn't that sort of prediction but don't throw stats under the bus like that. 
---
3 hits.  Grognak. Easy.

The world ocean
---
Testing with a friend some time ago they became more invisible and less like a glass figure of themselves.
---
The reason MHW was easier to solo is that when you play solo, monster difficulty is set to one person. But the moment someone joins (even before they actually show up in game) the difficulty jumps up to 4 people, regardless of how many players are there.
---
I didn't realize all those boxes of loot were from other players.  Like a dumby I assumed they just...spawned there?  I just started two days ago.  Now I'm having arguments with my 7 year old about "who's turn it is to play vidya games" every night.
---
 I never use VATS, never have in thousands of 3D Fallout hours. I figure I get about half of my Lever Actions hip fired shots into her. I can bring a level 50 down fairly quickly by myself, although the Sword is the finisher usually.
---
Thats what i expected the first multiplayer fallout but they really fucjed it up. I feel just one more year of developement wouldve made it a bit more crisp but they couldnt even do that
---
And reference how were asleep at the switch too with rest and relaxation week
---
ahh..nice..i need some chameleon wwr sentinel armour
---
Don't forget the cat house. Its very close to Morgantown hs
---
Sorry but I too am giving up. It's just boring now. 
---
Cause you can see through the BS and everyone else is an idiot. Gotcha.
---
You mean the events people complain about not being worth the time? Or the legendaries people complain about not even dropping?
---
The PvE feedback loop for this game is busted, removing slap damage and player killing won't fix that. You think people will enjoy killing SBQ for a vampiric rolling pin more just because no one is off demolishing their camp?
---
When youve got a whole team of devs a patch should have more than a fixed timer and loot list for the scorchbeast. That should be a single bullet on a list of patches.
---
Even if none of this comes to fruition, it was a good read, and a nice reminder of some of the designs over the years. Variety is good.
---
Also, I‚Äôve mentioned this before on some 76 sub but... when did people forget how to wear a bandana to keep the sweat out of their eyes and decide collectively that everyone should be a train robbing bandit? I‚Äôd love the ability to choose to wear your bandana on your forehead again or if that‚Äôs too hard to impliment for some reason, then a side variant of bandana that you can wear on your forehead.
---
I don't destroy bases and I do not harass other players. I help alot more than you could imagine. I even give lower levels useful items. Even legendary items as well. I really do wish the pvp servers would come, cuz factory raiding is the only upperhand we get at pvp, cuz It isn't really practical to hit a player and await him to hit back to start the pvp. Esp. if you are a ranged player vs. a melee user. It is always a win for the other guy, unless that player is alot weaker. Most factory raiders, including myself don't bother if it is a low level player. It is only fun when you attack a player at your own level. 
---
As for the irony for a raider to make such a post. Well, someone has to say it. I only wrote this because I see so many people complaining about being griefed. I figured i could share ways to avoid it hoping that I could help others.
---
The main difference is the mutation will work while standing the armor only works while crouching 
---

---
Ooh that sounds kinda fun. Maybe I‚Äôll message you when I‚Äôm on later and come check it out, maybe make the move. I found a spot I like a lot, but I need neighbors! My gamer tag is HourlyCoot

You can get them from the distant thunder event or treasure maps they are extremely rare though!
---
Well I have reached end game without getting to level 50, I was level 45, so honestly that wouldn't be fair to some. I honestly can careless if low levels are hiding, ect. I am now level 90 and before I got some weapons that help kill the SBQ I fought off the enemies that were attacking players trying to kill the SBQ, yeah I took my shots when she landed since my melee did more damage. I honestly wouldn't attempt going over there until my quest had me do it.
---
Glad to hear these are actually helping people. I've always wondered what happens to my plans. I've also started throwing them into Overseer's caches in low level areas. Along with US Military Requisition holos. I also try to track down level people and ask them if they just started so I can gift them stuff. Most players who are on alts do say they don't need it so I'm glad it's helping newbies out.
---
Eh, just thinking of a lot of those youtube or kauto(?) posts that are basically just reading reddit posts verbatim.
---
THANKS for the information.
---
One hit instigating fire axe
---
Ah, thanks for the tip. Didn't realize how rare they were since I got the Excavator and Ultracite pretty quickly.
---
The whole PvP system is garbage lol
---
Games journalists that crap out opinion pieces without research get equal respect to games developers who crap out money grabs without testing.

First thing I thought when seeing that pic: Tank Girl.

Don't bank too much on endgame or functional pvp if you're going to play ESO. Remember, Zenimax Media owns both Zenimax Online Studios *and* Bethesda. You get the same treatment there. For some credibility, know that I played ESO since March 2013 and only quit with the latest Murkmire DLC. Their endgame PVE content is a complete faceroll unless you do Veteran/Hardmode content, which is just recycled mechanics in a different order (not new mechanics, nothing unique about the fights, just the same ideas they've been using over and over for 4 years with a different skin). Which, coincidentally adequately describes their business model as well, and everything they offer in the Crown Store (reskins of the same junk, etc). 
---
OP mentioned that they don't address issues in FO76 and instead just "go buy this in the Atom Shop, you'll buy anything!" .... Welcome to ESO, friend. You may find it ironic that I actually quit ESO *for* FO76 thinking I'd escape that crap. But, sad as it is today (and for how much time I played ESO), there are bugs that I experienced in the *beta* for ESO that *are still present in the game.* Don't bother with Cyrodiil either. It's been virtually unplayable since launch. Yes, I'm serious. No, it's not an exaggeration. 
---
For a better understanding of why you should take my advice and move on to a different developer/publisher altogether: I managed a social guild that catered to players in the bottom 98% of players (e.g. not your score-pushing leaderboard elitist streamers, which is precisely who makes *all* relevant decisions in the game). Note that ESO does not have a solid QA team, they've recently "lost" (more likely fired, due to Murkmire) their lead writer *and* lead combat designer, and the #1 contributor to rebalance (which only happens about once per year) is half a dozen twich streamers with large followings. That's right, Twitch streamers decide what's best for the game based on their personal experience, which for what it's worth, is a great deal of experience, but nowhere near qualified to speak for the masses in a game like ESO. 
---
You can hopefully understand why after 4 years I felt compelled to share the reality of the situation, but if not feel free to ignore my comments. ESO and FO76 follow the same structure. They were both released preemptively, they both had massive fallouts in the fan base immediately after launch, they both routinely break things they either already fixed or that were working perfectly fine with every patch they release. Couple that with the smash-my-keyboard-because-I'm-so-mad level of endgame content that only 1% of the playerbase can even complete (unless 15 minute no-brain button mashing completions with zero worthwhile rewards is your thing) and how they devote most of their revenue to making unoriginal and overpriced vanity items in the cash shop, and you're bound to quit playing, just like the *hundreds* of players I've seen just personally sign up and quit, never to return again, within 1-2 months of purchase.
---
Oh yeah, and ZOS doesn't give free respecs when they decide to completely rework the classes and races in the game, either. If you intend to sub, buy it a month at a time on the off chance that you disagree with me after playing. Otherwise, expect to drop around $200 just to have access to today's content. /endrant
---
Hey don‚Äôt be so critical guys. 
---
They added a TIMER to be attack. 
---
We‚Äôre lucky to get even that at this point. 
---
It would have been considerably better if they spent more time polishing it and didn‚Äôt release it broken.
---
Don't worry about it. If people don't see time as an investment it means their time is worthless.
---
smart man
---
They shouldn't be advertising a god dammed thing until their game is fixed let's be honest, man. You need to be a smarter consumer. 
---
This is the best unintentional roast ever.
---
WoW was a fucking mess for months after launch. Not saying it‚Äôs the same thing, but you can‚Äôt expect a companies first attempt at something to go perfect, even months later. 
---
Perspective mostly. 
---
The game is a forest fire. People expect something more than just  things that should have been hotfixed months ago. The Queen loot should have been fixed a long time ago as well.
---
Wyf is it going to be until Sunday?
---
One day i waited in front of the vault for a new player to come out. Hooked him up with a bunch of plans and gave him a few guns. He is much more prepared for this cold fo76 world. Make me feel good helping out a fellow fallouter if thats even a term lol 
---
cat lady house in the savage divide
---
It really is pretty funny :D
---
Cyrodiil PvP is actually very fun, just find a guild. 
---
PvP rarely effects anytime I play. I have ran into a few but honestly they don't bother me. I rarely have junk on me, unless they catch me at the right time, and barely have caps, which are pretty easy to get when I need the caps. My C.A.M.P is just a free fast travel, repairs and storage for me and sometimes I use the resources if I am low on certain ones.

West michigan is with out power

Um, what do you think survivors ate FIRST? Answer: the pepperoni rolls!
---
i see..not much of a difference really
---
I'd say read a book or go over at a friend's house or something :/ not much you can do sadly without power unless you either have a backup generator or mobile gaming consoles thag have good battery 
---
Its not about being visible or not theres a value in game that quantifies your visibility to enemies.
---
Counts on your build... No one can really answer this question
---
Scorched Beast King
---
Organise a d&amp;d session (other roleplay games are available at friendly local gaming stores) 
---
Play some tabletop war games (40k, flames or war, battletech if you can find anyone over 40)
---
Read a book. Discworld is a decent read. 
---
Board games. Good ones. Pandemic if you hate yourself.
---
&gt;DONT bring a knife to a gunfight 
---
Which is funny because with the current state of weapons, in most cases the knife will win.
---
The original ITV was on Tuesdays. Then they pushed it to Wednesdays because they were running behind. Then Thursdays. That excuse ran its course.
---
I feel like this is something I would try to do at work to get away with slacking off at the office for a few hours. But this is a game development team and it's only real communication with its playerbase. 
---
 Well done. No I don't like that at all, in fact that's just strange. 
---
 We play games. PLAY, and really if you think you need a return on you play, you are what I call entitled. ;) 
---
i see
---
Bold of you to assume i have freinds with power 
---
What like a IRL junk run going from house to house?
---
Get me some springs and ballistic fiber üëçüèª
---
I logged in for the first time in 2 weeks and I went to one of the railroad stations. I just went in to sell a few things and see what recipes or plans the vendor had
---
 As I was about to do so a level 152 ran in with a knife and stabbed the ever loving shit out of me as I was trying to get out of their. I'm level 21. I understand the game had PVP but not one of use before launch was like that sounds like fun. I just want to explore like I do in every other Fallout. I still can't believe you cant play offline like most survival games. I played Conan Exile offline to get an understanding of it and spent alot of time exploring. That's all I want. I hate how so many games need you to be connected online at all times.
---
How does build effect legendary effects?
---
Giving them more time gives them the excuse to continue doing what they're doing. If you want change best bet is to not play the cursed thing.
---
But yeah im trying to firgure out something thats not gonna bore me to death
---
Maybe they're all sitting around the dumpster fire and just don't wanna put it out.
---
I read the original post. It asked what type of loot, other than legendaries, feel rewarding?
---
**L E G E N D A R I E S**
---
Period. I'm good on stimpacks, junk, don't use stupid chems, bobbles or magazines, have plenty of ammo and most plans. Legendaries are the rewarding loot or its garbage. 
---
Dude would you mind hooking up a fellow ps4 fo76 player? 
---
I can vouch for this, if you solo nuke the fissure to spawn the queen like, 5 people who vary from level 120 - 200 will port over to you, like, 93% of the time 
---
I've got my 100+ hours out of it, so regardless of how difficult of a time Bethesda is having at getting it balanced and patched, I still feel like my time spent was worth it. I played with friends, we did some neat stuff and had fun while doing it. It's not a perfect game by any stretch, it might eventually be fixed, it might not be, but I'll continue holding out hope that Bethesda will eventually get it right and finally make multiplayer in their games the best it can be, which is the only thing, imo, that Bethesda games are missing, because they would be great fun to play with friends. A 2-4 player co-op TES or Fallout game is just fine by me, so let them learn from their mistakes here. And after all, it's not like Bethesda has a lot of experience in the multiplayer field anyway, so live and learn.
---
I honestly haven't seen it, every server I am on is basically full. I know people claim they aren't playing anymore and some aren't. I am on PS4 and there are times my friends and I have to switch servers because we can't join the server one of us are on.
---
Hindsight 20/20.
---
You know its bad when walmart shuts down
---
No like go to a friend's house to play with nerf guns or something that doesn't involve power is what I meant 
---
"I‚Äôm not sure how Bethesda is going to fix the game, to put it bluntly. And it‚Äôs becoming less clear whether Bethesda itself has an effective plan for how such a thing might be possible. "  
---
They'll fix it by applying proper quality-assured patches in accordance with solid game design.  
---
Now, whether they do or not... we don't know.  But they fixed Skyrim and they fixed FO4, so...
---
[It looks like Guild Wars 2 has had 9 updates since January 11.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates)
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing in giving them more time. Not playing. Giving it more time before I play again. 
---
I just uninstalled the launcher and selected the option to delete all game data and this motherfucker is STILL there.
---
Delete the fucker manually.
---
Good luck on your spiritual journey brother 
---
The fact that you compare Apex to Fallout 76 clearly shows that you have absolutely no clue what you're talking about when it comes to game development.  
---
  
---
Doesn't make Fallout 76 any less trash though.
---
Could be worse. You could be flooded and have crocks swimming in your front yard üëÄ
---
Seems like most players took your advice. Hell, most gamers in general. 
---
I personally feel that my primed gatling plasma lays down way more damage in a queen fight ( luck of the draw and weapon artisan are a must have though) vs my primed gatling Balstic. 
---
I chew though a lot more ammo so thats the trade off in my eyes.
---
We have flooding next the 6 in of snow is melting 
---
I was playing last night on ps4, with 6 other random, we got the queen down to 80%.then failed the quest. It seems like bethesda nerfed all my guns.
---
Most of the group was 100+ lv, with me and some guy being lvl 60.
---
I'm having this same problem, 2 months later.
---
Nothing works the way it should. Nothing.
---
That would be cool, a Super Mutant also
---
Well characters should be stuck to the servers they' were **created** on without any possible way to transfer items from one server to another.
---
I know this isn't happening with the future survival server though, which is nonsense at its best.
---
Sadly the damage drop off with the 50 is severe at higher levels where everything is rocking armour. 
---
If you plan on keeping that cannon I‚Äôd invest in the perks for it, or you‚Äôll be using  80 bullets to kill something you could polish off with three from a lever action. 
---
Co-op is better than bad pvp. Good pvp though, who knows? Never experienced it before in a fallout game. Could be good.
---
This is not a circlejerk. This is a dumpster fire of a game that instead of improving with patches, just gets worse.  
---
I bought it on prerelease, been a Bethesda customer since 1994, but stop bloody defending these people. The fucked up big time with Fallout 76 and so far they show absolutely no signs of realizing what a huge pile of garbage they made people pay at least $60 for.
---
I have multiple bobbleheads. But only because I have not used any of them. Just can't seem to get used to not collecting bobbleheads.
---
Played 230 hours maybe 10 times
---
15 strength and a blades mole miner gauntlet. The Grafton monster is super easy to kill. 
---
Cunts will be cunts.
---
Thanks for your input! As for the increased weight for all armors, the frame already gives +10 strength which increases carry weight. While I agree there's probably be some "best armor" I think adding bonuses to each set would add more diversity to builds than take it away. Like if you're a sniper then you'd probably just take Excavator for nuke zones and extra carry weight, but if you're Melee with perks in chems, you might find the Raider armor better.
---
I also don't want to make it so that power armor is absolutely needed. The legendary effects only available on regular armor still need to offer value. I'm tinking more for the type of player who likes to make their builds themselves though, rather the type that google the absolute best perks for using whatever their weapon of choice is.
---
Let's say you run a bloodied build, you would want unyielding, PvP gun build you would want sentinel, sneaky sniper you would want weightless or chameleon, melee PvP cavalier assassin.... That's just the basic combinations, many more are out and about
---
I've played online games decades now. Very few were released in a state as bad as FO76, and those few had major patches and fixes within 4 months. 
---
**You're just wrong.** 
---
This is a blatant lie.
---
I did not have more than a few hundred of any given item, and I was banned.
---
Some are worse than others, mine had a bracket broken off that could easily be glued and repainted.
---
Others had broken visors and some even had exploded batteries and battery acid. But on the other hand alot were also completely fine so, I hope your luck is high too
---
I can‚Äôt imagine power armor not giving you carry weight bonus plus others. The whole concept of powered armor is to protect the soldier and make him more effective in combat. By default that men‚Äôs improving his capability.  As a minimum complete sets should give the following;
---
T45 - +25 carry weight, +1 strength 
---
T51 - +50 carry weight, +1 strength, +1 agility
---
T60 - +75 carry weight, +1 strength, +1 agility, +1 charisma
---
X01 - +75 carry weight, +2 strength, +2 agility, -1 charisma, +1 luck
---
Excavator +100 carry weight, -1 intelligent, +2 strength, -1 Charisma
---
The logic behind the minus numbers... X01 has an intimidating appearance so you scare people. Excavator is not soldier armor, it was created to make stronger laborers. You don‚Äôt have to be popular nor smart to be a drone laborers (according to management of course).
---
I think having laser guns that can be modded as a rifle or a pistol was a god awful choice on Bethesda's part, but that's neither here nor there. Laser guns are currently completely garbage. They don't hit anything very hard and break way too fast. I've done okay damage with one that was automatic but the durability was so bad it wasn't redeemable. With big guns some of them are just plain pathetic, I'm speaking to you minigun and lmg! Gatling plasma would be good if it wasn't for how easily it breaks. I haven't used a Gatling laser on 76. With guns in general it'd be nice if the base weapons were stronger and less reliant on a perfect set of legendary effects. Meh 
---
That's not going to happen, most of these people don't want to actual fair fight because they'll lose.  That's why they do what they do.
---
Reddit is the biggest defender of the game and Bethesda ....  having players is really beside the point .... the game is a big bag of bugs that somehow gets bigger every day that passes...and the Devs look to be not concerned. I admire your optimism....mine has dwindled after today.
---
Wait it does? 
---
*breathing intensifies*
---
Are you on ps4? 
---
Ok but what are all the choices? You listed a few there. Not all combinations just all the effects.
---
Good it‚Äôs mine 
---
Hard to tell who you are talking to. Honestly if you are still defending this sham of a $60 title you‚Äôre probably in the idiot category. Let me know how you feel with the downvote button friend. 
---
Shit really?
---
Old people don't actually talk like that, kid.  If you're gonna lie, at least put some effort in.
---
So this highlighted 2 fixes that aren't even completely fixing the problem and not until later in the month? Are they contracting bug fixes off fiver?
---
that is true but with ammosmith you can literally make THOUSANDS of .50 rounds which was my point I guess.
---
The inside the vault articles are supposed to be an avenue by which the developers can inform us about their thought processes going into the game. I think people are upset by the fact that this week boiled down to the equivalent of two simple lines in the patch notes. 
---
that is true but I am thinking about it from a economical stand point as well .50 rounds with ammosmith are nothing.
---
what? no my dude :))
---
I can't, I sprained my wrist and can't play, but once I'm not in pain I will be on. It will take a few days.
---
I mean it's kind of mainstream to hate on this game. And for a reason.
---
You say ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù as if it‚Äôs useless or meaningless. In fact, it is [necessary for survival for many species - especially humans](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beastly-behavior/201705/why-play-is-important%3famp) 
---
When you ‚ÄúPlay,‚Äù you are engaging in a mental activity that is necessary for proper mental health. It‚Äôs necessary for relieving stress and anxiety. Playing releases endorphins and serotonin which actively reduce cortisol (the stress hormone) in our brains. 
---
So yeah, you can keep replying with reductive arguments that make you look like an idiot. But you‚Äôre literally arguing against science. But don‚Äôt let me stop you; I think we‚Äôre all enjoying your little show. 
---
that is why I plan on taking every level to over repair weapons and armor.
---
Imagine a game being so bad that the specific subreddit designed as a safe space to praise a massive flop turns on said game as well.
---
wonder if the reason that they are FINALLY fixing this is because someone is threating to sue for causing them seizures with the non-stop flashing of light from those fuckers
---
I mean yes, I would want to chase you down and put a 2mm metal slug through your skull, but thats just because I am kind of nuts.
---
But seriously the problem with your argument is that it is completely against everything we are shown of pre-war America. By the time of the Great War, the US government is essentially a fascist regime. Chinese are rounded up and sent to internmemt camps, where they are left to rot or be shipped off to be experimented on. There is a sense of enforced hyper patriotism, where *suspected* communist sympathizers are disappeared, hippie protesters are gunned down, the military and science industries routinely abduct and experiment on innocent american citizens, towns are quarantined and deliberately infected with highly mutagenic viruses, and freaking canada is annexed, with the prime minister executed in the streets.
---
And somehow, the average american citizen still sees communism and china as a greater threat. To them, there is no good chinese, and communism is the very definition of failure.
---
On the other hand, we can wear fucking mole rat mascot suits so who really cares about story cohesion or immersion?
---
Your very own little poorly made Fallout 4 multiplayer mod.
---
You're going strawman here and switching to a completely different argument. No one is denying PvE needs fixing, which is a completely separate issue.
---
I have rank 3 weapon artisan the durability is still garbage 
---
Do any of the people complaining have any idea if how cumbersome it is to make changes to software in a corporate environment?  If they can patch even 1 thing a week it is a miracle.
---
This has been known since beta, yet gets posted at least once every day.
---
I'm comparing a game on day 1 vs another game 4 months in. Yes I know they are nothing alike engine or game style.... My point is a company can release a free to play game with a huge user base on day one with pretty much ZERO issues.  I really don't see FO76 reaching a polished bug free state. At this point I can anticipate every content release to be accompanied by it's own batch of bugs/glitches.  I've been a end user gamer for 30 years now... I have never played a game where I thought "they are not going to be able to ever fix this" until now. 
---
Sorry for my lack of understanding in game development. 
---
Dude literally no one cares if you play or not. 
---
"Goodbye" post are equal parts annoying (because they clog up the sub with nothing of value) and pathetic (because anyone making one is doing it solely for attention).
---
And today's ITV is why I came home from work and uninstalled the game. Good luck to those who hang around.
---
Bye
---
If you have cell service and unlimited data there are a lot of good mobile games out üôÉ

WoW is still a fucking mess. Much like Bethesda, Blizzard is failing to address the real issues. 
---
Shitty Azerite system? Shitty forced personal loot? Shitty character progression? Shitty forced AP farming? Shitty class design?
---
Shitty raid? Actually, they fixed this one, but that was bound to happen. The rest still hasn't been fixed and likely won't until 9.0. 
---
Now that I think about it, Bethesda has taken more steps in the right direction than Blizzard lately. ü§î
---
Most of the people who say the never met griefers are HIGH level players. Griefers are bitches who prey on those weaker than them.

---
&gt;People would still be out doing events, farming for legendaries dropping and doing everything they're doing now.
---
So PvE needs fixing but PvE servers will be a good thing because people will still be out and about doing the PvE (which needs fixing)?
---
Yeah, they totally ruined WoW, 12 million active users Its height is the best sign of failure I‚Äôve ever seen. 
---
Imagine people do sad that they have to try and incite a lynch mob over an underwhelming but otherwise innocuous weekly community rep blog post.
---
so true
---
ok....and that is a big issue how? I carry multiple weapons and have level 2 bandolier. I understand the durability needs to be improved but that is like saying if your tommy gun jammed you wouldn't pull your 1911.
---
What does Sharting mean?
---
Expel feces accidentally when breaking wind. (I love that its actually under  dictionary when i googled it.)
---
It was a joke Sheldon. Low brow dad humor. The kind my wife doesn't like but gives my kids a chuckle. 
---
They said they patch notes would include notes and explanations to what the developers thoughts on why they made changes.
---
Is this a patch note? No. 
---
People are upset because they are entitled spoiled brats that are stupid.
---
I see a lot of people asking for powered up end game boss versions of things we already have, but I honestly don't see why they can't all be unique. Mirelurk empress, super mutant goliath, deathclaw prototype, butterfly man, ect.
---
What I really don't like about the SBQ is that she's basically a retextured Scorchbeast, she's just attacking one guy at a time for most of it. We need a boss that is after multiple players at once, get some different tactics in. 
---
My comment was mostly in response to the edits and the last paragraph.   It's true , hating on this game is pretty mainstream.  However,  the OP ' clapping back'. In under 5 min after supposedly turning notifications off made the comment worth it for me .
---
Well, maybe not *this* player base.
---
Not true. Bethesda claims there are "millions playing regularly", which some believe to be false. But just for argument's sake we will say there are 2 million people playing at any given time ( I assume this to be much lower). A sample size of approximately 16500 people would give you 99% certainty with a 1% margin of error. So, the fact is, 18000 people is a perfect representation of the player base.
---

---
Im kinda branching out from the main subject but, the problem with in 76 is not how well pvp would work or not, simply because most people playing this game are PVErs.
---
 
---
You could make the most well thought out PVP system in the world if people are not playing the game with the intention to partake in it from the get go, they will not participate ever.
---
Its simply putting a "game mode" for an audience that isn't their main one. 
---
PVErs, when it comes to 76 should without surprise outnumber by a vast margin people who come here with the sole intention to play this as a typical pvp open world games in the likes of GTAO, ARK or whatever fits the example.
---
 This is just not gonna work, even if 76 was bug free . 
---
Seriously though, I was so mad when I found the corpse and she looked NOTHING like the mugshot.
---
I was expecting Queen loot to be hotfixed on the first 2 weeks lol. Not giving me different PLANS after 3 months. PLANS!?
---
Oh and why are energy, heavy, explosive guns still breaking after 4 minutes lol wtf.
---
Good on you op
---
The newsletter wasn‚Äôt the patch notes, when patch 6 drops it‚Äôll be more than just the change to scorch-beasts.
---
Other than this week‚Äôs letter being short I don‚Äôt really see the problem with today in particular.
---
Imagine thinking that posting a quick reply on reddit is anything akin to a lynch mob.
---
I carry 4 guns with me of different ammo types. I rarely have to repair any of them. These guns break 10x faster than my other guns and aren't anywhere near as effective. They're not worth carrying 
---
^ GREAT GAME
---
See, at the minute it‚Äôs kinda the opposite. I feel. Power armours absolutely not needed. 
---
Except maybe in nuke zones because nobody wants six thumbs and they want to carry out 300 tonnes of flux.
---
Legendary effect armor trumps power armour all day long. Granted it‚Äôs luck and rng to get it, but sentinel bloodied and vanguard sets are what has this forum excited in the pants department. Rarely do I see someone excited about power armour unless they‚Äôre role playing. 
---
And yes power armour is SUPPOSED to buff your strength. Except if you‚Äôve put all 15 points into str. Where it actually then limits it. Right now, unless you‚Äôve been lucky enough to find shocks for your pa, you‚Äôre probably able to carry far more sewing pockets onto your leather thong and matching elbow pads than in your walking tank suit. And that feels wrong somehow. 
---
I agree something needs to be done I‚Äôm just not sure you‚Äôd find raiders rocking raider armour for the Chems boost, when the ‚Äúraiders‚Äù I mostly encounter tend to favour whatever will let all rise swing the fastest. 
---
Bos In lore tend to favour laser rifles and energy weapons but the state of play at the mo has energy weapons in the bin.
---
Enclave sounds about right tbh. They do like plasma. 
---
The other two sets are quite pre war and not really associated with a faction beyond the United States armed forces. A boost to ballistics or explosive damage maybe. 
---
I thought that was weird too. What plans? Serum plans are the only thing I can think of since they moved the ultracite pa plans of her. What plans are dropping is the least of my concerns.
---
I have to disagree in terms of crowd control and sweep and clears they melt down rooms worths of enemies.
---
I am convinced at this point they are just hoping we'll lose interest with the game and move on to something else so that they don't have to work on it anymore. Their communication is a joke, their ITV is a joke, the progress they have made since launch is a joke. I just don't think they care.
---
They drop decent shit. Killed one from atop a fence pillar in whitesprings. He couldn‚Äôt hit me so I just stood there and bashed him in the forehead with my rifle butt 
---
What melts down rooms worth of enemies? I'm talking about laser guns. 
---
Raises uncomfortable implications that what we think of as "conscious thought" is simply lines of code.
---
I would assume it stacks but doubt it works for beast or queens 
---
Well sorry I clogged your feed then I guess. I just wanted to warn others about this bug that just made me stop playing for the night cause I voided all my ammo.
---
You say that. It is when you‚Äôre chunking 50 to kill a single level 65 scorched. Steel and lead become increasingly a chore to keep stockpiles of when you‚Äôre feeding a 50. 
---
Conversely .45 grows on trees.
---
Yeah it's not fun fighting really in the first place the you have people with like a unyielding instating groknak axe or rifle or really anything along those lines, it's real unbalanced. I wouldn't mind legendary armour if I was only on effect tbh
---
I take a workshop then team up with someone. I am flagged for pvp since I own a workshop. Can anyone who has pacifist off engage me in pvp then? What about my teammate, is he/she flagged for pvp since I am too?
---
Lol. That's awesome. I can only imagine one screaming in their deep growly voice, "ow! My head!"
---
I figured it out. You can't connect generators to any devices like lamps directly. You have to connect a cable from the generator to a power connector. Then a cable from the power connector to the device...
---
... Except in the case of devices mounted to structures: let's say you have a light bulb hanging from the ceiling of your shack. Your power connector can be anywhere on that surface, whether on the underneath side or the top side and power will be automatically distributed to all devices on either side of the surface -- as long as you have a generator connected to the power connector. So I put a generator and a connector on the roof of my shack, connected them, then put light bulbs on the ceiling inside. The light bulbs automatically turn on without needing any additional cabling. 
---
The devs are lazy and incompetent, if the post about Bethesda Austin is true, nothing is going to change and this game will be a permanent scar on Bethesda's rep. The game is going to die ( more than it already has ) and boy howdy I can't wait for the waste to be cleared and laugh at every single game Bethesda makes ( and other Triple A' companies ) receiving infinitely more scrutinization from now on because of their fucking incompetence. 
---
Yes, you're so wise for living your life like a nihilistic douche.
---
‚Ä¶...you get more .50 with ammosmith than .45......and lead and steel is easy with the excavator power armor....I currently have thousands of each.
---
Having visited this sub daily since launch and comparing the changes being made in the patches with the vocalizations of the community, I can say with certainty that Bethesda is hearing us, but they really don't care.
---
That have a plan for Fallout 76 and it doesn't include the fans of the Fallout series.
---
Yes sir.
---
Nobody cares 
---
I can make speed demon and marsuipial, bring me the materials and ill charge u 250 caps each
---
Sorry thought u wanted serums
---
Do they not have ideas so they are asking us? 
---
Same can be said about your reply. Why even reply ?
---
I want recipes
---
 I'm 72 and video games are my hobby have been for years. 
---
 I do think the young these days are going to have problems when things don't work out, as they get so fucking incensed over a video game and its bugs. That's not especially healthy.
---
 The crap you dredged up is not really applicable to my lack of appreciation of your investment attitude but hey. 
---
 If you say so. ;)
---
No word on making "pip-boy is unavailable" characters playable. unfortunate really
---
I meant more that .45 is a common open world drop. .50 is not. You passively gain a lot of .45, usually way more than you use. Unless you‚Äôre using the smg.  But .50 is quite rare as an open world drop. You‚Äôre basically crafting it or you don‚Äôt get it. 
---
That said you make a valid point a about excavator most likely. I live in a suit of t60 so I don‚Äôt have quite the same benefit.
---
To hopefully try to get people to stop making these posts they are filling my feed
---
&gt;*Fallout 4 sold huge numbers too*
---
I think that's a common misconception to link Fallout 4 streamlining to it's commercial success for two reasons: 
---
1) Most of the audience was presented to Bethesda games by Skyrim, Fallout 4 success was the result of a long climb initiated by Morrowind, but only got general attention in TESV.
---
2) Fallout 4 [pre-order/release sales were off the charts](https://www.ibtimes.com/fallout-4-sales-record-breaking-12-million-copies-worth-750-million-sold-launch-2183997), which indicates buyers were ***already*** interested in the game, probably because the point above.
---
&gt;  *Let's not pretend Skyrim's writing was anything but garbage.* 
---
I wouldn't call it garbage, but it ain't good either (it was also written by Pagliarulo btw). The thing is Fallout trademark was being about a ***player-driven story***, in which the main appeal was the reactive gameplay and multiple solutions to quests, alongside the moral implications of these choices.  The writing in Fallout was always top notch to back all this up.
---
The Elder Scrolls appeal (imho) was to present an immersive ***story/exploration-driven*** D&amp;D-like RPG. I dare to say that most people that sunk 200+ hours in it didn't even completed the main quest. I personally don't know a single person that did.
---
A weak writing in a Fallout game is a shot in the head, while the same in Elder Scrolls is bruise in the arm. 
---
Yeah this would pretty legit actually. Have another upvote. 
---
I have all serums available to craft on xbox mate
---
I just look at him and he falls over to his death, instigating super sledge. 
---
I...love the way you type. Leather thong üòÇ
---
But yeah getting the right armor will be the ultimate goal, but I'm the type of guy who likes using a railway rifle because it's fun even though the damage is ass. As for what armor gives what perks, I leave that begrudgingly up to Bethesda. Although T-51 could give a bonus to laser weapons (since his courses are in T-51 armor and you're right they do use lasers) and T-60 the heavy gun bonus I mentioned (they definitely used miniguns and laser gatlings too).
---
I mean, this kind of sums it up. The signature enemy in the game right now isn't fun to fight.
---
Honestly I couldn't care less. It would be annoying to have to find people who play because I don't know any personally IRL, but the lack of NPCs, engaging story, and ending are really what does it in for me.
---
It‚Äôs not laughable until you put it in the context I did originally....it was 1500! 
---
Hey what do you play on if you play on ps4 I can help if anything like that happens again 
---
Better.  But they don't use emojis, either.
---
Because making announcements like that too far ahead of time is a double edged sword.  For every person who is content with the information you have the rest of the mob who then uses it as a launching point to badger the devs every chance they get.
---
If you announce updates too far ahead there's no telling if there ends up being a bug that keeps you from releasing certain features on time or plans change and a feature ends up turning into something else.  You can't guarantee what is going to be in a patch and what form it's going to take until it's already done.  The reason this post specifically mentioned SBQ stuff isn't because it's the only stuff they've been working on, it's likely because that's the stuff they have done already and 100% know will be in the update.
---
This is why so many game devs have memes like "Soon^(TM)" when it comes to future updates and features.  they have to be ambiguous about this shit until it's ready to go
---
Hey , since you still seem to have notifications on could you answer a question for me ? How many hours do you think you've sunk into fo76? 
---
Over/under on how many people (on this subreddit) are familiar with that pop culture reference.
---
Thanks for replying on a month-old post. I figured mine out too. TL;DR: I was over budget. And for whatever reason, they don't tell you that you need budget (or that it's full) when trying to attach a wire.
---
Long version: I somehow had over 500 vegetables in storage. I've never even *owned* 500 vegetables. When I scrapped all of them, it overfilled my STASH too 711/600. When I tried bulking up mats to clear STASH space, my tinkering bench wouldn't work. No error, just nothing. So I manually dropped all my shit from STASH on the ground and finally it worked. Now I can finally try to attach the wire. Nope! Over budget! Sigh.
---
About 5 glitches in one.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be amazing if we had servers where workshops didn‚Äôt reset as often and so you would come across a fully built workshops where you could then add on your own additions to what‚Äôs already there while collecting the resources. 
---
I know there is some functionality of this because I‚Äôve come across a fully built up workshop and it was nice to have a base to work off of.
---
If the reset is daily now, it should be weekly 
---
I think the lack of content in the latest Inside the Vault makes it clear the Bethesda's done with this game.
---
So depart. The game is broken. Never going to Happy posts. Dislike posts so much Leave
---
Uses charisma *3.5?
---
Because they could care less about us, they already made their money off of us and could give less of a shit

r/FO76brotherhood or try r/FO76roleplay :)
---
I‚Äôve enjoyed 99% of the game solo playing it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think the game shines as a co-op. PvP isn‚Äôt even fun when you win lol....but their declaration that it can be played solo is pretty true from my experience so far, my first SBQ and Nuke launch was done with only one other teammate 
---
Not sure how a game survives bad developers. A bad game is a bad game.
---
Haha I don‚Äôt care how old you are. You act like a child when you‚Äôre opinion is proven problematic with facts. Actually, you‚Äôre a bit worse than a child. My 4 year old son handles being wrong miles better than you. 
---
Please, leave us ‚Äúyoung‚Äù to our game. At least we know why we play them, and don‚Äôt make up shit and argue semantics when we‚Äôre wrong. 
---
The game needs more behemoths and mega sloths. I ran into a behemoth at level 32 and spent like an hour fighting it, shooting, running, reloading. I finally killed it and even though I didn‚Äôt get anything it was a fun fight. Fuck some rad rats though, way too many hit points and too hard to hit. 
---
I love all the people on here just completely side tracked like "Yeah! I'd love more boss style events." While the game is still unplayable for many.
---
 I Think you unfortunately just got glitched, I‚Äôve looted a few and the drops are pretty good 
---
really, cause I replied directly to you, doesn't seem that hard... Honestly, if you're calling people stupid for liking something you don't, that makes you the asshole. Up/downvotes are irrelevant in this situation.
---
Should be a guaranteed 2-3 star max lvl loot. 
---
Fuck I didn't even think of that. I'm willing to bet it flew right over everyone's heads and out the window on this subreddit.
---
Buddy, after this flop, Fallout is sitting in indefinite limbo with Mass Effect. 76 may well be the last we see of Fallout for a long, *long* time.
---
I think pvp should stay in the game, but it should be punished a lot harder. It should be high risk, high reward. The whole game should have more persistence, including punishments for player killing.
---
Even if they need fixing, buffs, whatever, people still do them. PvP needs fixing as well and they're adding what basically amounts to PvP servers anyway with Survival. Either way, the servers are going to be split and the normal servers will most likely be left with just two types of people when the PvPers move to Survival- those of us who prefer the PvE aspect and griefers. I'd rather remove the latter.
---
For PvP to be a good mechanic the game needs to be balanced. This game is so far from being balanced it's ridiculous to think it'll get here anytime soon. PvP balance needs to be completely separate from pve balance. Honestly just remove all legendary effects in PvP and have power armor's durability act like it did in fallout 4 during PvP (where focusing on one part could relatively easily break it) and we'd have a nice starting point for balanced PvP. 
---
I‚Äôm aware but I still thought it was enjoyable running duos. It would have been nice had it scaled properly but I can‚Äôt complain considering how enjoyable that game was
---
I had 570lb of bulked junk in my stash box. I had a few things I wanted to scrap to max out my 600lb stash limit. So I scrapped all without thinking much about it, I've done it loads of times before though not recently. Then I realised for some dam reason it scrapped all my bulked stuff. I spent weeks getting enough plastic to bulk everything and then this happens. Im over encumbered to f*uck and can't do shi* so I logged out, uninstalled and walked away. Stuff that! 
---
The funny thing is I ran right up to him and called him out on his tactic.  He just relied with "nah man, I don't do pvp" so I asked why he was following around someone that would smash someone else's camp and got radio silence from both.  I continually congratulated them for blasting my house to shreds and their heroics on trying to punch me to death (3 stars blocker with power armor) at lvl 42 while refusing to fight back.  They left when I said that their mothers must be incredibly proud of their life choices.  I hope I hit a nerve there.
---
And you sound like a scrub low level that hasn‚Äôt farmed any good gear. Git gud scrub

Shut, not just heavy weapons, my Lever Rifle breaks faster than my Gauss does 
---
What is ITV?
---
Ah damn then. At least i know where I might find one to try again. 
---
I mean, there‚Äôs people I play with that I don‚Äôt know irl. Met them on TF2, discord servers, in the game itself...just gotta put yourself out there man. 
---
2/3 of the Nuke Zone was off the map so you could walk through it much. 
---
Fucking babies sinking the ship when some water got in the hull.
---
You also have to have your weapon out and the stealth is broken when you attack with the mutation. I personally prefer the armor, although the noise it makes when you enter stealth is irritating.
---
AAA game releasing and dying worse than a Korean F2P Cashgrab scheme....fun.
---
Not what I expect from Bethesda.
---
Don't you know? Being the most widely successful MMO in history means you're a failure!
---
I am in now way unreasonable or immature... I'm allowed to be upset at a game that is no better than it was in the BETA, I am allowed to be upset that a game I paid a good deal of money for, is in No way a completed project wherein nothing "Just Works"... 
---
I have defended the devs since the XB1 BETA... I have defended thus game on YouTube, and Reddit, I have defended it on twitter and twitch and I have defended it to coworkers and friends alike... I am done defending their incompetence and utter disregard and downright disrespect to us the consumer!
---
Inside the Vault is 100% supposed to be an informative newsletter to us the community to tell us a great deal of things. This is nothing! Literally some tried monkey was paid to write down some tiny little "hey were doing stuff" blurb that could practically fit in a damn tweet! It's lame and lazy and if you take offense to that, fine! I don't care what you some random Internet person thinks... I care what I am seeing and getting with my hard earned money and all I'm seeing is a game that is going backward in the dev cycle and backward in terms of fun...
---
And don't for one single second assume you know what I'm hearing or seeing or even thinking when it comes to what Bethesda posts! ItV is supposed to be community outreach, communication, and something to tell us that they are hard at work on making this game amazing! This 5 min type up, is barely any of those things. It is the most basic of communications they could have done and shows a complete lack of drive to assure the community of anything other than there's 1 Jr developer working in this game any more...
---
So pardon me for asking if that's all we get in terms.of information... I brief hint at the fact that they are working on fixing something that was broken in the BETA and should have been adjusted literally months ago... The fact that bugs are not getting fixed on a rapid schedule and that anything new has not been added and yet many things have been nerfed or made to be more cumbersome for the player, shows that there is not a fully fleshed out team working on this game and hasn't been since launch... 
---
TLDR: I've defended this fame long enough and as a paying customer I feel duped and let down by a Dev that I've loved for a long time for a franchise I've loved since I got the first one on release day! So don't tell me I'm being immature or unreasonable!
---
I think it would've been a lot better if they didn't spoil that every human we come in contact with is already dead.
---
2 things, report griefer douchebag Gamertags to Bethesda AND if you‚Äôre on Xbox, hit me up...I‚Äôll keep my eye open for their tags if you have them, my squad and I are not opposed to griefing the shit out of griefers.....
---
5k
---
Don't let your head get too big there.  I'm of course referring to the fucking front page thread we're posting in, which is only the most popular of the dozen or so I've seen since this Inside the Vault was published calling a simple fucking community rep blog post the last nail in this games coffin.
---
I play on PC.  I appreciate the sentiment, but the unwanted guy was swapping between a Dragon and pump action shotgun, both of which I assume were TSE.  We would have both gotten creamed and played into their childish game.
---
For sure, just an interesting oddity really.
---
When I first started playing it, it was a grindy mess.  This was before any expansion or anything else, has the game gotten better?
---
People still like the game, take your hate somewhere else.
---
You‚Äôre only active on here to bash on people‚Äôs positive opinions about the game.

And your camp dissapears when you log out, too. So ya...
---
I just hope all of you remember this and don't pre order shit from Bethesda again. Cause that's the only way things change. But more likely that not in a couple of years everyone will forget and then salivate over Todd's next big thing and rinse and repeat. 
---
I always thought she sounded like that one methhead chick from Orange Is The New Black
---
I'll come back when private servers are a thing.
---
They were paid. They did the job. I don't fault every single person at Bethesda but I do fault Bethesda as a company. This was an embarrassment for a AAA developer. It was always a joke that Bethesda released buggy games that modders had to fix, it seems that is far more true than I ever thought. They are either incompetent or lazy, and either option sucks.
---
My first nuke. Was just trying to put prime on the edge so we could pull the Queen out
---
That's not how the armor piercing works. It's multiplicative. Removed half, removed a third of what's left, removes a piece of what's left etc

Made 230 caps so far
---
Sorry, inside the vault

lol did you somehow missed the huge crowd of doomsayers before fo76's launch? Plenty of people saw this coming.
---
He was probably just there to watch the show. Justifying to himself he wasn‚Äôt apart of it when he could have told his friend to stop.

What‚Äôs your melee? Go get All Rise and it won‚Äôt be an issue. I was wasting 150 rounds of .308 on them myself until I finally got the balls to go to Watoga

Cooldown between spam increased by 10 seconds.  # of Sonic Screams between spam cooldown increased from 3 - 12.  You're welcome, please buy Atom.

I'm anti-social I don't really understand the point in terms of this game series in having friends you play with all the time. I don't even like to talk to people when I run into them I think it's much more fun to interact with the unlimited emoji
---
I sent screenshots to BGS without any hope of repercussions.  I play on PC and even with my main character's bed and breakfast camp just north of Whitesprings Station, I think I've been pretty lucky to only have been smashed a dozen or so times by griefers.  This is the first time I've actually screen-shotted them in action.
---
I just don't understand what the devs are actually doing. They're not fixing bugs, sometimes re-breaking previously fixed bugs, and aren't giving out content. I'm beginning to think that even another year before launch wouldn't have been enough 
---
Since the prime receivers specify scorched and scorchbeast it's fairly safe to assume that scorchbeast aren't considered scorched. Would be nice if they were. Could use zealot's weapons with scorched killer receiver for budget weaponry to battle the queen 
---
Ok, so what if you‚Äôre a Intelligence/Strength build (Rifleman/Melee) bc I would like to know the answer as well....I stay in X-01 armor but would like to be able to run around without it sometimes....
---
I don‚Äôt care what you‚Äôve done. You‚Äôre wrong about the Inside the Vaults. You don‚Äôt know how to read, you don‚Äôt pay attention. And then you want people to think your views and rants are important,
---
Instead bring a bratty entitled ass, try reading and being informed. 
---
Now shut up. 
---
Since FO3 Ive been saying how much I'd like to have a co op mode that I could invite someone to run my companion around with me. I pick the Companion, I played the game to get the gear I gave them. Let someone else bump around with me and help goof off. 
---
We also saw the other 50 threads that say the same thing, we don't need another one.
---
Server-wide events where we have to keep *all* the reactors running against wave attacks of equipment-damaging mobs for 30 minutes.
---
Scorched in Power Armor with legendary weapons.  Seriously, nobody ever went scorched while suited up?
---
Many, many more behemoths.
---
Whatever you need can be gathered outside of workshops much more efficiently. Workshops are pretty much useless for anything outside of plan rewards from defending.
---
I hate a Troll, I guess that‚Äôs motivation to grind your ass off and get some sweet revenge lol good luck, I‚Äôd help if I could

Dunno why u got any downvotes. It's fucking true. 
---
And actually had group content : (

More like, die, respawn, run in for your loot bag, die again, repeat for  30 minutes until the server disconnects you and you never get your loot bag back :(

Jesus fucking Christ just leave already.

---
The Tesla can certainly be a lot of fun. I just got a Bloodied Tesla rifle today. It stacks nicely with the Adrenal mutation. With the nerf to explosives I can see myself using this joint for some serious crowd control
---
I support the majority of this post other than the idea of building fetch-quest style aspects to boss enemy fights....we need more boss creatures and I agree they shouldn‚Äôt just require a squad for added firepower, but there‚Äôs enough traveling and fetching in the game to last us a while. 
---
Yeah, this sub is now filled with crybabies. Yikes.
---
I agree the game is done as soon as the next big title is released. Unfortunatly i think Bethesda are counting on it to get them off the hook. Money in the bank for minimal effort. The long term damage of this approach will be interesting to watch, you shouldnt bite the hand that feeds!
---
Yep. They might as well titled it ‚Äúwaiving the white flag, we are done ‚Äú
---
Waste of time. They can't update existing laser weapons too not have explosive app i don't see how they could change two shot in the mix
---
No dig on you either way. If that is how they chose to handle workshop structures, it's their fault.
---
&gt; Why is it taking so long to fix &lt;insert anything&gt;
---
I'm the immature spoiled best yet ur the one telling me to shut up. I read every word of what it said and all it said was they are looking at adjusting the SB and SBQ sonic scream and adjusting her Loot Table but they don't have a date for when or any other information... then they reminded me to give them.more money from the atom store. I'm entitled to a game that works because that's what I was told I would get and sold to millions.
---
I read everything Bethesda puts out about this game and most of the time it's the same recycled BS and that's it. The only one here acting entitled is you by thinking your opinion is the only one that should matter! I asked a question and you come here looking for a fight because I'm ruining your night or whatever by being upset about a game that is nothing what was promised us.
---
Or replace all instances of two shot with mighty so it doesn't have a draw back and uses a prefix we had in Fallout 4

Not ‚Äúpathetic.‚Äù If that‚Äôs how you really feel, seek mental help. ‚ÄúUnhealthy‚Äù is the word you‚Äôre looking for. 
---
Wheres step 12?
---
"Would you like to see more challenging enemies added in the future, that may require multiple players or a team to defeat? Why?"
---
This is where I fucking lost it. This told me they had no plans for future PVE content. 
---
An intelligent Behemoth thy rallies the other supermutants to attack a central location....you could give the entire server a warning just like a nuke launch so that anyone that wants to help with the ‚Äúcastle defense‚Äù can get there. This ties in perfectly with how hey say they have plans to elaborate and build on the factions. Make us join a dedicated faction and stick with it. Designate a certain building as a headquarters for each faction, let‚Äôs say...the Asylum for BoS and the Tree Top Village for Freestaters, etc.
---
Bethesda‚Äôs reputation as a triple AAA game developer is over. 
---
It's too bad the toolbox can't hold that much.
---
Find the secret hatch leading to the underground zetan bunker.
---
What the fuck does it have to do with being a "smarter consumer"? 
---
They **have** to advertise their product. That's marketing 101
---
Sidenote, as well as 5-11.
---
I mean, my first experience on my main sniper character with a lone griefer actually went really well.  I had a mutants/explosive combat rifle and just VATS the shit out of him with 15 AG and 15 Per.  I was an idiot and repaired my camp twice after killing him.  The dude had no quit, I'll say that much.  He gave me 1500+ caps in bounty, let alone whatever was in his bag.  I ported to an SBQ after the third attack, made a point to hunt him down immediately after he smashed my house for the fourth time (many server swaps required) and made a point to say remember me? and headshot him while he was repairing at home, teabag his corpse and destroy his rad shower and crops.  Normally I would never do that, but revenge is a dish best served cold.
---
You forgot one thing, 
---
There pride, and audacity to think they alone can make it right. They don't want feed back, they want a circle jerk.
---
Lol, oh you millenials.  You slay me with your experience.
---
People don't seem to realize this means they had no plans for future end-game content beyond SBQ. I am highly insulted. 
---
That‚Äôs a great point. Modders, even amateur ones, can crank out fixes and content so fast compared to this.  I imagine a lot of the slowness is all the corporate bureaucracy and red tape that undoubtedly goes on at a big company like that.
---
I mean... perhaps that says something about the game?  Or no, let's just circlejerk about circlejerking.
---
Fine w me stay off my lawn
---
Start as a couple and bang loverslab style
---
It's as if the game was a massive failure and even those die hard fans who stayed now even turned on it.
---
They changed it a while ago. There's a level cutoff where Super Mutants are no longer guaranteed to drop caps. 
---
That can only end in ruin.  
---
Too bad for them. Too bad for us...
---
Deep storage. Make it cost a small amount of caps (50 or so) to store or retrieve items. 
---
That's consoles fault not Bethesda's 
---
Yes, the gameplay is janky enough, adding player movement into it makes PvP miserable IMO.

For the "day you are uninstalling and unsubbing" you sure do linger. 
---
It's okay to admit you are not. and you are probably playing right now, and yes you just wanted to piss and moan for attention. 
---
Damn you seem super angry at the moment. Well probably not as angry as when you saw how bad this game was and had to pretend it was good for a few months before it died and was never heard of again. heh.
---
&gt; Inside the Vault is NOT a patch notes
---
No it's not.  It is however an opportunity to show you're in touch with the community, which was the opposite of what was farted into our faces today.
---
I had thought the same thing.
---
You're showing your age grey tortoise! Or, your interest in movies from the 60s.
---
Could we have a working and polished game before we start suggesting more additions for them to break? 
---
It means it sounds like you don't think you got ripped off and that this company that ripped you off is totally fine to keep.advertising their store. 
---
You know it's a big million dollar company right?  With multitudes of revenue streams? You seriously think it's okay because 'Hey, you gotta advertise."
---
You know advertising is a pretty ruthless and manipulative practice meant to take money from poor regular Joe's pockets and line the pockets of those fat cat CEOS who trust me, don't give a fuck about you!
---
But hey, capitalism. Gotta advertise and make that money eh?
---
If you are not super wealthy and a regular hardworking person who earns their money an hour at a time , I suggest you stop blindly accepting advertising and consumerism as the norm and start being smarter about what companies you support. 
---
Oh looky here... an article from Polygon basically mirroring everything I've just said... it is on Bethesda to fix this turd of a game and earn our trust and confidence back! The onus is 100% on them!
---
https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/7/18214008/fallout-76-updates-patch-fix-future
---
Or they're just going to let Austin slowly die out after this major screw up because clearly they're not up to the standard that they should be first studio like Bethesda. I mean to level of outright fuck ups that they just keep doing can only indicate some significant structural issues with their development process.

That is a bummer
---
I feel they should make pve servers. Most of us don't do pvp anyway.
---
That‚Äôs wat I originally thot it was gonna be
---
100% agree. I don‚Äôt even understand why they felt adding PvP was necessary because even if it was an attempt to pull in more players who like different types of games, that‚Äôs foolish when you end up with a player base containing multiple opposing and unrelatable play styles. 
---
Either make it PvP focused or not at all. This half and half with a dash of ‚Äúoh but you can‚Äôt grief here without consequences tee hee hee hee‚Äù bullshit mechanics only gets in the way of everyone whether they want to PvE or PvP. It‚Äôs half assing it without whole-assing a damn thing.
---
And now they‚Äôre making a separate mode for hardcore PvP? Even dumber. Some the PvP playerbase wants to deal less with the annoying PvE mechanics like material grinding and just get into fights, which the new mode doesn‚Äôt do anything special to facilitate(that we know of so far). Meanwhile the other part of the PvP playerbase is here specifically because they know there are PvE only players who came from fallout games that are single player only, because they want to grief those players. They are the perfect victims(in theory). There is no way to game design something for those folks because surprise! No player likes playing just to be those players‚Äô target or victim. So it‚Äôs a dead end player base, design-wise.
---
As many others pointed out, Anthem is releasing with zero PvP content. And the future of it being added is a big ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see.‚Äù IMO that is what Bethesda should have done. But here we are.
---
Yeah. No more freaking drills/flare/syringer drops. How about real legendary items. Get rid of the joke wood armor and the rest of the pointless crap like melee weapons with a stalker tag (like I am going vats with a melee?).
---
I like the concept of playing with friends, though I‚Äôd prefer to have an offline option, too. If I want to play pvp I go to other games designed for pvp, not Fallout. This is my escape game where I can play without massive dumps of adrenaline. This is a game where I get creative with my builds, enjoy the scenery and occasionally shoot something. I enjoyed the story lines in the past, that‚Äôs what Bethesda did well and what hooked me into gaming. I feel like a bunch of companies saw Fortnight‚Äôs P&amp;L‚Äôs and decided pvp was what everyone was clamoring over. Fallout did some things very well... even great... they should stick with their strengths.
---
Atleast there‚Äôs Anthem and a bunch of other games coming in case FO76 dies.  They only brought this in themselves.
---
Hell no.  
---
Enough things cost caps, like fast traveling, no reason to require spending caps to retrieve items from your storage. I however wouldn't be against using Atoms for this, and would make Atoms more useful.
---
Yeah I had tons of scraped stuff cause I planned to build. Not anymore I guess...
---
This. They are quitting. They have been phoning it in since launch but at this point they barely give half a shit even about appearances. They are hoping people will just lose interest and quit when this year's litany of amazing games comes out. Why the hell would anyone still be playing this joke of a game when something like Cyberpunk or even Anthem comes out? And Anthem is out in 2 weeks. I know I will be uninstalling Fo76 to make room for it.
---
Thanks!
---
I would recommend intentionally finding areas with high level players. Let them draw the aggression of the level 68 charred ghouls and take potshots from the sidelines on a perch the ghouls cant reach like the top of a truck or a small rocky outcropping they can't get to without falling.
---
Yea legit what I thought too. 
---
A coop Elder Scrolls/Fallout game has been my desire for a long time! Just 4 buds working together to save Skyrim/The Wasteland or whatever. Plus it would be more helpful than the dumb companions you pickup along the way in those games.
---
Yeah I need help. Until then...
---
What plan did you ~~dupe~~find/purchase multiples of?
---
&gt;Pros:
---
&gt;-You can't 1 shot anything in the game
---
&gt;Cons:
---
&gt;-SBQ impossible to kill
---
Do you see the conflict between these two points you made?
---
Do you know how you were available to be attacked?  
---
As someone who is only level 5, yes.
---
The common practice is to be in a team with a griefer, then when the homeowner engages a seemingly lone griefer, all of a sudden the teammate can one shot them from a stealth position.  The griefers will use stealth and the bag as bait to troll the player over and over until they give up.  It's pretty sad that high level players are resorting to this for amusement.
---
Yeah, change one variable. They have mailed this game in. 
---
Because a huge article would have satisfied you? You still would have bitched and moaned about it. Get over yourself. 
---
I mean, the acronym was about as long as today's ITV anyway.
---
If they weren't Final Fantasy Online with this one, I could be interested. When it came back, though, it would have to be with new content and a better build system. No glitches is a given, but that's unrealistic. 
---
I‚Äôm a vengeful bastard, even in IRL lol...I‚Äôm not a huge PvP player either (I honestly avoid it like the plague) but I claimed a junk yard and this dude wouldn‚Äôt stop trying to overtake it, I was wasting him over and over with my explosive Lever Rifle, collected a bunch of caps from him not wanting to just go away and take the whuppin, finally I just waited on the hillside until he respawned chucked a Missile Strike Beacon into the middle of the workshop, watched the fireworks and then fast traveled back to camp. I was getting ready to call it a night and log off when I hear someone blasting my turrets and the side of my camp (I stay in the forest, where there‚Äôs next to know attackers so when my camp is being attacked, it‚Äôs odd). The guy wouldn‚Äôt talk to me, I screenshot his GT, logged off the server and then found him on Xbox Chat, didn‚Äôt take long for me to get this dbag riled up enough to admit that ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt matter‚Äù that I had taken all his scrap and caps because he had thousands of everything. I posted a ticket with Bethesda.net immediately for admitting he duped (with the screenshots of the convo), sent him the ticket #, told him what I thought of him and bounced lol 
---
&gt;It means it sounds like you don't think you got ripped off and that this company that ripped you off is totally fine to keep.advertising their store.
---
1. I don't play the game anymore and haven't for at least a month
---
2. I easily got over 300-400 hours of play time out of a game I paid ¬£45 for.
---
That is **objectively** getting my money's worth. So no, I don't feel like I got ripped off. Because I objectively didn't. You just have an absolutely fucking stupid definition of "ripped off"
---
Agreed. The only pvp I do is defending against some rando trying to jihad my camp.
---
Then why complain about someone having better gear, sounds like you‚Äôre jealous
---
Why are they nerfing explosive weapons? 
---
They already weigh more so should to more dammage; a bonus for lugging it around. I still haven't used my  missile launcher yet because it weighs so much and I could just do the same ammage with two shots from my handmade rifle.  I am saving a fat man and 8 mini Nikes though for the assaultrons down in Watoga.
---
I have 198. The ghouls at Whitespring drop them like wood armor... all the time.

Are you on PC?

The old MMO firefall had a similar problem.
---
Great gameplay that was repeatedly reworked, re-balanced, changed, and partitioned to suit the PVP crowd. Often ignoring the wishes of the main player base.
---
O wow Really Brother? 
---
Unfortunately the Atom Store itself is an obstacle because modding=nobody buys anything from the Atom Store. I'll bet they don't even plan to support offline/private servers and modding anymore, if they even really planned to in the first place and weren't just talking out of their ass. They just don't want to say it because they know they'll lose the last of the fans forever. They'll just keep the game on life support for the pittance that the Atom Store might still bring in until they stop supporting the game. That way they can blame the low player numbers for not ever getting around to adding it.
---
&gt;But they fixed Skyrim and they fixed FO4, so...
---
Skyrim and Fallout 4 were developed by Bethesda Game Studios in Maryland. Fallout 76 is being "maintained" by Bethesda Game Studios Austin, whose last projects were multiplayer DLC for DOOM and BattleCry, which was cancelled before release.
---
Why is nobody talking about Crackdown 3? The first 2 were great games and the third has Terry Crews. What's not to like about that?
---
I leave all ammo in the Watoga pail it‚Äôs the easiest place I think will get traffic. 
---
Conan does this, you just need pvp and pve servers and settings adjusted for each
---
I'm glad you got your time in with the game. Not sure why you're so angry and worked up though. If you've put your time into the game and moved on, what are you doing here? 
---
Just being rude and swearing at strangers, I guess. Sounds fun, enjoy your salt.

People who've been killing me, most of them have been using heavy weapons and/or Two Shot Explosive weapons not sure about anything else.

Whenever math guys start a sentence with ‚Äújust,‚Äù I usually end up looking like a confused dog staring at an episode of Silicone Valley. Or me staring at an episode of Silicone Valley. I‚Äôm a bit of a Bighead.

LOL. except an hour ago, making it an hour after you make your post, you were still here commenting in another post. 
---
But, you know, brave man. Glad you took a stand... 
---
Unfortunately I feel that they want to sell us servers and then sell us creation club mods. Why buy things from the Atom Store if some modder is just going to add it for free. Short sighted strategy but that's AAA gaming nowadays. 
---
I can‚Äôt imagine putting that much importance on a newsletter...
---
&gt; They'll just keep the game on life support for the pittance that the Atom Store might still bring in until they stop supporting the game. 
---
Yeah, that's a great plan if you want to *kill* Fallout 76. My plan is to *fix* it.
---
:(
---
That‚Äôs kinda my whole point.  When you attempt to Jam it all together on one server/map you‚Äôre likely setting yourself up for failure.
---
What level are you?
---
Saw your edit and I don't think anyone has replied about it, but to see those go into your Pipboy, hover over the item and press the "Inspect" button. You can see which button that is towards the bottom.

That doesn't mean I didn't unsubscribe or uninstall? Lol I want to read what other people have to say about this today too? Also I wouldn't talk about standing for a single thing if you're standing up for this game. 
---
It's as if adults are constantly throwing tantrums about a videogame. Just move on, you'll feel better.
---
How so? I've seen much smaller updates to games on consoles.
---
I never used my TSE in a PvP, that‚Äôs a Bitch move...other people didn‚Äôt feel the same, after a couple 1 shots (rather than pull out my god Gauss) and retaliate, I‚Äôd just served hop and stopped PvP‚Äôing unless it couldn‚Äôt be avoided....that being said, I miss my OP TSE‚Äôs badly!!!!
---
Can we get a Ferret ghoul?
---
Workshops give you a few for free to use in the workshop
---
People like you whining about a TSE killing you in passive mode is what led to mega nerf.
---
I guaran-fucking-tee if I gank someone in passive with my TSE shotgun, they will not die for quite a while...
---
Stacking Bobbleheads was the issue.
---
Bethesda is just lazy, incompetent, etc. 
---
I mean yeah its not like you become leader of the institute and have a chance to turn them around or anything.
---
The fact that weekly maintenance isn't happening is more than concerning.
---
Shot part deux
---
I think they are also missing talented people at all levels since the best of them just got pulled on Starfield and the next Elder Scrolls, leaving Fo76 with noobs trying to figure out how to do a game like this.  When they say they had people from different studio working on this game, I feel this was more a "call me if you need help understanding something and we'll do our best to give you 5 minutes of attention but you'll mostly have to figure it out by yourselves".  That's what I feel Fo76 is...exact same crap we got from Mass Effect Andromeda.
---
They cant make the mistake of simply adding new content that is PVP entirely. That would make the content completely pointless for part of their player base.
---
Absolutely
---
No
---
Oh, nice. Didn‚Äôt know that 
---
The queen turns into a meat pile too quick sometimes and it's really hard to find because it doesn't have an especific name

Displayed on TVs would be a cool thing. Just my opinion.

just remember for thsi and never give them money again.
---
Agreed, this whole damn community has turned toxic bc of this game...play it or don‚Äôt, enjoy it or hate it...just shut up about it lol people are on this sub bc they are the ones playing it...nobody cares that you ‚Äúlogged off and uninstalled tonight‚Äù
---
Or the fact that they don't have anyone trying to fix this garbage fire anymore. 
---
They only have one guy working there and he can only do so much.
---
I think it depends where you go solo. I‚Äôm not a very good player... I can  get around most of the map solo now (old retired guy level 50), but early on I had to stay around places like Flatwoods. I also noticed doing melee helped unless I was sniping.
---
I dig the idea of a Scorched or Super Mutant running around in a busted up, thrown together PA...that could be very cool 
---
That said, I do hope they release the server code, or at least let the game launch in off-line mode. I think the moders could salvage this in a week or two, and make it playable. 
---
The list of bad ideas is so long. 
---
Biggy for me is the obsession Beth has with PVP. Had this been a no pvp, coop only game the fan base would have been a lot happier.
---
Human nps with instanced Vault dugeons would have been great.
---
Instead we get the Fallout version of the Purge.
---
The only thing Beth has been doing so far is making the worst parts of the game harder.
---
ultracite exploding vents. every time
---
It's up to OP to learn the magic of paragraphs

120 separate

Why would a hate bandwagoner defend the game for 2 months and then start to dislike it?
---
Go read some of the haters post histories you'll see alot of positive comments.
---
After losing my Power Armor for the 3rd time (Excavator level 25, 35 and 45 respectively) due to bugs, I just deleted the game from my PS4. Among with pretty basic things like not having game breaking bugs fixed, the still atrocious FPS drops on PS4 when firing fast RPM weapons, the duplication that is still rampant, and the fact that there has been literally zero content updates for the (almost) past 3 months tells me that unless this game receives the FFXIV reboot (or devote an enormous time and money into making it a better game, which to be frank doesn't feel like Bethesda is willing to do just on the off-chance that they may bring old players back and get new ones), I honestly think this game will not survive this year.  
---
And by survive I mean Bethesda literally throwing the towel, perhaps even closing the servers. Their only saving grace would be allowing single player and maybe modded private servers. I wish I was being overdramatic.  
---
With Anthem / Division 2 / upcoming DLC's for Destiny 2 only being few weeks away, I cannot imagine Fallout 76 having a core player count. Not even mentioning a "good" player count, I really mean "core".   
---
This was an amazing game on paper, and when it did work (1 out of 10 times), I had fun exploring the gorgeous world that Bethesda is really known for. But it didn't work. They had one chance to impress people, and the overwhelming majority of players were not impressed.   
---
And to promote it. It even had different art and advertisement today! 
---
79 - separate
---
Private servers at this point may be the only thing that can save the game. 
---
I actually gave you a pretty thorough response to which you only adressed the first paragraph cause I guess that's all you tiny brain could get through. 
---
Then you hurl insults and swear like a child, but I'm the one who's gotta 'get a grip?'
---

---
We should still have legendary effects, don't get me wrong, but only one at a time and I could agree to the power armour part, though I negate a bunch of armour so even guys in power armour take a minimal amount of hits to kill for the other guys I agree completely
---
The gun nerf was a horrible move.  Anyone that wasn't already melee should be quickly converting thanks to all of the strength perks that every single player has to have in order to carry anything.
---
Fuck anthem. But yes. They‚Äôre trying to bury this shit 
---
Ah!! Thanks! Much appreciated
---
Effort? What‚Äôs that ?
---
And please... *please*, fix their animations, literally every single Scorched in the entire game has the same animation with every single ranged weapon, it can be a pipe pistol, a shotgun, or a MINIGUN and they will still be holding it the same way
---
I rock t60 legs and t51 everything else. The leg pieces seem to take the most damage and t60 is cheap to repair. Slap on paint and it all matches anyway!!
---
The Responders vendor, like Phoenix in Watoga, is invulnerable and often chases down hostile spawns.  We've found him several times stuck in the stairway.  Just search the fire station and you should find him, and with a friendly nudge you can guide him back to his original spot.
---
This is my dream tbh.
---
In other words, they failed at their first attempt and are staring down an 0 and 2 failure streak?
---
I feel bad for all the invites I shy away from in fear my camp will get messed with again by a lame team mate. But my biggest problem with the partially damaged structures is as you move your cursor over them you will see their health bars pop up constantly. I just can't believe something so simple has not been added yet. 
---
And isn't Jello just boiled down bones?
---
Relax m8. Nothing wrong with saying it was not ready for release because it was not.
---
BETHESDA is a AAA Developer and their actions so far have been very sub par.
---
If it came with bug fixes and a general about face on the way the game is going (into the shitter) then yes, I would.
---
Is that why they've stopped dropping for me?  I know them all so they get removed from the loot pool?  That'd be fine if it also removed the Explosive Vent from the loot pool . . . 
---
The mobile app isn‚Äôt that great sorry. Hey if you want to call me an asshole that‚Äôs your right. But if you‚Äôre going to keep defending a game this incomplete and flawed I‚Äôm still going to judge you as negatively as you judge me. 
---
The game was rigged from the start!
---
No.
---
yep. the enemies sometimes get resitance against ranged weapons. u need change to melee to kill them, then relog to fix.
---
and there is many other bugs from last patch, like carry, carry weigth, weapon damage, hp changing wihout reason, fast travell remove pa parts, etc.
---
Bring it. PvP is just a obstacle from a gameplay and developer balancing items standpoint.
---
I have only killed 2 players ever and once was part of when I was trying out workshops. The other time was when some jackass kept slap damaging a friend who was trying out the game for the first time and he would not leave them alone. We even had to kill him 5 times over and he kept coming back trying to sneak in a kill. 
---
PvP in this style of game either needs to be done like Rust or not at all. And it needs to be billed as such, not the nonsense boasting ‚Äúgriefing won‚Äôt be a problem in *OUR* game!‚Äù I snorted when I heard that.
---
If they‚Äôd just not wasted time with PvP and instead spent that effort on making the game work with npcs and a proper fleshed out world and story then we‚Äôd have a different and better game.
---
PvP in FO76 was a mistake. A boastful, greedy and unnecessary mistake.

The only time 2 guys were shooting up my crappy hillbilly camp I exited the game and come back on.  Sucks though.

I bet 76 made your parents get a divorce, too.
---
If uou notice most console updates range from 300 mb up to any number of Gb's the 300 mb ones is basically the game designers changing one thing and the rest is code basically telling the xbox this is a xbox update push it through 
---
I might be wrong, but if i remember correctly i went there 2 times and it was a different corpse, so maybe it's just a randomized corpse, which would be even more annoying IMO
---
I would never play the game ever again and would try to get a refund 
---
This would apply to any and every game.  PVP bad.  Co-op good.  
---
Have pink hat if you want and on ps4
---
The Gatling Laser (and maybe Gatling Plasma) default to an ammo amount equal to the number of cores you have until they are reloaded.
---
There are some mods available that have no corresponding mod slot on the weapon, so they cannot be applied. There's at least a "Speedy Receiver" (sorry don't know which weapon) and at least one Gamma gun mod in that drop in the world that cannot be applied to a weapon.
---
Some weapon mods are poorly named, like "Bladed" which could possibly apply to many weapons like Baseball Bat and Knuckles, but you can't tell which weapon the mod is for until you try to apply it.

Hey we aren‚Äôt updating our game or adding that content we talked about...RELAX this week.

Their way of saying, we fucked up so bad last week we need a lot more time to fix or mistakes BUT we still want you to spend money on our game even though we aren‚Äôt taking ENOUGH time to fix it.
---
For me, after grinding to get all of these sets of shiny power armor and never using any of them beside the X-01, I would love to be able to walk into my camp and see them lined up against the wall....that would make me happy. Also, all those bobble heads I never use and end up selling, let me display those too!

I know no one wants my opinion but I think coop fallout 4 with a new storyline and improved grafics was really all we wanted and now many of the fans who have been here for many years no longer trust or want the games this company has to offer its very sad indeed 
---
See you in 3 years! Maybe another vault will open then!
---
Neither could I... but here we are.
---
So when balancing for PvP what legendary effects stay and which go? How do we balance weapons used for killing giant bullet sponges for working properly and fairly for a 300-500 hp pool? 
---

---
It wasn't an update, it was a deceleration of surrender. I've seen more detailed posts from abandoned Kickstarter projects.
---
I'm not saying that's what I want, I'm saying that's probably what's going to happen. FO76 was an experiment for them, it failed and the effort to fix it for them is most likely not worth it. If they had any scruples they would've removed the Atom Shop on day one but instead they did shit like pretending the christmas packs were on sale when they didn't have a base price to begin with. Stuff like that shows exactly where the company's priorities lie.
---
Her hair is exactly like hair in the atom shop should look like!! 
---
I mean, they can and do make any mistake they want. We know for a fact one vault has the main content be a PvP king of the hill vote collecting thing. Anyone that doesn't PvP is going to have many many many months without any significant content aimed at them. create PvE only servers and they give up even the option to use any of that content 
---
Lol I‚Äôm lingering all day today. At least for the next half hour. Can‚Äôt believe the attention this drew but sadly I have to go to bed at some point. Just shocked how many people feel the same as me.

Making money is important. Making money at the expense of quality is the beginning of the end for most companies.

Or significant enough to make room in the camp budget for ü§£
---
It's really unfortunate that they are doing their best to not make it less of a fallout game than it ever was, which wasn't much. 
---
You are correct, they're the least experienced studio. Honestly, I think they're at risk of losing that moniker though. They might get cannibalized by the rest of Zenimax
---
Imagine if they kept making large-scale DLCs/end-game content for Fallout 4 instead. Had they not worked on Fallout 76, we could've had 10 more Far Harbors by now

It is sort of reddit copy/paste, though.  The sources she uses to back up her points are based on reddit posts.

The queen is actually scaled to the number of players in the region. Soloing her on an empty server isn't too hard. The worst is when a half dozen level 30s port over to get a shot in on her, then you'll be wishing you had stacked bobbleheads as the timer expires and she flies away.
---
Don't know if others have experienced this, but the challenge to fully rank up a perk card in each Special has never worked. Level 50-something and it still says 0/7.
---
Predicated on all known duping methods being patched, I would accept the following wipe:
---
A complete wipe of non-quest legendary items (they all revert to their non-legendary counterparts), any multiples of quest legendaries being eliminated, and anything with a quantity greater than 100 being reduced to 100. But not a wipe of levels/xp, quests, perks, or known plans.

Some dipshit...

Only if the sample is representative of the player base as a whole.  Since this subreddit is self-selected, I would argue that it is not.

It just frustrating because some of the stickers and misc. Items are near impossible to pick back up. It drives me nuts. I'm pretty OCD about my base.

Yadda yadda yadda.

Game production has been going steadily downhill, perhaps since the release of E.T. for Atari 2600.  None of this should be a surprise to anyone.  I'm amazed by HQ AAA titles, not expectant.  
---
Shitting on the floor then leaving the building isn't helping.  So long.
---
How about adding literally anything to the game
---
Its extremely annoying only in the sense that it's one more thing to item dump, and more than that, they fixed and then unfixed it. That might not matter from a gameplay standpoint, but it removes faith in the dev team.
---
That is great news. 
---
My new alt is coming along nicely too. Not melee though. I am hoping to team up in PvP where my build can play a part in the team but not be the heavy hitter melee tank team member.

I want to be the supportive medium distance member with my pistols and some charisma perks to buff the team.
---
6 times  in one day you died in passive mode. strange. so you re  saying 6 different people griefed you in passive mode today? 
---
I waited a long time for No Man‚Äôs Sky to not be crap.  So I can wait.
---
&gt; anti griefer system
---
Pathetic they even tried. Either have hardcore PvP and *clearly state* that‚Äôs what you have, or no PvP at all. Those are the only choices from a feasible game development standpoint. 
---
As for melee weapons...yeah slap damage is stupid. Turn it off. And in fact, just turn off PvP. Anti-griefer systems are stupid because they‚Äôll always be worked around or corrupted to allow different ways to grief and harass players.
---
Lol I tried
---
This too! Line in the Sand is my favorite event. It only improves with more people! 
---
Yeah the paints should be applied without using materials 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm shutting them off when I go to bed. I‚Äôve put about 11 days and 8 hours into it. 
---
They should be rechargeable like nicad batteries. 
---
I'm all for nerfing melee.  No reason a ski sword should have more dmg than a nice shotgun 
---
I have seen a lot of stupid posts in this sub, but god damn is this one up there. 
---
Turrets suck at defending and eat up budget. Just get rid of them. 
---
If you want power for lights on the second floor just put connectors underneath and connect wires to the generator.
---
Exactly, faction based PA paint plans or skins...so that you know who you‚Äôre running up on when you‚Äôre out and about. It could really build a gang mentality, turf war kind of vibe which would bring a lot of interesting gameplay back. 
---
If you're in passive there should be NO slap damage. This dude was EASILY draining my health with that dumb mechanic.
---
I like where you are coming from. Today's trash is tomorrow's meta. I too have a knack for getting certain combo's of legendary stats. Seems to be mainly mutant/weightless/chameleon with 1/2 stars.
---
My feelings of "I will not play anymore" equate from the fact that I do not think it's a fair, level playing field when it comes to RNG's. Some analogies:
---
*I go to the casino and before I get on the Black Jack table I am told by the dealer that "You sir are only going to be able to draw cards that equal 15. Every play.*
---
*\*dealer points to my friend\* "You are only going to draw 21." Everytime.*
---
*Another person: "You are only going to draw cards that equal 10"*
---
And so forth.
---
That would be very advantageous in some situations however it's not fair. 
---
Another:
---
*DnD: You will only roll 6's, 10's and 0's. Everyplay.*
---
This is where I'm coming from. I'll add to my thoughts after some r/Showerthoughts I've had with subsequent replies why I believe Bethesda devs' thought this was a good idea. I 100% believe it's seeded, and it's manipulated somewhat to what server you are on. Almost like a key/algorithm/etc, that reads your seed and determines the categories of loot you can get.
---
‚ÄúAdditionally, we are also looking into ways we can make her loot list more ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù in the future. While we're still working on implementing that system, we will let you know as soon as we have more details to share.‚Äù
---
Uh, do you not know how your own game works? Also, you‚Äôre just NOW realizing that maybe the toughest creatures should drop good loot?
---
I‚Äôve been exceedingly positive about this game, but you sound like a bunch of amateur idiots with no business being NEAR a valued franchise.
---
Found this floating around, tested it and found him to be accurate. While in pacifist you will not do damage to other players or their belongings at workshops. You will get a bounty while in pacifist if you pick a lock but that's about it. So unless there is proof of the incident, it is not credible and more than likely that they forgot about pacifist being off. This subreddit is turning into an echochamber of misinformation.
---
&gt;**You have to die at the hands of another player for them to collect the bounty. How seriously dumb is that**
---
Because if you cashed in your own bounty that would not be fair to whoever you accrued the bounty on, and defeats the purpose. [Man tries to turn himself in for reward money](http://kwbe.com/the-dog-house/man-tries-to-turn-himself-in-for-reward-money-gets-arrested/)
---
Doesn't matter what it says, Polygon is shit. 
---
I just encountered this exact issue and destroyed my entire build idea so I have to back track because I don't want to constantly keep reapplying the perk to share so stupid
---
I‚Äôve given up on even using mine, I don‚Äôt even pick them up anymore lol
---
ü§£üòÇ Agreed!
---
By trolling you do understand that they have already done this once and probably will happen again?
---
Yeah, I've be a big fan since 3.  I still like and am playing 76 but it sure was rushed prematurely and the blame goes right to the top, whomever decided that this game was finished and ready to ship should mo deffinately loose their job.  I hope they're able to make things right and add lots of new content, add more storylines and characters that aren't via holltape.  I hope they add new game modes maybe like a team vs team game like overwatch that has desthmatch and capture the flag and all that; something to keep people comming back.  I just hope they don't pull the plug in this franchise like what happened to my beloved Mass Effect.
---
Greifer making anti greifer post. Just wow. By the way none of this can completely prevent greifing if there is a motivated team targeting you. Why should we do all this nonsense to avoid assholes. I don‚Äôt want to play this game crouched (pun intended)
---
It‚Äôs taking all the fun out of the game. People are leaving in droves. The game needs major changes and greifing is a small but relevant part of it. It‚Äôs mainly an issue now because everyone is bored with nothing to do
---
Being able to set traps, even inside your camp, would be great...if a level 3 picklock wants to break into my house, he gets a head full of flamer ala Home Alone 
---
I wish our characters could look even half as raidery as her
---
I get you're doing what you're doing for character limit but there seem to be a lot of wasted characters on screen for me. Are all the coded stuff in braces really necessary? That's like 30% of the text right there saved.
---
These updates remind me of the early days of Destiny 1 and  Deej‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis week at Bungie‚Äù articles that were meant to give the players an insiders view of the state of the game.
---
In reality though, every update would be multiple paragraphs explaining absolutely nothing about absolutely everything.
---
Bloody hell and I thought I was in the minority with this approach. 2 accounts, 1 PvE and 1 PvP. The PvE feeds the PvP one.
---
Anyhow at $10 a pop for Fallout 76 it makes sense that more people jumped on it and got multiple accounts.
---
waifu vault wanderer. I respect your thumbnail game, just not for me. 
---
Raid from the Rich, give to the poor! 
---
That's what I'm afraid of, I actually liked Andromed.  Hopefully Bethesda can turn this ship around.
---
So basically you experience 0 PvP in 400 hours and yet you complain about too much PvP.
---
 I ain't joining zip. This is where ESO went sideways requiring team play for some mats and areas. 
---
Why would someone think it's a good idea anyway 
---
Separate PvE server
---
because they want it?
---
The reasons I prefer the mutation are: 
---
1) you can be invisible while standing, which is often when wanting to shoot over some cover but not be seen. 
---
2) if my armor breaks, I'm still invisible. 
---
3) sneaking partly relies on armor weight, and unsurprisingly, weightless armor weighs significantly less
---
I am giving up quite a few armor perks by using the mutation, but I like being extra sneaky
---
You think they‚Äôre going to repeat a mistake that egregious? That probably got someone fired. A second time surely will. It doesn‚Äôt take a lot of faith for me to believe this. 
---
They're checking your inventory to see if you're a duper (do you have 10000 bobbleheads, stimpacks, etc) and if they can take you (what armor/weapons do you have)
---
I don't think tamed animals should cost budget at all
---
 How is destroying a base fun? I am puzzled by this behavior. ;)
---
Kinda dumb cause its only that one i have all the game but pipfall is the one they want nothing else 
---
This is the time to concentrate on building the factions back up, make us choose one, give us a ‚Äúhome base‚Äù, the Asylum for BoS or the Tree Top Village for the FreeStaters. Let us have faction based events and quests that award faction exclusive loot like PA Paint or Armor, gun skins, etc. They could even have a ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù style castle defense type of gameplay pretty easily, if a rival faction wants to try and raid us, we‚Äôll defend the castle....make a Faction scoreboard and let everyone brag when their Faction is top dog in Appalachia. This would be so much more enjoyable than this boring ass PvP system that nobody except griefers wanna mess with....
---
*insert Simpsons "I'm helping"*
---
It just sucks because I shy away from invited because of it. It's one thing for someone to destroy my camp. Also annoying but I'll tolerate it. But when people mess with the layout it burns my biscuits. 
---
Best. Companion. Ever.
---
Are we pretending as if The Elder Scrolls (which btw ESO has a new great expansion coming soon) or their half-a-billion other franchises don't exist?
---
+1'ed. Be prepared for a wave of sad down voters though.
---
What do you roleplay as?
---
Right. Missions that are faction based would be really fun too. 
---
Yeah annoying I only trade with ppl thru here
---
While I can't say that I'm a roleplayer, I'm also not a min-maxer either, so I get where you're coming from.
---
Nothing wrong with that crowd too. Just letting you know that there are a number of us people who aren't power levelling mix-maxers.
---
That's *IF* it gets released. I'm still anticipating Beth' pulling a Bioware/ME:A level tantrum about the negativity from the community and pulling the plug on future development.
---
Your comment sums up exactly how I feel. I must admit though, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve logged a single hour in 2019. All of my friends were gone by mid-December (some only a few days after launch or the BETA). I stayed on through it all, but this game has effectively become single player for me. None of my friends want to play it anymore. When I did play it alone, the problems stated by countless others drove my interest down. With Apex Legends, Kingdom Hearts III, And now Metro: Exodus coming out, its just not worth my time to play Fallout 76 anymore. I sincerely love this franchise, the rich lore, the storytelling, and the addicting gameplay.
---
Was Fallout 4 a step down? Sure, but it was still a decent experience. They build on the lore a bit and kept things moving. Fallout 76 did none of those things. They disregarded lore (a cornerstone of the series for me) among other things.
---
I don‚Äôt know. This game is just one big ‚Äúsigh‚Äù for me. 
---
I guess you‚Äôre right there, im  not saying I think it should be mandatory, and the events/quests would be optional if you want to help or not in my opinion. 95% of my play is solo, but I think I‚Äôd still join a faction, just to help out when I wanted to...
---
They need more variety everywhere for enemies. It's boring when you're a high enough level and there's only three types of ghoul that spawn anymore and every single super mutant is a warlord. 
---
Santa. I go around giving people presents, helping them defend workshops, and giving coal to Wanted players; I don't kill them though, just coal.
---
Not at all. They could still take the workshop and the person in pacifist would have to disable it to stop them.
---
bruh u better stash ur junk
---
It's called man-o-naise... Very easy to find in the wasteland normally for free....
---
That's fair. I'm just very concerned that the only people getting a word in are the min/maxers, meta-builders, etc.
---
Because they‚Äôre not thinking things through and making snap decisions. Some dev who doesn‚Äôt even play the game, while looking at the TSE weapon problem, saw the Demo Expert perk and noticed it isn‚Äôt the same as the other damage perks. Not realizing *every goddamn explosive grenade and launchers‚Äô base damage is balanced for that already* and in fact is a bit weak as it is for the resources they expend to make and effort to use, they instead said ‚ÄúDurr-hey! This number doesn‚Äôt match that number! Things should match! That‚Äôll help balance those two shot exploding things cause they use explosive damage!‚Äù So they did. Without even thinking about *the main freaking use of the perk.*
---
I‚Äôm serious. Just go read the dev comments in the patch notes. This is literally what they did. They just blindly said ‚Äúthings should match!‚Äù My comment about the dev who did this not playing the game is an informed guess because frankly, if he does play and still did this, it‚Äôs an even worse call.
---
This one part is a make or break for me, tbh. It‚Äôs so shortsighted and indicative of overly simplistic thought and sheer blindness to what they‚Äôre doing that makes me feel like they are low effort. Don‚Äôt forget they fixed Heavy Gunner boosting automatic grenade launchers by *completely removing the tag for what weapon type it counts for.* Yeah. They didn‚Äôt change it. They clicked a drop down and said ‚Äúwhoops there‚Äôs nothing here it could be besides heavy and nothing!‚Äù So they picked nothing. Now no weapon perks work for it, surprise. Demo expert still does but only cause it‚Äôs damage is tagged as explosive. I dare a Bethesda dev to come in here and prove me wrong. I straight up am talking mad shit about them and calling them out. Not that I expect or think I deserve a response lol. But just because I‚Äôm curious if they‚Äôll ever fess up to making an obvious mistake.
---
pretty much. Although it is what is at the current moment and its just a few pointers. Some players may find them useful. 
---
I do not grief though. I never broke anyone's camp or harrassed any players. Just saying. 
---
Let‚Äôs just nerf everything...
---
Makes you wonder if their anti-cheat detection has overflow errors.
---
Yeah, I mean can you imagine you and your Paladin bro‚Äôs standing on top of the asylum...looking out over the Bog seeing the Enclave storming up the hill. Now that is cool...
---
I try to dump them as close to the vault as I can. Figure they could be handy.
---
Hmm, TSE is still powerful enough to kill someone while in PM? Then it deserved the nerf and you're now whining because it got nerf, funny how that works. 
---
I wasn't even saying TSE was the reason it was happening just I was getting killed by people who had it while in PM not all of them did but just the mention of TSE got you triggered
---
One of us takes things personally. I wish the best for you.
---
no idea, could it be the more rare holo game? i have all the games as well so i dont know if it is or not.
---
I agree with the more group oriented activities but not with the less pvp . When I first heard about fo online , I envisioned it to be a few large permanent servers where camps could build towns and faction fights would be constant ... I was disappointed  
---
107 üòê
---
You mean glowing pustules? Shoot we got disease cure for that!
---
They've rebranded and added on to the same engine they're used since Morrowind released. **In 2002.** 
---
And they're going to be using it for Starfield and ES6.
---
WHY?!?
---
I haven't played since early December.  I had to finish my semester with college and once I did the dumpster fire that had engulfed fo76 has made me afraid to return.
---
I've posted this multiple times and get downvoted to hell for it. But I agree 100%. 
---
Such dramatic changes to the game should be tried out by a small testing group for a week or two before. Bethesda could use their feedback before pissing off the entire playerbase. Or causing more bugs that are sometimes worse than before. 
---
I'd gladly wait a week or two to have things tested first. 
---
No slap damage, you are noclip to other players, your weapons fire and melee strikes can pass through them, and they turn transparent when they get close. Just trying to think of all the ways someone may still somehow try to be a dick. 
---
She displays an ability to circumvent existing programming even in her miss nanny form, if you are persistent enough in feeding her information that should result in her remaining trapped inside the lab. Whether that circumvention is necessarily self-interested action driven by consciousness, or could be another piece of higher priority code at work, is not certain but it appears to be an exercise of autonomy.
---
I'm not a developer, how can I suggest that as a solution? 
---
Most tips in this post are things that can be done within the mechanics of the current system.
---
with the amount of buggy ways to die in this game, thats a bad idea to keep all your junk on you.
---
I have to disagree a little there. I see myself as casual and enjoy PvP especially in groups.
---
Sure I am low on any leaderboard but I seriously enjoy the game mode. Sure teams will drop me as soon as they realise I am not as hard core as them but I just need to find the other casuals then and yes they do exist. Well in my side of the world they do, 35-45 year old dads playing PvP when the kids go to bed.
---
Now if you meant being top 10 on the leaderboard is not for casuals then I agree. No way I get even top 5000 in something like TD1. I just don't have the time to invest.
---
Xbox has gotten better...
---
Ok I can see that but during a SQB fight I have ran into that a number of times....guess that makes sense.
---
I'll add you when I get onüôÇ
---
Dankpanda710 
---
You can maintain storage in your stash
---
I hear you, upvote well earned, etc. Now my twist on it is that this would be a great survey to send out ON WEEK ONE. If they didn‚Äôt have literally hundreds of pages of people saying in no uncertain terms, ‚Äúthis particular thing makes the game unbearable, I quit and am uninstalling‚Äù. For me, White Knight nerf came damn close. I can only speak for my own thoughts, but ‚Äúevery player seems to use this perk, so let‚Äôs make it much less useful‚Äù is the definition of counterintuitive. And on top of that, it was prioritized over things that were majorly impacting gameplay. Multiple things.
---
So yeah - this ‚ÄúHey guys, what changes would you like?‚Äù after months of our pleading for long standing problems is precisely a slap in the face, followed by a lovely second love tap of ‚Äúand spend some more atoms too! Kthxbye‚Äù.
---
I know the expectation is, ‚ÄúOK, wise guy, what would YOU write?‚Äù
---
Something like this:
---
Thanks for all of your feedback! We‚Äôve got a few things we are addressing right away, so in the next patch you will see (change list, notes)
---
Based on your feedback, here is what seems to be the top player-reported issues:
---
(Issues, brief comment and rough timeline)
---
Finally, here are some things definitely on the list, but will need to be addressed in later patches due to some code or functionality dependency on the first round of patches being completed beforehand.
---
There are a few requested changes that don‚Äôt have a definite timeline, but we feel would improve the game so will be implemented when time and resources are available in a later patch cycle.
---
=======.  
---
Note: I didn‚Äôt include unsolicited nerf/balance changes- honestly I don‚Äôt think they should even be looked at until bug fixes get to a manageable level.
---
RoF rate of fire. The 10 mm should never do as much damage as a Rifle because the rifle has a slow rate of fire.
---
The overall DPS should however be pretty similar for balance.
---
Personally IMO pistols should have a natural x2 damage for head shots not in VATS.
---
I'm not saying we need a nerf. That's not the point of the topic but being able to kill players on passive just to rob loot shouldn't happen. So in this case what would be your solution?
---
But it happens a ton of times
---
Okay, that's fine.
---
I think they fixed the bobbleheads issue. Did you claim a workshop then forget about it 20 minutes later?
---
I know how that is
---
Go to Tyler's fairgrounds..I think that's the right theme park
---
I'm not to sure about that. When you do the saboteur portion of mayor for a day his note talks about becoming paralyzed. 
---
Very entertaining story. I like it when the bullies get the tables turned on them.
---
Ha! Wishful thinking on your part. More like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8E_zMLCRNg)
---
Auction houses exist as guild stores so there is player vending; just use Tamriel Trade Center  mod and website for buying and selling so you know where to look for the good deals.
---
Its an anomaly i guess random game for a collector 
---
Thank you 
---
Yes, you still get packs every 5 levels and one chosen perk every level. You can forego the perk for one SPECIAL point swap.
---
I usually drop extras in the Flatwoods overseers box. I like the cash register idea, though.
---
What armor / DR do you have? What is your level? What was their level? What weapon did they use? Did you have a workshop? Were you in a team? Were they?
---
This is vague af, man.
---
PvP will not work correctly for at least next two years (don't make me wrong I have op PvP gear and can kill almost anyone but system is totally broken and there is no fun in it)
---
Just make only pve server as content and try to make it more stable, that's what I want
---
Lvl 177
---
Also the same style as her Mrs Nanny
---
aww, he wants attention :(
---
Thanks.
---
And? She's a voice actress who did a good goddamn job with her character - dafuq I care what she really looks like?
---
Severs have been fine for me. What system? Wifi or wired?
---
They can't. You had the junk in your inventory and forgot.
---
Losing the caps sucks, but all you can do is run or switch servers. 
---
Glad to see someone else noticing this post; this is such a major issue but clearly nobody cares.
---
I was killed by some dude who had a 196 cap bounty and never hit him he one shot me with a sledge hammer and I lost all the junk from my box I had none on me it just all disappeared from my box
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts, and especially that website. For the record I've been playing since BETA.
---
I just don't get how some people constantly get great 3-star items.
---
Believe what you want, last night after posting this I got my 1st 3-star Two Shot handmade from the SBQ. I took a photo: [https://imgur.com/a/iv6aDly](https://imgur.com/a/iv6aDly) 
---
Its subset was (surprise!) 33% Vats Chance, 1+ Agility. And we all know how useless that is.
---
In fact most 3-stars I get are terrible. E.g 1st and only bloodied 3 star rifle I got was a Railway rifle with if I recall correctly 1+ Perception and 33% Vats chance. I have it still on my alt so I can look it up and check if need be.
---
The first and only 3 star lever rifle was very similar. Executioner/ 33% vats chance/1+ Agility.
---
See the pattern?
---
Agreed. 
---
It's either a *very* rare bug or you're mistaken. I'm guessing the latter.
---
Anti griefing works on GTA pretty well.  Whenever you are passive,  no damage,  shots go through you just like you describe 
---
So are you still able to level up said perks (i.e. bring a perk card to level 3 from 2 even if you can‚Äôt level up S.P.E.C.I.A.L.‚Äôs? Thanks in advance.
---
Until then you‚Äôll remain unhealthy. It‚Äôs not a joke man. Have some self respect and stop being a mindless asshole. You won‚Äôt change the fact that there‚Äôs countless other mindless assholes out there. But 
---
&gt;~~Today's insider the vault~~ **FO76** was lazy.
---
small tweak, otherwise no concerns
---
Nope I made sure I put it in my box because they were near my camp so I put everything in my box and walked around with binoculars out to show I wasn‚Äôt doing anything he just followed me around and just killed me when I wasn‚Äôt looking 
---
No. Not even if they promised to full effort this finally and eliminate a full itemized list of things they‚Äôd fix that contained every known bug the game has right now. If I have to give up all those hours I‚Äôve already played just to give them a chance to fix something they should have done right already? No. That‚Äôs asking too much.
---
&gt;Some weapon mods are poorly named, like "Bladed" which could possibly apply to many weapons like Baseball Bat and Knuckles, but you can't tell which weapon the mod is for until you try to apply it.
---
Which coded stuff in Bracer? You mean the item and weapon formID info?
---
Ruh roh!
---
They just need to make a permanent perk card that If you select, you can not de-select. It should be a possible 5 star card, with each star representing a 10% budget increase up to 50%. Not all players are base builders, but for those of us who are, it would expand the game quite a bit. 
---
Regardless it just sucks. Who knows what legendary loot I left behind. It was either leave it behind of risk him Killin me and taking my farmed materials.
---
I still believe the conspiracy theory that Beth intentionally made it with horrible pvp/co-op to get people to stop asking for it like they did with 4. XD
---
I had no stuff on me I made sure I put everything in my box because I saw that they were around my camp so put everything in my box and then walked around with binoculars to show I was passive and he just followed me around and then killed me when I wasn‚Äôt looking 
---
I'm a BoS recruiter. I run commando. I don't use vats. My weapons are 1* even though I have 20,000 caps and could buy something nasty. Oh I do have a 3* weapon. None of the effects are damage boosting lol.
---
You're not missing anything. 
---
P
---
How about a Yao Guai the super mutants hopped up on FEV and put chunky armor on?
---
Missed tue part were they are looking into missile and heavy weapons damage and ammo weight. 
---
Game is still broken reboot will not fix that
---
Oh, well shit. I got my dates mixed up then. Thanks for the correction.
---
hopefully that means you won't post here as much :)
---
Even better I had 10 of each flux in my box cuz I was saving to build a decontamination shower :(
---
Well, the scorched didn't kill every single non scorched human...but most of them.
---
So there's an abomination for each leech hiding in the shed?
---
The game is made to pvp. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs broken, it‚Äôs that a player can make a perfect pvp build &amp; attack someone who isn‚Äôt built to pvp at all. Slap damage is there because they encourage pvp.       Yeah, maybe this was the wrong game for them to make online with pvp but that‚Äôs how it is. If someone is attacking you &amp; you are literally so under powered that they can kill you simply with slap damage rather quickly, then server hop.          
---
100% see this all the time. Clusters upon clusters. Especially if you are farming the one area. Watoga is another example.
---
'Their Strength is on the technical side of game development'
---
Let's be honest here, they have no strength and that studio is absolute dogshit. If THAT is their strength then this game is already dead, because the 'technical side' of this game is hilariously bad.
---
Neither do I but, I sadly understand programming and know it has to cost as it is an NPC tied to your camp and one of the things that could stress the servers. 
---
Yeah but you can only have one right?
---
voice seems to be patterned after Harley Quinn.
---
Don't think it should be a perk card but yeah some way to do that is needed for camp builders. The problem right now is if a card like that was added they could just use it to put 5 more turrets on their bases which as anyone who has gone to whitesprings knows those grind camps are a pain in teh ass. 
---
Only thing I ask, let this be a learning experience. Remember this moment, the next time you're contemplating buying a Bethesda game.
---
Isnt the robot just a fake who took on her personality?
---
Sweet. Now I feel all cool I figured that out before even knowing that. I‚Äôm sure something will promptly humble me but thank you for this info. Actually, that makes me curious what all else anti-griefing or anti-douchery techniques exist that other games already do.
---
Edit: yep. Stubbed my toe on a coffee table and spilled beer everywhere. I‚Äôm a fucking genius.
---
Same. 
---
Someone understands statistics and the importance of randomly selected groups :) 
---
That was hard to read
---
YEs only one tamed animal but that isn't the only NPC on the camp, the others are turrets, brahmin, and spot lights. 
---
The bear rug was purchased in Whitesprings. 
---
The fireplace in the Atom shop.
---
He doesn't have enough screws to fix his armor.
---
Yep, looking forward. I will be killed often unfortunately, maybe I luck into a good team :)
---
Huh? Is that comment meant for me?
---
If so, yeah, that's what those square brackets are.
---
Thanks üòÖ that's kind of what I was aiming for. I like the good comments on stuff like this. It's a guilty pleasure.
---
I know you can get hand mades from them thats what I pick them up for. Trying to get auto reciever 
---
Way ahead of you, haven't put the FO76 disc back in my XB1 since RE2 came out.

You raid players who take workshops to milk them for caps. There are many ways to make caps so no reason to do this. Workshops are designated PvP but anyone taking a workshop are at a huge disadvantage. It‚Äôs just shitty right now and you know it. There is 0 balance 
---
Pacifist, not Passive.  
---
If it makes you feel better, it could have been a Mutant Slayer‚Äôs Pickaxe or a Exterminator‚Äôs handmade with +40% bash damage. 
---
I hear that though, sometimes this BS is enough if it forces you to abandon good loot or something you needed on that specific server. As if bugs forcing us to hop or log in/out weren‚Äôt bad enough.
---
We get it, they nerfed  the tse weapon you bought off of ebay so you want your pound of flesh.
---
Be prepare to be subjected to the very mechanics of this website...
---
I highly doubt that all 170,000 subscribed users regularly post. And if they did, I highly doubt BGS would go through all of the posts. 
---
Besides, the people who post in this sub aren't even "average" for the sub itself. They are the most vocal of the users and that's because they tend to be the most upset about the developments. They are only hearing from people who are upset. That skews the data considerably.  
---
Bugger off I hate you, why are you joining my post's comments, I hate your name, you have horrible taste in fashion, your name is silly, you didn't end your sentence with a period. Stop one shotting low level players with your duped TSE shotgun, I know who you are, I'm reporting you to my Mom. Try going melee and you will understand why this sub complains about everything.
---
I hate Scorched and ghouls always bum rushing me and also mole rats.
---
Have a nice day :)
---
There are so many "final edits" on this post that I can't even find the original...
---
Right. What I'm proposing is more of a make space for it that's wasted if you don't have it, giving the illusion it's not taken into account.
---
thats cool, I  once had a comment I made long ago reach 500 dislikes, I'm hoping for a new high score someday.
---
Yes, but only with a fully retooled game with proper qa. 
---
&gt;Would you like to see more challenging enemies added in the future, that may **require** multiple players or a team to defeat? Why?
---
Yes, please make Todd "You can play the whole game solo" into a liar. That will really help BGS' reputation with its core customer base.
---
Happened to me, Flavors of Mayhem wouldn‚Äôt complete, server hopped....disappears from my quests, syringer gone and no loot for completing. I guess I just won‚Äôt finish that quest now.
---
Your statement doesn't sound believable.  Liking it when it is it's worse but hating it after it has bern improved doesn't add up.
---
Even if they are, I got a lot out of my 250+ hours...
---
I never said I didn't like the game. I went on to say even we liked the game, but the bugs were gamebreaking despite this being an established game that had already undergone testing and hasn't been fixed even this long out.
---
Whining about people's valid complaints simply because you might not have had as much trouble is dismissive, which was the point I was making in addition to the fact that this low quality isn't something people should be having to put up with this far out. And it shouldn't be glibly cast aside.
---
When we started playing and looking for answers to various bugs or different things in the game, we ended up directed here. Most of the results that came up were in hard defense while putting down people that didn't want to put up with an unstable game they paid full price for. Now months later and with little fixed still, even some big defenders are starting to crack. But "everyone is just *crying*." People can vent their frustrations and ask for more from a company asking their player base to shell out even more cash for a shop.
---
You can play through the bugs? Great. 
---
Join the imperial reaper group! We are a new mercenary team in the wasteland! We need creative players to make our RP even greater!https://discord.gg/ZxqWAt
---
I'm clearly not jealous I  just don't like seeing some invincible dude tearing up someones camp while they can't do anything about it that should be obvious besides my gears better because it survives crits too I just don't abuse it like all these sentinel armor people do I take it off for pvp which I rarely do anyway
---
That's not how this mechanic was supposed to work. They explained this several times before launch. Slap damage was supposed to take a tiny percentage of your health to initiate PVP. It's supposed to be so miniscule that it'll be impossible for the player to kill you on passive. This guy was melting my health as if I were standing in a blast zone with no gear. If you think that's because he has a "perfect build" then you must be a melee player.
---
You better believe I won't be pre ordering any game ever again. This was the first and last time. If anything I'll wait a year before even considering purchasing a bethesda release.
---
I‚Äôm a merchant on a subreddit here &amp; a lot of times I‚Äôll ask to trade with random players IF they‚Äôre not doing anything. If they‚Äôre hanging out around a station I‚Äôll request to trade to simply see if you have anything I want or vise versa. 
---
They announced a server limit of 24 players since day 1. While your idea sounds great (I'd play it) we all knew it would never be like that given the player limit.
---
We have all been scammed. Honestly, we should sue. No other product can be produced with this sort of shoty craftsmanship and be acceptable. Bethesda does not care, they made their money - any additional development is sinking more money into a lost cause; they have probably abandoned the project, save for a few individuals to keep the appearance of progress. 
---
Stop spreading misinformation.  You can no longer stack bobbleheads to increase damage.
---
Not saying you didn't honestly enjoy the game and are let down. But this comes off as a little... hyperbolic? 
---
It's not the fact of which legendary effects stay and go it's more who decided weapons and armour should have more than one, I have no problem fighting people with any legendary effect but stacking something, worst case, instating, tse, bloodied, armour piercing, furious any combination of those is just going to be extremely over powered where just having one legendary would be ok
---
Because it is one of many things they have to address.  When you have a list you have to prioritize. 
---
That is the biggest problem. They still don't have a pre-planned roadmap for where they want the game to be in 3-6 months. Anthem and Apex Legends both have visual roadmaps showing *guaranteed* future content.
---
I play rifleman, have never even seen a TSE, and my highest level is 31. Was tired of everyone complaining about anything they can, now tired of you. 
---
I hate ragers and children making bethesdas shit show of a game even worse.
---
Have nice day :)
---
Also my taste in fashion is top notch, thank you very much.
---
Ban inc
---
This is true. Why would you be worried about 'karma?'  
---
 If there were a useful faction happening I might be affiliated to one, and help out when I felt like it. 
---
It's a partial fix. They stopped players from duplicating items, but players with ridiculous amount of items still can be in the game since Bethesda can't take away their items. 
---
How so?
---
I almost never use range and if you eat he'd the clip you could tell using melee, switching melee and even a grenade didn't register damage
---
They have burned through so much goodwill from me im seriously doubting i'll ever pick up another fallout game again.. 
---
Im here thinking "i've done fallout now, i know the world inside out and have experienced the best of it" to justify not picking up the next one. I never would have thought that was possible with before this game. Damn. 
---
Also why no Tudor‚Äôs?
---
Attention. Duh. 
---
So, basically like the skyrim reboot where they patched the actual game a couple times then just left it broken... Thanks Bethesda for making yet another shit and broken game
---
Do you need a full set of Chameleon for it to work like this? I only have a Cameleon chest piece but I still get the invisible visual effect. 
---
That could be upvotes too. I was making a commentary on your asking OP to be prepared, not predicting the karma count of your post.
---
It feels like there's less and less players online every time I play, so I don't have any hope for content that relies on an active player base.
---
its as if you people never played through a online game with a Update,patch and hotfix style of development before. I need to check myself and understand even though its been prevalent since  the early 2000's that maybe, just maybe this is the first game you ever picked up.
---
Whoever thought legendaries with 3 effects and PvP would mix well is kinda dumb lol
---
The many things that they have to address because they are so backed up. If they truly cared enough to prioritize then they wouldn't be this backed up. Half these issues have been solved by modders working alone within weeks of previous games launches.
---
Yes exactly. We're geniuses. I have a couple friends with 5+ accounts they are so cheap. 
---
They keep putting hot sauce on shit instead of realizing they need to clean up the crap first.
---
I'm so bitter
---
True. Or it could have been the Instigating Lever Action I've been looking for. Well, at least he couldn't loot it either. He was just focused on trying to kill me rather than kill ghouls.
---
you only get upvotes if you trash the game.
---
Maybe you could have an option to be a soldier of fortune, help a faction win and get a bounty of caps/loot and if you lose you could be penalized the caps...I dunno, but I think there‚Äôs definitely something there that would please a lot of people 
---
Good. Get the fuck out.
---
X-01 power armor, 500+ DR, Level 52, Level 149, gauss rifle, no I didn't, no they weren't. 
---
well anecodte here. i played tonight and in a fight with 8 level 68 supermutants 4 dropped caps.
---
Yeah we will have to see how many people they let on the leader board and hell, how to even get on it. March will be very interesting if they do this right. Man I hope they do this right. History says otherwise.
---
Thats because it's reasonable for there to be issues in the first month. That understanding dissipates as time goes on. 
---
Very true. I was speaking strictly of numbers, as he/she said  the sub is a "teeny tiny percent" of the population. As for being a random selection, definitely not. Members are overly critical or overly praising with no real rhyme or reason. One of the downfalls of being fans of a franchise.
---
When I first started playing I would routinely kill all of the bots in there for the exp and junk. 
---
The vendor tho, is immortal and likely just wandered off somewhere. 
---
Or fans of video games...
---
That's strange. Every post made has both an upvote and downvote button next to it on my screen.
---
I've never had that happen 
---
You sure about that last part...
---
Yeah its only a matter of time before they nerf Fireproof. Like how they nerfed the White Knight armor perk...
---
&gt; &gt; Scorchbeast Queen Loot: In Patch 6, we‚Äôre also planning to fix a bug affecting the Scorchbeast Queen‚Äôs loot list, ******which often results in receiving the same plan as loot even after multiple Queen kills.****** ***Once this fix is live, the Scorchbeast Queen will be able to drop a wider variety of plans from her loot list***, which should also limit cases where players receive a duplicate plan. ***Additionally, we are also looking into ways we can make her loot list more ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù in the future.*** While we're still working on implementing that system, we will let you know as soon as we have more details to share.
---
I love fallout.  I actually really like Fallout 76, but Holy fuck!  How can they make the top priority for SBQ loot to be "different PLANS"??? WTF.  
---
How hard is it to just adjust her drop table so she drops a fucking decent legendary?
---
The hardest* and most annoying fight in the game and you're top priority is giving us a wider variety of plans?  
---
Do you understand what it means to be tone deaf?  
---
The most common complaint about fighting the "end game" boss isn't that we're not getting a wider variety of plans... It's that there are hardly ever, if ever, legendary drops!  That's It!!! (besides the fact that sometimes she just disappears and doesn't drop jack ruby shit or the server crashes)  
---
Depending on how many people (and their levels) join the SBQ fight, we can end up spending insane amounts of ammo and getting our armor shredded(which we now have to grind longer for)  for what? A New Fucking Plan? 
---
Goddammit, Bethesda.  
---
Serves me right for hanging in this long (250+ hours, level 205)
---
*By hardest, I mean for the lower levels.  I just spawned in whitespring with 3 level 80 scorchbeasts and took them out by myself with no problem, but also with no decent loot.  I'm complaining and spouting profanity on behalf of the lower levels and the noobs who I want to like this game.  Cause I want this game to succeed. 
---
I noticed that the Bethesda team has been silent almost all day today. Surely it's not due to backlash, and just due to lack of interesting CAMP posts. /s
---
Agreed
---
wait, huh? screen shot pls.
---
No judgement about your opinion of the game. That's what opinions are for, it's your delivery of that opinion that could use work.
---
Yes I understand why no one believes me but I swear I made sure my stuff was in my box before I went to look around 
---
3* ghoul dropped a light bulb for me yesterday. 
---
Polygon?  Never.again.
---
Oh I am a melee player since beta. Even in fallout 4 I‚Äôm a melee. The fact you have to resort to ‚Äúhe must be a melee player‚Äù shows you have no idea how to make a build. You can make a perfect pvp build with a sniper or heavy as well.               
---
Maybe learn to make a better build or upgrade your current armor. Or simply server hop. 
---
well....looking at how it took a modder only weeks to code a complex working text chat mod for the game while the developers themselves are apparently too incompetent for that...speaks for itself...
---
What a load of lying shit. Everything just randomly popped out of your stash because you were killed? 
---
 I have 2 at 50+ and I am pleased with them. The present one walks everywhere and is a generally nice guy, most of the time. ;) He is a Scorchbeast hunter and seeks out Fissures and owns them. I would pay heavily for a 'pissing in the fissure', Photo Pose thing. ;)
---
I also play The Division PvP for the loot :)
---
I basically only play PvP games that reward me with loot except Fortnite, no idea why I play that game on and off again.
---
If that's the case, how was I killed in three hits despite not attacking?
---
oh cool, another cj thread.
---
Why would I lie about my stuff disappearing?
---
I'd honestly just be happy if they used the lowest value cores first instead of the highest.
---
I like that idea, I haven't tested it though. Are you on PC?
---
The make is easier to look up the items in the game files....
---
Brave
---
I don't, and i loved it at first. Then it just got worse, and eventually wore me down to complete apathy towards it. It's so broken, the bugs dominate any time i spend on it. Im getting rid as soon as i get my platinum..
---
Yepper. But if you only had enough of the stat to equip the level 2, then you'd need to remove another level 1 perk somewhere.
---
PS4?
---
You're kind of an asshole man...
---
I mad about this and honestly it‚Äôs frustrating because of the stuff that I lost why does no one believe me I don‚Äôt know how this happened or why 
---
Logic? You absolute madman.
---
To view the other effects, examine the item in your inventory.
---
Will add to the NPC's one!
---
That isn‚Äôt the issue he was talking about...bobble head *effect* stacking is dead. You can‚Äôt pop multiple bobble heads for big damage bonuses anymore.
---
Server update lag maybe, it's the same way people dupe items.
---
Server doesn't update live but can take  up to a couple minutes, so if you put items in stash and are killed shortly after, the server doesn't update the new info fast enough and treats your junk in its state the server last updated.
---
Not 100% on this just what I've picked up from YouTube video etc, so take with a pinch of salt.
---
Nope, works fine anytime. 
---
Go outside and roleplay. It's free. These bastards basically ripped us off for $60 bucks.
---
I would love to see an enemy vault. This would be a test vault that was indoctrinated with the idea of eradicating all mutant life on the surface, including any humans who have been exposed. They would basically be total zealots who never appear without environmentally sealed suits or power armor, love to use flame weapons to purify earth and are generally incredibly well armed and dangerous. The kicker would be that they actually have a GECK or even multiple GECKs, they were just intended as a plan B, in case humanity finds itself unable to compete with new mutant lifeforms. Problem is that they full on believe they must kill every last living thing before they can successfully restore anything. 
---
I would also love to see these guys introduced in a subversion of the Fallout 2 intro sequence, where the vault opens up, except the people inside the vault are in power armor and are gunning down everyone outside with miniguns. 
---
Thanks again...   
---
\-Will add to the reload bug list.  
---
\-Peaking Quickly I didn't see it...  
---
\-Added Bladed Issue.   
---
\-Added Grognak   
---
 I bought one off Wallace. Could not believe it, grabbed it quickly and snuck away. ;)
---
I pray your right my box weigh dropped though... honestly I don‚Äôt believe it happened myself because other people think I‚Äôm lying :/ I just want to know where my stuff went 
---
I have an extra marsupial, healing factor, and adrenal reaction.   3k caps each. 
---
I'd be down with co-op only outside of specific events (e.g. "Monster Mash", where it's at contained thing that you opt into. Same with Hunter/Hunter).
---
Wasn‚Äôt trying to be. It just sucks as a melee player to watch everyone complain about TSE then immediately start to complain about melee after the TSE nerf. With the way fallout is, you‚Äôll always be able to make a build that crushes other players until they completely change the way it works. 
---
Prepare for the downvotes... oh well,  you spoke your mind! :p
---
What about the scorched not having brains enough to swap out a FC? Scorched only use mob tactics. What happens in the glass cavern to leave them with memorys of past training enough to remain a unit? That's unit caught behind a minor cave in so the plague took longer to take root? A few story ideas might help sell this one. Anyone?
---
Not developed by Bethesda. Bethesda Softworks, a publisher, is doing just fine. Bethesda Game Studios, a developer, has lost a lot over this crap. 
---
There‚Äôs a building in Helvetia (Forest Region) that has a pool table with all the billiard balls on it - that‚Äôs one of my go-to plastic farming locations!
---
Nobody rage quits on Thursday.
---
we the supreme councilor of redditors, are quite angry you didn't get our notes on what this inside the vault was supposed to cover. THIS GAMER IS RISING UP.
---
But I have to wait a few decades for a nuclear wasteland, though. At the very least, I want to get some practice in!
---
Exactly, maybe in pve but PvP is overpowered
---
Yet, those posts are getting upvoted, giving a sense of how many people in this community it's feel. 
---
I also notice some posts that have a positive leaning get upvoted.
---
It's almost like Reddit allows people to give their opinions, and others upvote or downvote them.
---
Amazing how this site works, isn't it...
---
Also it's technically incest because gen 3 synths are made from Shaun's DNA.
---
I‚Äôm calling BS, too. What the hell is wrong with this sub and tall tales trolling?
---
I'd like there to be a different boss monster for every location you decide to nuke. Perhaps a giant grafton monster holding a billboard like a picket-sign club if you nuke Grafton. 
---
PC yes. Haven't tested it yet. Will test in March. 
---
Works well in The Division. I like playing a tactician build whilst others like high DPS builds. 
---
For every level after 50 you gain an increased  chance for server disconnects, vats misses, getting stuck in your power armor, or vendors glitching.
---
Looks exactly like my cousin, it's the weirdest thing.
---
+1 for ManyATrueNerd. One of my favourite Youtubers.
---
Totally get it...
---
For the record I think it's a Seed followed by a Server Adjustment to that table...
---
Getting over 300 upvotes not counting the downvotes for a post that took me 30  seconds. Pretty sure my delivery is fine. Goodnight. 
---
That could work, but the moment people figure out that is what is being done then people will get pissed.  
---
Though boiled down that is what this topic's main suggestion is anyway. 
---
Oh shit dude that‚Äôs nice! I got me a primo 3 star steel scrap once from a legendary Watoga protectron. But that‚Äôs nothing compared to your fuse! 
---
Yeah, because wishing for less people to be talking about and/or playing the game will surely help the current situation.
---
Have you seen his vid...why fo3 is better than you think, it lasts like 2 hours or so but it's a great watch.
---
Love matn vids, nuka world LV 1 is also another gem.
---
I played wow horde on PvP servers. I guess that gives me ridiculous expectations for PvP balance 
---
It‚Äôs sequential. And only one says final. Maybe remove the fedora from your eyes. Good night. 
---
The RNG is pretty ruthless outside
---
Who cares? No one's flashing pictures of Katherine Pawlak when they talking about what Sunny Smiles looks like.
---
&gt;I am convinced at this point they are just hoping we'll lose interest with the game and move on to something else so that they don't have to work on it anymore. 
---
This is exactly what I think, too. If the last of the players give up and go away they can write the whole thing off and stop spending any more money on it.
---
I agree- I also hope you get what you want ('cause I'm selfish and want it too :-) )
---
\[Bethesda Game Studios Austin\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda\_Game\_Studios\_Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin)) is the culprit in this. A development team with no successful track record making, well, anything.
---
I don't have a pet, and with my BoS camp I have no plans to obtain one, but if someone wants a camp exactly like mine but with a dog, they should allow it
---
Not even. Is there a gif for deafening silence?
---
Yes I do.  This company is known for this sort of thing.  
---
[Bethesda Game Studios Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin) is the culprit in this. A development team with no successful track record making, well, anything.
---
I think they must program the Scorchbeasts to target new CAMPS in some areas.  The day I built mine on the Golf Course I got chased home and my CAMP was nearly levelled. They seem to ease up after the initial few attacks on my CAMP.   
---
Pleb 
---
Ahh Cheetos, the President of The FO76 Fanboy Club
---
Yep. That's one of the main reasons why I highly recommend his videos.
---
Really not even sure what karma does on Reddit. I‚Äôve only ever made two topics on all of Reddit myself. I‚Äôve explained all this in another reply here. Good night. 
---
I feel that a fair amount of it is people just not understanding the somewhat convoluted pvp system.
---
one piece works
---
Not sure I would say always. Melee is way overpowered though. Ultimately it's a bad implementation though, melee shouldn't be doing insane damage when compared to a minigun, it should probably be doing more cripple effects and staggers though. And miniguns should have the same per bullet damage but slow spinup, heat management, and insane recoil. The balance of things is just all jacked up.
---
He does have a point though. I do perfectly fine damage with my build and a lever action in PvP. But I can't indefinitely wail on someone who is passive. I have reloads, durability, and ammo to deal with. Melee can go virtually nonstop without an issue. They need their damage tied to current ap percentage or something so it's more bursty and less overpowered.
---
Ok, I‚Äôll bite. What other time, and for which game, did they release a patch that clearly reverted changes from a previous patch?
---
I found that picture early on and captured it for a loading screen. Didn‚Äôt know who it was
---
someone got 5000+ for an I Quit post on patch day, bfd, that's why it's called karma farming. Wait till Bethesda does something, bitch about it, profit.
---
In a broken ass game rampant with hacking, why is this hard to believe? 
---
I suspected you were a melee build because instead of having a normal conversation you instead rationalized a broken mechanic by praising your own build. I know how to make a build perfectly fine by the way but you're missing the point entirely due to your complete ignorance. The point is I'm on passive simply farming. I don't care to PVP at that moment. As for my character, I'm lvl 120 with fully decked out PA and he was still able to inflict that much damage. You're assuming that I'm fresh out of the vault the same way I assume you either skimmed passed what I wrote just to defend your build or you are intellectually challenged.
---
Brave, give this true gamer some upvotes!
---
You must not understand ROLLPLAY not cos play. Play real RPGS for ohh 2 decades then say that.
---
After the character you have spent every Thursday for 6 months building him up gets killed by traitorous dice. And your GM tells you to come by early next week to roll up a new one.
---
What? Your logic makes no sense what so ever. Caring about prioritizing game bugs and content rebalancing has nothing to do with speed.
---
Mods mods that are done that fast are addressing small issues and they are spread across multiple people.  Until one group combines them into one convenient download.   But even then those mods can go though multiple versions because other errors pop up because of those mods.
---
Lucky! How is it?
---
Didn't improve too much a little bit yes, but mainly old bugs were replaced by new bugs
---
There has been tons of bizzare and false claims here so nothing can be taken at face value. It sucks, it's not quite fair, but too many have cried wolf here before.
---
I just enjoy grinding and leveling up and exploring; not sure what category that is.
---
The real endgame 
---
Did you check the blue suitcase in the station? I left plenty in there for free.
---
Only hold on if you‚Äôre willing to wait half a year or more
---
Or just make pvp cap at weapon cap... 
---
Messaged you
---
Try looking on r/fo76bazaar , many players will sell the mutation serums for around 100 to 400 caps
---
204 - separate 
---
Any weapon can kl in passive mode... Tickle damage adds up Ya donkey 
---
 its real good. Hits at 116 normally so one shots abound. Its really the gun I use the most, and I have em' all.
---
Who the hell are these random people on this sub just giving gold to any random comment or post. This is literally someone just linking to another article. I swear I see more golds here than anywhere else on Reddit. 
---
&gt;and a game cancelled by Bethesda.
---
This is why I set my expectations low for fo76. Battlecry looked like a mediocre game at best. Then it got cancelled. I wonder if it had anything to do with how bad Battleborn did and figured people might get it mixed up with that game.
---
I never thought the result would be this bad though.
---
Is that a reply from Bethesda in this sub?
---
&gt;This was actually my ***most favorite*** game in the world  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I defended it *against* my friends
---
*Emphasis added*
---
Even if 100% true, the language is very strong. Like the stereotype of non-native English speakers saying things like "most best excellent extra happy fun times!" It just doesn't sound natural. 
---
Sorry you're bummed out though. Do you have any games looking bright in the future? A lot of people burned by Bethesda are hoping Outer Worlds becomes the Fallout we didn't get. That look good to you or you got any other titles you waiting for? 
---
Oh god i havent read the new ITV ill come back to this post hol up lmao
---
They could up their Atom game as well honestly.  Other than when my kid smashed his 2yr old fingers on the keyboard and spent some atoms for me I haven't spent any since launch.  I would of gotten the blackbird paint but it was already gone when I found out it was a thing.  
---
The skins for armor/pa/weapons have been scarce and men to me, would love to see more.
---
Not really. If you have a work shop. u can easily catch players off gaurd. First if they try to claim, they are confined to that work bench. Turrets around it forces the player to take them out asap. Giving the defender an easy clean opportunity.
---
Better yet, if you see a bypasser, who may be a raider. Just keep aiming at him and if he tries to claim. Take him out. What I usually do if some tries to take my factory. I go chameleon and watch them make the mistake, once they go red, i barrage em. Done.
---
But the disadvantage applies to those who turns a blind eye towards invaders.
---
Man, I was just wondering if I did something completely random, would it get attention and it did!
---
Shows how this community is feeling. Lol
---
It's like a flipping essay, but flipping good, I flipping love his vids, he knows his flipping fallout.
---
Yea which old bugs replaced by new ones? Is there proof of theses bugs and how to recreate them for the support team?
---
A 2 year old account that made a dozen posts a year ago then pops up and starts to complain about this game is a bit suspicious. 
---
The cat lady's house.  It's a house next to an unmarked farm near Bolton Greens golf course, near Morgantown.  It has lots of Cat Bowls.
---
Other than that, it's really just remembering the things that give you plastic that you may not consider, like Enamel Buckets, Pens, Cafeteria Trays, Golf Balls, Billiard Balls, etc.

I‚Äôve had players with AA minis murder my melee build. The melee build that‚Äôs wrecking pvp is the vanguard set &amp; once you start taking damage that boost from vanguard goes down quick. &amp; if you‚Äôre running around &amp; using marsupial then there is almost no chance I‚Äôm gonna hit you with my melee unless I use VATS &amp; even then it‚Äôs still hard.          
---
But you‚Äôre right, with passive on you shouldn‚Äôt deal or take damage. 
---
Welcome to the Wasteland
---
I go there when I need gears and screws... lotsa typewriters.
---
Something with the power armor filters and the chems they had on them slowed the progress of the plague enough to keep some of their memories intact, just not the higher functions. So their trained instincts, like fighting as a squad, still remain but things like coherent communication and friendly interactions with outsiders are gone.
---
Favorite comment of 2019 
---
Indeed
---
How about fixing what they have before adding more? 
---
I have the Exterminator's Lever action. That combined with Adrenaline + Gun-fu, woo wee. Heads just pop. I can't wait to upgrade to Instigating. I retired my Quad Handmade because of it.
---
You actually got a drop be thankful
---
In my hundred+ hours I have never had people fuck with me so the way I see it is the current servers are PvE. I do had pacifist mode on. So we don't a 3rd server splitting up the player base even more.
---
Yep, I agree. The other day I saw two guys flatten a lower-level players' house and contents completely then kill him.  They decided to leave mine alone, perhaps because I was better protected and wearing Power Armour.  This is what some people think is PvP.  It was just petty low bullying and it didn't make me feel good about this game.  Funny thing is, they asked me to join their team and were waving furiously for me to go with them.  No, thanks. Up yours, fellas.
---
Lol salty. 
---
But you don‚Äôt know the ages. You just made that up. The average age of most gamers is like 33. (XBOX leaked internal data)
---
It‚Äôs really sad that people spread false information I‚Äôm not on this subreddit much i only really trade but it‚Äôs really bad that‚Äôs what has become of this Reddit :/ I don‚Äôt know why anyone spread false shit about bugs on a game tho but I don‚Äôt understand how this shit happens how he hell does a game just give my series stuff up??
---
117/82, i like combined but i feel like actual pvp currently doesn't exist.
---
Since Bethesda won't voluntarily do it, going off the idea behind your comment, this is the fo76 community forcing Bethesda to take the game offline, fix their shit from the ground up and then bring the game back. 
---
Yeah, that was just the first thing that came to mind. I just don't want them to think "Yes, more challenging enemies" means "Yes, please add more bullet sponges".
---
I've heard about this before, and there seemed to be some confusion on whether or not it had been fixed, although the possibility that the Tesla Rifle is totally exempt from this may also be an explanation.
---
I think that‚Äôs Fallout 4 where you eventually get the French  bot a body (I forget how), but then she‚Äôd sleep with you.
---
Step one: See unrepresented community of which you are a part.
---
Step two: Create a subreddit for it
---
Wait, do you think they would be upfront and honest about how little they are working on the game? They can't even dress this update up any better than hyping 2 meagre fixes and an atom store plug. That's basically nothing at all. It's become so obvious that the game isn't going to get much better, if at all. I'm laughing to myself thinking back to some of my older thoughts "at least the DLC will be free". HA! i can can barely play the game through the bugs as it is and the game came out 4 fucking months ago..
---
I would always take that with a hint of sarcasm but you‚Äôre probably actually right. At least that‚Äôs what it feels like lately.
---
What system? 
---
Bethesda: 
---
&gt; Thanks for the $60 dollars! It was fun while it lasted, suckers. 
---
That‚Äôs actually adorable.
---
There should be a nuke going off in there every 30 seconds.
---
Not salty at all. Just stunned by your inability to reason or read. 
---
They might be too busy looking for new jobs.
---
internet trolls using the duper crisis to harass people,  MY GOODNESS. just block and server hop. You'll never see them again.
---
That could be really cool and yeah, I want some more variety in apparel of scorched. Full power armor, chunks of it where some of it fell off, pieces of regular armor. Maybe a scorched wearing the tattered remains of a red evening dress. Come on people, add some variety.
---
Agreed. I want Faction warfare 
---
I think they just call that ‚Äòplaying the game.‚Äô
---
They're PVPers checking you out to see if you're species for PVP, if they they can take you out, they'll attack.  If they think you can kill them they'll pretend they wanted to trade. 
---
More salt. Lol. 
---
She beds you with her synth body.
---
Like the fella once said:
---
Ain't that a kick in the head? :-\]
---
No.  There are a lot of single-players.  The programming needs to be adequate to cater for both teams and single players.  If they can't do that, they need to leave it alone.  At least half of us are loners, which is probably what attracted us to the Lone Survivor aspects of Fallout in the first place.  You can't change the game to make it unplayable for single-players to keep you lot happy. 
---
76 has a robot who says shes a person, but you find that person, and you find out she somehow just started acting like this person out of  nowhere
---
You mean modders? 
---
Just write that goodbye letter, you'll feel much better. I remember getting emo and super pissy at world of warcrafts content release schedule back in the day. Just find something else to play, it will make you happier than trying to pin all your frustrations on a video game.
---
You think it won't be used to be fucked up?
---
Haven't you guys supposedly addressed this already? Wtf happened last time you addressed this issue?
---
Well, someone was saying how this sub represents very little of the player base of the game. So pretty much everyone is complaining and making suggestions to deaf ears...even tho it ‚Äúseems‚Äù Bethesda is actively in the sun. 
---
Really it seems like pretty much any other company in the world. Put out their product then eh it the rest of the way. I mean fuck I‚Äôve complained since Christmas about my sons hoverboard. This company claims they have great customer support...it took over a month of a simple response.
---
Just another American business just doing great things for themselves and the economy 
---
They‚Äôre being downvoted for caring more about winning an argument than the truth. That and being a prick.
---
By this point, I really wonder how many people work at BGS Austin. Because it doesn't seem like a lot.
---
During an SBQ fight I have accidentally started a trade when I am jump-jetting or VATSing and some knucklehead backs into me...  LOL!
---
Yeah, for me, I don't compare 76 to previous Fallouts as much as I do to something like Cities Skylines.  It's a comforting FPS that I can chill out to at the end of the day.
---
The log out button is my favorite.  But you have to beat the game to it.  You vs machine.  Log out vs blue screen.
---
Who will win?
---
Til you realize her AI is messed up and she enjoys running up and punching everything rather than shooting them with her lazer rifle...
---
It's good to see this sub finally coming around, after months of rabid and blind support. 
---
They know this game is dead. It's a meme at this point. 
---
"Untitled entry"?  They couldn't even be bothered to name it?
---
I feel like my only driving force right now is to hit level 100 for the achievement but knowing this shit show it won‚Äôt pop. Wish there was more to do for the next 20 levels though.
---
Good luck finding 8+ players. Sometimes there are 4 on the server. 
---
Some used super glue. Class of ‚Äò83.
---
I wonder if they just have a skeleton crew on this game at this point?
---
This doesn‚Äôt seem at all like the kind of patch notes I would expect from a full team of a AAA developer. 
---
50, separate.  
---
Matn is an awesome YouTuber. Love all his fallout series
---
If you're talking about Patrol Duty then yeah, it can drop the plans but it's pretty rare.  I did it a few times a while back and never got them, so I just bought them from someone here.  You're probably better off just grinding for the caps.  
---
Here's the thing though:
---
Why would the server be set up to render all of the items in your storage? Why not have a list of items and their quantity? What's stopping them from doing that, and if they already are what problems would unlimiting stash sizes actually cause?
---
I'm 145 and I have yet to get a single mutation or a  legendary that actually works for me.
---
Fallout 4 has never been multiplayer or on the server.
---
&gt; Guess I'll try YouTube.  
---
Yeah...that's a great idea if you want unbiased opinions and help in this game. 
---
It does for everything that isn't the bulking window?
---
I appreciate your post mate
---
And serious upvote for the matn referencing
---
His play through of the series and the why fo3 is better than you think. All great.
---
Ur right as well. This is a fallout game. Old tunes on the radio. Exploring. Reading tonnes. And finding hidden Teddy bears in odd poses is the game. 
---
Yeah this seems like the kinda patch notes youd expect from maybe an indie dev. or just like, one dude bored on a weekend... 
---
Imagine caring more about your master than your fellow slave.
---
Me too. That would be awesome. Make the factions meaningful distinctions. Not something you can just grab all of. The basis of it is already there with the Free States and BoS supposedly fighting against each other but it has no meaningful impact on the game as is.
---
I ran into some Bros parked behind the whitesprings golf course with rocket turrets blasting... The server started acting up and they started talking on the area mic saying 'dupers are making the server act up, let's go get 'em!'...
---
Palmface... 
---
I wonder if most of Bethesda Austin is working on MP for Starfield or the next Elder Scrolls at this point?
---
They don‚Äôt seem interested at all in continuing this game. 
---
I don‚Äôt think this is an unpopular opinion at all. I think there‚Äôs a TON of things 76 could do to facilitate this more. (Many of which were lost in the transition from 4 -&gt; 76. I see a few metagaming posts but mostly people complain about the BUGS, loss of old features. It hits roleplayers hard imo.
---
Sadly, I sold the Two Shot to a vendor.  I still have the AA and, for the time being, I'm going with it rather than the Berserker.
---
The Two Shot wasn't that impressive to me.  I'm sure it would have been prior to Patch 5, but the +50% limb cripple, the Furious bonus, and the benefits of cutting past armor seemed to outclass the nerfed Two Shot prefix.
---
Um say again? I don‚Äôt quite understand what you said
---
Also Bethesda wanted to make GTAV money
---
YES! Where are the biscuits?!
---
Now your talking nice.
---
I‚Äôm sure I could say the same shit on their official forum and it would be the same thing. This business plan of pushing out trash to fix later down the road is horseshit and getting old.
---
i feel really really bad for you.
---
This is why you don't shill for companies. 9 times out of 10 they don't have your best interest in heart its all about the money. 
---
Interesting. I guess this is how someone would fool themselves into thinking they dusted someone in a conversation by making the same rebuttal over and over. It's like watching a chimp snort coke from my point of view. Fascinated but at the same time disturbed.
---
Ok, you you won. I'm "salty". Now move along and try not to hurt yourself.
---
Correct, I'm waiting to receive my free merch from Bethesda for being such a die hard fan. 
---
Zach Mayo... he wants jets. I taught in a prison for several years... inmates always had mayonnaise packets on them. Not ketchup or mustard... just mayo. Figured out it‚Äôs their lube. Beats going dry I guess. Moral: Don‚Äôt go to prison.

You don't need to look far get rad worms and check your mutations food bonuses, unless rad worms changing you in to super man are normal.
---
PS I deleted Reddit 2 years ago just recently installed it again
---
Blood for the blood god.
---
Great list, how about make the 50 Cal receiver on the hunting rifle do more dammage than the 308, otherwise why the bloody hell would you make the upgrade?
---
But yet I fell for behind the scenes at Bethesda on how awesome this game will be. Except for the fact they literally over coded the shit out of this single player engine from previous fallouts
---
Exactly, I‚Äôve been posting all night about it...give us a ‚Äúhome base/castle‚Äù that‚Äôs unique to each faction, make us defend it. Give us faction unique rewards like PA Paint or skins for our weapons if we‚Äôre successful. Let other factions try and raid or storm our castle. Can you imagine standing on top of the Asylum with your fellow Paladins watching as the Enclave or the Staters march up the hill towards you....that will make it more dangerous to run around also, at least without backup nearby. If you ran up on a group from a rival faction...who knows. I play this game about 95% solo but I love this idea. 
---
But with how the armour system works, higher alpha damage &gt; higher RoF with the same theoretical DPS.
---
This means high RoF guns (like the minigun) are FAR less powerful than, say, a musket with the same DPS.
---
You care into the sub and poured gasoline and lit the match and now you‚Äôre acting like a smug prick to these people who are asking what the fuck is your problem. 
---
Dick move. 
---
LOL, you really think they'd waste their resources to do something like that?
---
any suggestions?
---
PS4 :( but your playstyle is awesome!
---
You couldn‚Äôt even take the criticism &amp; argue about the difference in builds. You immediately went to insulting my intelligence. You don‚Äôt know how builds work in fallout, simple as that. Not gonna argue with a kid who has to use insult after insult to defend themselves. 
---
Brief answer and wise advice from a LVL 185: No.
---
Ew.
---
Just like umm... the situation you're in when posting, holding on hurts you in the long term. Better to let it all go and maybe revisit later on when the game is in a healthier state.
---
Or it's flushed down the toilet and you never have to worry about it again. Either or, relief.
---
How long are you going to be a shill? Lmao the game has been in a horrible state since launch people have a right to be upset.
---
They admitted to moving on to developing the other games?
---
As in most of Bethesda Austin? Or Todd Howard‚Äôs dev team?
---
Good idea.  Even I would bother with them if that was the case.  The build menu would have to have a separate blueprint category for workshops at each location.  I think that they would say this would take up too much memory. 
---
I also think that the CAMPS and stash contents should be stored in our own memory, when we're logged off, so that the size can be larger. We'd just have to opt for a bit more game storage space, which is no big deal.
---
I managed to do it for my first time and one of my targets was at the airport in the middle South. I almost killed him, but he called in a vertibot and everything started wacking out, then got disconnected. 
---
And dose curing them fix problem?
---
Handful of posts.  Deletes reddit.  Returns specifically to complain about a game on a platform you ignored for 1 year. It is very odd.
---
TBH seemed like another stalling tactic.  See we‚Äôre engaged with the community, we‚Äôre asking for your feedback!
---
Lone Wolf, no club. Sorry.  I'd prefer cooperative settlements being able to trade with and defend each other. 
---
I know, it's disgusting how many people will blindly support a corporation, when their main gain is to take your money. 
---
Maybe if this game wasn't Bethesda's first blunder, it would be more understandable - but they've proven how little they care plenty of time to know this game was just a way to suck quick money from the rabid, willingly to blindly support fans before the release of the next fallout series that shows how little they actually care about the IP
---
72, Seperate
---
u bulked them. Once u bulk, they go to ur inventory and u have stash them again.
---
Give me instant gratification or  I'll post on social media about it!. Where were you when the UPDATES? PITIFUL,PATCHES?DISGUSTING....HOTFIXES? https://youtu.be/07So_lJQyqw
---
It actually is all true. Out of all the games I‚Äôve played Fallout 76 instantly became on the top of the list. I had a lot of fun from the beginning leveling up and playing with friends. Before I knew it I had logged in 300 hours and it startled me when I saw it. Before the most recent update I managed to pry myself off of it for a good week and head back onto Black Ops 4 and Battlefield V. Then fell right back into it up until the update.
---
But other games I‚Äôm really looking forward to is Anthem. My friend who I played Fallout with was constantly talking to me about it for the past few months while I thought about it. After watching a video on it finally I thought it wasn‚Äôt for me. Then he was playing the Beta last weekend and I saw it was an open Beta. So I downloaded it and surprised him and played with him for a bit. I honestly love it! It being an open Beta was the same reason I bought Battlefield V, I got a taste of it and knew it was for me.
---
He also managed to get me to buy Elder Scrolls Online over the weekend as well with Anthem. Given that it‚Äôs a Bethesda title and I‚Äôve lost hope in them about now, I know these games are far from being end game since they‚Äôre practically unable to be completely completed. Plus I plan on buying the rest of the DLC‚Äôs for Fallout 4 and Skyrim itself as well to have fun on.
---
I do plan on maybe trying Fallout 76 again soon but with almost every aspect of the game getting changed in the last update it just feels entirely different now. Maybe I finally got burned out since I‚Äôm pretty much maxed out or what not. But 76 near the beginning was a blast. I personally compare 76 to the past months to the last few weeks. One great, the other bad. It really looks like they‚Äôre not trying anymore, as well as nerfing everything and not changing the few things we actually desire.
---
Paid $80 day one, currently 200 ish hours play time 
---
Got my money's worth and then some, no regrets 
---
The MIRV frag grenades display a pistol instead of a grenade in the quick use wheel.
---
They ate each other when the food ran out?   If I was trapped in a vault with most people, I'd become homicidal. 
---
Ok.  Not taking your remark personal because I'd have to care about your approval. Have a nice night.
---
You picked some weird shit to overanalyze.
---
I lost all my bulk materials a while ago and just never billed them again 
---
Two months ago I would have made a ‚Äúseason‚Äù character lvl 1 that could only play with other fresh season characters.  Way too late now.
---
Roleplayers, please, for the love of God; understand you are the minority of players.  It's like being upset that mainstream porn isn't catering to furries.  Like, no shit dude.  It doesn't matter if you have a con where you get to dress up like a fox and throw shitty diapers around the hotel.  Most people don't enjoy your kink.
---
I played DnD and other tabletops for years, I've played games as a FP'er before.  We aren't and never were the core audience for video games.  Stop acting that your viewpoints on mainstream culture are going to be represented.  They aren't, no more than mainstream US Sports is suddenly going to realize that neglecting women's Soccer is a commercial failure.
---
You aren't the core audience unless people specifically say that is their goal.
---
Well played üòÇ
---
I bought a new console and the game on day 1... had been playing on a Xbox360 for years, but just HAD to get my hands on the newest installation of my favorite franchise. #fml
---
It crashed me constantly when I used it so I stopped.  Then, I stopped playing the whole game.
---
Thanks, and will add
---
shut down, fire staff, rebuild, and refund and/or give people currently playing a lot of game loot to make up for the restart when it comes back up. 
---
&gt;I have spent the atoms I earn in game just because, but I would probably actually spend money on atoms if one they actually had useful things in there and the prices weren't way over inflated.  They are just way too expensive for me to want to spend real money. But I would love to see more armor skins (especially for the excavator pa), gun skins and a little more variety for camp items (hell the price the want for one floor skin should be a bundle pack if different skins). I don't see them doing any real price adjusting anytime soon so I will just go playing and wait for the day that modding servers come along for the cool stuff.
---
I feel you on the legendary front. I‚Äôve yet to find anything really worth a damn. My strongest weapons are a lever rifle with rifleman perks w/VATS focus and the All Rise. Mutations were one of my boredom things and just spent a good day farming them. Locked in ones I wanted and I‚Äôve kept them. But now what‚Äôs next?  No easy route here though. I‚Äôve yet to attempt to trade with a person. Maybe that‚Äôs part of my problem but the way this game works I‚Äôm afraid to do so. I just want new content or a hint of some.
---
You're still trying to spin this? Look, you win. I'm straight out the vault with no gear and just a pipe pistol while farming in White Springs. Now crack open that Mountain Dew and smash the empty can on your forehead in celebration. Melee is the best! You proved it. 
---
Can I buy one off you? I just lost mine to this same bug
---
Bethesda in general. Dumping this onto Bethesda Austin shoulders and going dark. When Pete Hines started hiding we all pretty much knew.
---
Im sure Outerworlds will turn out very well and make it's money's worth 10-fold. Hopefully that opens Bethesda's eyes to stop this EA type behavior bullshit.
---
Couldn't a person just move their CAMP to prevent its destruction or is it locked to a location once being attacked? If not just move that shit away so it all ends up in storage
---
Inside Todd's Vagina
---
It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs virtually zero effort to deliver.  That‚Äôs all they can do at this point. 
---
Absolutely. My boyfriend and I would have gotten lost in that game, had that been the reality.
---
I‚Äôm trying to be nice üòÇ 
---
I leave excess scrap, ammo, armor, plans, etc., to the Flatwoods overseer's stash, as i am camped right next to it. Glad to know others do similar, and that it's appreciated. 
---
How do you get past that all your characters have the same name?
---
You should talk it personal.
---
What you did in this sub was not something a nice person does. 
---
I want you to realize that. Nice people don‚Äôt do that. You need to recognize and understand that if you want to mature and be respected. 
---
Lol
---
PvP is first because all they need to do is new icon and remove PvP restrictions. (If you think balancing... They don't even know what it means)
---
It hasn't happened to me but you could just let them kill you :/ Not the best solution since you'll loose your junk but they will get no caps neither experience plus they'll get wanted. Melee might be OP if they're already close but without the slap first hit they are the easiest to kill when wanted.
---
He said it is show separately in the other workbenches. Craft a weapon, it show all your junk. 
---
I‚Äôve stated at least 10 times that it needs the ‚Äúa realm reborn‚Äù treatment. People think that‚Äôs bold but...it worked for FFXIV...
---
You‚Äôre right.  The patch is more of a curse than a blessing.
---
Works for me. When go to craft ammo, it shows all the bulk lead at least in the count.
---
Go find its underground bunker now!
---
Lol totally sums up my time posting and with the game.
---
run a circuit of areas you know you'll get a lot of gun/legendary drops. You can travel to 4 of the 5 vendors pretty easily. That's about 800 a day, they cost about 1500, so in two days of following your circuit and getting 200 per vender you can have them in 2 days
---
I think it's pretty clear they realized they weren't going to be able to milk their fans of all their pennies and decided to shift resources elsewhere. They're now more than willing to let this game die off as they had more than enough suckers pay full price for it
---
Hah. I forgot about Pete Hines. 
---
Where the fuck has he been since November?
---
No way. I just got me a fresh batch of lead and plastic. 
---
well if you are looking for for a jetpack or calibrated shocks for the  t-51 I bought the plans for both items this week. As far as mutations go, I'm just using the time travel train.
---
I still like this sub
---
The second one say last which is a synonym for final.  I thought you turned off notifications you crybaby.
---
The "Christmas rush" was amusing. I had fun helping the new wastelanders. I wonder how many of them stayed with it.
---
Fuck that, I spent 200 hours in this game. Don‚Äôt fucking wipe all my progress!
---
Can there be a third option where I just get my money back?
---
I don't blindly support it, I just enjoy it for what it is. The week it came out I was sick, so I played it a lot. And the experience I got put of it was pretty enjoyable. However not a lot of people agree with me, and they've fucked up everyone's trust now. There is no going back.
---
That's nice, dear.
---
I don't know where you get your information. We wanted PvP Fallout back in the days of Tactics. 
---
You should clarify that doesn't mean we want more "bullet-sponge" enemies, enemies with actual mechanics would be 10x better.
---
Hey, you keep hot sauce out of this! Unlike Bethesda, hot sauce is always there to make something mediocre into something amazing.
---
ILY hot sauce üòç
---
I too am a role player. I am a raider and destroy everyone's CAMPS. I initiate PVP with everyone and steal their junk. I don't have any caps and only live off raw meat and fiji water
---
No.  It wouldn't have been better.  Wasteland is harsh.
---
See I feel Bethesda pulled the d move on you. I bear you no Ill will. In fact I feel you deserved better. Have a good night.
---
I‚Äôll never forget watching that announcement by whatever his name was, I think at the game awards, and getting pretty hyped. And it turned out nothing like what he described.  Is Elder Scrolls like this too?  I never played but was it the same bs along the way?
---
I dont care. If they want my attention, they have to earn it now. Im tired of getting no enjoyment out of this game and im not going to play it out of *pity*
---
Feedback: Quit updating the atomic shop.
---
Discussion: Start actually updating the game.
---
They'll be sure to send you a draft for approval from now on.
---
I don't believe you. you are telling fibs, so there.
---
That actually made sense... 
---
what did you play 4 on?
---
If your 20-25 I believe, they'll show in the watoga train station vendor. I haven't seen them there after the plans patch, so it might still spawn only during those levels. That's how you used to get them.
---
High levels had to do patrol duty over and over.
---
It can happen, yesterday I was one shot by a junkies walking cane and my PS4 exploded
---
I don‚Äôt care about the game. I care about what you did. 
---
It was rude and in no way necessary and you don‚Äôt give a shit about me or anyone else in here. 
---
You just wanted to rub our noses in the dirt and say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù to make yourself feel like a smart boy. 
---
There is nothing nice about that and any attempt by you to play it off as ‚Äúcaring for us‚Äù is utter bullshit and you know it. 
---
It‚Äôs just shameful you would do that. 
---
All your junk from your STASH disappeared?
---
I mean, if Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp can do it...
---
this is false, I just tamed a level 71 yaogai and im 133 5 charisma, 3 aw 1 ww, might have been using a grape mentats at the time, but not sure if it was still active. 
---
Absolutely.  
---
If PVP is the cause of the worst issues, then the Bethesda servers are the cause of the second worst crimes against the game -- instability and common disconnects, as well as absurdly small stash sizes and CAMP budgets that run counter to they very aspects most people enjoy in recent \_Fallout\_ games.
---
Killing two birds with one stone, I think they should have gone with a model based on Borderlands where co-op games are hosted off our own computers.  
---
I uninstalled Fallout 76 to make room to reinstall Sea of Thieves, that's pretty telling
---
Winner
---
That is still something for me to do is get the jet pack plans and such, but the cost is bananas. I have some of the mods but they need so much flux to make and 87% of the time I crash when I go to a nuke zone to farm it, or I‚Äôm short one hard to find type of flux. Mutations are fun though, mostly marsupial which makes it feel totally different.
---
Brand new account. Seems legit.
---
Inside the vault,  clearly a cheap ass ploy seen from the success of other tittles like Sea of thieves, just lazily thrown together, fronting hope for their player based or lack there of,  desperate times calls for desperate measures

---
Yeah. Lame. The Atom Shop could have had great stuff - like Raider gear and decorations, monster suits - whatever. Instead it's Ikea and 18th century fake antique furniture. Pathetic. 
---
There's a lot worse things going on for this game than a ham-fisted "rebalance" of explosive damage.
---
Won't you just learn to love the bomb with me?
---
Well if you ever happen to desperately need those items, I will 100% craft it for a minimal cost +mats
---
Fuck no, 250 hours down the drain? Instant uninstall for me
---
Im a filthy casual. And i agree with this post. I do enjoy wondering around aimlessly, helping ppl, bug there is nothing left to do in the game, and it is a husk of one. But i play 30-60min a day so its still fun in a way. But all concerns raised by op are valid and Bethesda really need to address them. They really lost the no confidence vote with this game imho
---
Its free, Are you able to come online now? I was about to head to bed but if you can come on now I can drop it off and go
---
You obviously didn't read my post.
---
I agree with this. 
---
Same here. I'm almost always solo but meaningful factions would likely change that. 
---
Me too. Even the skins are few and far between.  How hard is it to make red, black or purple power armour skins?

How much damn flux do the jet packs require?  That‚Äôll be my downfall.
---
Yes I agree. Loading times, freezing, crashing, and server stability are number one priority 
---
I would love to see your playstyle of  a tse   was  required for fun
---
 I  prefer co-op over pvp.  Though the passive mode does make it okay.  They do need to share kill xp with the team.  Every other game I've played share xp from kills.
---
When a minimally viable product gets worse after launch it becomes less than minimally viable.
---
I also recently uninstalled.
---
I keep hoping I will come back to this sub and read about the miracle patch that makes everything better and maybe adds some PvE content.
---
Yes your right about that I am one of them!!!
---
In all honesty, who in their right mind would pay atoms to wear an ugly, knee-length dress? 
---
I completely disagree. Not everything should be huge or monumental.
---
I have no problem with them making a post about "what we want".
---
This request is the opposite of lazy, its them saying, this is a feedback opportunity. Tell us exactly what you want and we will start working on it.
---
 This is the input request part of 76 they said would be key to its development since day 1. They are collecting community feedback and ideas. So if you are creative and not just a angry tool nows your chance.
---
‚ÄúTheir strength is on technical side of..‚Äù

is that why weapons deal inconsistent female to enemies as well as other players? I don‚Äôt think Austin studios are umm professional in any aspect here

Curing it creates new problems, but it looks like you are more interested in my person then fo76. I'm out
---
I noticed this last night too! Thought maybe it was a fallout reference. 
---
Stash box yes why does everyone think I‚Äôm lying I‚Äôm just mad al my stuff is gone
---
Did you even readnit? I completely disagree. Not everything should be huge or monumental.
---
I think the short answer is that they aren‚Äôt currently planning on doing anything about it. It took them 4 months to fix the SB spam attack.

Long story short, you break the TOS.
---
To be fair that is the question I am posing. If you read my build tell me what I am doing wrong.
---
Missed the sarcasm I was trying to make about how nerfing explosive weapons as a class over the TSE debacle was shortsighted and foolish since explosive weapons are cumbersome, resource-intensive like nothing else in the game and had the worst ROF and utility in the game. Don't even get me started with those bouncy ass grenades. And then how they're just brooming the problem of melee builds being able to do leagues more DPS with the least resources, perk investment, and weight of any build in the game.
---
Trying to say the B-team working on this "balance" issue isn't cutting it with their current tactics.
---
Any chance for a way to leave a camp owner a message and a few caps after using their place to scrap and take a nap?
---
Sharpshooter wouldn‚Äôt work as in most games ‚Äúsharpshooter‚Äù  has to do with accuracy increase and this is not that. I would call it something like pristine or preserved. All of these normal guns are in janky broken down condition so a preserved/pristine version of that gun would be cleaned and do a little extra damage because of its increased condition quality.
---
That's not an emoji. An emoji is a type of graphical icon, where as that's just a face made of standard keyboard characters; an emoticon or "smiley" as they were sometimes called back in the day. I don't know about you, but I see grandparents using emoticons and acronyms on social media more often than most people. If anything, I assume people saying things like ROTFLMFAO to be older because it reminds me of AOL chatrooms and message boards in the 1990s. I mean, do kids even talk like that anymore?
---
Yeah, I went to two CAMPs recently that were four times the size of what I can build. What's going on there? 
---
What new problems.  Mutations and diseases are two different things.   Mutations cannot be effected by disease cure.
---
Oh no I'm interested in both. I've noticed a few accounts like yours. Almost no post history with a large gap that suddenly posting nothing but negative things about the game. Is it not odd that someone who had nothing to say suddenly has everything to say about a specific topic?
---
If you haven't already, come on over to the sub /fo76filthycasuals.

I'm non PVE for sure, but support the idea of separate servers as it's very needed. With the introduction of survival I hope adjustments to adventure come as well to really bring PVP/PVE servers to us for real. I hate PVE to the core esp in online games and I dont force ppl to PVP but I don't wanna be left out cuz of bad game mechanics 
---

'Deep dives into some of our systems'.  That's exactly the type of statement management at work use to palm people off with non-specifics while sounding like they are making great efforts.  In fact, that whole statement is nothing but a hand-job. The people in this reddit are too smart to buy that.
---
I‚Äôd bang. 
---
I would really have to watch you to see the flaw heh. I switch to melee too for silos, it just has the advantage at close quarters.
---
He payed to be relevant, can't say I blame him, his build is back to being irrelevant after the TSE nerf.  He's the product of this games design/quality just like you and me, I'm not happy about him leaving as that's another player lost to justify running the servers and justify this game surviving. 
---
You might not have a game left sooner than later to white knight snark post about so I suppose make them last as the game is bleeding out.     
---
ESO is exactly what FO76 should have been. 
---
It feels exactly like an Elderscrolls game, only you can play online. They update it regularly and are super active with the community. It's an example of Bethesda doing something really well
---
Well it's not a perfect system to go by by the base costs shown in the inventory often reflect rarity or item tier.
---
But I've kept some that people are calling for in the trade forum and I've kept a few that were hard to come by myself.
---
Right now, however, armor and weapon mod plans are gold because vendors aren't selling all or in some cases ANY of them.
---
Because dying has never had anything to do with items stored in your stash box. Not to mention no one other than you has ever reported something like this happening. Most likely you tried to stash your junk in your stash box but ended up accidentally taking it all out. Then when you got killed you dropped it all.
---
i hate being a snitch but I'd rather report it and have it removed than bethesda going full exterminatus.
---
Rosalynn is the real person and Rose is the robot though...
---
If you had a workshop, all they have to do is contest it and they can do full damage to you. Doesn't matter if they claim it, doesn't matter where you are on the map; if you claim a workshop, you are opening yourself to PvP.
---
Do you just comment on every single criticism of the game and tell OP they're a crybaby? 
---
Makes me want to frame by frame the movies and see if anything else is in the background, like a Red Rocket sign peeking out from behind a building or an advert somewhere that just flashes by during a fight seen. The cars kinda look like FO vehicles, earlier models but trending that way.
---
WoW was a massive game built in 2004, doing something very few games had ever done. 
---
That was fifteen years ago, and this is not a new or innovative game. 
---
Lol why would someone do this?
---
Every system: weapons, perks, SPECIAL; they all need a balance overhaul in a PvP/MMO environment.  For some reason Bethesda thought they could slap a broken FO4 PvE sandbox RPG system on, with NO fixes, and it would work.  I'm hoping Bethesda is doing that complete overhaul now, and dropping each system complete or near complete.
---
This is the real issue no one really talks about.  FO4 was a broken system in PvE, only made great by multiple 3rd party mods, and a variety of workarounds for the issues Bethesda never bothered to fix.  Whoever decided to shift that system whole cloth to PvP was clearly on crack.
---
Here's why I personally believe seeded RNG exists, perhaps not in the exact format as we surmise, but I think it does in some shape or form.
---
Take the example of the RNG and the vendors pre-patch 5. It seems the underlying principle from a psychological point of view is to spread out your gameplay and encourage trading. It was hard to get what you want (forget what duping has done for a moment).
---
Same goes for a seeded RNG approach. I believe it's the same mentality from the devs.
---
It makes the dropped loot siloed, and makes items even rarer. It is almost as if the design point was to encourage trading.
---
I guess there are (like I mentioned a few posts above) algorithms that make it so the servers adjust to your seed, however it still does not counter the fact that it is not a level playing field.
---
I was shocked it wasn‚Äôt Tara Strong. 
---
... you just made one of my points.   To be fair if the style i picked is not viable the developers should say so and not make it part of a game.
---
Remember a game is suppose to be enjoyable, relaxing,  and an escape from the tediousness of the normal world.
---
This shouldn't be downvoted. It looks like Bethesda is getting ready to cut losses and maybe come back to the board later if they feel like it on this one. Especially if you read the last "Inside the Vault".
---
I know it doesn‚Äôt and don‚Äôt know how this happened but the dude wouldn‚Äôt give anything back anyways I‚Äôm over it at this point I‚Äôm starting to doubt I had it in my box because of all the comments saying I‚Äôm lying but I know it was in my box cuz I always put my junk in my box before leaving my camp but then again I‚Äôm pretty sure this game just hates me I don‚Äôt know if this has happened to anyone else and they just don‚Äôt say anything or my game is broke but idk anymore 
---
no melee has no AOE yes we can hit ONE target for alot of damage but we can not hit multiple at once like guns can quit saying it need a nerf it is 2 different things
---
He‚Äôs always there, it‚Äôs a spawn point for him. So go back and try again 
---
Bethesda Dude has 2 broken hands
---
I have an image of a guestbook filled with dick drawings, but I like the idea of leaving a message and a few caps if I use the the place.
---
No.  This is the culmination of Bethesdas corporate culture of pushing out buggy and unbalanced games, never bothering to fix them, and relying on modern to make their games playable.  
---
For starters just give us more enemies, there‚Äôs a reason everyone keeps hitting whitesprings. The rest of the map is a relative ghost town!
---
Yep.    Logged in today for the first time in 4 days.  Took half a stroll around Watoga.  Farmed two ‚ÄòLegendary‚Äô Protectrons.   Asked myself, ‚ÄúWhat the hell am I doing?‚Äù   Logged off but held onto the Mr Handy Buzz Blade and the nocturnal ski sword as painful reminders of the grind and plateau.    
---
So disappointed.   Have to face my friends after defending the game for months.   They get the last laugh.   
---
I didn't know gaming was the equivalent to aroma therapy.
---
SOP for Bethesda games.
---
It could easily work as it seems to be kinda modeled after rust, but I guess the pvpers dont like it
---
did you have a workshop owned at the time?
---
r/whoooosh
---
Truer words were never spoken 
---
Maybe they should have replaced those black sunglasses with rose tinted ones.
---
Doesn‚Äôt help us console players 
---
Eff that, 600 hours of game reset, no bloody way.
---
I think Bethesda needs to present us with a roadmap of additions they‚Äôre planning to implement into the game over the coming year. If there are any other than the new PvP mode 
---
Ok. You are as entitled to your opinion beliefs and feelings as I am. Again my anger is with Bethesda. That's on me. If you want to feel that I somehow attacked you personally that's on you. Again I hope you have a good night.
---
What they said isn't the only changes happening with the patch. Just what they thought you cared about 
---
After some research I found that both Fallout &amp; Incredibles are using ‚Äúsugar bombs‚Äù as a reference to Calvin and Hobbes. Not as cool but still cool lol. 
---
Wow, I guess you paid full price and have the money/time to waste.
---
He means the only place bulk isn't counted is while you're bulking more, which is by design. Everywhere else it's shown and counted.
---
Does it help to target the creature?
---
I didn't see this, but yep - same thoughts
---
so you can attack while crouching and stay in stealth while your shooting?  with the armour?
---
Yeah apparently :( its driving me nuts. What‚Äôs also strange is when it does stay on which isn‚Äôt for long...if your friend then changes his shared card it‚Äôs guaranteed to take yours off instantly if you don‚Äôt have a true 6 charisma 
---
The comment didn't state "can't do this, rushed release," it just said they don't have the time to implement the quest chain. 
---
Two very, very different things
---
I can't even lie I like your idea way more and it makes more sense too
---
As does the nuka grenade (or nuka quantum). It shows a pistol for one and a gender for the other. I don't remember which is which. 
---
 This is cool and all, but you could follow their directions and post this here.

---
You can report someone for destroying your base? Isn‚Äôt it Bethesda that allowed it in the first place? I can‚Äôt see how destroying a base would be reportable 
---
Okay.
---
What if I told you it was possible to fix PvE *and* create separate PvE servers?
---
No, those would be the people around level 400+ (I've seen them) I clock in 2 hours a day if that, maybe 4 on the weekend.
---
yes there have been several post about this it is a bug that happens sometimes.
---
Have to agree. If we had more role-playing features (Player shops and such) I'd be happy to do that. Just wish I could match my voice to what I want my character's voice to be.
---
Although it may be a reference to Fallout, it may also be a reference to the stereotype of children eating bland or unhealthy cereals with ‚Äúsweet and savory‚Äù inspired names during the Fifties. A Calvin and Hobbes comic even parodied it.
---
I'm going to be as bluntly honest and yet helpful as I can.  It's your build.  
---
I play a stealth sniper.  I managed to make impacts in SBQ fights even before getting an explosive weapon.  The thing is, you fell into certain traps and didn't build to the strengths of a sniper.
---
To be most useful, a sniper should be surgical and focus on VATS Criticals on weak spots.  You have a Luck of 5.  You need way more.  You also use a damned-heavy rifle, instead of picking the lightest weapon that synergizes with VATS.  Find yourself a pipe bolt action with Zealots or if you can spend caps, get an anti armor and/explosive.  Mine weighs 7 pounds.  
---
There's a lot more to go into, and if you need help rehearing and respeccing, I am more than happy to help.  My clan and I offer help to anyone on PC.  Look for me (WhiteNoiseMaker), HeroJoker1992, or Dasnomad online.
---
You can stack adrenaline by equipping and unequiping this card
---
&gt; the progress they have made since launch is a joke. I just don't think they care.
---
What's ironic is SoT started with even less content than Fo76 at a $60 price point.
---
Not necessarily but if they‚Äôre purposely griefing you and abusing the system, I think I‚Äôd report them...they‚Äôre actually pretty good about that
---
How much end game content have you played?
---
That's a massive assumption, mate. Quite frankly, you've offended me on a deeply personal level. Is there something wrong with wanting have a good ol fight with two power armor users?
---
Part of the plan for tomorrow after work. For tonight laying in bed this is my start. I will collect ideas and make a follow up post with a link in the future to the forums.
---
Bethesda can you look at scrapping armor to gain their respective mods? 
---
I have scrapped hundreds upon hundreds of light combat armor legs and have only recieved two unlocks. 
---
It probably only took about 20 to 30 srappings for each other peice of combat armor chest and arms. Scrapping leather armor pieces for every mod also took about 20 odd scrappings. 
---
As someone who actually enjoys this game (despite it's flaws), I would be very upset if the game was taken offline for that long.
---
I hear ya man.  That nub gonk raider is a troll.  He either cant read or cant comprehend anything he does.
---
There are other melee cards that also applied to unarmed too. Just not obvious from card descriptions. 
---
Did you downvote just because its not on the forum lol?
---
I‚Äôd def agree if they were following you around destroying every new base you built 
---
Ooooh, so Fallout is set in the Calvin and Hobbes universe, I like that.
---
probably killed the SBQ 15 or so times  from sever hopping, launched my own nukes 4 times.
---
Or maybe your karma there is negative from scamming/duping? It takes basically the same effort to post there as here.
---
And where is the Scorched lieutenant that‚Äôs promoting all of these scorched into these influential positions...
---
Because of the possible mutation combinations,  unarmed would be disproportionately powerful compared to other melee if they had two more perk cards.
---
 Why don't you take your own suggestion? Come back in a couple of months, and leave the rest of us out of this.
---
Won‚Äôt lie, that would be awesome.
---
Seen it a couple of times. Have a feeling it's world-related like there's newer code on those servers than others. 
---
You know you could role play in a better game that supports that better, right? 
---
Did you feel adequate with your build and was it a efle build?
---
I mentioned earlier, I think....the dude was mad that he kept getting wrecked in a PvP that he instigated with me, I finally got bored and went to my camp, the dbag followed me there just to trash my base...literally just to be a dick. 
---
The atomic shop is a different team that has been working on that crap for ages and are following a set schedule for release. they have nothing to do with the dev team trying to fix the game. I doubt their even in the same building.
---
I must admit to getting excited when I stumble across someone‚Äôs camp and take a tour of the place. If I‚Äôm distracted from a game by a home tour, the storyline may be lacking in the drama and conflict department. But the creativity of the camps is really, really fun.
---
That's jus how these types of games go tho, I've played ark alot and ya got raided n wiped by bigger tribes with more time n ppl but damn was it fun!!  IMO the story is awesome but the quest system isnt fallout at all, its jus filler for a game loop that's missing
---
bye fallout 76, time to uninstall 
---
We are not allowed to like the game, I have criticisms but I enjoy playing it in my own way. I just ignore all the moaning.
---
All this 'I've uninstalled FO76...' if they really had they would not be here continuing to bitch about it. If we are fanboys then they are the opposite, hateboys and it's become a habit for them.
---
For me, as a game to explore and run around in, it was perfectly fine and fun.  As an MMO it's laughably terrible.  But as a single-player Fallout game, I've enjoyed it.  At this point I've done the quests, explored the map, gotten the mutations I want, and built a nice camp.  I had fun doing all of it.  But there's not much left to do on that front, so I probably won't play a whole lot unless they release new content, which doesn't seem like it's coming any time soon.
---
Haha, well someone should be getting a draft to approve.
---
 hey they asked for feedback, and thats what I gave them
---
About as adequate as I can with no good legendary besides  a explosive gating plasma which breaks really fast. I'm probably going to go full melee in the future so I can cut the costs on making my own ammo unless i get a ultra cite weapon.
---
No. No no no... You're thinking of the Scorched HR Manager.  
---
Same, this is a terrible idea. Creative but not practicle. I would not come back if they did this. I have no problem with the state of the game. Just waiting on my first free content patch atm. All geared up and ready to go
---
If the interval was longer but attack more devastating, I wouldn't be against that. It's the spamming I hate.
---
Same too with assaultron head beam at long range. 
---
I stopped playing because of lack of content.
---
All it would take to get me to come back (whilst not the ideal solution) is lots more stuff to kill and loot.
---
All I want to do is fight stuff and feel a bit of fear with some chance of a worthwhile reward. At the minute it feels like you have to go around the map knocking down doors to find anything to kill and the rate of Legendaries makes it feel unrewarding anyway.
---
There‚Äôs a reason people camp whitesprings, which is a shame because it‚Äôs a actually a great map with plenty of locations for decent battles.
---
Also I got sick of people complaining about how other people play the game (seriously if you don‚Äôt like what I‚Äôm doing, engage me in pvp or fuck off).
---
Glad someone else is saying it out loud too! Some ass  hat said I was an entitled immature spoiled brat for saying the same thing...
---
Yea that‚Äôs totally it I dupped septuple shot explosive boomerangs into the trillions 
---
Every time I‚Äôve tried I‚Äôve fucked up the have want format so I just don‚Äôt care to try, sad part is I know that someone like you would be the first to comment about duping sad you have such a negative view and jump to base assumptions 
---
And honestly why the fuck would I dupe 1* stuff
---
I guess sales are so low and the atom shop's revenue is such shit that the company just doesn't really feel like the cost-benefit of investing in the game is worth it, which is why it's probably run by a skeleton crew at this point. The whole thing feels like ME:Andromeda. An ambitious project that was bleeding too much money over time so they rushed it out the door for a Christmas release to cut losses and now they are looking for an excuse to just trash it out altogether.
---
This is mega corporation with billions of dollars and alot of successful games. The state 76 launched in wasn't good terrible even,bugs are littered over the game,almost every update sets up a new bug,and its been 3 months with the already very little to do game and we haven't gotten any major content updates. People have a right to be angry nothing is happening with the game its just a bunch of bugs bug fixes and minor changes to gameplay. 
---
Yah let's punish the players that play the game daily and enjoy it 
---
Do you have a santa suit?
---
I've read that it doesn't matter how much of 1 item you have, it's how many different types of item that's the problem. So your denomination system would make things worse. I assume the biggest data hog is gear. It has to track durability, modificiations, and if it has a legendary.
---
Fast travel to your CAMP or Vault 76, it will stop. (PS4)
---
Good for you? 
---
Same. I brought a second account to get the handmade plans (what a Bethesda Sucker Customer eh) and that's when I noticed it. I setup a camp in whitesprings just to quickly level and could not believe the difference. It was like night and day.
---
Just play **Apex Legends** - the game is really good, way more polished than FO76, and its free.
---
I'm officially hanging up my FO76 cleats. Now confirmed a waste of $80 
---
Gotta love the trash that walks into the sub whenever the inside the vaults drop. 
---
Yep, me too.
---
At least that‚Äôs what people say to me when I tell them I enjoy the game for what it is lol
---
You can get a"similar" but not nearly as cool look from the combat helm and a gas mask.
---
Ahh... just found that. Thanks!
---
I've noticed that as well, I have hosted a Minecrfat server on my machine without issue, played many online games and never had anything close to the number of DC's and CTD's I get from this game.    
---
I never bothered to monitor my transfer rates until now but it seems they are around the average for an online game, around 250 Kbps spiking to near 450 occasionally so it must be on their end.
---
‚ÄúExcuse me, Becky...my paycheck says I‚Äôm getting paid as a Believer when I‚Äôm CLEARLY at Zealot now‚Äù

Yes, seems like every week there‚Äôs a new nerf scare or a new ban scare
---
People want Fallout: Borderlands. Not this bullshit. 
---
I truly, truly believe they were aiming for a game identical to Ark, but in Fallout. They quickly realized the engine was not equipped for that and spent two years slapping together whatever they could
---
Fallout 76 is the Fyre Festival of gaming .
---
That's good to know. I've just finished Iron Fist 3\* and have maxed all other melee cards, time to experiment with the build and my *mutant's knuckles*.

Yeah well I didn't know it was an item you couldn't get and I though dev room players were banned, players name is: t0074205
---
the final boss of that is a random dc heh
---
**Bethesda:** Hey guys, we've been listening to your feedback about the game, specifically about Scorchbeasts and how they attack too frequently and how players are getting the same loot when they shouldn't be. So while it's minor, we're putting this patch out which will address these concerns and here's how we're going to address them...
---
**Fallout 76 Subreddit:** Bethesda has given up, no one working on the game anymore.
---
\------
---
Honestly, if I was working on Fallout 76 at this point, I'd probably have given up on you lot too. Most games don't get small patch fixes like these, most games don't get this much communication from the development team. Yet despite the increased communication, despite the willingness to fix the game's issues and keep players informed, you're throwing them into the mud like this.
---
#gamerstrong
---
I don't want to have to download your photos and Bethesda certainly doesn't want to. Every photo you show off would have to be downloaded to a Bethesda storage medium and then downloaded to my machine either when I got close to your CAMP or when I got onto the server. That could potentially be several gigs of extra downloads a day.
---
Cool idea, no good way to implement this.
---
Do you wear the beer hat?! With the two-headed reindeer on your CAMP outside Whitesprings?! 
---
Or are their two Santas and I'm overly excited?!

Why would you do that? They don‚Äôt care you already paid for the game
---
Good. Where it belongs. Upvote.
---
They really dropped the ball not having Scorched Cultists....
---
but then why quit....?
---
luckly its hard to loose someone on the NZ/AUS servers
---
This is originally why I got excited about this game. The reality is that I rarely see people and when I do I can't talk to them. Does your voice work in the game?
---
heh, oh don't post the names here. people might say you are witchhunting .
---
&gt; I just enjoy it for what it is. 
---
Makes sense to me, I had a similar experience with NMS. 
---
Ironman death system is pretty brutal too.
---
You don‚Äôt want plans for t51 it‚Äôs not a great armor. Just find the pieces, paint it in Nuka Cola paint, take a few pictures and stick it in your stash to collect dust
---
Pipe revolvers don't drop as legendary weapons.
---
I have a level 85 that I have grinded hours and hours to achieve and finally get to where I want my character to be, now I will admit I was not happy when they nerfed two shot weapons, could care less about explosives since I wasn‚Äôt a TSE player, just a rifle build with a two shot handmade. Now I have changed a few things with my build and getting happy with it again. If they were to wipe everyone‚Äôs characters, stash, XP, level everything else I don‚Äôt think I would come back to the game. I‚Äôm a huge fallout fan, logged hundreds of hours in 3 and 4, and I have logged easily over 100 hours in 76 but now you want to make all that grinding worthless. I definitely don‚Äôt agree with this idea I‚Äôm sorry. 
---
See you never!
---
Is that speculation or is that legit confirmed? Bc if so....Fark, R.I.P. Power Armor 
---
My character is an Enclave Power Armor soldier, I planned on using the Gatlin Laser but they still haven't fixed it so I'm using the 50 cal in the meantime.
---
Ah yep, definitely going to be patched. 
---
Patch 5 was built on an older model. So it included the glitch that scrapped bulk items unfortunately. üòì
---
How about just give us some way to earn legendary power armor?
---
Yeah, I saw it on him a couple times too. Havent met him since the patch tho...
---
What I got out of his last post.  Truly I want answers.  Games are meant to be fun.  Either this is a pvp game or not.  I have seen too many good games ruined by " pvp balancing" and I have never seen a game do it right.
---
A scholar and a gentleman. 
---
Melee is already the goto for damage thanks to the nerfs.
---
I think that's the game with dragons and magic.
---
Fuse OP! Buff light bulb!
---
You'd need to rally every active member of this sub, and even that would be like 8% of this game's population. Bethesda wouldn't notice
---
Can not be affected üò≥ oh no it can be a bug then üò≥
---
NukaQuantum, and added, thanks
---
You really should take the two or so minutes to learn to post there, as there's a much larger crowd specifically looking for gear. Or just use r/fo76bazaar
---
I think TSE made the game more fun for myself, honestly...part of the awesomeness was shredding monsters, those things pre-nerf, perked correctly were a blast in a nuke zone (pardon my pun) 
---
Ive been saying the same thing from the start the game was and still is no where near ready enough to be treated as a full launch it definitely needed another year before release but clearly all they care about is making maximum profit off of low quality with no effert or time
---
And all the rage comes in. Reddit is really fucking dumb. Lol
---
You wouldn‚Äôt do well in prison. 
---
Just keep leveling up once your 50 u start to respec points every lv.
---
Yeah, whenever the Inside the Vaults drop they descend like vermin. 
---
I'd be okay with a full offline mode, personally. Workshops could just be like settlements and you could farm resources safely. Would make the bullet sponges more tolerable because you would permanently have the ammo plant.
---
Wow, already at five downvotes. This community is mostly children and man babies.
---
That's honestly what I think a lot of people are doing, taking time away to let new content come out (and, yeah, some fixes.) We see the loud flame-outs but a lot of players are probably just waiting on new content. Expect a spike for a couple months after new content comes out.
---
Yep! It's just congealed collagen from bones and hides (but not hooves, that's mostly keratin). 
---
Good idea... I claimed a workshop and got blasted from behind. It asked if I wanted revenge but I thought, meh... only once but I don‚Äôt get to play a lot. I‚Äôll start building a wall as soon as I claim. A big beautiful wall.
---
Had a roommate with a Xbox1 that everyone in the house used. I moved into my own place a couple years back though... so I had to upgrade this time around. 
---
Thanks the bazaar seems easier
---
This game is lame cuz the pvp sucks.. I'll def be logging in when the new PVP mode drops. This will never be fallout 5 I'm sorry and the story/quests will never equal that of a solo plyer fallout title. 
---
I know that. Anyone says anything on their mind and it doesn't fit their little agendas, you're thumbed downed. Lol it amazes me. I learn new ways of bullying/being bullies every day here. Lol
---
Have an upvote from me... like it matters, but whatev
---
 Lol 
---
&gt; Take the example of the RNG and the vendors pre-patch 5. It seems the underlying principle from a psychological point of view is to spread out your gameplay and encourage trading. It was hard to get what you want (forget what duping has done for a moment).
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Same goes for a seeded RNG approach. I believe it's the same mentality from the devs.
---
&gt; It makes the dropped loot siloed, and makes items even rarer. It is almost as if the design point was to encourage trading.
---
&gt; I guess there are (like I mentioned a few posts above) algorithms that make it so the servers adjust to your seed, however it still does not counter the fact that it is not a level playing field.
---
That is a fantastic social engineering theory, and if that's the case they both did a fantastic job and completely botched it.  
---
Fantastic because it's a great idea and does result in exactly that...  
---
Botched because it was a little too heavy handed, so the patterns were visible to those of us watching for them.
---
Completely agree. I think it comes from watching MXC. You seen that? Stands for Most eXtreme elimination Challenge. Definitely doesn't sound like natural. 
---
\*shrug\* I put in about a 100 hours - I can't complain.  I've had fun, but I'm about done.
---
Way to generalize people. Anyone complaining about nerfs isn't automatically a min-maxer, they're people who actually want to enjoy the character they've made.   
---
Like if you want to roleplay a energy weapon character you're going to have a WAY harder time than anyone else, to the point where it's pretty much impossible to use energy weapons exclusively because they're so weak and break so fast. Want to roleplay a mad bomber? Too bad, explosives got nerfed AND grenades barely work, either bouncing somewhere crazy or disappearing altogether.
---
Paid $60 on Reclamation Day at my local GameStop in WV, 250+ hrs and going strong...I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs $60 very well spent 
---
It Just Works
---
&gt;2 molerats in a cage fighting over a terminal wire
---
Photomode that shit for sick loading screen my dude!
---
You still messing with Chainsaws? I'm curious of they fixed any of the issues it has had since the game launched.
---
What other cards effect punching? 
---
That's a reasonably non toxic approach not seen much lately!!
---
PvP server is end of the month, meaning they should announce the DLC soon after. Otherwise just take a few weeks, and check out the website for The update. I'm building inventory and caps, but hopefully we will have some new dynamic content soon. 
---
The Devs have said they're excited to share what they're working on, and I'm hopefully it will be worth the wait
---
&gt;*Effort: Available now at the Atom Shop for 1500 Atoms! Buy now while digital supplies last!*
---
I honestly haven‚Äôt used much for reddit, outside of fo76 and another game has been my only real use and don‚Äôt really care for following rules if it seems it‚Äôs a pain and will waste my time
---
You don‚Äôt get anymore points but every level you get the option to move a point or pick a new card. 
---
the only other one that doesn't act crazy is the mirelurk king if you see a lvl 30 mirelurk king at one of the random locations tame it , it will actually show up as a white passive bar instead of the red bar like a tamed deathclaw or sloth has and wont attack randoms
---
lol
---
pvp is a stupid concept for fallout, because the game thrives on being unbalanced. people like the rise to power, rags to riches, and what pvp does is to balance all that shit out. that's not what fallout is about.
---
I was waiting for this.  Um inventory management and collecting junk runs for playability.  Look at my build I consider weight reducing perks mandatory due to a horrible stash limit.  Please enlighten me on how you handle that aspect before you tell 5o adjust into luck.  Also take into account the weight of rifles on your weight limit.
---
Nah, I had to close the application.
---
There isnt actually factions,  to complete all the missions u will join all available factions.
---
I like how genuine and passionate you are. Sorry for questioning you. I hope Anthem lives up to your expectations. The flying and gunplay look like sheer fun. And I love the Fallout 4 DLCs. Nuka World was so fun to explore, Far Harbor added a lot to the synth lore, and I had a blast with the Workshop DLCs. I absolutely love Automatron. Piper and Deacon were my go to companions, but once I could customize my own robot companions I ran with a fully decked out Assaultron as my bodyguard. It's a freakin' blast. 
---
Sorry you got burned on FO76. I definitely got my money's worth out of it, but i was hoping to play it for much longer, too. 
---
"I am the very model of a modern scorched major general..."
---
Yes. I also changed my gamertag to "Saint Nukeolas"
---
Hey, at least BF2 has content updates a few times a year. For 76, we're going to be going at least 6 months post-launch before any new content gets added. 
---
Isn't that the whole reason why we wanted multiplayer anyway? No, seriously. I only wanted multiplayer so I could travel the wasteland with friends. Not a battle royale. Not a boxing ring where we beat eachother senseless (well, maybe sometimes). I mean, the whole idea is kind of Mad Max-ish and it seems kind of cool, but given the current state of the game, I would hope they shift gears to fixing everything first. No one is going to sink more money into this game until it's fixed.
---
So when does this turn F2P?
---
Because I only like the one account. The alt was a means to an end for my main. I have a somewhat disposable income so I got my value out of it enough to justify leaving.
---
Unlike a true MMO, there are no other classes, etc., so re-rolling in F76 would be a monotonous, gargantuan exercise for me. I would not want to go about looking for a X-01 jetpack again, as an example. Same goes for other rare items.
---
And I haven't quit it's all the issues that this game has, has begun to weigh me down and I don't feel  like playing it as much.
---
Top it off with some icing called seeded RNG, and my tether is chopped.
---
andromeda makes me cry
---
i love mass effect so much and they butchered my baby
---
Legendary Bullhorn of Scorchbeastrend
---
Yes! That would be awesome to play as a 'bad guy'!!
---
Unfortunately, this is probably what makes the best short term business sense for them. I just feel like the company is going to lose so much credibility over this debacle that they would at least care about how it might affect future projects.
---
Personally, I know for damn sure that I'm not pre-ordering the *next* Bethesda title! And I'm not buying it until it has time to get an established positive reputation.
---
I almost agreed with your title, but the rest of your suggestion is awful.
---
On second thought, Taking the servers offline isnt going to free up any more manpower to focus on fixing issues. Taking them offline at this point will probably make a lot of people think theyve given up, and the servers wont come back at all. 
---
Also you cant have it both ways:
---
&gt;Wipe all player inventories.
---
&gt;All PA sets in stash or inventory carry over
---
She‚Äôs hot. I‚Äôd fuck her.
---
They are probably working on the next game...
---
All the Gladiator perks for melee.  Fists count as melee for them.  I've been using a Suppressors Ski Sword and Troubleshooters Meat Hook.  I don't have Iron Fist at all, but it's my next 3 levels as I just found 2 more killer meat hooks.  Losing Martial Artist will hurt my sword, but the meat hooks just barely out hit it without iron fist.
---
They earned their loss of credibility.
---
Communication is so poor that the last hotfix doesn't even mention that now "invite to team" doesn't show anymore when you are in the player's team.
---
I agree. I'll gladly take more damage if the don't scream non stop.
---
Here for the comments. I‚Äôd tell you to just use Rad X but obviously that‚Äôs not the answer 
---
Won't deny that, but looking at the sate their in now, they could still be.
---
You know how the cranberry bog groves had those visual artifacts? My prediction is the next patch will do the same thing to the sonic blasts. 
---
I have a dozen cores between 25% and 75%... didn‚Äôt really think about that. Makes sense.
---
No, usually makes it worse
---
This would be the perfect time to release dedicated server software, and allow for open modding.
---
 Ignorance is bliss. ;)
---
Like the OP said, the is plenty of "feedback" already to be had. We've all been screaming into the void for months!
---
*hits blunt*
---
This was such a damn good thread I wanted to check in and see of you had gathered any new info or if anything had changed with subsequent patches?
---
Then suggest it. Remember i said this is a positive forum. Stop saying what they messed up and only what you want.
---
**Scourched Cultists**
---
Every time I begin to forgive fallout76 I just look at red dead redemption.  It‚Äôs time to start calling it what it is. Fallout76 was a failure. 
---
Well, for the record the T-60 is more cost effective to repair, and if your on PC I'll happily make it for you...  
---
But I understand.
---
But yes the grind is crap, and with (3) separate XP nerfs, getting the XP to level quickly (Alts that is) is tough...   
---
I regret not doing it soon on my 3rd account, the same characters that are level 15 would be 40..
---
Easy, I wasn‚Äôt hating on them...I love the game, I‚Äôm playing it right now, just seemed very, VERY obvious to have those around from day 1 lol I‚Äôve got a hole list of things I‚Äôm going to suggest based on the Vault Notes 
---
No shit? You're only now starting to realize that?  
---
Skyrim Special edition or hell, even the version that's on the Switch still has glitches that were there since fucking day 1! The mining glitch is still there, they don't "work" on their games to fix them, they say they do something or do the bare minimum and they expect people to buy it and be happy with it... and so far, they've kept succeeding (well until Fallout 76 apparently... but I guess it's just because that one's online, you'll see the same thing happen with their next games)  
---
Oh but your omitting a very important thing. How much the players have had to put up with on a full priced game, and the fact the this game would be in the top 3 of most bugged games on launch and still is so many months later.....plus everything else that has happened and still happening. This is the reason why they have also had to communicate so much....because they are in constant damage control from what they have shoved at us. If anything they would be so grateful for those of us who have stuck around. 
---
Reusing FO4 assets implies that rust suddenly freezed during 200 years...
---
I would NOT be holding up Bioware and Anthem as an example of a good game and company.
---
I‚Äôm a melee guy on a PC platform with an unlimited data plan for WiFi, so not great internet. It gets a bit laggy for mr, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had that happen.
---
To be fair, it should have at the very least included a timeline for the "Bulk-Bug"...   
---
Yep, Bethesda has lost all good will with me. 
---
I‚Äôve bought every Bethesda game since Morrowind on day one, most midnight releases. 
---
I fucking love Fallout, I have a great little collection of Fallout paraphernalia in my home office.
---
But after this, you better fucking believe I‚Äôm waiting at least 6 months for major patching/fixing, sales etc. 
---
I think OP's point is that even *they* have done it.
---
Shrug. It's not especially convenient to look at game files on xbox, so I don't. If the game's treating steel scrap as one thing, then the game weight system makes even impossibly less sense than it does currently.
---
Yeah, cheese hasn't been invented in 2096 yet.
---
I'm looking to make it manageable (4 or fewer per second probably) without power armor or hazmat
---
It's easy to make promises when you have a track record of lying to your fanbase.
---
I‚Äôm at a loss of what to do.  Today I logged into the game after fully updating it (PS4 copy, username LoftyBanana), and now:     
---
I can‚Äôt see container contents, or the loot on downed enemies.  I can collect it, and hear the sound associated with that, but no menu.         
---
Can‚Äôt see missions list on right side of screen (Pip-boy missions and all other functions of it seem ok).  
---
I can no longer see my food or water levels.    
---
I can‚Äôt see enemy health or name, nor can I see other players name, emoji actions.  
---
If I unlock a modification on a work bench while scrapping, I don‚Äôt see the text anymore.    
---
Has anyone had this happen to them?   I‚Äôve poked around in my settings and can‚Äôt seem to find anything off. I‚Äôve also switch servers and done for resets of the game and console entirely. 
---
Thanks for your time.  
---
 I did not downvote, I just posted the link to the place the devs are reading.    
---
If on Xbox sure
---
Rabble rabble angry comment. Something something I quit. Gimme things, NO NOT THOSE THINGS! Wah I quit again! Worst game! Rabble rabble.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4
---
Fallout will never work as a pvp game.  Unless the only weapons and gear you can use are crafted gear.  Legendary items make it impossible to balance.  No perk cards either.  Balance means if you are level 1 or 1000 your weapons and armor offer the same protection and damage.  The only variable should be individual skill.  Anything else turns everything to shit.  But the unbalanced shit is where they make money on micro transactions.   So they will just keep screwing it up to sell more junk.
---
Bug fixes then bug fixes and PvP servers, couple months of attempting to make PvP servers works then back to general bug fixes, to early for 2020 road map
---
I play on decent internet, nothing amazing but this occurs alot, and it happens a ton on stuff with more than a two hit health pool
---
You are absolutely right. Sheesh. I'm ditching T-51 legs asap. They ARE the things that break first and so many damn springs!
---
Based upon the publicly know sales figure this Sub represents between 5% and 9% of the total online and physical sales.   
---
   
---
That is statistically significant, and in any situation would be considered a more than valid sample grouping.   
---
We even run the gambit from rabid die hard fanboys to increasing critical franchise burnouts... 
---
So again... This sub could and should be used as a one of the representations of the player base. 
---
When I poo I just go. I never understood how people sit and read or use their phone. Does it just take you a long time to get it all out? For me it is bing, bang, boom, done and over with, no need to occupy myself with something else. Do you eat enough fiber?
---
Aaaanyway, there is next to no end game. Might as well shelve it and check back later.
---
Brotherhood of Steel vertibird boss that actively hunts down mutated players
---
I understand you're being sarcastic. I'm glad you were able to spend 300 hours in this game and have fun.
---
My friend and I tried so so hard to like it. We defended it and all of that. I saw, and still see, the huge potential it is. 
---
This game shuld've come out in 4 years with a brand new engine and a bunch of features that aren't there. Oh, and NPCs. I tried to defend that but that just got old. Following holotape after holotape got old real quick. You never listen to any because you're talking.
---
But my god, the clunkiness of combat. Blech. The game appeases those who have a hoarding addiction. I don't have that. I thought it was fun to loot, up until I realized you could do it all day and get nowhere.
---
No kidding!! Like 30 springs per leg. Screw that@ T60 legs all day
---
I'd hope the ppl losing their minds about this 2 month's ago tested that but it is fo76.
---
Ppl seem to know things but never tested them
---
So you think the dupers and exploiters are a bunch of thugs/hardened criminals?
---
Bethesda only cares about money. As long as they can make a game that make money from they do not care at all about their players.
---
Amen!
---
Limited time offer on infinitely producible digital merchandise? Count me in!
---
You can't they change how radiation works (Vs what was in fo4) to prevent that. You need hazmat/pa/or use game bugs
---
It‚Äôs not an mmo though and never was going to be
---
I know it might be shocking but the majority of the updates are like that.
---
Expect it
---
You just made my playthrough less tedious. And for that, I thank you!
---
The enemy I want to see is [this thing](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/KzRNX). It also happens to be created by one of Bethesda's own artists. It's creepy as hell, which is perfect for this game.
---
Literally in the same boat regarding equipment and Legendaries... I gave allot of stuff away, he'll have my gaming sessions were spent finding people to give upgrades to...   
---
Now I can't horde, even to a minor degree, which makes it hard to want to find the level 10 and make his year..
---
"Biggest project ever!"
---
Honestly, the dream for me was that it was going to be a proper Fallout but with 2-4 player coop. I was hoping to enjoy one of my /formerly/ favourite franchises with friends. Instead, we got this.
---
Yes but, there is also someone above them saying hey, update the atomic shop and, hey work on the game. The people doing the labor are irrelevant to the decision making.
---
people can accuse me of what they want I just wanna know how to get that hat and I know the answer now and that is that I can't because I don't wanna get banned
---
Unarmed has rather high base damage for what they are.
---
Im pretty sure those are the only pure damage perks but both talons and twisted muscles apply.
---
So does incisor and martial artist.
---
Ok, have fun with a different game!
---
Im pissed ive been server hopping for 3 hrs for one of them hoes 
---
Bethesda has given up hope like most players, there is no map, they're lost
---
I suppose mutant commander should have at least 50 Strength. So, yes please!
---
I have Bethesda suckling on my teets and it feels so good 
---
I've started too but am skeptical to whatever changes BGS makes before the beta or live servers. Things like character transfer from survival to adv. As you stated kinda breaks the new mode so I hope that this 2 month wait is worth it and the get it right. It may never be balanced but it shouldn't be leather armor and pipe wrench should defo get wasted by Mattel armor and guns. I'm seein alot of love for the PVP update which makes me happy, if your on ps4 come fight me or team up n come fight me lol
---
That would help balance out the increased number of plants in the game world, yes.  Let's try it this way:
---
I'm using a similar build to the one I did in FO4.  Melee/pistol, non-power armor,  and immunity to chem addiction which means in FO76 I walk around with 100+ psycho and immediately pop one when entering combat.
---
Toxic soot flowers aren't that hard to find but pitcher plants are only available in the cranberry bog and are somewhat rare, certainly rarer than cranberry plants.  It isn't just that there is a finite number but also that they are spread out and require me to take on the dangers of the wasteland to acquire.  I have a run I do where i consistently collect 7 plants, at one point last week i fought 3 scorchbeasts *at the same time* while doing this run, I almost always encounter a large(10+) spawn of either mutants or scorched in one location along the run.
---
If all I had to do was plunk down a few pitcher plants in my CAMP it isn't just that I'm increasing the total number of pants in the game world but also that im negating the inherent danger in acquiring the materials as well as significantly reducing the time required to gather the materials.
---
Never knew about the cat lady. Also I remember seeing a house with a full pool table but forgot where it was. Thanks for the help!
---
I'm guessing it looked kinda like this!

 I have been contemplated the concept of a multiplayer game were the adversary were players in the role of traditional NPCs,  Not nearly as powerful of typical players, but in the adversary role.  I imagine there is the possibility of an online MMO kind of game with a paid part with powerful characters and a free to play side where player fill the role of NPCs .  The Free to players could earn credits to play the other side of the game as they play as cannon fodder.  This is clearly nothing I could ever do, but it seems like an interesting concept in gaming.
---
Sorry, but that article is trash. The same trash we have seen time and time again produced by content creators who make a living off drama and negativity so they spin every single facet in the most negative way.
---
Im starting to think that their roadmap involves so many fixes before content that if they show that people will just flip out and leave the game for a period of time, theyre barely touching up on any actual game content and the next patch doesnt seem to be until the end of this month
---
Difference with WoW and '76 is early on, very early on, Blizzard started actively working with some of the community to help resolve issues.   
---
If that's happening, it's not public knowledge.  
---
The lack of information and acknowledgement is what seems to be burning most people, which is frustrating, because with a little more communication... 
---
Good luck with that. You could always buy items online from the black market of Fallout 76. It‚Äôll cost you real cash though 
---
The hidden value thing was definitely tested and found to be true. However, I don't know if they determined that *nothing else* has that effect.
---
The combat in ME:A was decent, but that's about it. It was a real gut shot to watch that dumpster fire get out of control.
---
It would be nice if they based an entire game off of a co-op experience. Not split-screen, but online, maybe similar to the borderlands style MP. It would be great to have another spin off game with co-op. I would like FO5 to remain SP.
---
&gt; and yet you complain about too much PvP.
---
No I don't. I'm saying it's not interesting or relevant to me. 
---
Thank you for your input. I will direct the team to add Legendary input addresses in the atom shop, available for free for a limited time.
---
Thanks. That's what I mean. If you think about it, from a design point of view it matches all the other design principles of the game. Combine that with the evidence from yourself, the experiences of others, and my good ol' gut feel.....
---
Cholula, baby. 
---
I think there are exceptions.  I hit up every vendor for 2 days looking for plans for the meat hook and the mod for it , extra hooks.  
---
I finally found the mod and 1 regular meat hook which I scrapped and miraculously learned the mod.  
---
Before the last update I'd chalk it up to RNG, but vendors are now supposed to have fixed plans and I never saw any for the meat hook.
---
Actually i bought the game for 6 dollars
---
Anything sold there should be available in game. What would help someone in regular armor take less damage from rads?
---
At the pace they‚Äôre working, the player base is going to just absolutely bleed players to other games. 
---
I‚Äôm a huge overall Fallout franchise fan and if this game had been released in a better state or at least made drastic improvements over time, I probably would have played it over anything else releasing for 6+ months. 
---
Now, I‚Äôll probably grab Metro or Far Cry next weekend and possibly Anthem after judging player reactions to that release and 76 will never be anything more than a novelty to occasionally log in to and laugh at. 
---
Well, she was a bit of an experiment even before she was a Synth. One of the scientists tinkered with her and changed her programming, as well as gave her a terminal/diary of sorts.
---
‚ÄúWah! They pushed out a patch too soon and broke stuff!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWah they take too long to patch to make sure they don‚Äôt break stuff!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWah they don‚Äôt communicate enough!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWah they communicate when they have very little news to share!‚Äù
---
Just move on already. Come back in a year and see if it‚Äôs better, or don‚Äôt.
---
Nice!

I think is would've been much better as a co-op game initially, then pvp aspects added later. Let's face it, the franchise as a whole was based on solo survival in a post apocalyptic world. That was what the franchise was built on. That was what its customer base was used to. That was what made Fallout unique. They took that wonderful combination and messed with it.
---
Yes, I'm still playing the game, but even the most patient players are starting to get fed up with legendary mobs not dropping proper loot, bugs in events like Swarm of Suitors that gives you no reward and regular mobs that Regen health at random times. How is it even possible to miss these during beta? That is what a beta is for. Did the people making decisions not even play the game?
---
Perforating has the highest penetration ("superior" trumps "improved" for all mods), the other two will have identical penetration to each other. Higher fire rate receivers like Hair Trigger and Snappy also increase reload speed on single action weapons (Hunting Rifle, Pump Action, all of the revolvers, etc) so if you're using one of those I'd go for perforating, but if you're using a Hardened receiver you might consider piercing. I'd only use stinging on weapons with high base capacities, like Handmade and Combat Rifles.
---
I scrapped skull and ribs with no issues
---
I've never had gladiator effect any punching weapons like the death law gauntlet or anything. Are you sure? I just checked and it didn't raise my damage. 
---
I'm just sick of people bitching. Go play something else if you dislike it so much. 
---
Go to gatling plasma
---
Raise base damage by 25%
---
Increase durability by 300% of current value
---
Go to laser rifle
---
Increase base damage by 35%
---
Increase durability by 800% of current value
---
Go to plasma rifle
---
Increase base damage by 20%
---
Increase durability by 100% of current value
---
Go to gatling laser
---
Increase durability by 250% of current value
---
Go to alien blaster
---
Raise base damage by 300%
---
Idk about durability because it's literally fucking useless
---
So about 12 minutes in the geck editor?
---
Content takes way more time than removing restrictions that open the game to new players and old players, what content do you think they could a added in this time frame? What content are you looking for? More quests where I find a location and an object n press x like I do for a piece of loot or aid or anything else?? No dialogue no npc's so what do you expect?? New maps would be dope but that takes time to do. This ain't fallout 3 or new vegas where we need 3 characters to see the whole story. This is rust in a fallout skin
---
&gt;**Homer:** Do you have any of those microphones left?

&gt;**Warehouse Goon:** [Yeah, a couple](https://youtu.be/KMf_4-doa2I).
---
People are already leaving though. I doubt most will come back for PVP...
---
mr. fuckin fantastic himself
---
Bug fixes, more bug fixed, even more bug fixes, PVP crap, fixing PVP crap, even more PVP crap, bug fixes, maybe some new content, fixing said content, even more fixing of said content, bug fixes.
---
Vaults would be what adds actual content that isnt pvp, but I feel that they just keep pushing that back further
---
Salty bois farming karma from other salty bois.

YOU TELL EM BROTHER #gamerstrong
---
Underwater friends! Yeah, that would have startled me too. Reminds me I need that Aquaboy perk for an underwater mine.
---
The Gladiator perks only effect 1 handed melees.  It doesn't work with the unarmed classified weapons.
---
Didn't they promise to have moddable servers?  I guess nothing ever came of that either.  
---
According to the ‚Äúinside the vault‚Äù feb 7th edition, we‚Äôre basically beta testers.
---
Wtf happened to the initial beta testers?

Uninstall this game for your own sake ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That is false.

&lt;--- Active modder and also posting bug round ups...

[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup - Weapons - Feb 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aobkwm/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_weapons/)   
---
A couple of the fixed look really simple, if you look closely and test using FO4 as a base, for example the Plasma hit bug, but it's only simple if you know what your looking for / where to start.  
---
The bigger problem is the way they have the damage arc set up, not enough is know about the curve tables and their global interactions yet, and not as an apologist but coming from a place where I can usually figure things or quickly, the set up they have is, daunting.  
---
There are some "quick and dirty" fixes they could do, but I'm not sure they are interested in stop-gaps, but want real fixes, especially with the rockier rollouts they have had.  
---
Short of long, the weapons and interactions are allot more complicated (it seems) then in FO4
---
More endgame bosses should be a priority. Theres no real reason to nuke anything outside of FSP and WS. 
---
Uh, I guess I'm not sure?  I used both the sword and hook as I leveled them up and saw similar rises in damage.  Maybe strength alone raised my meat hook to keep it on pace with the sword?  If so, I just freed up 9 points I can use somewhere else.  
---
In-game items that you can buy for real money from these ‚Äúblack market‚Äù websites.
---
Fallout 76 has turned into a pay to win game since its turned into an ‚Äúonline only‚Äù game. 
---
They were unprepared for this release. Not only with how broken the game was at release, but with how so many people could buy the most rare weapons and armor with real money from these shady websites 
---
Fallout76 is dead guys, it was dead on arrival. There won't be any support for this game in no time.
---
Exactly why this sub has become trash. fast.
---
Whoever guilded a fucking polygon article should be ashamed 
---
I‚Äôm not sure how sea of thieves was able to rise from the rubble and become so successful, even when the entire internet was against the game. It‚Äôs a redemption story like no other.
---
I don‚Äôt believe it will happen, but there is still a glimmer of hope in my heart that 76 will one day make the same redemption. It‚Äôs a small glimmer though. 
---
 It kind of needs to no?
---
 Move along buddy...your just a troll....go back to griefing.
---
To me, this request for specific feedback about mob battles/loot makes me uncomfortable. It's like when you do a school group project and they ask you to name your group and some dipshit recommends something like "cool guys" or wants to name it after their favorite sports team or something because nobody else has a good idea right away and doesn't want to embarrass themselves with some other crap name. So then, 10 minutes later you wind up sheepishly writing "Team Awesome" on the white board as you get up to present.
---
Anyway, I think only a few dipshits are going to recommend boring, self beneficial mob/loot adjustments because the rest of us are tired of doing THAT EXACT THING for the past 3 months and all of a sudden we are going to start looting a bunch of those token things for that carnival from the sbq with no other meaningful changes.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is that the desperate sounding request for user feedback makes me feel like not only do they not even *play* the game, but that they really have no idea what direction they even want to go with it.
---
The main isssue isnt min/maxing. ITs easy to min max without even realizing it. Melee weapons are one of the best builds right now, and its the one peoplle will be drawn to for casual play since it doesnt require ammo management. The issue is its too easy to have a bad build. This has nothing to do with min maxing. This is all about making the game mor enjoyable for however you want to play. Its one thing to be a bit gimped when playing a certain build, its another thing for it to not be viable at all. 
---
Wait no karma for me too?
---
FO76 sooo bad!
---
Gives me karma please. 
---
Congrats, you‚Äôre the third person to make this post.
---
Shocking
---
It feels like with the naming system for the scorched they had meant to have some kinda tactics between the scorched, but my guess is they didn‚Äôt have time for all the scripts and so they just had to go with a basic AI that just rolls on you if you close, or hides behind something. 
---
I mean, just in a general technological sense, the launch of Apex going as cleanly as it did is a fucking mountain of an accomplishment. 
---
They had something like 1.5 million concurrent players at peak and had next to no connectivity issues. 
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying about the complexity of development, but it‚Äôs still a hell of an accomplishment for an out of left field F2P game to be able to launch so flawlessly on day one with that server load. A company with the influence and deep pockets of Bethesda repeatedly shitting the bed while a game company 15+ years their junior eats their lunch is hilarious. 
---
Since when has Bethesda ever walked away from one of their giant titles? Bugs, they always got em. But, again, where is this coming from? Based on what? I'm not defending what's wrong with this game, but Bethesda has no precedent for what you are saying. 
---
Honestly, I'd rather they focus on a couple of major issues at a time aside from overall stability as the last attempt at patch 5 showed they can't handle doing that much at once.
---
The hand of one is the hand of all.. eat lead asshole!!!
---
welcome to the club, friend. i got out once they broke stealth, not going back until the game is finished about a year from now
---
I can‚Äôt wait to hear the ‚Äúwe hear you‚Äù comment to this post, if they actually reply to it. They probably won‚Äôt though. 
---
Snitches get stiches
---
First run with Bethesda? 
---
I'm not omitting anything.
---
This isn't a post complaining about the game having issues. Everyone knows that. Hell I know that and it was one of the reasons why I gave it a below average score on my review.
---
This is a post taking shots at Bethesda for communicating changes to the playerbase because they're what? Not good enough? Only two issues fixed in a minor patch? How dare you sir! How dare you tell us you are fixing issues with the game that people have complained about for a long time.
---
I'd be far more critical of Bethesda if they weren't trying to fix the issues with this game, and let's be real here, they could have easily not bothered. If this was the cash grab that various subreddits like to claim it is Bethesda wouldn't be bothering to fix the game, the only thing they'd be doing is slapping more and more stuff on the Atomic Store and releasing paid DLC packs to get more money out of the suckers who bought into the game.
---
Instead they're fixing the game. Trying, despite the grief that this subreddit among others gives them, to do right by the people who have bought the game.
---
Most games not only in this genre, but in others don't get nearly as much communication about what's coming and what's being fixed. It might not be perfect, but they're doing a damn better job than other developers I can name.
---
This happened to me today! Happened to repair a rifle with the exact unbulked amount of steel in my stash. Went to repair the next rifle and it said zero steel. I checked my stash and found bulked steel. Went to repair and it worked. My bulked steel got unbulked. I said, meh, it works.
---
Refund everyone or we sue to get everyone‚Äôs money back in a class action lawsuit, including those who got banned. 
---
Never trust Bethesda again, they brought this upon themselves.
---
Fool me once.. 
---
You guys distribute these formats on discord or is there some planetary force that manages to produce the same fucking post 20 times a day on this sub? GTFO 
---
After the last patch it has been a ghost town. I‚Äôve added 20 new 76 friends since the game launched and most nights nobody is playing. I haven‚Äôt played in a week. Netflix is getting my time for now 
---
 I usually don't care about those who rant and quit, but in this case I do. You look a reasonable person.
---
 Have fun wherever you go!
---
or maybe i'm just trying to make all of you paranoid ;)
---
I would love a system where people can leave logs in my terminal. I could see where it would help the roleplaying. I show up to my CAMP, and suddenly there‚Äôs a creepy message. 
---
I prepurchased at $60, I have over 100 hours and still playing.  I got my money's worth.  They need to fix things and it is far from perfect, but the game has never been unplayable or unenjoyable for me.
---
THE MODDERS AND THE EXPLOITERS SHOULD  TAKE OVER, KARMA ME UP BOYS
---
&gt;This Reddit seems to have become dominated by min/maxers, meta-builders, and, in general, people who want to just run around shooting things.  
---
Exactly, they also believe they are the majority of players so they are getting even more upset when they are not being listened to
---
Mmm... ribs
---
That's the lesson I learned. Never pre-order a Bethesda title again, and always wait at least a few months before they get the bugs out that never even should have made it to beta. 
---
Damn auto correct....
---
i didn't like the jetpacks, the underpowered weapons and powers that never got a proper balancing
---
If you have the time and caps, get Grafton Steel Yard.
---
On an unpopulated server.
---
How do you role play the crashes?
---
If we got through No Mans Sky, we can probably get through this.
---
That‚Äôs counting on Bethesda actually putting an effort into finishing the game like Hello Games did.
---
any way to check number of players on server?
---
My prediction is that their change delays it‚Äôs entire AI sequence, increasing the time before it lands ten times or more, and often causing them to never land. 
---
Dead and buried
---
The dreaded gold fork!
---
It‚Äôs a reference to Calvin and Hobbes, but i think it‚Äôs also inspired by the Fallout one, since the box art and font is very similar.
---
Ahh I see your mad someone destroyed your base in a survival psuedo-PVP game 
---
Locking players into servers is a good Idea for real, I LOVE PVP but players shouldn't be allowed to fsu and server hop or fast travel away. I LOVE PVP and some of these ideas would really help
---
MEA was a good game... I don't care what anyone says.
---
True, but that's the price you pay for letting Microsoft tell you how to play...
---
Tons is happening so don't lie. No new dlc? They saids its ready just.coming after glitch exploit patches. Over 100 bugs and exploits fixed . Thats pretty solid work
---
 They are doing lots, just not as much as you want. Also not everyone in the team works on bug fixing. Not even 10% likely.  Others are doing animation, writing, level design, storyboarding, pr, and well every damn job that goes into making a game.
---
Exploiters? No!
---
I actually want this game to be fixed. I just don't believe they can do it anymore. We are 3 months in and where are we?
---
Go through big bend from Watoga to Ash Heap, collect all weapons, head to station, scrap.
---
Ya just call it like it is my NERF firecracking handmade?
---
That‚Äôs an interesting reality you live....it‚Äôs it works for you....good for you.
---
Content?  What's that?
---
Oh, you mean what Ark did!  A small indie developer that yes, had problems, but also delivered a lot of fun CONTENT in patches.  Now I know what you're talking about :)
---
Oh that's both good, and bad. 
---
If there was factions and you could only 'complete' one, it means your friends could complete others and you share things but some things are faction members only. 
---
It's good though because nothing is behind a 'faction wall' where you'd need to grind to get something they could nerf later one, and your faction becomes useless for you. 
---
Open map and start counting.
---
No easy way.
---
Problem 1 is an issue.  
---
I've been looking and not found the cause, but I've seen that more than a couple time..  
---
Hell at one point I had a furious board (level 5) that refused to accept upgrades, I'd click craft, it would eat the junk, but the upgrade never, ever attached.  
---
There are some really oddball and hard to isolate bugs :)
---
Basically square one in terms of content and stability. 
---
Youre right i was confused its not an ultracite its just a gatling with a prime receiver.
---
Maybe after 3-5 consecutive hits a player becomes wanted for the bs harrassment?? Tbh I do rack up bounties jus so ppl attack me lol
---
Thanks found an awesome group. 
---
10 seconds won't be enough time regardless.
---
They don't really stop in the air UNLESS their shooting their blasts. So really, they'll blast, fly around and make it hard to shoot them, then blast again. Their entire AI needs an overhaul, not just how often they scream.
---
Agreed. Not to mention the fact that they don't drop as loot (so no legendaries) and are locked at level 20. LOTS of oversights on thos weapons.
---
Funny you should ask that....
---
Even real pvp games like this have better options, beds every 3 min or a single use spawn point like a sleeping bag would be better. 
---
That‚Äôd get old, fast. Hope it gets fixed fast.
---
But they still have job postings up..
---
I took Rose‚Äôs personality to be the outcome of the grief caused by the real roses ‚Äúdeath‚Äù.
---
He reprogrammed the Nanny to sound and act like her.
---
You make a build to how YOU personally want a build, me, personally, I'm a hoarder, so I have almost every weight reduction perk going + extra carry weight.  
---
I dont think I have any damage reduction or damage increase perks in my build whatsoever until I go to fight something like a scorchbeast or the queen then I swap them in quickly
---
LOL
---
Only a true Fallout fan knows about the most important person in the world :)
---
Bravo!
---
I like to call it a o
---
1 1/4 shot sparkler gun lol
---
Well damn I couldnt have said it better
---
Grateful?
---
O.K., but never forget that from Bethesda's this is just a COMMERCIAL transaction. 
---
She wasn‚Äôt uploaded.  She died in the flood after the raiders blew the dam as revenge for the people of Charleston ‚Äúkilling‚Äù her in the raid.
---
I still hope they add more of a single player/coop experience. It‚Äôs such a great world in the fallout universe and I‚Äôm not a fan of the grind FO76 currently requires.

---
I had one drop at Whitesprings the other week. I'm level 125 and it drops an f'ing level 35. Even though it's a level 35 it's better than a non legendary as long as the enemy is at full health.
---
Kill mole men and scrap the lanterns, guns, suit scrap, and breathers they drop
---
Been here a while.
---
I've just never been so underwhelmed.
---
False alarm, i thought they were going to shut down all servers 
---
Totally agree, played all the mass effect games and MEA was better than ME3
---
They actually cancelled their preorders. It wasnt just a forum flex they actually cancelled.
---
u/ladydevann any updates? u/the_lone_wanderer?
---
Exactly!
---
OMG if somebody named Saint Nukeolas came up to me in a Santa suit and gave me a present, I would shit myself (from joy)
---
WIDLEY resequenced dna. They used Shaun‚Äôs ‚Äúclean‚Äù DNA as a base line but the closest relation would be something like great great great great sixth cousin.
---
Roleplayers are the minority yes, so are Min Maxxers, the majority of players are casual players who will jump in, kill a few things, do a couple random events, do a few quests and build a camp or workshop for a bit, then log off  
---
They dont farm the whitesprings or nuke zones, they dont put huge effort into making sure perk set are maxxed out for the most damage you can get out of a build, they use whatever they have and just role with it
---
Scavanger :) that's pretty much what I do. I have a handful of things I'm set on getting and I just explore every single box and corner I see.
---
I'll go through phases. One week I'll farm legendary enemies. Another I'll just sever hop looking for a specific item until I get tired.
---
Their patch support for their older games compared to other companies is actually quite lacking. Lots of huge bugs still exist in Morrowind, Oblivion and the like. Meanwhile companies like Valve and Egosoft still push out updates to fix and improve things for their older games to this day. You should have seen the amount of salvaging Egosoft put toward X: Rebirth after that fell on its face. If Beth put half that work in post launch patch support i'd like them a lot more.
---
Sadly to this day every Skyrim Edition still has shit like Markath's banners being generic green strips of cloth, and half of Fo4's companions don't even benefit from the companion buffing magazines.
---
It's only a country road...
---
Yeah normally the Fallout wikis are full of VERY valuable information.
---
Half the time I find reddit posts with more information than the wikis.
---
**But those of you that do update them, THANK YOU!  On some of the more filled out pages you guys have done AMAZING work.**
---
Sincerely,
---
Someone who's lazy, but deeply appreciates the people that work on the wikis :)
---
p.s.  You guys are the un-sung heros of the Fallout universe!
---
The reality is now I think they are trying to run us off to justify shutting it down. And hope the memory fades be for the launch of one of that's real games.
---
When you‚Äôve got to hit your quarterly numbers, it doesn‚Äôt matter what the customers want.  Push the game.  Remember, good, fast, or cheap; pick 2.  And in this case BSG was trying to go to fast without enough people.  They way their support system seems to be handling things, they‚Äôve cut back there too.  Gotta hit the large margins people!
---
I agree, wholeheartedly, especially about the PA paint. I'm still kicking myself for not buying the Blackbird Paint, though at the time I was predominantly running Excavator so what was the fucking point?
---
You have to scrap human bones, not just scrap junk to get bones. Fight some mutants and loot skulls, femurs, etc. Confused me too.
---
Same here. Sucks though because my wife and my sister in law just started to play and I just really don't feel like playing with them and she's bummed. 
---
Oh that would be amazing...
---
Fps skills go far here as many players rely on vats. Someone acclimated to this can do real harm in pvp in fo76. Decent range and rate of fire can do well in this game stay mobile and stay movin really
---
The only roadmap I have is a country road leading out of Appalachia :)
---
Ba dum ching!  Yowza!
---
Elmer‚Äôs blue too.   Liberty spikes.
---
Right??? Hell, I'd spend a fair amount of Atoms on a simple matte black PA paint!
---
Hahaha sorry man, I was brought up saying it and my mother never corrected me. Wasn't till I was an adult I found out I'd been living a lie. Sometimes it slips through without me noticing. 
---
But hey I like to think I did you a service Sean Connery is a legend.
---
That was a new error 
---
Ad victoriam
---
Brutal...  
---
I've had random specific items vanish but never "everything"
---
Have them fused and mutated into the frame, that would be rad. 
---
Didn't you make a post complaining about exploiters? Man, the tides have changed
---
I get that noise frequently on the XBox. It also happens on FO4 to this day. Years and dozens of updates later, it still crashes. I think that will be a persistent crash for FO76 based on the history with FO4. 
---
Happens with melee, too, even though I can see my weapon going through the enemy.
---
God I wish ARK was a good game. I played for 3 years on a pve server but god the latency was just too much.
---
Eh, I'm willing to give it a try.
---
**They really need to do some IN-GAME surveys to figure out how not to f it up for the community.**
---
They've proven pitifully unable to get the pulse of the community via reddit.
---
Start taking some 1 to 10 polls ffs.
---
1 love this idea------5 unsure----------10 hate this idea
---
Repeat with a TON of questions.  Get that valuable data, THEN start coding.
---
Right now it's:
---
Step 1 - Read a few reddit posts.
---
Step 2 - Over-react and code like crazy.  Pay no more attention to anything......just code, code, code.
---
Step 3 - Release Patch.
---
Step 4 - Every customer is pissed.
---
Step 5 - Act confused, return to Step 1.
---
Bethesda gave up before the game even shipped due to low preorder sales.  
---
Very frustrating, I've hit an enemy as many as 6 times before a single hit registered 
---
Poseidon Power Plant and Tyler Country Fairgrounds always have low-level Scorched running around. Kill them and scrap their guns.
---
I'd avoid Grafton Steel at level 14 unless you want a tough fight. There's a ton of super mutants in there, and the defense missions aren't easy either.
---
Morgantown High School, low level scorched with tons of guns to scrap on top of all the loot you get from a run. 
---
I am a lazy, filthy casual... neither a roleplayer or a minmaxer. 
---
So far I am having fun. 
---
But from reading posts here, I can see on the horizon the time when I am low on key ammo, or suffer from weapons breaking, or have a hard time keeping my armor in repair... without investing time farming mats. 
---
That isn't fun and if I hit that point I am done with the game. 
---
Hopefully it won't be an issue by the time I get to higher levels. 
---
r/fo76filthycasuals
---
This game is much worse than MEA. It barely runs. Sure it boots up and usually loads you into the game world but the amount of time you can play before crashing is a roll of the dice. The game world itself is really well done considering the duct tape and glue holding it all together but the game does not offer a reliable experience. I went back to RDR2 and I am stunned when comparing the level of quality between those two games. It‚Äôs shameful to see Bethesda release this game in the same launch window as Red Dead Redemption 2. 
---
I drank the kool-aid
---
What?
---
FFS you're re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
---
Hey, this chair should really be over there.  Wait, this table isn't lined up next to the pool.
---
Meanwhile ship is sinking, crew is fumbling around, passengers are screaming and dying.
---
Please stop posting stupid things like this.  You aren't helping.
---
They got sued for disclosing an actors real age and costing them work since they were playing WAY younger.  At this point if an actor tells them they don‚Äôt want something on their profile,  it gets removed.
---
West Tek when you get to a higher level.  Plus it‚Äôs an awesome place to farm legendaries.
---
Pretty much the reason why im waiting for custom server before touching the game. Having other role players can make this better than any other fallout
---
I got two pieces of loot tonight for my SBQ kill!! One from the queen, and one from a 3* legendary that spawned in, of course after the event completed and I got my loot, and quest reward, the server crashed and when I had logged back in the server had done a roll back, and I lost two pieces of armor and all my event reward loot.
---
Dude, you have a gem on your hands. Over repair that bad boy to 200%, stack the gladiator perk cards, and watch the damage fly. I had one but got rid of it because I came into a Bloodied Mr Handy Buzzsaw(my main go to now). Still got a furious ripper tho. I love these things. Always overrepair rippers, chainsaws, and my handy buzzsaws.
---
I'm holding out for Atomic Heart and the new metro. 76 may be dead, but post apocalyptic fun shall live on!
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
You where generous about the bugs....I could make that list 3 times longer of the most noticeable stuff.....and that‚Äôs before we even look at all the other issues.
---
I feel like you‚Äôre a lazy entitled brat. Seriously how many more of these posts are gonna pop up today? I know when you talk shit you get upvotes and for you little basement dwellers that‚Äôs probably the equivalent of a date but damn. Learn to think for yourself. This game didn‚Äôt come with NPCs but y‚Äôall sure are filling that role üôÑ
---
Dumpsters outside of whitespring is great for this. 
---
Heh. Great job!
---
Lol it‚Äôs like the SQB is trolling you, like ‚ÄòHey just wait a bit longer the loot will drop soon!‚Äô 
---
Like you dropped me MF ü§¨
---
I remember reading that in some patch notes, perhaps the previous patch?
---
When it comes to companions, Synth Curie with Pickman's blade all day. Something about the French gal gutting raiders like trout...
---
I know military guys who can break down and rebuild their gear with ZERO conscious effort.  This makes sense.
---
(More raider questline spoilers, on mobile, dont know the bbcode/text formatting, fair warning)
---
Am I the only one who felt weird about robot rose asking me to desecrate human rose? Even after robot rose tells me she was just doing that to distract me I felt really weird about it.
---
Pretty much how i expected her to look like. 
---
I hope I find a legendary Abraxo Cleaner
---
It is sad stuff but I don‚Äôt think people are blindly supporting a corporate, it‚Äôs more blindly supporting a brand and I‚Äôm guilty of that. The Fallout series are hands down my favourite games ever and I just refuse to accept that it‚Äôs dead even if this game is shockingly badly made. I won‚Äôt add fuel to the already huge bonfire but I‚Äôm quietly hoping they fix this to the point it can be labelled as a fairly poor game but no so bad that they kill the franchise. It‚Äôs really heartbreaking and this game *could* have been incredible.
---
Like Bethesda 
---
No, I've fired at least six hundred rounds through it with no wear at all. 
---
The rest and relaxation portion of the ITV was pure filler bullshit it was lazy as hell since the people who are still playing saw the R&amp;R update already when logging in due to the stupid banner, and the people who aren't playing couldn't give a fuck about the R&amp;R buff.
---
Wow cool
---
Wrong. Why would I waste my time posting on this sub about such a terrible game?
---
Yes!
---
You are more than right.
---
When it does that I just look away then look back at it over and over until something pops up. Idk but since the games been out, with all enemies, if it starts to give me the loading loop, I've done that. Idk it makes the items spawn in, but I feel like it does lol
---
Cards that just mention melee without qualifying it with one or two handed e.g. incisor and martial artist. I think that's it? Not sure if there's any more than that. 
---
Or r/talesfromappalachia
---
Did you mean, "Vault 34"?
---
Didn‚Äôt know that was one thanks 
---
This is the most poignant comment on the entire sub. 
---
**Bethesda needs to learn what BALANCE is before they go nuke nerfing everything.  SMALL nerfs and buffs to ALL builds until balance is achieved.**
---
To paraphrase a very famous quote:
---
When they nuke nerfed TSE, I said nothing, because I wasn't TSE.
---
When they nuke nerfed Melee, I said said nothing, because I wasn't Melee.
---
When they nuke nerfed Sneak Crit, I said nothing, because I wasn't Sneak Crit.
---
Then they nuke nerfed My Build, and and nobody was left to speak for me.
---
Let them show that they UNDERSTAND what balance means before you put any more sacrificial goats up on the altar.
---
I used to have 2 good builds, now I have 1 good build, pretty soon that will be 0 good builds.
---
That's idiotic. On the other hand, if you're sure he just copied someone else's post, that ought to be easy to prove. Just google it. 
---
Yeah we all did that until she disappeared.   Complete bull shit. 
---
Personally it annoys me that passive mode is even a thing. It's fallout, everyone and everything should be a target. Instead you have level 30 scrubs following you around that you can't even remove. If it moves it should be able to die
---
I'm sure your threats have them shaking in their boots.
---
/s
---
Think globally act locally. Scratching my head where you stand on the matter but thanks for commenting on my post.
---
Thats worse than what happened to me.  This game is just broken as hell.
---
The inefficient Austin studio shouldn‚Äôt take all the blame for this shitshow. It‚Äôs the big ups at Bethesda as a whole, who said ‚Äúwe need a cash cow like that Fortnite my kids play. What do we got? Fallout? Make it multiplayer!‚Äù You know that everyday of the development, the devs knew this wouldn‚Äôt work, because the Creation Engine can barely handle one player in the world, to attempt 24 is laughable. Go back and watch that documentary that noclip made. It‚Äôs even more awkward now. Every person they interview seems to know what they made is broken and boring, you can hear it in their voices and see it in their body language.
---
I read it.
---
Didn't see one word about upcoming CONTENT.
---
Whoever wrote that should've just skipped it.
---
My friends are quitting because they're BORED.  I can't fix the offline, offline, offline, offline bug on my friends list.  Because it's not a bug.  My friends are not there.
---
Seriously?  Their sonic blast is protected by fireproof?
---
Dang. It's gonna take me a while to figure out how to add that into my build. 
---
Yep. Its been almost 15 years since I touched an M-16 but I can still close my eyes and feel the motions I'd need to do it. When you drill something into yourself to that degree, it *sticks*.
---
Sign me up.
---
Is that whats wrong with FO76, people that haven't played it, interesting...
---
We need all the pieces from 4.
---
Here‚Äôs a spoiler for what support will respond with, ‚ÄúHello, (player), we see you had an issue in Fallout 76. We passed this along to the dev team and they are looking to fix this issue in a future patch. As for your missing items, we cannot add items to a players game, we are sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you for playing, see you in Appalachia!‚Äù 
---
All I could think,  
---
https://youtu.be/9foB2z_OVHc
---
I‚Äôm sorry.
---
It‚Äôs true though.  Modern would have this shit humming inside of a month.
---
How can I roleplay if it takes 4 headshots to kill a scorched? 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
I just got a picture in my mind of this......
---
\*Sees some sort of mini-nuke go off in my side vision\*
---
"What is going on over there?"
---
\*Looks at the shed\*
---
\*Another nuke detonates, half a dozen noob ragdolls spraying out of it like some sort of mannequin mass murder\*
---
"Oh, they added nukes to the shed, nice!"
---
I'll give them credit on modifying the creation engine to get multiplayer to work with 24 people.  Modders have been getting multiplayer to work in the creation engine for years now, but not to the extent that Bethesda got it to work.  I'll give credit where it's due.  However, they completely shit the bed in every other area of the game.  The weapons are horribly balanced, the world is bland as hell, there's a significant lack of "dungeon" type areas, PvP is still broken, still a ton of bugs, base building took a **huge** step backwards, there don't appear to be any concrete plans for the future, and the communication has been abysmal.  
---
I'm just waiting for the Outer Worlds at this point.  Bethesda lost their way a long time ago, but it's only now becoming apparent to the masses.  There are a plethora of developers that do RPG's better than Bethesda, though Bethesda did pave the way for the amazing modern RPG's we have today so credit to them for that too.  
---
If Starfield doesn't innovate, or it's as hollow an "RPG" as Fallout 4 was, that's it for Bethesda.  One burn on an experiment of a game I can let pass, but if they burn be again on a single player adventure RPG I'm done for good.
---
I found my first at Level 104; a 2* Lv. 50 Bloodied, explosive combat shotgun on a super mutant outside WestTek about a week before the nerf. It was a fun week. 
---
The reason you‚Äôre getting downvoted is because you have nothing to support your statement 
---
I think you're being dumb and over-estimating how important you think you and your "case" is. If you don't like the game, don't play it. But other legal teams have already tried to soak Bethesda, and, well, nothing came of it.
---
And having this heavy-handed attitude of "do this or else" isn't going to win you any favors. My advice? Just let it go and find a game you enjoy.
---
Then what is the robot?
---
How about having them drop the guns they use
---
Scorched holding pipe pistols have dropped anything from a 10mm pistol to a hunting rifle.
---
The spinning arrow was my favorite loot drop in the beta!
---
It's a sad day when killing a duper gets you better loot than the in-game bosses.
---
Nah. Let's just pump scorchbeasts full of steroids. Because they're totally not annoying enough yet.
---
This man doesn't get ripped off with out a fight.
---
Bring it on
---
you probably pick a bad time for this bud even the die hards that would be interested are wavering
---
Your wife‚Äôs boyfriend probably chuckles at it, too.
---
I‚Äôm a member of three groups. 
---
Bounty Hunters.
---
Raiders and 
---
Brotherhood. 
---
Depends on what you like to ply. Each has a niche.
---
BH is all about collecting wanted caps and anti griefers. 
---
Raiders is about consented PvP and Hunter Hunted runs.
---
Brotherhood is RolePlay as a member. 
---
Haven‚Äôt seen a free-states group yet.  
---
I agree to an extent. I had a Gauss rifleman build with a TSE. I was a bit disappointed they nerfed my Gauss but being I could easily one shot everything and hearing these griefing stories where players would one shot others in passive I not only accepted the nerf but understood why. It sucked having to tediously level up just to reallocate my points but in the end it worked out. The game for me personally is much more challenging and enjoyable. The issue here is that griefers moved on from TSE to Melee weapons yet the main problem isn't resolved, the slap damage. No weapon should be allowed to break the mechanic.
---
Do it man. I was so upset by the overall quality of the game and the just lack of respect for the customers which keep them in business. I returned the special edition with the helmet. If they can't treat essentially who they are working for(the masses that are getting turned off by now) with respect, I'm not sure I want another product of theirs.
---
Lol just be thankful you got anything. My legendary enemesis clip through the ground and disappear  (just like todd did).
---
Creature feedback doesn't even breach my top 10 list.  I'm guessing they put a bunch of in-house dev questions in a hat and picked one out at random at lunchtime.
---
**Feedback DENIED.**
---
How about they do some actual in-game polling for a change?  Throw a ton of questions out there.  Give atoms for completing the survey.   Then they'd get some real feedback.
---
FYI I don't need the atoms, I'm sitting on a boatload.  Just want more people to participate in the survey to get better results.  I'm not even interested in the my little pony stuff they're putting in.  Want to see some enclave or brotherhood over-armor camo.
---
That ultimatum doesn‚Äôt mean anything but I think pretty much every sees how bad the game is. Just don‚Äôt buy anything else from this company and take the L on this game. Just go play something else and forget about it. Trust me, you will feel much better about it later. This thing isn‚Äôt worth the time and energy to file complaints to an agency. It‚Äôs just going to make you more mad throughout the process. 
---
The only bug that's on my mind right now is the one that makes all your weapons lose 40% of their damage output randomly (and at the worst times). Until that's fixed, combat's nearly unplayable for me. Documented it here:  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amlrfu/anybody\_see\_a\_drop\_in\_damage\_across\_the\_board\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amlrfu/anybody_see_a_drop_in_damage_across_the_board_for/)
---
not really just picked a bad sub-reddit to post on however, we're posting everywhere we can to get things off the ground. trust me your brothers will have your back in this trying time.
---
Doesn‚Äôt hurt to try.
---
still on?
---
Nah this is perfect. Have a read of the posts lots of people are looking for groups still. 
---
Me and some friends were talking about making our own video game company last month. I like your idea better! Thanks for the positive light friend
---
The raider boss was distraught over the real rose being killed (by the folks in Charleston he believed) so he uploaded tapes of her voice and their private times into the Ms. Nanny that was at the ski lodge.   This combined with programming tweaks gave the Ms. Nanny the approximation of Roses personality and memories.
---
I am subbed here and I only entered the game for a few minutes a few days after launch. Pretty much just played 2 beta days. Haven‚Äôt even reached level 10. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt assume anything about the percentage of people subbed here who are regular players. 
---
.....and sleep with da fishes :)
---
It just works. 
---
What's next? Going to go shout at a cloud because you got wet?
---
You didn't get ripped off. You purchased a game that you believed was better than it was - for you. The number of people that continue to play the game show that your "case", that the game is an incomplete mess (or whatever you said, I didn't memorize it), is not even worth following up. Any good lawyer would laugh at you and and any good judge would dismiss a money-grubbing lawyer's case without thought.
---
You want to waste your time, go ahead. But don't get your hopes up.
---
You would think the cream we find in the wild would turn to cheese.
---
Exactly.   For those without military training or friends with it,  it‚Äôs like when you take the same route home at the end of the day every day.
---
Sometimes you don‚Äôt even remember making the trip but you did.
---
Muscle memory.
---
Ahh, thanks for the reply, but none of those things are really up my alley, unfortunately. 
---
How long the engine has been being developed and used is not the issue here.
---
Microsoft have been rebranding and adding on to the same operating system since windows 1 released in 1985 WHY?!?
---
Rockstar have been rebranding and adding on to the same game engine that they've used since Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis released in 2006 WHY?!?
---
Funny story: a couple of my friends when I had just met them were off to launch a nuke.  I stayed behind being level 13 but they nuked Grafton to see if they could get a glowing Grafton monster. But absolutely nothing spawned. No glowing anythings. That was also my first nuke zone and I went in buck baked and took no rads. That is, until I wandered out of it and tried going back in. But later that day we went back to our camp and four level 80 scorchbeasts were waiting for us. Good times. 
---
Not a problem. Better to be part of a group you sync with. Best of luck hope someone else replies to your post. 
---
It was, but there were a lot of inexplicable flaws that shouldn't have existed (like one Asari face), a ton of oversights, and a lot of glitchy moments. The sad part is that the story and choices were so amazing, and we're never going to get to see the impact. There were some very tough choices that made me sit there and think for a while.
---
Passive mode doesn't prevent you from being killed. It prevents you from starting fights. ... in most cases.
---
I assume that when you internalize the difference, it'll stop bugging you so much.
---
Yeah, content.
---
There is none.  Zip, zilch, nada.
---
It's bugfixapalooza.  Just made that word up.  It's where you try to fix 100+ bugs in a single patch and seem to introduce even more annoying bugs at the same time.
---
Oh, my friends are missing too.  The only clue I have is it says "offline, offline, offline, offline" next to all of their names.  Maybe it's just a friends list bug.  Oh wait, they're not in our discord either.  Where did they go?
---
Pacifist mode. 
---
People who actively play enjoy the game more then people who gave up on it months ago? You may be on to something here.
---
It's brutal..   
---
By any chance do you have adrenal reaction?  
---
There appears to be some linkage between that and "Rad-Worms"..
---
I‚Äôm just curious what games did you pick up since then cause tbh that‚Äôs not long ago?  I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick by no means. Just am curious
---
Funny how in all that you never mentioned fixing anything...?
---
Well, maybe not everything....   
---
But atleast some of it ;)
---
In Fallout 4, those Behemoths were scary.  Deathclaws too.  Cazdors I'd love to nuke THAT valley.
---
In Fallout 76, easy, easy, easy.  Crap loot too.  Maybe worth it for XP?
---
Maybe if they made them 3 star legendary and HARD to kill it might be worth it.
---
purge
---
You start to yawn a lot as the content dries up.  They haven't found a perk card that fixes that though :)
---
Cross posting to r/fo76filthycasuals
---
They always have. I can not think of a single other major game company that releases as little patches and updates for their games as Bethesda does before 76.
---
j u n k i e ' s
---
Preventing you from starting fights=preventing you from getting pvp'd is my whole problem. I shouldn't have to pull 12 lvl 50 npcs to get a low level player killed/removed from my field of view.
---
"work"
---
BACK TO THE PITT - Ancestor. 
---
at least the shitters don't complain about TSEs  anymore and people one shotting legendaries so theres that
---
7 games over almost 18 years isn‚Äôt that long ago? 
---
I‚Äôm in my late 30s and have been playing Bethesda games since I was a teen. 
---
Reinforced is a modification like shadowed you can apply to any of the types of armor light sturdy or heavy. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt buy the study plan though. Just get the heavy armor as a drop or use legendary armor of any type.
---
&gt; At this point IMHO the only way this game can be saved is taking it offline for a while. **Fix the issues**, add content, **redesign** whatever is needed to make duping impossible, add a DLC to the base game to make up for all this crap.
---
I said it in the second sentence.
---
Lol my bad forgot how old that is. But I understand I am in basicly the same boat. But only difference is if a fallout was announced today it would be preordered today. Because I trust Bethesda 
---
I use the term loosely.
---
ok.  just found arm sturdy.  728 caps for each with all my perks.  guess i will pass.
---
[your face rn](https://imgflip.com/i/2t5jo0)
---
Just checking, within 1 minute of post got a downvote (which is a weird miss use of a downvote because like it or not my post is very relavent). Anywho thanks for the link!
---
I sixteen it.
---
People might downvote the hyperbole. 
---
Glad to see another joining the rank. I made my peace out post earlier, ended up back here to post this meme to the grumpy fucks https://imgflip.com/i/2t5jo0
---
No Adrenal Reaction here. But I do have "Marsupial" (from a serum) and "Unstable Isotope" (picked up in the wild). I thought at first it might be perk card related, but it affects all weapons - melee and guns - but not grenades. 
---
It does seem like a straight 40% drop across everything tho' - my Hardened Hunting Rifle, with perks, does 130 damage normally but more often than not it's doing 78 now. None of the perk math works out.
---
Awesome to hear! Sorry not attacking you lol, just wanted to use you to show how I intend to direct the conversations. Was a little rude though i admit. Been getting a lot of hate messages for trying to talk about the game positively.
---
Apex is EA
---
So Apex=bad
---
Except half the challenges are bugged and cant be completed.. 
---
Hmm...
---
When I'm out and about, I check the map a bunch randomly, and take note if a player is anywhere even near my camp, if they are I quickly log off and log back on to server hop, not risking this shit happening to me...again :\
---
I've never seen them heal more than once, and multi-star drops weren't a thing in FO4.
---
I don't know why people hoards thousands of units of ammo. Aren't most of y'all speccing obe shot builds anyway?
---
PA sets with all the mods would be hard to compensate players for, just simpler to allow them to be carried over.
---
yes I can have it both ways its a game after all.  The wipe is to eliminate all the duped items and start fresh, i have yet to see PA sets as a major dupe problem. You keep the mods installed, but not the mod itself.
---
Jump ship to EA? Talk about out of the frying pan and into the fire.
---
Hi, I'm visiting from Filthy Casuals. üòÉ
---
I like all the things you like and don't like the things you don't like!
---
You should hang out with me and maybe some of my friends! We have a group that plays on Friday and/or Saturday nights pretty consistently. All on PC. Most of us are central time but some are east coast time, the rest I don't know.
---
We are a variety of levels and ages and have a bunch of different interests. I don't think any of us know each other in real life but I'm not sure. We met through the game! 
---
Feel free to drop by if you see me online and say hi and I'll bring you in with whatever we're doing. heatherlk on PC.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can hook you up with basic legendary armor for cheap or free.
---
Skip sturdy and go straight to heavy either way. I don‚Äôt think vendors sell the heavy plans. They come from events rewards.
---
Upvoted for that final sentence. 
---
Ive literally never had such a love/hate relationship with a game. Until now. 
---
Talk shit = upvotes
---
Y‚Äôall sure are obsessed with posting in this sub despite how much you hate anything to do with the game. Take it for what it is, Fallout 4 with multiplayer, nothing more, nothing less. I‚Äôm sorry this spinoff wasn‚Äôt the game for you but dang you need to stop whinging.
---
Remember when we got that pre-Christmas update saying that it would be the last infrastructural update before we got new content? Haha man 
---
6 months? 
---
Hell I'm waiting until it comes out on sale a year later at less than 50% off
---
Don't care how good TESVI looks, not buying it.
---
They told him that EA would value someone of his skills... 
---
I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised.  This company has often relied on the user base to release patches.
---
It's especially a shame that there's zero replay value. I made a character that's good at bonking things and OK at shooting things. If I played for 100 more hours I could play through identical quests to make an identical character that's good at shooting things and OK at bonking things.
---
Woo. Hoo. 
---
Whatever you say, Don Quixote. (RPing. Seriously, though, good luck!)
---
They can fix melee weapons doing massive slap damage.  I know the exact reason.  I don't use that, and don't like it, but I'm not giving up more sacrificial goats until they PROVE they know what BALANCE means.  FYI it involves adjusting ONE thing.  ONE single thing.  Boom done, no more problems.
---
I'm expecting a triple nuke nerf that kills all melee builds any day now.  Just as hard as the TSE nerf or worse.
---
When I get up to level 130 on one ranged character and 170 on another melee, only to have them nuke nerf both...........nope.  I'm out.
---
I'm not bringing up a THIRD character to chase whatever the new "best meta" is.  Two strikes is all they get.   Not giving them a third.
---
They can guess the reason when I don't buy Fallout 5.  Since they hate surveys, I assume they'll just have every dev toss a reason in the hat and pick one out at lunch.  Whatever they pick out will probably be on my hate list tho.
---
A Fallout Fan that pre-orders EVERY Fallout title and buys EVERY Fallout DLC.  Even re-purchased one that didn't link to my steam account for some reason.
---
Ha
---
Punish? getting duped everything out of the game, getting them to fix the bugs and exploits, add content, stabilize the game and its servers...really?
---
I love FALLOUT and I still like Fo76 but I would gladly give it up for a month or 2 if we could get a finished product at the end.
---
Same my dude! I also classify as a roleplayers as well as a "want to shoot random things because guns". I have 4 characters, all different factions. 
---
If you want, there are some nice folk in 
---
r/fo76filthycasuals that are...casuals, people who play for the fun of it and some roleplayers
---
Lots of very high min/max people in this sub and I might be unsubbing, holding on just to see if things will get better. 
---
Pleasure to meet another roleplayer! My main is an Enclave average Joe who does not look secret agent but rather.... Interesting. I run a small inn near Whitesprings, on Xbox
---
Where did you find that? Haven‚Äôt seen that one yet. 
---
No idea why you got downvoted, maybe some missed the reference.
---
&gt;I'm in charge. This whole operation depends on me. No Fantastic, no power. Got the whole NCR suckling my teats, and it feels so good
---
Don't forget the push for the Atom shop at the end!
---
As someone who has supported this game from the beginning, even I'm feeling disillusioned now.
---
Im still keeping hopes.
---
Otherwise, i will just have fun with what we currently have.
---
(Unless they shut down the servers )
---
Thad because they don‚Äôt know. 
---
I've just had this with Apex Legends. Critisized the game, go spoken down to by children telling me how i should go back to Fortnite, then had my post deleted for my post being 'Uncivilized'. The irony.
---
Hm, if I remember correctly Vault 34 turned into the boomers. They weren't really hellbent on killing people, they just really loved blowing stuff up and were very xenophobic. 
---
This vault would be crazy heavily armed, probably be attached to a mine and have its own weapons factory, but the test program in it would straight up be just indoctrinating the residents into seeing it as their mission to wipe the slate clean before they can use their GECK and restore the old world. The inhabitants wouldn't even necessarily be evil, like they all feel bad for the mutants, but think sacrifices have to be made to restore humanity. They would basically look at it like "Ten billion people got nuked, killing a few thousand more so we can rebuild properly is regrettable but it doesn't really increase the depth of the tragedy" 
---
Did you ever find plans for a normal sledgehammer?
---
I‚Äôm down for it. 
---
I dont really care for the reason tbh it's just entertaining.
---
It used to be a super mutant before the last patch.  I‚Äôd never seen the fire station wiped until last week, then is empty so much I was wondering if they‚Äôd changed it
---
You claimed a workshop, didn't you?
---
White ones are yours, green are from the workstation 
---
I made an alt account with different names
---
What did we ever do to make you not like us? Was it making the Super Mutants? Or the Scorch Beasts? It was the Scorch Beasts, wasn't it?
---
Specific feedback, in 1 direction. They are probably working on plans for the foundation for dlc 2 or 3 and want to see if they missed anything. Complaints arent even 1% what this inside the vault is about. They said they addressing some monster concerns and loot but want fan ideas for fun.
---
... and their auto detecting radar? BS. No way in hell a SB can "sensed" and followed my max Agi/Sneak character from a Fissure to the other side of a freaking mountain.
---
What they need to do is give us a way to fully respec instead of having us grind a point at a time. That right there is complete bullshit especially after a nerf.
---
Challenge accepted 
---
That is basically the thing, they both don't work. Neither does meeting up nor pvp. Games just a big unfinished construction site :/. 
---
It‚Äôd be nice if that extra 10% existed, and then punched through a wall
---
It was a joke, but yeah that would be neat.
---
Someone tripped over the power cord and dragged me back to reality
---
And I'm sure harassing people trying to actually do something's going to move mountains, too.
---
Here here
---
I haven‚Äôt uninstalled, but I also haven‚Äôt played in over a month and maybe 10 hours in the month before that (would only play till a crash). My wife quit before that.
---
You can like it all you please, but by the standards of most people it‚Äôs a total fucking trash fire that burned us and BSG will have our ire till they‚Äôve made up for it.
---
Guys, just hold in there for another month and SBQ might be a slightly less annoying fight and have a little better than no loot drops!
---
The sad thing, the people at BSG that will get all the rads (laid off) are the ones in the trenches, not the idiots at the top.
---
Which, if taken to its logical conclusion, could result in some really surreal and poignant moments if the scorched were fleshed out more.
---
Sounds like a pretty great idea.
---
Well, today's Inside the Vault did everything short of officially ending development. It seems clear Bethesda's cutting their losses.
---
SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH
---
Well the fact that people would turn to murder each other would come after level 5 meaning after confronting the wildlife that inhabit the area some may rebuild, some may still fight for the security and safety of others and since there many chems in the game some can become addicts or hell with the stress of all the wildlife wanting to kill you maybe even become a raider or just kill to get the resaurces from others. To me it makes sense either way
---
Was it incandescent, florescent, or LED?
---
I am sadly.
---
I am going to play Anthem, you should check it out. I tried the free demo weekend and have to say never played anything like it.  
---
Kinda feels like a Fallout 2099 version without the nuclear hype. Power armor suits, humanity clinging to survival. The kind of coop experience the fo76 trailers promised but never gave us.
---
Kicker for me was the only thing I ever really wanted in the Atomic Shop was a simple clean White paint for my PA. They have it (Winterized) but instead we get a princess pink bed.
---
I will still be playing Fo76 but only a hr here or there to vendor or explore a bit.
---
I 100% do NOT hate this game I want it to be GREAT. I love the FO Franchise but Beth just seems completely lost regarding who plays their game and what those majority of players actually want. 
---
 You want Heavy Combat. Accept no substitutes. Slap the BOS mod on it for the best armor in the game.
---
So you basically look to kill low level players for fun?
---
wut 
---
I honestly have no idea where they got this creature balance thing from.
---
Nobody was talking about it.
---
I saw zero complaints about anything but the Scorchbeasts.  
---
Was there some sort of in-house contest where devs put questions into a hat and they picked one "theme / topic" at random during lunch?  That one gets included in the inside the vault?  If so, whoever came up with that idea............you're done making suggestions, thanks :)
---
**DO, SOME, EXTENSIVE, IN-GAME, SURVEYS**
---
Quit stabbing in the dark and wondering why you're missing the target and everyone's mad.
---
FYI I bet you'll see some heavy "content needed" responses in those surveys.

And dont forget to stop by the atom store to give us more money.
---
I would love this
---
They've asked me if I have a degree in theoretical development. I said I have a theoretical degree in development. They said ¬´Welcome aboard¬ª
---
Yep, no content.
---
I'd love a job where I could just fix some things and smash other things, but never really accomplish anything new for the customers to enjoy.
---
I call it smashy smashy fixy fixy smashy smashy job.  I'd be sooo good at it.
---
I think now he was referring to the Atomic Shop not the actual game.
---
Uh yeah, pretty sure you're the only one. Kind of a dumb thing to be annoyed about, in my opinion
---
You forgot to tell them to kill themselves. That's how a post like this usually ends, right? Seriously, I'm pissed off too, but this is going too far.
---
2 months ago I would've had a bunch of recruits for you.
---
Now it's just me.
---
Pretty soon it won't be me.
---
I wish you luck though.   *Ad Victoriam* brother!
---
Yeah. Nobody asked for PVP improvements, TSE nerfs, reduced Scorched Beast sonic attack spam, improved SBQ loot table... Literally nobody ever once circlejerked those items to the top of this sub Reddit everyday for weeks. 
---
...yeah no that's not happening
---
Absolutely not. I prefer to help most people. There has just been more than one time when a lower level person was getting in the way/following me around to leach off my high level kills. Generally I don't mind that, it's just annoying when they show up and don't even speak/ emote. Just follow and get in the way.
---
I wasn't trying to sound like a dink, I just think if it moves it should be able to be shot.
---
Seriously? How do you live life so afraid.

Look for a meat pile.  Sometimes she despawns into a meat pile.

Hell, we know they're fine integrating moders' work into their games, or else the Creation Club wouldn't be a thing. People are trying to fix your mess for you! LET THEM!
---
Hey...I like this game
---
yep followed that guys advice and got slaughtered by mutants and waves of ghouls
---
Maybe try telling THEM. Not the Reddit, you‚Äôre asking ALOT expecting BGS to sit and read EVERY comment on EVERY post.
---
That's your opinion, mate.
---
I literally said that but ok
---
They asked me how well I understood game development. I said I had a developing degree in games. They said welcome aboard.
---
And where's my monkey?
---
shit i wanted the quarian ark so badly 
---
Xbox pc or ps4?
---
I don't understand whats your point, but  "*I saw zero complaints about anything but the Scorchbeasts.* " So you are telling me, you didn't saw those hundrets of "f\*\*\*ing scorchbeasts" post wanting nerf of those flying \*\*\*\* ? 
---
If you think this is about balancing, um i think it is about developing new enemies for us. 
---
That's the problem with people today... Just because the internet give you a voice dose not mean anyone has to listen. 
---
&gt; but Bethesda has no precedent for what you are saying. 
---
Are you delusional? Bethesda's past games are still filled with bugs and glitches. The only reason you can still play them is because of mods. Even Skyrim still has bugs and that's been re-released countless times.

Only bought the base edition. Haven't played it in about 2 years. Considering buying the expansions and starting a new character. 
---
That's a bit bullshit. Not two weeks ago everybody was complaining about them not following existing infrastructure because they were doing something different. 
---
The no NPCs is innovative. Some may not like it, that's called innovation. The combat system and online VATS is innovative. The CAMPs are innovative. 
---
Stop nitpicking things to complain about. It's one thing or another on this game, everyone wanted Scorchbeasts fixed and now it's a complaint, because they wanted to do something right and get one ahead of the other? Come on. One of the worst "fan bases" to date. 
---
Or maybe your at fault for buying a game that was not suited for your type of audience. This game was suppose to be like Rust. They nutered PvP from the start because the singleplayer carebear community bought the game in mass complaining about pvp and Bethesda got greedy taking your money and implemented a slap mechanic that ruined the game for both pve and pvp audience. If you had a brain and ignored this game paciently awaiting Fallout 5 which is more suited for your type of singleplayer storyline gameplay we would not have to wait until March to finnaly get our PvP servers which should have been what the game was all about from the very start.
---
No, I was at the Overseer's camp, not far from the vault. 
---
i paid like 15 and played like 120hs it was worth despite the hole mess

You would be downvoted to oblivion if you said this 2 weeks ago

Fallout 76 a realm reborn
---
Your username is great BTW :)
---
It is not allowed to explode until after I find and kill a flatwoods monster.
---
Killed few supermutants, looted things of them, scrapped and get my atoms.
---
Got holotape challenge completed without getting atoms after loggin tho. Some daily/weekly challenges are bugging up.
---
Fallout 76 doesn't support roleplay almost at all. Not only because of simple things like the lack of private servers, text chat, characcter names and backstories,  and other essentials, but in terms of roleplay tools or ingame tools to help promote roleplay.
---
It's not like Rust/DayZ/Arma 3 where I can build a town and have a jail, a mayor's office, etc. There's no way to roleplay a bandit. No reason to value your life. If you die you just go back to your loot etc. 
---
This is a whiteknight post. The only roleplaying your doing is pretending to like this game the way you've claimed to.
---
Bethesda will usually pop in to fix miss and release an expansion, but modders handle a bulk of it. 
---
Skyrim, for example, has a wildly popular mod on the PC. It's an unofficial patch that fixes literally hundreds of bugs, including physics errors, desktop crashes, bugged quests, etc. Bethesda doesn't handle it because the fans do. 
---
The same goes for content drops. They will push out huge expansions, but the community handles small things: weapons, monsters, artifacts, new areas, new quests... all added by modders.
---
FO76 is the first time they have zero help from the mod community, and it is showing. 
---
They can take that respec and shove it up their bums as far as I'm concerned.
---
I'm not a full on min-maxer, but I try.  My build is still too polluted with weight perks to be a real min-max.
---
Every time they nuke nerf something, they hit so many ITEMS in your build that you can't fix.
---
Spent a lot of time working on trading for a TSE?  Have a few of them?  All wasted, no respec fixes that.
---
Spent a lot of time trading for good melee weapons?  Have a few of them?  All wasted, no respec fixes that.
---
Wait till they start nerfing armor...lol  You're going to see some EPIC meltdowns then.
---
In the trading subreddits the meta changes INSTANTLY when they hear of a nerf.  Nobody wants that thing anymore and everyone dashes to the new meta.  How many weeks has it been since the TSE nerf?  I have posts up EVERY night offering really good items for whatever the new "meta" is, only to find nobody will give any of it up.  And trying to find your own item of the new "meta" in-game is a sad joke.  Legendaries dropping absolutely nothing, or garbage, or under-leveled, worthless items seems to be the norm, not the exception.
---
Let them learn balance.  Small nerfs and small buffs.  Until then, they can stuff those nerfs right up their bum.
---
But you had claimed a workshop? It's a well-known exploit. If you've claimed a workshop, someone can take it, and PvP you anywhere on the map.
---
I wouldn't unless they added in a ton of more content. If I wanted to start over fresh now, I would just make a new character. 
---
thanks, it fits my personality :)
---
Please dont forget to check the Atom store. And go buy skyrim. 
---
I wouldnt for a while.  200 hours would of been thrown away
---
Bff crossout &lt; war thunder
---
nope
---
FO76 literally inspired me to buy the annual pass for Destiny 2. The longer I played 76 the more fondly I remembered Destiny
---
I was really hoping it'd shape up to be a No Mans Sky situation, but you're right it seems more like an ME:Andromeda situation which means it's likely never gonna be properly fixed 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to PvP, *never* own a workshop.
---
If you own one, you can be killed in full damage PvP pacifist mode on or not.
---
Third time: if you capture workshops, people will come and kill you.
---
Good thing we're getting new content in a month
---
The Nuka Grenade, but *not* the Quantum Grenade, does radiation damage.
---
3 star cricket dropped nothing for me except cricket glands yesterday
---
i stopped playing anyways but they should of just released a full game initially and there wouldnt of been all these problems, but i think a server wipe is the worst of the worst ideas
---
I'm redownloading because Im super excited for the Elsweyr expansion this year, home of the khajiit!!
---
That's not how adrenaline works.  You get the additional %damage on a kill, not before.
---
&gt;anything but the Scorchbeasts.
---
You read that incorrectly :)
---
That sentence directly states that I did see those scorchbeast posts.
---
I don't need new enemies.  My friends didn't leave because of new enemies.  They left because there's nothing left to do.  One you've killed the mirelurk queen, is it challenging anymore?
---
It's like the house is on fire and they're asking "what are we having for dinner?"

What, who said anything about dinner?  Uh, the house is on fire!  Probably work on that before you start busting out your Martha Stuart skills :)

Heck of a lot of games on both lists. Maryland had basically all of their people working on 76 for at least some portion of the last 3 years.

You're right, submit a support ticket that a minimum wage worker will click delete on.
---
I can confirm the vendor was NOT in the fire department.
---
&gt; She infers quite a lot
---
Implies.  You infer, she implies.
---
I agree with you about the Scorched and cover.
---
Nice, I actually just tamed one down in the bog.   
---
I assume gulpers are super agro as well?
---
Where's the risk, given that we have no way of knowing what feedback they get?
---
There would have to be a complete rework of the game we are talking ff a realm reborn type reboot otherwise I would just avoid buying anything Bethesda makes that is multiplayer at that point. 
---
I will say, the mirelurk kind if an absolute treat compared to the yaogui. THe bugger opens my door comes in, then walks out. 
---
I want to see more rad scorpions :(
---
I do like the full open world with random interactions myself, but I feel it‚Äôs hit or miss finding other folks to play along with at my pace (heavy looting, listen to the hoop tapes, read all the terminals, Would be especially nice if you could run a good main storyline in a co-op isolated world, then graduate to the broader community. Would make it much easier to bring any friends in if there was a bit softer landing to the game play experience.
---
I'm not knocking the community managers or the fact that the scream spam is being fixed. 
---
Your points aren't that great, though. 
---
- VATS has been around for 20 years; it's Fallout exclusive, yes, but the system has existed since the first game. 
---
- The combat itself is virtually identical to every other shooter game. 
---
- CAMPS are not innovative. Minecraft lets you build structures. Ark has a build system nearly identical to 76's. Fortnite has a similar snap build system. I'm pretty sure Dark Cloud on the PS2 had a similar system
---
But it‚Äôs not much of a single player game either, there‚Äôs nothing to do and it doesn‚Äôt take long to get to that point. What there is to do is just artificially grindy bs
---
As a photographer, yes. Just yes. I stopped doing photo-mode because I thought "where would I share this?"
---
Side note, is there a sub to share photo-mode photos?
---
i've never found one it would let me tame (gulper)
---
Fuckthesda's most loyal dog. Good doggy
---
The fact that they've tried to discourage hopping through other means is why I'm convinced that this request isn't super feasible.
---
**NOPE**
---
Spent too much time leveling 2 characters.  With the super XP nerfs, not doing that again.
---
Spent too much time trading for better weapons and armor.  While it can be fun at times, it's a friggin grind.
---
That would be a GOODBYE moment for me.
---
That would be bad ass. Maybe they could have a few intelligent Scorched that are just crazy but capable of doing something other than standing around growing leaves
---
Hahahahaha. What are you? 15? You're the reason people call gamers entitled.
---
No. The nuclear option is a terrible option. 
---
In regards to people still holding duped items, they should just put out a 5 day warning, stating any held items above 1500lbs over your max weight will be purged. 
---
Gives players five days to manage their inventories and wipes duped items out
---
To be 100% honest though, we still have day one Skyrim bugs that are in the latest and greatest versions ha. My prayers are with the team I hope the best for them... I just hope that they let us modders do our work to HELP them. That's all we want.  A better game for everyone. 
---
Might as well work for Activision. If they get in trouble  with the community he can make a post making one of the characters homosexual.
---
If you're looking for lower level PA parts Burning Mine has 2 spawns.  One at the top of the hill, and one just inside the mine doors.
---
If you're looking for higher level PA parts, Watoga Emergency Services roof, the Crashed Vertibird in the middle of town, and the locked door inside the Bus Terminal.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
Like the locust in gears of war ? 
---
Now i understand.
---
 "*My friends didn't leave because of new enemies. They left because there's nothing left to do*." 
---
Bethesda is asking us, what new bosses we would like to see. New content, new things to do.
---
Yeah i do enjoy killing mirelurk queen, they are tankies mobs in game now, but nothing hardcore. I do even enjoy killing basic scorched, or super muties. I do enjoy game for over 400hours. 
---
[Now i enjoy killing players.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg&amp;t=311s) There is plenty things to do, it is open world with much options. Your friends left, becouse they can't find fun here. That's their problem, not game.
---
And becouse i want more Co-op content i did reaction to their inside of vault.
---
love killed a chance that they had at rebuilding....
---
Not sure I'd be on board with camp defense events, I hated having to go defend settlements from attacks in FO4, and turrets take up way too much budget in this game, so setting up a bunch of them to defend your CAMP would make you unable to build much else.
---
I like all the other ideas though for the most part. To add on to the scorched in power armour idea, they could also drop a random power armour piece when you kill them(from raider to X-01 or even Ultracite armour), or maybe a plan for a power armour mod.
---
On a side note, I'm not sure if it's a place that spawns a random kind of enemy, but my friend and I fought a massive swarm of Liberator robots in the observatory north of Top of the World. We died at least 10 times from them because there were so many and every time we killed them all another group would come out of nowhere. We had to have killed at least 40 of them by the time they stopped spawning.
---
No I didn‚Äôt miss it, but you seem to have missed the English class where they talked about verb tenses. 
---
2 months to fix the lever rifle animation
---
I would play, if there would be improvement in game content, extra content and compensation
---
That's not how that works
---
I'm lvl 25 and im still playing, its one of the best games you can buy for 6 dollars
---
Sometimes it's fun to blow off a little steam, I'm not going to go fuck up someones brilliant hard work..but a wood shack turret base at white springs..hell yeah
---
Why do people keep posting this crap?
---
The good old days :‚Äô(
---
You're looking for BOS Combat Chest, BOS Combat Arms, and BOS Combat legs.
---
Unfortunately those plans look like they are missing from the Grafton Train Vendor.
---
If you're really interested in getting that upgrade and can't wait, you may be able to go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar and buy the plans, get someone to upgrade your stuff for caps, or maybe free upgrades if you bring materials.
---
This is more of a pc problem. Those of us who play on console were never this dependent on mods, nor as married to the concept. We also eventually ended up with decent optimization in most cases. My Playstation is the same as the next guy's. No difference in processor core numbers or graphics cards. It's clock rate is the same as the next. Pc doesn't have that level of consistency. Sure there are still small bugs, but there are more Playstations playing than similar variations of Pc.
---
So they intend to address one issue every two weeks, which equals roughly 25 issues per year. And the game already have dozens of them. They are not gonna make it at a pace like this. 
---
I have actually seen many people wanting PvP improvements.
---
[Really?](https://i.imgur.com/6BdV4AB.jpg) are you only happy with 100% upvotes? 
---
I agree with what you're saying, but I think you've forgotten all the console players like me who had to make due with the bugs. 
---
It's absolutely my pop in, pop out game.
---
Why are you even in this sub? From what you said it sounds like you didn‚Äôt buy the game so I don‚Äôt see the point in coming onto a sub and saying, ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù unless you have literally nothing better to do with your life. 
---
Oh no, somebody call his mother!
---
Thankyou
---
Someone else on the same server just ran through the same guide, maybe. Server hop and try again?
---
The option is called "block for session." It seems to be based on your initial log-in.
---
F
---
That doesn't excuse the issue, though. 
---
There are hundreds of thousands of pc games that work without issue, most of which are made by independent developers, who can resolve bugs and fix problems. 
---
I'm honestly pretty confident Bethesda, at a managerial level, got complacent with bug fixes, knowing the community would handle most of it. 
---
Beth can‚Äôt really do much when it comes to items in game especially when it‚Äôs your entire stash. I hope I‚Äôm wrong tho and you can get your stuff back. 
---
This is exactly my feelings. Red Dead has its faults, but what it does correctly is so good that it makes FO76 look absolutely worthless by comparison.
---
Bethesda had no precedent of hiring some low-grade devs to quickly make a buggy multiplayer mode for their older game, but here we are.
---
We need actual barter box's and player shops god damn it
---
&gt;Modders have been getting multiplayer to work in the creation engine for years now, but not to the extent that Bethesda got it to work.
---
The most amazing thing is that actually surprises me, because in every other respect modders have consistently been better at improving the same BGS game over multiple iterations than Bethesda‚Äôs ever been.
---
I had to go back and read that section again.
---
They said nothing about boss creatures.
---
The only thing they said about events was timers.
---
There was no indication of what the heck they wanted from that info other than grabbing it for some unknown reason.  I haven't seen any of those questions come up in the reddit.  And I'm here all the time.
---
Now change that scenario to them saying "We're looking at adding more Boss Events to the game, what creatures would you like to see as Bosses, and what could we do to improve them".
---
Now  you've got me 100% on board.  I'd see they want info, and I know that info is going towards something my friends might like.
---
What's going to be the next question in the Inside the Vault?  Flora questions?  Where are your favorite loot locations?  How many hats do you own?  They need to tighten up their priorities with in-game surveys, not random questions they pulled from a hat.
---
Your sarcasm detector is broken.
---
You just aren't that great at it and probably hyperventilate each time you get into a confrontation... dont worry, it's just a game.
---
It was nerving energy weapons. I loved my plasma rifle from FO4. üò•
---
Not seeing the same companies you do then.   I just tried to play Lord of the Rights: (something), its about 6 years old.  Crashes every 2 minutes.  Not a bug, but crash to desktop.   Fun game but literally unplayable.   I have several older games like this and similar results.   
---
However, every Bethesda game I have always works.  Sure they got some bugs, but at least they work.   Bethesda is a solid company.
---
I‚Äôve been playing crossout too. It‚Äôs a shitty F2P model, but a super fun game. Never enjoyed a competitive team game before it.
---
Recruiter? Where do I join up?
---
This is the same problem I have. I just don‚Äôt enjoy grinding in the starting areas just because I can‚Äôt put a dent into the enemies in certain areas I‚Äôm up to in the quests. I want to come back and finish my quests, but only when there‚Äôs PvE servers or the enemies are less of a bullet sponge.
---
In terms of what we got, a co-op game would have been better. That being said, on a conceptual level, the idea and potential behind Fo76 I like a lot more than a co-op title. It just seems like poor planning, poor execution, poor everything. It could have been a real gem of a game if they took the time and effort to actually make a good product.
---
How would that sort the issues?
---
You can't compare these to past single player games though, it's pretty standard for any game to have a few patches, expansions and then moving on. This is an online game meant to consistently get patched and that's exactly what they have been doing. 
---
Valve isn't patching old games, once in a blue moon they release a hotfix to fix 1 exploit that covers the entire source engine. 
---
I have a theoretical degree in game design.
---
I replay Bethesda games all the time.  Not a single time in over 15 years have I ever installed 1 single mod.
---
More than that, it was a bug that carried over from FO4
---
Skyrim unofficial patch only has a little over 1million unique downloads, while Skyrim itself has sold over 30 million copies. Bethesda isn't as reliant on the modding community as the modding community wants to think they are.
---
" anti griefer system is broken "
---
I have to inform you that there is none ... there is even a perkcard for demolishing buildings.
---

---
If that had done it in the first couple weeks when duping was first identified...   
---
Yes.  
---
Now?  
---
Would be the last straw for me.
---
I'm just done pre ordering a game from any place. 
---
No problem, I think it was just a misreading of the year.  I was just confused cause I hadn't heard about that lol.
---
He took pity on you because you asked Bethesda to critique your build. Well, they passed it on to the team. His advice is what you got.
---
Do You still have it? I want it 
---
You seem a bit salty. Have you tried not being so serious? Might help you live a bit longer.
---
Let's nerf ranged weapons harder, melee needs to be the best at everything.
---
I got downvoted for stating this month's ago. Glad this sub lost the whiteknights. I knew they wouldn't be around forever. 
---
Yeah, what the heck is that dude talking about? Bethesda barely ever supports their games. We always have Unofficial patches that fix 400 million bugs, and Bethesda is too lazy to  copy past them into the base game. 
---
No Man's Sky was and is a far worse game that FO76 ever was and is.
---
I would wear the shirt out of that.
---
What your describing a nuclear option..
---
How do you take into account...
---
-people on vacations or work trips for a couple weeks?
---
-players with out of control but legitimately gained inventories?  
---
-the players who build up inventories for the promised player vending?  
---
Your suggestion is nearly as bad as a wipe, if not worse 
---

There are scorched everything in scorchbeast queen fight
---
Grafton day can have level 40 grafron monster if you are there with high level, but yeah there could be even stronger variant.
---
I hate liberators, as they evade shots from vats. When i now get aggro of lvl 5 group of those bastards i rather run away.
---
From what i readed, you want more bullet sponges. Are you crazy man ? :D
---
Then you obviously are collecting too much junk--that's 45-65 bulks crafted. I want that much plastic for crafting shotgun shells, but sadly it appears they've nerfed all of the spawn points. At least all the ones I know of
---
You spelt anti-fun players wrong.
---
It really is comical. But don't you dare mention modders or people here get extremely emotional very fast.
---
I got a 3\* Legendary Bobby Bin. Sadly, upon use, it turned out it wasn't two-shot after all.
---
We've tried...   
---
We've offered..  
---
At the moment the answer is "Submit a bug report"
---
No it's proof that they're breaking up actual articles so they can have an update every week. You really think this is all that will be in the patch?
---
On top of poseidon powerplant is tower and on top of it there is minigun, red chest and booblehead spawn.
---
Another one you can find in raiders camp south of trainstation, which is near top of the world. There are 3 different booblehead spawns in this camp. So you got to search whole area there.
---
No. I like the concept of this game and have always wanted to play fallout with my friends. Did they execute this game poorly? Yes, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't have tried. This game, after lots of love and attention can still be something great... just because it's not right now doesn't mean trying it was a mistake or a bad idea.
---
Glad you like it :D
---
No, you've got that backwards friend.  It's 2019.  We paid them.  They didn't deliver.  
---
If you pay $60 for a lifetime supply of food at a restaurant and when you go it's absolute crap from your perspective, you're not going to just keep going back, you might at first out of spite, because you paid $60. After a while though...  Especially after you complain and the restaurant keeps botching your order, or worse, promising they know how to fix it, then they fix it for your next meal, and then go back to their old ways of making shitty food at your very next meal.
---
We're not entitled.  We're consumers. And we're voting with our money and our online voices.
---
I disagree, that had new stuff.
---
There were those two around the holidays which literally just told you the same patch info as the previous ones.
---
Considering they said gamertag I assume Xbox 
---
On east of watoga is place with broken trains. You can have snalligasters spawn there. Guess what they drop. 
---
Well how about your giant game studio take 16 hours and fix it once and for all..  Stop dragging these simple bugs out over weeks and months.  
---
Go to Whitesprings, all the coat hangers in the 3 clothing shops. Whitesprings is great for Springs, Steel, and Plastic
---
Did you read it?
---
I think fo76 has more than a few small bugs lol
---
And it's not a pc problem when you consider no other publishers have issues with bugs to the level of Bethesda. 
---
Yes, please! That would be some much better.

Another idea I had about Scorchbeast Queen event problems is to make that event a continuation of the Silo. This would mean it is instanced to the group of players that launched the nuke on the Prime Fissure and they take a Vertibird parked inside to the place of the fight. Now I know that coming together as a server to fight a big boss is fun, but this would really fix the leeching problems and the fact that loot in this wonderful game has big troubles loading when more than a 4-5 people are in the area so no more losing Queen's loot to spinning circles.
---
You know Skyrim and FO4 are still bugged to this day right?
---
Thanks :)
---
No mans sky was worse than FO76 at launch but the Next Update made it into a genuinely fun game for me
---
I would love to be able to go near Whitesprings and do my quests, but I‚Äôm level 16 right now, so it‚Äôs pretty much impossible. 
---
Instead of a level cap, what about just better overall server balancing? Dedicated servers for specific level ranges, for instance, so that you don‚Äôt end up going to do the Top of the World quest as a level &lt;20 and you run into a bunch of &gt;60 super mutants. 
---
You could still join your mates in the same ways you used to, but if they are high level and join a low level server, they wouldn‚Äôt end up skewing the enemies‚Äô levels. If you are low level and join them on a high level server, that‚Äôd be your prerogative. 
---
It might not be a popular idea, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôd work, but if we had something along these lines making early game more accessible it‚Äôd be great. Right now, I‚Äôm stuck unless I jump servers, which is random and can take a while before I find a good one, only to have a level &gt;200 player spawn in and mess it all up again.
---
This isn't saying they aren't reliant on the modding community, just that they don't care that much about player experience. That data just shows that 29mil people had to deal with all the stupid bugs and Bethesda just didn't care enough to fix em. 
---
Very bizarre, I've not had this pop up, but keep seeing posts about it, trying to find a common denominator.  
---
Power Armor or regular armor?  
---
And thanks for the replies
---
I went back to FO4.
---
Played 90 hours since release and I just discovered this playthrough that there's a boat full of pirate robots.
---
Yeah stopped playing fo76. Turns out there's still shit to do in FO4
---
Are you on PS4?
---
I'll peak in the morning, but that's odd....  
---
Whut? Do people actually think a spin off title flopping is enough to topple Bethesda? Seriously?
---
&gt;Preventing you from starting fights=preventing you from getting pvp'd is my whole problem. I shouldn't have to pull 12 lvl 50 npcs to get a low level player killed/removed from my field of view.
---
So... don't use passive mode and kill them? 
---
Passive mode doesn't protect you from being pvpd, it stops you from damaging other players until they damage you
---
I am a die hard Fallout fan.  I bought 2 copies of the game in Beta.  
---
I thought this was the perfect game to turn my GF onto an online RGP/MMO/Post-Nuke game that would have some semblance of any of the previous games.  boy was I wrong.  Started playing Vanilla WoW for free - much better experience. The basic mechanics of successful online games have been around since 2005 at least.  This game is an absolute disgrace in terms of mechanics, leveling, loot tables, and player interaction.  
---
It's almost like it was an experiment to see how bad a game could be made before they voiced up.  Well, congrats Bethesda, you found the floor, all of you on this team should be ashamed.
---
Are you sure that it doesn't double-dip with shotgun perks when modded thusly?
---
That would be slightly North if the Whitespring Lookout
---
It's fascinating watching the same ~~paid~~ accounts cry about the game every single day
---
Like dude, if the game is so terrible why are you here?
---
Not really what I was aiming for. Im a big fan of tactical shooters with low TTK. I dislike most enemies being bullet sponges. I want enemies to have unique strengths and weaknesses to exploit. So its less of a mindless grind chipping away their health.
---
Find a metal tub and 4 waters and its a great weapon
---
Bethesda is good at world design.  They are not good at everything else. Who the hell thought a UI from 2009 that is constantly modded to be better would be good in 2018?  
---
Or that despite what the echo chamber thinks Bethesda games are still immensely popular by gamers even with those issues in place.
---
 If I hadn't played the games myself modders would have made it out like these games just don't function at all unless they bless it first. The overwhelming majority are doing just fine without them.
---
Well... I am biased but enjoy doing tweaks, rebalances and creating variety myself ;)

That‚Äôs how I feel about 76 :(
---
PC
---
i could help you out, i‚Äôm level 130-ish but since i‚Äôve done pretty much everything there is to do alone i‚Äôd be happy to help.
---
 i have discord but so far i‚Äôve only used the voice chat with a few people i‚Äôve played with for months, so i‚Äôm kinda careful like that, but once i get to know you better i could talk almost daily.
---
if you do wanna team up just add me on discord, helka.exe#0350
---
Also, its not that assaultrons are unbeatable, but that the laser is cheesy. An assaultron has more firepower and capability to keep you suppressed than a sentry bot. It doesnt feel right, like if a sniper sucks at long range, or a radrat having more HP than a super mutant.
---
Yeah they do, they sell out all the time. Remember when Star Wars did the han solo dance game?
---
Austin and Maryland co-developed the game. But it's been passed off to Austin and it's in their hands now. Maryland's busy on Starfield and ES6.
---
Be fair.
---
They're 2 and 0 if it's a *failure* streak.
---
Thanks...   
---
As one of the people trying I get the frustration.
---
I absolutely agree with the power armor thing. They made raider calls cooler in fallout 4.
---
In addition, I‚Äôd almost love to see more returning enemies from fallout 3. There are a few that could fit into the game without having to retcon anything.
---
I‚Äôd maybe like to see something similar to the swamp folk in point lookout. This is West Virginia, after all, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some room for a mutated hillbilly camp somewhere on the map.
---
Trogs could also absolutely be added to the ash heap without breaking the lore, in my opinion. Maybe they could be similar to wendigo, since they both have resorted to cannibalism
---
(Also, more eyebot variations)
---
It would be helpful if you listed your gaming platform in your ad.
---
A huge amount of players have 200+ hours into the game before reaching this point.   That is far superior amount of time than almost all of my other games (330+ games).   The only ones that have more hours than this is XCOM2, Skyrim, FO4.
---
Hell Civ VI; Beyond Earth only got 9 hours from me before bored to death.
---
I'd rather it be more like Mad Max, the worst thing about the game is the PvP handshake.
---
Weapons deal *what* to enemies?
---
I roleplay as Raoh.  So min/max is legit
---
Doesn't change the fact that Bethesda settled for a good enough experience. I played fo4 back on release and had to deal with crashes, weird physics bugs, and a ton more shit. I still used to play relatively frequently but had given up due to a crashing issue I keep having. 9nce I remembered mods exist and got the unofficial patch, things were alot better!
---
I just think that such potentially heavy issues shouldn't be ignored by devs.
---
I do understand your point though, I just disagree with them settling with the player experience. Settling also brings about complacency, which I believes showing in fo76
---
Damage lol new phones autocorrect sucks 
---
How can they go back to a time before it was "The Pitt?" üòÄ
---
I like the game "overall", and your core points about the midrange being (previously) nearly perfectly balanced...  
---
Could not agree more there...  
---
Also agree they don't seem to understand the higher level game and mechanics..  
---
I think your loosing people with the amount of rage, you have some good points regardless..
---
How about instead of adding new ones, revamp the scorched and make them interesting 
---
Awesome! I'll add you. I'm new to online multiplayer and I feel like chatting with someone could make the game more fun, but I understand if you'd like to wait. 
---
If you dont do online pvp stuff fallout76 or other games I see why you dont do well against others n that's cool if it ain't your thing, a few more weeks and maybe we all get the updates n balances n other changes needed. But ya quick fps skills n reflexes go along way even with "the sub par engine". Its a skill thing that takes time that games like cod or battlefield can really help with
---
&gt;Floating balls
---
My friend, you don't know what you're clearly missing, since No Man's Sky NEXT is the shit. It adressed everything. WHen the "Floating balls" were the last Thing you saw in that game, give it another try. Real Multiplayer, real Campaign, and much more stuff. Otherwise you'd be pretty unfair. And since you payed for it anyway‚Ä¶
---
By the way: FO76 is dipshit compared to NMS in ist current state. In fact.
---
Only if they added a shitload of content immediately afterwards 
---
Style?
---
I'm also greedy n have 1500+caps so I'm sorry that your fightin broke ass griefers. Atleast if you win you get the full bounty off me
---
I played it about 1 month ago which is after "NEXT", yet during the community event, all I saw was floating balls.  Ever.  Not a single player.   Saw all those spammed message balls too, which was horrid.
---
That's what they'll tell us about...   
---
But as for it being the only thing? ;)
---
Maybe they want feedback from people other than redditors.
---
I pray I never have this experience while on PS4 
---
I believed in Bethesda until now. I really loved fallout franchise, but now it's dead for me. I can't say that I will preorder or buy any Bethesda games in future. They choosed money instead of fans: terrible Bethesda launcher; terrible release without proper testing; terrible post game support; how much money Bethesda saved on this decisions? 
---
There was a call to uninstall the game just last week to let Bethesda know players were very unhappy. So Bethesda uninstalled right then and there to stick it to Bethesda. Why are we surprised? ^^^^/s
---
I've experienced a similar bug. We could easily damage, but not kill, one queen, while the other was practically invincible and eventually flew to the edge of the map. Same outcome.
---
The only known upgrade between the .308 and .50 receivers is that with associated maxed out perks, you can craft more .50 rounds for cheaper over a comparable amount of .308
---
Way too long to read
---
Good to know. Thanks!
---
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre aware that you are unable to play the game long enough to see your Atom Shop purchases due to our servers and have passed it along to the dev team!‚Äù
---
This topic has it right 
---
They could go to nexus, sort mods by popularity and downloads - download it, clean code and merge. Look at fallout3, fallout NV and fallout4 nexus - look up what weapons and enemies or game mechanics were most adorsed and implement those 
---
Instead they opt to go out and paste a random shout out for feedback like it‚Äôs the one missing ingredient to make a giant come back and at the same time completely ignoring the feedback that is already there for them to just ‚Äûharvest‚Äú 
---
Go play something else for awhile, or go for a walk 
---
Well you summed up every of my thoughts. I can't bare this anymore. Too many good titles left. I'm leaving this Burning pile of shit. THanks for this amazing community and Sub though. You're amazing and the game didn't deserve you all. Cheers
---
If I run in to some jerk with a horribly OP weapon that starts to overwhelm my griefer shield trying to hog dead enemy loot, here's what I do:
---
Popping Med-X and using Lone wanderer = 45% flat damage resistance. Let them try breaking through your reduced damage anti-griefer shield doing half damage in the first place. &lt; My personal favorite. You should always have Stims, Stealth Boys, Med-X, and Radaway hot-keyed, imo. This pretty much guarantees nobody can troll you, after the TSE nerf. I also run the Healing Factor mutation and Assassin's armor. I laugh at griefers. Med-X + Lone + 5x Assasins armor parts + regenerating health = 85% damage resistance VS. players, recovering any damage they DO inflict, added to the slap shield. Just sit there and taunt them.
---
Hopefully you have a pro. I accidentally bought the standard version when I meant to order the pro.
---
Every time I play, I kill a few scorched near my camp. Then upgrade the level 5 shotgun, find a player under level 10 and give him the gun and 100 shells. Puts a smile on both of our faces.....
---
Substance?
---
The first Into the Vaults were sporadic releases and at least a few paragraphs. But now that they've settled into one every Thursday there's hardly any substance to them. I think it's because the playerbase asks for  weekly updates on upcoming patches but there's not  enough  concrete  information  to announce, so they're breaking them up
---
Asking him to prove his claim after he asked me to prove my claim is idiotic? 
---
The idiotic thing is OP asking me for proof then not answering when he/she is asked for proof.
---
Welcome to 2019, this is the norm now if you cant tell with game development. What was the last perfect game your played??
---
Their continuous fuck ups has really not been inspiring to say the least, I‚Äôm on to other things but I hope one day they get their shit together.  We want more than one fight at end game yet we have to wait 6 months for a PvP beta? Sad times.
---
There's the NPC in Watoga that you have to visit for side quests every time I leave the elevator my PS4 locks up never once have I got it to work. While not game breaking it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.
---
I've been wearing the northern civil war outfit, I'd kill for the hat. Been wearing the civil war era top hat for now.
---
All platforms my friend
---
Hear hear! Fellow roleplayer that is only interested in cooperative content and story and exploration and being able to play my characters in this RPG.... \*roleplaying\* game.
---
Darn! 
---
Odd considering Fallout 4 was considered the most stable of Bethesda launches. It is entirely possible it wasn't the games fault you had crashes. Especially since the unofficial patch doesn't patch anything for crashes. 
---
Also I don't think anyone really knows if they are settling, Bethesda still has to make money and if 76 stops making them money they can't waste resources trying to fix it. I feel like people already forgot they fixed some longstanding engine issues with it like the FPS cap.
---
Unfortunately you'll get zero response from the community managers on a post like this. Even if you do, they'll only say that they'll let the dev team know. 
---
at least i enjoyed the single player campaign for andromeda, and i would say i enjoyed the multiplayer for a while too. once i 'finished' fo76, there isn't much else i can do. grinding for repairs, grinding for ammo and maintainability, is not fun. i can't even enjoy prime weapons because prime ammo uses hard to get flux. 
---
Hell yes...   
---
And 1x1's that can snap to the stairs
---
Glad you got some use out of NMS, even the Next update did not make it fun for me to play.
---
I jumped back to Anno 2070 and had a blast though once uninstalled NMS.
---
It does but I hate that they don't let you adjust your hot mic so I'm on mic 90% of the time because it picks up every little sound.
---
:((( me too
---
Why?? other games like this track way more items with item I'd tags and who crafted them in the name. go play ark with unlimited inventory and constantly respawning map resources. Fo76 can do the same if they figure it out.
---
They don‚Äôt want feedback - they want to ‚Äûshow‚Äú how much they listen to their gaming community and how every change was built on the decisions of the player community... but I repeat, they don‚Äôt want your feedback 
---
TAKE A BREAK??
---
They're only 60% as effective since the nerf :P
---
That is so nice.  I am willing to bet it hurts quite a bit when getting hit but that probably happens much fewer.
---
You're not making any sense.
---
Bad aim homie time n plan your shots better not to be rude
---
Need a hug bro? It's ok 
---
Had that happen also had it happen to where you could damage the queen to 80% her health then your no longer damaging her even tho each hit should take a chunk out each time
---
Aside from crafting for low level friends or their alts nope seems to be about it
---
Omg very bad aim homie smh 
---
Fallout 4 had an actual story, that wasn't thrown together in 10 mins. Also, the game doesn't crash every 5 mins and there are mods that fix the bugs that have not been touched by Beth (they actually have some of the SAME bugs in fo76). Also, you don't have to manage your fucking inventory every 30 mins and there are NPCs with meaningful/funny/interesting stories.
---
This game is NOT FO4 with multiplayer. It's an abomination not worthy of the Fallout name.
---
Poor sarcasm pal. Was trying to be funny 
---
guess im keeping my explosive tesla shotgun as a shotgun then
---
Yeah I'm on PC but I wouldn't say I'm very sociable(very shy since I feel like the youngest on the server), but I wouldn't mind shooting you with what you've got, from interactions I've had and some aggravating others(Not shooting their base just doing the taunt or building up courage and asking politely quietly XD), I know I  may need to overhall my armour set up and start grinding to get a real good sentinel roll on a really good armour piece(I've got school and tests coming up so, not much time to grind I have). When I tested my builds I pursued people who I saw had good weapons and asked them to test them on me, I'd chug a good amount of damage if I kept using some magazines (server hopping watoga, the diner at the back of the BoS vendor has a chance of spawning in two magazines, so I usually grab them) and items and then eventually die, mostly cause I have a near full sentinel set, but it's not a full sentinel assassins set, it has a zealot piece and wheightless, so I'm not the guy to test stuff mostly with, I've gathered data from my own set while also taking in factors of other peoples more complete sets. I also don't have OP ranged I'd say so, my best are a TSE The Dragon(How'd your friend get it to 4K? I've tried everything that I can imagine and I'm still stuck around 1.7k damage on that thing XD), Quad Explosive Combat shotty, AAE Handmade(Not automatic, since my best mag on it does 10 bullets a round), Berserkers Exploding Lever-Action (the berserker bit is useless with a Sentinel assassins build, having high damage endurance and all), supressors explosive harpoon gun (One shots when I have all the heavey cards on and sneaking), executioners exploding Black Powder pistol and a Two Shot Broadsider (has like 10%+ damage while aiming and faster movement speed, but I keep it for the lols) , I have no bloodied explosives weapon, hence why before I was hunting for a legendary sniper rifle. I have a bloodied LMG which I know they're crap, but 70 dmg a round ain't that bad, does more damage than my Exterminators exploding LMG.
---
For stealth boys try just walking around the BoS stations in the cranberrybog and Fort Defiance and their base in the Mire, a stealth boy should spawn in each one, and the Stealth Boy Mk. III I think is bugged and won't give the amount of time it says it does.
---
Nope I got a 2013 launch PS4 
---
Never had a night like yours, worse I get is maybe 2-3 disconnects in 6 or so hours of playtime and the odd blue screen crash 
---
That being said I know this game is a buggy mess. Just amazes me how some people have it so much worse than others yet are playing on the exact same system 
---
By going back to the time when it became "The Pitt"
---
rofl... So we are the ones not thinking, not the ones sucking Beth's dick, no matter how bad they fuck up? seems hypocritical to me.
---
Pistols are lighter and faster than rifles but do less damage. It says this in the loading screens. Why would a side arm out perform a rifle?? Use your brain 
---
Yeah, but you go wanted, and end up with a HUGE bounty if you wreck someone's base. And first you have to stumble on a player's base. Admittedly not TOO hard if you watch where they travel to on the map or check common spots. And I will watch a map to turn the tables on a griefer I can't kill, and find HIS base. While wanted your base is fair game. I completely tore apart some jerk's base who had an explosive uber-weapon who was messing with me when I was too low level to fight him and he was wanted. Left nothing but the floors of this huge, elaborate compound. Got no bounty. I lost 50 caps, he lost hundreds of caps worth of resources and the hassle of re-constructing his entire base. Then I just hopped servers. I won that one. There are ways of dealing with jerks, even when you can't directly kill them.
---
I suppose it does depend on level and build.  It was not a difficult fight since he never seemed to move more than a few steps from the pond, but he tanked 4 head sneak attacks from The Dragon and 4 body shots from my lever gun with 8/9 rifleman perks and full covert operative before he died. Had he been able to get a bead on my location I wouldn't have been able to down him.
---
I recall in FO4 that once you hit level 20 or so on survival that you basically became a god. With proper tactics, behemoths fell very quickly. But I suppose that's because two shots seemed a lot more common in FO4.
---
Typically the same for me, usually one or two of what I mentioned above, but I guess tonight was a perfect storm.
---
Muskets are 1 shot per minute do dps is shit compared to semi auto rifle
---
I‚Äôve always been Master
---
I've already had to change from an explosive build, I don't want to change again.
---
I know right?
---
Well I am level 129 and close to 300 but goof around quite a but and did not do whitesprings when the XP was insanely high.   It was boring to grind.
---
You probably have at least 200 hours at least.  Yes, TSE are extremely rare to actually find.   Someone said they have 25 luck from the unyielding build and seemed to get quite a bit better drops on regular basis though.
---
He's STILL being downvoted, when you sort by best he's way down the list from people who are still saying "BETHESDA WILL FIX THIS FOR SURE LIKE THEY HAVE WITH LITERALLY NONE OF THEIR OTHER GAMES!"
---
Dear Bethesda, 
---
I love Fallout franchise and I do massively enjoy Fallout 76, that being said the only thing that stops me from playing for the last month or so is stash limit. I do not want to drop items I have been grinding. Even that I will most likely never use drill to kill enemy in the game I still want to keep it. Currently my stash is maxed out and I have about 600 on character which means game is pretty much unplayable for me. 
---
I will return the game and continue support development by buying vanity items in the shop when the stash limit will be, at least, doubled. Until then...Anthem is coming. 
---
Thanks for hard work! 
---
I don‚Äôt know if they ‚Äúsettled‚Äù though. You can always make something better. Bethesda‚Äôs interface happens to work really well with modding. The fact that you could fix so many little errors in a functional game means it‚Äôs massive. Its not like they didn‚Äôt put a ton of work into Skyrim, and honestly unless there‚Äôs something major most game company‚Äôs don‚Äôt fix a whole lot after a single player game is released. There‚Äôs instances where Bethesda could have been better, but I don‚Äôt think Skyrim a great example. No one is ever going to make a perfect game of the same size and open world-ness. This was especially true at the time Skyrim came out.
---
Reboot the simulation!
---
+1, they missed the window people would have Stomached a wipe
---
Cool thanks. 80 hours in and I still feel like a new player!
---
You forgot the ‚Äúbuy our stuff‚Äùpart.
---
Yeah like 99% of their difficulty atm is just being blinded by that damn attack, not even the damage. 
---
Only if that fixed all the bugs and completely cleared the way for new content, separate PvP, and PvE server and a road map with a clearly defined future. 
---
So are they going to ignore the Overseer's Mission? It's impossible to complete. I collected all the logs and played them many times. I've tried this after every patch and still nothing. Isn't this supposed to be an important quest? I just want to finish the game already.
---
Creature feedback and a bed for the ATOM shop? Bethesda really outdid themselves this time ROFL.
---
This is awesome. I believe every server should have a big brother or big sister to call on for help. And the person calling you only needs to pay your fast travel costü§î
---
These are the things we should have had if they had finished the game before release.  MY BE one day ...
---
But they couldn't call it "Back to the Pitt."
---
rofl, so you are okay with "creature feedback" and a new bed to the ATOM shop as their update? Oh boy, no wonder Bethesda is not even trying anymore. Ppl like you just eat their shit up like candy. Congrats and enjoy your new bed!
---
Not much story content maybe but multiplayer gameplay loops yes. Look at games similar to this and other pvp games not like this. Think ark or rust when you look at fallout 76. And look at other games with no story and strictly pvp stuff that have massive player bases and the same shit happens ing over and over 24/7. Ffs look at rust and how ppl play it all the time with no real content or story but for the fun pvp gameplay loop they all do again and again. Get wiped raid get wiped lol and they still ppl play all the damn time
---
&gt;  while the same in Elder Scrolls is bruise in the arm.
---
I'd say, more like an arrow in the knee.
---
They have to fallow rules too and had to make a game for pve'ersand pvp'ers to exist in the same world. Only when we all flipped shit did they say ok let's divide em.
---
Where at in the center? 
---
At the time I made that comment about karma, I had more downvotes than upvotes. I wasn't expecting this amount of upvotes. 
---
I mean I am not trying to be mean or nasty but did you even try to google that first? Just saying, there are several videos that pop up with acid farms, heck even links to Reddit threads. Same for power armor locations. There are whole video series showing you how to get to every set of power armor and what spawns at what level, 
---
What have you developed lol
---
It feels like they felt preasured to say SOMETHING but didnt have alot they were ready to divulge.
---
I had matt black boss raider armour in FO4 and purple X-02 Very schmick. There you go, Bethesda. That's 2 votes already.
---
I wouldn't suggest reducing incisor. Anti-armor melee fills a niche for big gunners who feel the need to use their 15 strength and whip out a power sledge instead of expending ammo. Just because it's not at the top of the meta doesn't make it completely nonviable. For example, with incisor, and my power fist I need to run the puncturing mod and both Weighted arms to approach 100% Armor Pen. However, with an anti-armor power fist, I could run aerodynamic arms for a massive decrease to power attack and heating coil for some energy damage versatility. It's even more apparent with weapons like bats and sledges that have a wide number of more versatile mods.
---
I run a tanky, bolstering/+STR. armor build utilizing iron fist, martial artist, incisor, blocker, and barbarian from strength, tank killer from perception (it's nice to shoot things, sometimes), fireproof and adamantium skeleton from endurance, lone wanderer, suppressor, and tenderizer (or bodyguards, stranger in numbers, tenderizer, suppressor 1 in a team) from charisma, demolitions expert from intelligence (that AAE handmade, though), evasive, gunfu, adrenaline, and action boy in agility, starch genes and class freak in luck. It's not the meta, but I do just fine. I don't need more than 900 points of damage Instigating, or 400 furious. It's surprisingly effective in PVP, as well. 
---
I enjoy not being the glass cannon at the top of the meta, I'm happy right where I'm at. I just need more content.
---
I hope that Bethesda will allow a little chance to craft 1, 2 or 3* weapons depending of your luck Stat. If a such feature is added then this perk would be really interesting. Actually it is useless for endgame players
---
&gt;Let's not pretend Skyrim's writing was anything but garbage
---
I dont know why you're getting downvoted. Skyrim's writing and storyline is atrocious. It is more rare to see ppl say they played Skyrim for the writing than ppl that say they just liked the sandbox and modding it.
---
What story?? This wont ever be fallout 5, This is an  mmo no story needed 
---
This would work rather well as events to be honest.
---
I get this game just completely freezing at Poseidon. The part where when you log in you're at the train track. Then you walk towards that red thing like a kind of walkway or something going across to Poseidon. Before I even get to that red thing game just completely freezes. Happened a number of times. So definitely repeatable.
---
Well, even though it doesn't make a lot of sense with regard to the steel only, but it does prevent you from storing lots of other stuff which is more taxing to track.
---
Well in the first 100 hours after reaching level 50, I did not have Sneak/VATs but I fought SB when I needed to.   Even 3 at once.   This was with just normal handmade and a normal BOS Recon Rifle (Hunting Rifle).
---
It was plenty viable.  I would see posts in here where people would brag about killing SB in 10 seconds without issue.  Called them just a nuisance.    Its interesting how things turn around when taking away their TSE.   Now its no longer viable?  
---
it was plenty viable for me to fight them.  Sure I had to grind more ammo for an hour afterwards, but could do it.
---
Now with my Sneak/VATS, I can easily kill them with the very same handmade I have had over 100 hours.
---
TSE still do WAY more damage than my normal handmade ever did and ever will.  I'm pretty certain that if I picked up a TSE heavy weapon, I could still kill those SB pretty decently without Sneak Hide. 
---
I know this because I use to carry around a Mutant Slaying Explosive Plasma Gatling just in case found a SB, it could knock them down  to 30% health in just 20 seconds before it broke.  The only perk I have in heavy weapons was making it lighter, that's it.   So that Explosive Plasma Gatling was doing about 200% damage (Pre-Patch), a TSE still does 189% damage post Patch.  Pretty much still in line which about same damage.  I am certain that most players have a good amount of perks for their TSE as well, so they are still doing more damage with TSE than I did with my un-perked Explosive Plasma Gatling.  Yes I know even normal Plasma Gatlings do good damage, but so do many other heavy weapons.
---
End result is, sure it makes it so TSE cannot kill the SB in 5 seconds.  It might last 30 seconds now with TSE, that does not mean its not viable anymore.
---
Pvp?
---
Talk about delusional people....
---
Well there more ppl playin this than us assholes on this sub reddit
---
I have the pro. Doesn't make any difference.
---
[Hope i will meet you protecting someone, so i can eat you both. \*evil laught\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg&amp;t=311s)
---
I did already point out that there have been plenty of suggestions within the official forums? 
---
Don't forget the new bed in the ATOM shop!!!!!!!!
---
How? The game isn't set up like other fallout titles the story and quest interaction is way too shallow no fallout player wants that not even me. Save that for fallout5 and make this the mmo it's supposed to be 
---
Yeah no i didnt cause i found that with other games like fo76 i have to watch videos rake like 5-10 minutes getting to the point (like ark youtubers) and i just click off and decide to say "fuck it" and look for it myself. Here i get straight to the point answers with no bs and its been really helpful so i say, why not? 
---
No it was a glowing one 
---
Just a little tip, if you aren't going to do anything at the battle but shoot it once and hope for the loot please do not take the spot of someone that can be useful to the fight. You are only being an annoyance by hiding in a BoS camp hut like a coward.
---
It saddens me when I see posts from people that were well known in the modding community, dropping off and giving up due to Bethesda's blatant lack of communication.
---
Thats where I am at if they can't do this live online service and fill it with the content and bug fixes and patches that are needed to be a live online service game.  if they can't make it work and can't make things work with the game's engine or their servers, then I wish they'd just be upfront and honest about it and say hey we tried, but we're going to turn everything over to players to play solo and privately co-op with friends and enable modding. My god theres so much the modders and community could do with this game and the bones on it.
---
To add, if you craft something for a second character, technically you can't pass it to it.
---
You have to disturb someone twice to help with the transfer.... or to buy a new account.
---
And in of both cases, we have the risk to lose the items being transferred due Disconnection. It happened to me with an Hazmat suit level 1...
---
Did you have Rad Worms? That's a known bug.
---
It does. Never been accidentaly wanted in 400hours.
---
When do ceo's value anything other then money?
---
It's super annoying.  I used to could unequipped everything in charisma and it would work again... but now you have to server hop
---
Yeah with a proper melee build he is squishy as all get out. Black diamond with no strength bonuses is maybe 5 hits.
---
Or say for that matter 
---
Right.   You have to jump through way to many hoops and that‚Äôs IF everything works as designed.   
---
It's a poor design for that tho, the quests are so weak. Go to place press button to receive introductions to go to next place and press button. Total weak sauce compared to singleplayer fallout titles. I hope some super creative dev's can prove me wrong but the story and quests here seem to be a secondary aspect giving the linear simplicity to them. Any way fuck fallout 5 outer worlds will have what we missing here for solo story drivin games. The future here is pvp and I know its unpopular but that's the truth
---
I don't think that it's balanced, that AA aspect is completely covered by a single 3* perk. There was AA math somewhere here, that showed, that using AA weapon with incisor adds like 6% to your AA rating. In your scenario, due to how Fallout damage formula works, slow speed 2-hander will still hit quite hard. And this will also force you to consider which legendary effects and mods you choose to use. 
---
I had the exact same thought. The scorched are plainly intelligent enough to use and maintain complex weaponry and tools, even if their goals are entirely slaved to the scorchbeasts. There's no reason why power armour ought to be beyond their reach, especially with so many discarded suits laying around all over the place. It would be great to see them in mis-matched, hodge-podge armour that feels as careless as their tattered clothes, shambling around. 
---
Bonus bonus points if while they're in that armour their voices are muffled and modulated through the helmet's speaker like BoS troops in Fallout 4. 
---
Level 89 here. Ill help. 
---
Add me paulofg1980
---
ill be online later today around 7 pm gmt.
---
I've had this issue crop up in the last couple days, personally. Only started since I completed my Excavator set, but I pulled out my other PA sets and it does the same thing. Tried every possible thing, nothing seems to work, always missing the chest piece when I get in but when I get out, the torso reequips itself onto the chassis.
---
Ok... ahahahahah
---
Seems like another invasion by r/games trolls... 
---
I got it done but thanks! I was actually able to do it without killing any Scorchbeasts. But used a lot of stimpaks lol.
---
that's not very lvl 14 friendly 
---
Love to see some fucking true hero Mass Effect N7 bois out here. Maybe one day we will see the quarian ark or maybe even our cries for a remaster. Stay strong comrades. 
---
Why shouldn't I be concerned with pvp where it's an ingame mechanic? A mechanic I enjoy too. Because its BGS pvp is void? Are they only allowed to do single player pve? The only one who doesn't fuck up is the only o e not trying
---
Go to Wixon Homestead, kill scorched, scrap.
---
In 400 hours i killed people i can't count.  Mostly guys with bounties / anyone who shot me (i don't care if it was accident). I am raider so i do it for entertaiment. Also i experienced some pvp in Monster mash and hunter/hunted. It is all fun, shame people are scared loosing their caps.
---
Now when i have time to do so, [i go to workshop that someone own and ofter them to buy their lives with food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg&amp;t=311s). 
---
I have build my charracter as raider. Spend many hours on him. If they separe PvE and PvP servers. I'd be sad. Becouse my main gaming entertaiment is PvE progress, but when i don't do it right now i go pvp. 
---
Hmmm to complete the quest you dont need to kill a SB,  but to earn the trophy you need to. But you can do the quest later again anyway when you're higher leveled. ;)
---
How is a person writing a PR article indicative of the number of developers? Some people really can't do even the basic thought processes...
---
How about more unique enemies? Like perhaps have a mid range boss at the water park be the alligator turned animatronic by a wave of recently reactivated park-bots,with the alligator being the boss, eating players for a temporary disable, while the robots attack us?
---
Or better yet, dynamic battles as a whole. I'm still really disappointed with FO4's story and many design choices, but one thing they mailed was walking into a three-way with supermutants, synths and raiders duking it out. Having some Scorched attack a mutant Outpost with some liberator bots chipping away at them would be cool.
---
I like the outlook of this idea, because power armor are cool, even tho I don't wear one inside the game, but seeing how bad work they have done so far with enemies, this new power armor enemy would be same boring as all enemies in F76. In the end it doesn't matter if my bullets are sinking into yellow sh#t or blue sh#t, sh#t is sh#t. Boss tier monsters rather need mechanics and ability actually beat the players who don't know what they are doing or aren't working together.
---
Your character wad telling you he wanted a frosty beer with snacks too
---
I will put our flair differences aside to join you.
---
Speaking of: I just had one better. 3* glowing one on the green at Whitesprings and the corpse disappeared right after it died. Another chance at legendary junk lost. 
---
If you ask me, the risk is that you imply that 'Hey, guess what? We're looking into fixing creatures in the future. Give us ideas.' The danger is that you have some thread gain popularity on Reddit or elsewhere with a perfectly fine idea for retooling creatures, that is totally unworkable internally. And now you need to say 'No' to your customers.  Its all about expectations management.
---
Sweet good to know! I thought I needed to kill one so I spent 2 weeks trying to level up at the golf club it was such a waste of time lmao 
---
i have faith that one day, a large triple A company will take up the reigns and present a sequal or prequel that will ruin the world's productivity
---
i'll probably be 65 years old then, still wearing my N7 hoody (i highly recommend the hoody, it's really good material)
---
Basically there are people (often from r/games) waiting for any misstep by Bethesda to start their fake rants. Bethesda makes an average patch? Fuel the outrage. Bethesda makes short ITV? Let's make a noise about how this means that Bethesda doesn't care...
---
Well, I trust that Bethesda people are not blind and will ignore those pathetic trolls and their weak arguments. 
---
But why? Why would they design a system that hinders their ability to make patches, changes and nerfs accessible and easy for them? I realize and believe you're not an apologist, but the reason to me would be the same as op; lack of effort, foresight or incompetence. This is a live game, and they didn't prep for it.
---
I think after Anthem and maybe another flop, they will go the Bungie way and separate the same way they did with Activision but with EA and get back to their roots. Unfortunately I realized wanted a new KOTOR since they are teamed up with EA anyway and they have the rights so it feels like good timing but... 
---
This is my theory as well 
---
You forgot the 2 biggest offenders of melee damage powr scaling....  
---
Talons and Twisted Muscles. Just nerf them to hell and bam... melee is balanced. 
---
Yes. It feels like they were adding multiplayer to the game engine when an idiotic executive saw Fortnite profits and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make ours battle royal style PVP and the ability to destroy whatever players build. Just like fortnite!‚Äù And he thought he was a genius. 
---
i think his name is homer Simpson...
---
They are like a dog that wants to play fetch but won't drop the ball. 
---
No buffs, only nerfs! 
---
No fixes, only more bugs!
---
They haven't added any new content, have barely made any changes people wanted, and instead just nerf stuff to increase the grind ever more
---
I would be a roleplayer myself, i love to roleplay and with every survival game i make my own story with distinct characters. Well more of a writer if anything and honestly i enjoy the game for what it is aswell and well i dont see it as a fallout game, i see it as a survival game with a fallout asthetic. Ulike everyone else on here.
---
theoretical degree in game development sounds better?
---
I am not the best writer, more of an orator. When I say a few small bugs I am referring to games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, Fallout 3 and so on. 
---
Rockstar is an excellent example of a game studio that produces tons of bugs it never fixes. Some examples from GTA online include but are not limited to.
---
Heist Replay Glitch 
---
Clothing Glitches 
---
Mrk2 Ammo Station bug
---
Armor resistance bug
---
Volatol two part radar bug
---
Rpg Rapid fire bug
---
Modded account transfers 
---
Orbital Cannon for free glitch 
---
and so on...
---
Yeah and you dont have to kill the only in the Glass mine either. Trigger the quest and when it asks for the SB sample, just lure the Whitesprings SB to the robots, shoot it at least once and let the robots do the rest. 
---
You'll earn the trophy anyway and you wont waste too much anmo.
---
they should rather implement dungeon/raids and use this "Giant Rad Toad" in there. Difference is that you can instance dungeon/raid out, have more stable environment and have no situations where low levels come to endgame boss, tag and then sit in shed.
---
i think it's because the game spawns enemies appropriately for players, so if a level 100 dude walked around the place they would spawn highest level mobs, but when a level 14 walks by he sees the same mobs.
---
i really don't know, but that's my impression
---
Yeah, at least he can open something with it :)
---
I feel you OP
---
Two of my friends put their trust into F76 and bought  it on release day - and Bethesda immediately shits all over that trust by cutting the price in half after less then a month 
---
I forgot the give friends cars glitch, my bad
---
Finding a gunhas been my dream since I left the vault

Can‚Äôt join, but I think it‚Äôs great that you invite the community like this, so thank you. 
---
&gt; Unfortunately I realized wanted a new KOTOR since they are teamed up with EA anyway and they have the rights so it feels like good timing but...
---
a new KOTOR? do you mean the 300 MILLION DOLLAR piece of work that was Star wars: The Old Republic SWTOR?
---
=P
---
Pc or console?
---
Also, I'm sorry to tell you but the game seems to die out. :(
---
I don‚Äôt have on SWTOR it was just not the narrative and rich story that KOTOR was. I still play all of them SWTOR included when I can.
---
And again, the fax it's fucking free-to-play!! I paid $60 for... Crashing?!?!
---
Well that just doesn't make sense.
---
Mmo no pvp? Get real
---
We share. I get a monkey, he gets a Blackwater. ;)
---
I think asking for further ‚Äúnerfs‚Äù is poorly conceived.   Any more fun reductions at this point will erode the player base even further.  
---
Pc
---
Because the real life equivalent (potassium iodide) has a slew of side effects at radiation-treating doses. It should probably carry a disease risk on its own, lol.
---
&gt; SWTOR it was just not the narrative and rich story that KOTOR was
---
sad isn't it =(
---
Crap... You can see it...
---
I'm pretty sure whoever wrote that post didn't intend to slap us in the face. There's probably been a conversation somewhere at some level asking how they can get to better know the player base. Perhaps precisely because of the reaction to the White Knight nerfs, someone thought that these questions were a reasonable place to start repairing the damage.   
---
If Paradox Interactive were publishing this game, all of the above that you've suggested they write instead would be what I expected from them. However, Bethesda is in a different position, and I imagine a bit wary of publishing roadmaps. The last time they did so was back with the early post launch feedback where they laid out the plans for the first two patches, and sadly people read into that roadmap more than was actually said, expecting more changes than actually were on the slate.  
---
I also get the feeling that Bethesda are not quite used to having such a large live environment. A lot of the early responses reminded me of the Creation Kit closed beta for Fallout 4. Every week or so we'd wait for a community manager to pass the good word on to us, and often it wasn't clear what they thought was a priority or not. It wasn't the poor fellow's fault, just simply a case of how things were structured. We were lucky that one of the devs was a good sport and would chime in anywhere they had useful info for us, but it wasn't the norm.   
---
Now Bethesda have a true live environment, where the expectations on post launch support are far more granular than anything they've had to deal with before, and I have the feeling their team is still finding their feet. Not just on dealing with the community, but also delivering actual production changes. Until they do, they're not going to have the confidence they need to address us as you've suggested.
---
It's just a pain in the ass having to rebuild everything because someone who is bored decided to blow everything up haha, it's not worth the risk so it's easier to just relog on to a new server, I don't have time to rebuild or farm all the mats to remake my entire house.
---
It's not designed as that. It wasnt advertised as that either. How would it work with it's super boring linear story with one option for progression? 
---
sound reasoning...so do you stay invisible while firing your weapon?
---
hunting legendary monsters was all the fun for me in fo4. can't believe how much of a joke this has turned out to be in 76
---
Not at all, a wild wasteland without raiders? 
---
&gt; Increased health of all creatures in the world  
---
Yeeey bullet sponges everywhere.
---
But i must say, i like your idea of legendary modifiers balancing.
---
No mixing pve and pvp. Its proving not to work already
---
Not at all why do you think this??
---
That sounds a bit excessive. I'm guessing you build your camp next to a fissure site.
---
Mods plan (you need just one for example Plan: shadowed leather arms) are same for Heavy/sturdy/light.
---
There is shadowed mod for leather armor pieces.
---
Bullet Sponges are more fun with friends!..  \*proceeds to cripple entire pack of ghouls with fatman\*

---
Sweet thanks my gamer tag is A__BLACK__JEW if you ever want to play I‚Äôm probably going to need help killing the assaultron at sugar grove. I‚Äôm on the white springs bunker quest. 
---
I don't think melee is op. For me sneak sniper is better than sneak melee. In all ways.
---
The proper way to use any acronym professionally includes a Brief Explanation (BE) for your acronyms before you begin to assuming the level of your audience's understanding. After the BE any acronym can be understood freely as you've established the phrase for your readers. 
---
i eagerly await the hot mess that anthem will turn out to be. heh
---
Shill 
---
Lol read some other threads pr other discord about fallout 76 I sure as hell ain't alone in the need for better pvp
---
I think it would've been better as a completely coop game instead of this weird live online service game format. Dedicated client side private server options, modding enabled, and Bethesda to have impleneted a paid sponsorship program to their longstanding modding community to develop big content mods for them, like ARK does. The thing about live service game is you gota have a big team working on bug fixing, balancing, new content and community ongoing events. Live service game from a AAA studio isn't and shouldn't just mean a game that is weakly server supported for a dozen ppl with mild patches once or twice a month.
---
Story driven DLC was not expected for year or two. What was expected was the missing endgame and factions PVP.
---
Where  is this battle royale comparison coming from? Entirely dif style of game and setup 
---
I craft gear to use for farming or just random exploring and doing whatever. Saves on my good gear I use for stuff like launching nukes or anything that's of significant difficulty that repeated dying might be annoying. I always have the mats to repair my good gear this way, and I can just discard my crafted gear once it breaks, and make new gear at less cost than repairing it.
---
I was building a set for fighting Scorchbeasts. I have +25 poison resist on 2 pieces and Dense mod on the chest. I was still getting radiation damage though when in the green spray, then I started using a gas mask and it helped I think, though I still jump out of it so not 100% sure. The Dense chest mod makes the sonic attack do practically no damage, so I can just stand there and wait for it to land. Started using VATs and hitting the wing with an explosive lever action rifle to get it to land quicker. I haven't mastered the whole thing yet, and yeah I have also thought about a gas mask in the nuke zone but I don't really like nuke zones much and I'm not one who just drops everything and runs to one when one drops. I would like to test it though, with Rad-Shield and Rad-X diluted. You used to be able to stack the Rad-X diluteds. I don't think you can do that any more which kinda sucks but I guess it's understandable. It would have been nice if they made that toys giving up to 50 rad resist a permanent feature also but it was only temporary.
---
I end up in this conversation fairly often. People don't stop to consider that melee does more damage because It lacks range. This is probably because range isn't the raw damage number, so they don't see how it's a balancing factor. Let me put it this way, though: there are rifleman builds that can 1-2 shot me from a hundred yards away. If I go through all the trouble to painstakingly curate my armor for bonus strength, use all my strength perks for survival and damage rather than quality of life, and spend thousands of caps (pre-cost drop) becoming a genetic monstrosity only to then use all my luck points to simply keep those mutations and mitigate their side effects, rather than building for crit recycle, why should I not be just as effective at close range as a rifle user with equivalent caps and hours is at long range? 
---
Sure, as it stands, there's plenty of reason to complain about melee in PVP, because you can't just start the fight with a hundred yard headshot unless they have a wanted level. But when Survival rolls out, you'll see how much of a liability it is to have start combat within 10 yards, and why melee gets to swing for a bit more damage. Closing the gap in PVP without slap initiation is not going to be easy, and I CANNOT FUCKING WAIT. :D 
---
I wouldn't suggest that heavy a nerf to the mutations, since they become useless compared to the others. I'd definitely accept something like TM just giving +4 strength (+20% damage) and maybe changing how talons works entirely (adding bleed stacking or something similar). 60% incisor does seem fair, though.
---
I'm well aware of that. I mean i did say the original post wasn't going to be constructive after all. However, I don't fault the community team for it. For starters, if I got more than the usual response from a community manager, why didn't other posts get it that were detailing real bugs, or changes that are simple and easy to execute?
---
I'd be more than happy to know that this post has been read by someone in the dev team. As a gamer, as a mod author, as someone that cares greatly about the idea of Fallout, I do want to help them, and I feel like someone on the team needs to take a step back and ask 'What are we going to make?'
---
And hopefully, somewhere along the line, they'll let us know what they intend to be making. 
---
Now maybe they do know exactly what they're doing and what they intend to make. I'm not presuming the devs to be fools. However, hopefully this post, if at all constructive, has pointed out the fact they're struggling to communicate their larger vision. They've been trying to, with the dev notes inside the patch notes, but I feel they've not yet gone far enough.
---
Push to talk
---
funny, i'm pretty sure i can make light armor shadowed, but not sturdy or heavy.
---
anyhow, still looking for the plans, even though they 'made' it such that all plans can be bought
---
48 - separate 
---
Unless whitespring as a fissure site on the snake symbol then no.
---
Not all plans only ones for power armor. For BoS/shadowed combat armor plans you must still serverhop grafton vendors.
---
So if we could find a way to give Bethesda money in exchange for them providing us with a game that shows they care about players... ü§î
---
You can plant them in the whitespring vases or on a campfire (in fact campfires are considered ground/foundation and you can place water purifiers, plants and objects like a decon shower in a tower)
---
Cool, thanks. 
---
As a mod author, I have to say, it'd take us two weeks to just figure out how to make the server register a jump command. You've a very distorted idea of what's involved in dealing with code that someone else wrote, particularly when you're not getting paid to do so.
---
What is the fucking point of this post? Karma farming? Its just another vapid "List of reasons why I'm mad &gt;:(" That gets posted every 15 minutes. 
---
You can have animals at your camp, it's not a listed feature and requires animal friend 3 as well as another perk I forget.. you can find videos on YouTube showing how to even have a deathclaw at your camp
---
I'm aware that there's a chunk of player base, that would like a "kill everything in 15 yard radius" button. Some say, that after tse nerf plant life severely deteriorated in various regions due to vast amounts of salt absorbed in the soil.
---
I'm pretty sure there are two near Whitesprings.
---
YES
---
I‚Äòd accept a rollback in a heartbeat if Bethesda accepts my request for a refund 
---
im having the same trouble with quick select wheel..i have 2 shottys..one tse one not..i click on the tse and it gives me the other one..also guns dissapearing off my qyick select wheel
---
Doesnt the game tell you when a player attacks your camp though? Its always a shame when i find someones camp and is checking it out and they just log out. Could be a fun interaction if they fast travel back to say hi.
---
Martial artist is the faster swing speed and reduced weight right? Why should that be disabled while In power armor. Power armor is already at the disadvantage of not having any legendary mods. So it‚Äôs unable to stack all the unyielding +1 strength armor pieces that make melee broken. 
---
Yep. The honeymoon was great guys, but it's time for even the most dedicated fans of the game to acknowledge it as a complete disaster. If you're able to enjoy it somehow, good on you. But jusy think about how much better it could have been. 
---
I am not able to view it on my mobile phone! At first there is a loading screen - not kidding. It takes around 20 seconds to build up the page and then it is in german (WTF!) and there is an advertisement about half over the screen. And the german translation is ugly. Scorch is translated like fire. So we have the fire queen here.
---
I tripple checked the link. Itwas the english one. But I guess it uses some kind of localization. So Bethesda can even mess up webpages like sh**. Even when going back from other pages (don't know if my browser caches the pages or not) there is a loading screen.
---
And wow...they adjusted the loot for the scorched queen. How much people were needed for this legendary task? I think a ten year old can fix a loot table and the timer for the attack in 2-3 hours with double checking by an adult. So what the heck are they doing? But even if they would fix their bugs within a few hours...they would need to restart the servers for every "hotfix", which is crazy.
---
I don't know what indie games you are playing where they drop 2-3 patches a month since release. 
---
At this point, apologists like you are just a cancer.
---
If I could upvote this a million times I wouldü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Same reason I do the same thing with my mods. I need the damned thing to work before I pull my hair out. If I had all the time in the world, sure I'd make sure my code was self documenting, well laid out and maintainable, however, I don't. So I get the damned thing to work. Yes its ugly, but if there's time later (there never is) I'll go back and clean it up.
---
Keep in mind what you see in the finished code isn't just a first draft. It's likely the result of a lot of testing and efforts to optimize, and at some point in all that mess, someone just needed to get it done yesterday.
---
Posts as stupid as Todd
---
Why are all the notes able to be picked up. Theres so so many notes and papers, each with a unique name. 
---
Make them read only. I tried dropping some of the hundreds I've accumulated and crashed 4 times doing so. 
---
saw it at the grafton station not too long ago. 
---
It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve all but given up.
---
As a mod author, I think you vastly underestimate how much work goes into the fixes and content we make. Not to mention how buggy our initial mod releases tend to be (as little as we like to admit so!)
---
They asked for feedback to try and start conversation about anything other than how bad the game is and how empty the ITV was.
---
The feedback has been there for them to see, since before BETA. They must have played the game a little themselves? 
---
They wont do anything with the feedback apart from pass it along with all the feedback they've been passing along for the last 3 months now.
---
My friend fixed this earlier by taking a rad-x to suppress the mutation then waiting for it to wear off
---
Multiplicative 
---
The sad part is they don't even have publicly held stakeholders to please at this point, they're growth is entirely predicated on furthering their personal investments. They only answer to themselves for what the next move is. 
---
Nerfing melee mutations is just 1 small step though. Lets be real, melee is very overpowered. You'll still be 500+ with bloodied weapons. 
---
Scavvers are real and in no short supply in these parts! I'm bored now n no one fights me anymore so wonder the wastes picking up junk hoping someone shoots me
---
There are still a few of them on this sub but they slowly lose their drive too with the way things are right now 
---
Because they don't patch one small thing, shut the servers off and make everyone update for it. That's not how patching works in online only games. They do a lot of changes and combine them into one patch after they have *supposedly* tested them all (yes I know Bethesda is a bit of a joke at this). 
---
I guess you could say it fucks up your immune system for a while.
---
Ok I'd go for that!
---
I farmed whitespring a bunch for loot before the xp was needed and got like 5 levels a nuke. I play 2 to 3 days a week maybe 5 to 6 hours at a time because I work nights and stay up all night to keep my sleep schedule on my days off.

Into a full blown expansion sized mod? Sure, it‚Äôs a ton of work. But switching the values on a weapon‚Äôs or perk‚Äôs damage modifier? I don‚Äôt think that requires much. They could *easily* buff up energy weapons and heavy weapons to be on par with other weapons, instead they just say they‚Äôre ‚Äúlooking into it‚Äù.
---
The amount of work really depends on the mod. I‚Äôve made some simple mods myself and it‚Äôs really not a lot of work to fix small things like that, especially if you know the engine.
---
Actually, the weapon damage is decoupled from the individual weapons in F76's omod entries, so it's a little weirder. The way the weapons inherit their stats comes from generic modules, so changing one ends up changing a whole class of weapons, is just a little weird.
---
That said, you're right, it would take less than a day to change the values. Heck, most actual code writing takes rather little time.
---
The problem is making sure you didn't break anything. Because you will break something. You're a coder, it's inevitable. The problem with making sure you didn't break anything is that when you're dealing with a game, it's a very long painful process to make sure you didn't break the game. Let alone break the balance.
---
Crack Shot is unfortunately useless in VATS btw.
---
I'll support you jus so we both get what we want outta this. I mean shit PVP/PVE servers exist elsewhere so why not here?
---
The problem there is, as stated, not everyone wants to be a bloodied/unyielding glass cannon. Yeah, they'll sit over 500 still, but if you address the problem from any other angle than a bloodied/unyielding nerf, you force everyone to go cookie cutter and run the only build capable of still outputting that damage.
---
Trust me, there is, but not because they're incompetent or lazy. You only need a few network coders working on patches and server maintenance, you need individual artists for items in the atom shop, plus marketing teams and someone who implements its model as a playable function and then a small QA team for each item in the atom shop.  
---
Yeah that's why I have 4 characters and just built a 1 handed melee build for pvp that uses adrenal reaction, radicool, unyielding armor, instigating Chinese officer sword that I found on another character and sneak with ninja so that I can use it on the new pvp mode. Really fun build but sneak is kinda messed up right now on ps4 and once I attack I'm stuck in caution until I relog. 
---
I've seen it a few places, but I don't remember where. I'm pretty sure Wallace has it, and one of the two in Watoga.

Haha the cargobots a don't hit you, fly into and through objects and generally die from a fully loaded clip..... Workshop ones are awful because then you can't use the repair all feature because the cargobots constantly get destroyed, deal no damage and take ages to fly even a small distance
---
The point is that Apex is running on a tried and true engine and isn't really doing anything special with that engine. This is in no way trying to shit on Apex, it seems to be a very high quality game but it's just so different to FO76 that you might as well compare a game like Civ6 to FO76.  
---
Of course, this in no way excuses the horrible fucking mess that FO76 is. 
---
This. They attack with a machete then the loot is a sickle....
---
ugh, darn. thx
---
Perhaps you misspelled "hug." Would you like one? ü§ó

I'm a bot, and I like to give hugs. [source](https://github.com/as-com/reddit-hug-bot) | [contact](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=as-com)
---
What problem do you solve with your suggestions? After TSE nerfed, I switched to melee. Yes, because otherwise I will have to hit the enemies more than 2-3 times to kill. What is the point of spoiling this aspect of the game?
---
Meh, they spend so much time lauding the multiplayer aspects and gameplay failures it makes you forget that a ton of people on this sub are still defending the microtransactions to death, so the most worrying aspect of Bethesda's recent changes will likely carry over into other series. 
---
Whitespring nuke farming before the xp nerd. Ghouls were 495 xp per kill. I was farming for loot and levels went really fast. Other 3 characters were leveled on quests, events, and holding workshops for the defend quests because nowadays nobody contests them and I can hold 3 at a time so that's like 6 initial quests and then 3 an hour while I explore. I do not spend a ton of time on the game. 20 hours a week or so but it's the only game I played which may be why I'm so burnt out right now. 
---
Oh I agree that just changing the values on a set of weapons is a fairly easy task. The problem is making sure that you didn't break anything. 
---
This is one of the stages of creating weapon mods that I personally hate. Loading up the game 50 odd times on five different characters to make sure that I didn't just create something that totally breaks gameplay. Because I have to make sure that the weapon works on a character with no perks, a character that has maxed out these perks, a character that has this perk and not that one. It ain't easy!
---
There's a wonderful bug I found in F76 awhile back that had a full auto rifle get damage bonuses from the semi auto perk cards. Which means somewhere, there's a keyword flipping the weapon to register as semi auto. Is it on the receiver object, the barrel? Is it getting it from the base weapon object? Is something otherwise wonkey going on here?
---
The point I'm trying to make is that folks tend to equate mods to produced games. However mods have far lower standards of quality to meet than a production game. You'd find few mods on the nexus with an empty bug tracker, even the ones fixing things in a game. Sure we can crank out a fix faster than Bethesda can, we just don't care if it doesn't work 1 in 10 times the first time we let it out in the wild. 'Oh no! You'll uninstall my mod. Whatever will I do?'
---
Bethesda doesn't have that luxury.
---
Which is why we need an entire legendary affix overhaul. 
---
Yeah I guess as a coop or mmo type game they were not ready for the grind fans to get to this point so quickly but I invested into this game because I really enjoy it and want a reason to keep enjoying. 
---
It was the same in Fallout 4 survival mode. 
---
Mine! https://m.imgur.com/Re0oXb7
---
Now that's hardcore and I played everquest for like 5 years so I've used up all the hardcore I've got left in me and I'm mid 30s now with a fam lol
---
You got your pills mixed up.
---
What we need is a full server wide inventory wipe of all legendary items, all aid and caps. Only solution. If you reset levels this game is finished.
---
Fighting is each other is too expensive. Caps and ammo. I like to  just farm right now. Trying to get steel to finish my camp ive been working on for a couple weeks now.
---
All bones are junk...
---
But got it to work using SB bones but mole rat teeth break down into bone shards like every other bones so it "should" work
---
Looking at two in flatwoods on xb1 
---
aka a bunch of leeches are waiting for someone else to do the silos
---
Love
---
The problem here is that you could easily hurt people or camps by accident. Pacifist mode is necessary.
---
That's my plan sadly. Just a break though. 
---
Yeah, we're never really told how close 2077 technology got to true robotic conciousness. For synths it's easy enough because they're basically just clones with a little control chip in them (exactly like Star Wars and order 66) but robots would have to have everything written out line for line. Don't get me wrong it's possible to lay out every emotion as a written function but it's bloody complicated.  Considering some robots like protectrons are very rudimentary but handys and nannys seem way more self aware there's no clear answer on how close they got to true AI.
---
lol, good bot
---
Sorry probably should have added a /sarcasm for those who didn‚Äôt get it..
---
I had the same issue, fixed by going into workshop mode, storing it and then rebuilding it.
---
You get my upvote.
---
While I disagree with some of your opinions on what recreational medications decision makers were or were not taking, one of the core issues here is that alot of the core systems from Fallout 4 were outright lifted. For good reasons. I mean to make a multiplayer game from scratch in under four years, it helps if you have something that worked as a starting point.
---
But Fallout 4 had plenty of warts in its core gameplay, which were hidden by the fact that you couldn't easily compare your capabilities in combat to someone else's experience. Now that people can see how much easier the game can be with an 'optimized' build, the spell has been broken, and now a lot of painful decisions need to be made on how to make it fair for everyone.
---
Past few nights i've solo run a silo in hope for legendaries at WS and each night it drops, the same group always kill me because apparently i'm rushing their nuke zone. I stopped launching tnem myself. 
---
The game seems to use differential tracking. Somehow a glitch didn't update for items picked up, then when I crafted away with steel, the counter just decremented below zero which wrapped around to uint.
---
Marine is the best standard armor. It'll say that its unmatched by all except power armor in a survival tip during load. And the excavator power armor I'd say, especially for the 100 bonus carry weight.
---
Ok, then we played two very different games since I couldnt do real damage before the TSEs. I had combat rifle and hunting rifle with all mods &amp; hardened reciever and invested 9 perks into rifles. It gave a standard scorched beast nothing but a belly rub. It is wasnt just me but we had also different builds in the group - shotgun or heavy that didnt do anything as well in the group I played. The only viable alternative was melee which at the time I hadnt created a character for. 
---
I also never saw anyone killing a scorched beast without sneak/vats build. Do you have proof of your claim? Like a video? Or, if you were so successfull before maybe you can do a video?
---
So imho it was terribly unbalanced. How can it be that you have level 100 + char with full rifle specialisation doing nearly no damage? 
---
The TSEs were never the solution. They were only a very poor workaround for bad design. They should not be necessary to able to fight these creatures.
---
Ain't that a kick in the head.
---
Check out r/fo76roleplay 
---
I rather like all the pieces we have to build with in FO76 (except that stairs are a bit of a nightmare to build with), but we definitely need more. 
---
Half height stairs, wooden stairs, a new build set that looks similar to how the shack set looked like in FO4, turret platforms that can snap to walls, curtain "doors", more "everyday" type decorations (I want to be able to put a toaster on my table, and a book next to my bed)... 
---
I could go on. 
---
This next patch literally addresses the specific thing you're complaining about right now. 
---
Sometimes you can do without class freak. If you use 1 S 1 E build, the negative effects of Eagle Eye, Egg Head  and Bird Bones  are zero. And+6 INT from Egg head neutralizes -4 INT from Marsupial
---
That is the topic of this discussion. Thank you for your valuable and insightful contribution to it. 
---
No. Inventory wipe yes. Level reset not the fuck.
---
How am i an idiot for pointing out how Bethesda still engage with the community through the subreddit , and have made changes to the game and patch notes from the feedback from here. 
---
Sick one.
---
Top yourself.
---
Sounds to me like you've had your $80 worth already. Maybe play another game and check back in a couple of months and see if there has been any positive changes to the game.
---
Monster feedback - my worst dissappointment was with Flatwoods Monster, who drops... well he may drop fucking nothing and it wouldn't feel different. Encounter itself is still fun and encouraging, greatly staged with unique purple light that you really like to see in the darkness (oh boy! a rare mob encounter!).
---
Ah yeah my first email was verification but that was last year in early december. I just got the email about atoms 3 days ago and didn't notice spike in atoms. Since I had around 1k spent 300 on the black sunglasses dropped to 650 and if I did get atoms I should have been over 1k before buying the glasses.
---
Do you have 2 calibrated shocks for the X-01 power armor ? That s the true endgame grinding content
---
You done it yet ?
---
I guess price to fun ratio is different with every one but personally 80 was a lot for me to spend on a game for only 300 hrs. When. You compare to warframe 1000 hrs and only spent 60 dollars over the course of playing. 
---
It's a quote, don't be afraid. 
---
I think this was the one who created the patches then:

Thank God you are not a developer.

Dude, your ideas are worse than bethesda.
---
Nerf mutations? Who would wanna nerf on mutations lmao.
---
Nerf bloody and Buff furious to 75% lol.
---
You just suggested to kill off bloodied and make Furious the new meta. How do you think that is balance?
---
Cursed to wander the wasteland of the game industry forever as a warning to others :(
---
Oh definitely
---
you dont want client side servers, or you have the loading times of GTA5 ... 5-10 minutes to get on a "server" just to get disconnected a few minutes later.
---
Just about to run the silo. 
---
There are 8hours campain games for this price. 
---
Wait.
---
radworms is the problem here.
---
It's becoming very clear to me what Bethesda is becoming. They very much used to be a company who cared about their games and products but at this point they are taking the same direction as EA and Blizzard.
---
When investors are the ones controlling the directions of the games instead of dedicated developers, it all comes down to the $$$. It would seem as if most if not all large game studios turn out this way whenever large investors see an oppertunity to invest and pressure for higher and quicker revenue.
---
I have lost faith in Bethesda's ability to 'restore' this game, and in that I've also lost hope for their future products. They'll need to change my mind by fixing this if they want to see my wallet again.
---
Oh I agree and the half section of concrete floors and also concrete floors with a longer base to go into the ground. And maybe a selection of rails for balconies.
---
&gt;its been 3 months \[...\] and we haven't gotten any major content updates.
---
jesus. it's things like this that make me wonder whether people here have actually played other games before at release or if they are just talking out of their ass for some strange reason?
---
&gt;No mechanic that makes players resent others for joining in on the fun is a good mechanic.
---
This is a really important point. I don't really care how the issue is solved, as long as this is one of the guiding principles in the solution. 
---
Can help if you want :)
---
I could certainly agree with that. 
---
You'd have to shoot 10 bullets first to match Bloodied. Which makes it balanced. 
---
Yeah... If they found the time to play their own game they would figure out exactly what tweaks need to be made. 
---
"Hoooooo boy! You may want to keep your distance (from this game)."
---
I actually really want that "The Inspector" suit just for that magnificent top hat. So much more fancy than the tattered old civil war era top hat I've been wearing for the past month! 
---
Thank god someone said it üôÑ 
---
Yeah but this is why we are on Reddit. Talk about how to improve our experience.
---
Last two times I connected, I tried taking workshops and got disconnected every 15min. This is not being a powergamer, this is "playing" 
---
You're a rp player, that's great. I don't think of myself as a powergamer: my main is level 80 something, and I started day one, played almost daily until two weeks ago.
---
But I must say, there's less and less to do in this game. I can't take workshops as stated above, I can't kill the last boss because there's no way I grind through a silo to get server ejected right after and I don't see the point in grinding further as long as that's not fixed.
---
The real thing is, as a RP player, you would have been happy with whatever multiplayer was provided, even if there was no last boss, no workshops, no nukes... Because doing RP doesn't require anything.
---
But people wanting to play the game as it was sold, that is a mmo in the wasteland, those players need functioning mechanics and stable servers.
---
I'm glad you enjoy the game, but you ought to understand why other people don't, and why those who don't express their expectations on how to improve.
---
They really don't need to, that is just what I named the thread. Not hard to find good names though...
---
;-)

Congrats you beat the game and paid less then a dollar an hour for your entertainment 
---
And there is a reason I don‚Äôt play those lol I like fallout and games of the like for the immense hrs I can get for what I pay. Was kinda let down as it seemed as of this game was going to bring years of playability and be constant adding new content. So I got hyped that my fav company was going to release this awesome game I could really get invested into. So I preordered the tricentennial addition and by now I was expecting some new quests or events or something. Yeah yeah I should never preorder blah blah I get it lmao 
---
The whole games been lazy, they should  shut down Bethesda Austin and split the people between the other 4 studios.
---
Why is this being downvoted? Talk about fanboys, you downvote cuz he smashes Bethesda but cant even remember a iconic line. Woops.
---
I think the ship is going down. At this point with no roadmap and patches that seriously screwed up the good that was found in the game f76 is done for.
---
Maybe the resonsibles realized that and therefore half assed the inside the vault.
---
unfortunately, I've finally given up on this game now. After completing the main missions the wasteland just feels empty with nowhere to explore. Most people I meet just ask if I have a two-shot for sale then leave. I'm going back to Fallout 4! 
---
The facerolling aspect? Gee, I dunno. Play any MMO decent mmmo and show me where you can 1-2 hit any mob equal to, or above (yes, because any level over 50 means jackshit), max player level. Or where you're able to solo the so-called end boss of the tier. It's not an "aspect of the game", it's half-assed balancing job.
---
I‚Äôve usually got a little sign set up in my camp telling people to feel free to give me a shout for help :) 
---
Another bitch about Bethesda for karma farming, you are so brave. 
---
"There are literally hundreds of people who agree with me! Validation!"
---
I have been having the issue where enemies regen their health multiple times before I can actually kill them.
---
Yeah seriously. They didn‚Äôt address a single other thing from their known issues list. Game is still riddled with bugs and they just wanna know what billet sponges we like shooting at most.
---
automatic weapons would rip anything apart by the time they reach 4th or 5th bullet and that would be very quick. With explosive perks, it would be even easier to secure procing furious even you miss.
---
Esp. on auto smg or handmade
---
I m on your server you can send me an invite :)

got a nice pencil from a 3\* ghoul, made my day! 
---
Patch Notes: fireproof was adding an unfair advantage to scorch beasts new version of perk will add 10% then an additional 5% perk rank for a max of 20%....
---
Depends if you consider the nerf to adrenaline rush also. 
---
Because it is enjoyable and because it is clear the dev team cares.
---
Plan: Shadowed Leather Armor Arms exists, no clue where to get it, but its a plan so it cant be learned from scrapping. Also mods work across armor tiers....if you unlock shadowed leather arms, you can make light, sturdy or heavy.
---
There's a recipe for corn pone
---
One "server" is one AWS instance, that's to say a virtual machine running on a host server in an Amazon data centre.
---
Todd didn't lie -- Bethesda has no servers.
---
OK, i'll bite... support what statement? that people would complain? is it not safe to assume that people would complain irrespective of what they did because there's always a subset of people complaining?
---
i get why the guy is downvoted. it's completely not related to anything you said. he could have said the opposite thing in the same tone and still be downvoted. because it was edgy.
---
i just... i'm sorry. i just don't understand why your nonsense is upvoted. it's like a bot regurgitating some typical phrase used in debates.
---
reddit votes suck. they are completely illogical.
---
With the new PVP Mode I think they are better off just scrapping it on normal PVE servers.
---
My galaxy s8 has had literally none of those problems when I read the update off their website.
---
Hi Nicholas, Im also a roleplayer. I even come from the age where pen and paper was the thing to go for. So true roleplay. 
---
Im admiring your stance that you can find a way to roleplay in that game. 
---
Storywise / RP-wise for me this was an empty shell from the beginning. So to me its completly understandable that f76 suffered the same fate as Destiny 1. Without a real story or NPCs the people just do what this game gives back - shoot and loot things. No biggie here. If you want true roleplay in an MMO you should look to other games. 
---
True. 
---
Some Telltale games are doable in 4-5 hours and they are totally worth it (15-20$ games).
---
But kids these days can't understand these things‚Ä¶ until they leave the nest one day‚Ä¶ then they will understand...
---
And becouse you can eat other players.
---
She does have a line about it being "so long since she's had food", tho. 
---
I think the point of view is important here I guess.   I solo mostly because no real group content or dynamics in this game.  But I feel like the quests should be soloable, but there should be group-based content like SBQ or other dungeon-y areas.   I would say they still heald the "Can be done entirely solo" line based on the main story.
---
Just look at the SBQ, the quest specifically says group based \*8 or more players.   So they can get away with having more of that stuff thats tagged with 8+ players.
---
I feel your pain, I really do. 
---
The advantage of FO76 being an online game is that they can add back cut content later.  The tons of stuff cut from FO4, FO3 and FO:NV was just lost.
---
Specific feedback helps narrow down the conversation 
---
All they really need to do is swap her model for a Robobrain tbh. One change and Rose actually makes sense as a character. 
---
But I mean they fix the fun bugs and leave the broken. Like Mama Dulche, fix the bug that gives everyone food but leave the one in that eats gear. Asks for feedback on events, doesn't restore the former glory of mama dulche
---
alright, someone else said this also so it must be so! thank you guys!
---
Playing with friends :) 
---
They didn‚Äôt design it that way on purpose. I assume it‚Äôs the side effect of using an ancient game engine that was never supposed to be online. 
---
what do you do to be so hated?
---
I am also level 135 and I've not had that problem at all‚Ä¶ not a single time.
---
Said this, PvP in this game sucks and it should be remade and isolated, but that's another story...
---
I think the dlcs of fo4 weren't that good either, incl far harbor.
---
but why
---
You don't know how that works do you?
---
More like patch guy, judging by the progress so far.
---
Well I think the SBQ should reward based on scaling too!   Give higher chances of good rewards based on the % damage you deal (now that TSE got re-balanced).  No chance of legendary if you don't do at least 5 percent damage.   Cap the percent chance increase at around 20%+ dmg.
---
Yes, people could abuse this and try and solo the SBQ.  But with some careful adjustments, you can raise the base stats of the SBQ to make it impossible to solo or duo.  The testers at bethesda really need to hard-core test it with 8 characters with the best weapons possible with all the best possible builds for those weapons.  Then adjust the difficulty so its tough to do with 6 of those people, impossible to do with 4 of those.   Fairly decent effort with 8.
---
Remove the scaling and just adjust the baseline stats, only scale it beyond that point if there are more than 8 people above level 50.  Make it so anyone under 50 cannot hurt her.
---
Again, I'm hypothetically talking about going back in time and restarting my version in mind.
---
I'd identify myself as a roleplayer. Right now my character is an ex-convict turned plumber, who got stuck on a repair job in Vault 76 when the bombs fell. He only uses pistols, takes a lot of drugs and has no sympathy for all that power armor business and modern tchnology and whatnot. 
---
That said, it is not enough for me to shove away all the many issues this game has, both in the technical field and with missing content and a interface that is not up for the job.
---
If that happens it probably means that that "server" doesn't exist anymore -- there is nothing to rejoin.
---
I havent found any Raider armor of any tier, or sturdy/heavy metal anywhere. Ive found heavy robot pieces in harpers ferry, by the spawn, and found 1 piece of sturdy combat somewhere along the line. Im pretty sure they are rare world spawns, but im have no clue where to find an armor plan spawn to farm outside of harpers ferry/watoga (which seem to give marine and rarely robot). 
---
It's quick, it's easy and it's cheap. JK
---
Now seriouis,
---
Really, only because it would be hilarious.
---
Huh. I tried it with a bunch of antlers I found and that didn't work, so my next guess was it specified human bones. 
---
Looks like another Chad
---
170,700 now. My point was that it is in a steady decline, like it is lol.
---
I used to love wandering aimlessly In fo4 not knowing where I'd end up or what enemy I'd face, the adventure of finding something different or an Easter egg.
---
Fo76 has been perfect for this for me, I havnt got bored with it one little bit, I have other games I got at Xmas like rdr2 and God of war but I've shelved them as I want to keep coming into this game over them
---
interplay was the original creators not obsidian. 
---
Would really change up the Dysentery disease 
---
Combat comes in light, sturdy, and heavy variants. The marine has some rad protection but is generally inferior to modded combat armor. Light combat armor with the BOS mod for example offers much better damage resistance than marine. There a load screen that says marine armor is the best, and in FO4 it was. But in Fallout76 combat armor with the BOS mod is the best by far.
---
I don't think that's much roleplaying to do in this game but hey, if you can find it, more power to you I guess.
---
&gt; Thank you for your hard work and for continuing to put up with all of this
---
This part made me chuckle. Does releasing a patch that reintroduces old bugs constitute for "hard work"? 
---
Honestly do you believe that after all that ignoring our claims that have been thoroughly reported Bethesda will turn around and finally start caring? I mean caring at all? 
---
The horse is dead as you say. I wish I would be proven wrong.
---
I stated before patch 5 would kill the game. Not only I but countless others here and on other forums even in the Bethesdas forums. And it happend exactly as predicted. Now you daily read posts about people quitting and if looking at my friends list the 20 ppl that have been playing or now gone, too. 
---
But somehow Im still hoping the responsible managers will finally understand you can't create a community game without the community. Although that hope is very faint. 
---
hahahaha, very nice :D
---
There is actually lots to see and places to go 
---
Average patch? You mean reverting to a previous state, reintroducing old bugs and even creating new ones. That's an average patch? Lawl
---
IIRC it happens sometimes when the nuke zone is too far from V9. To be honest and fair with bethesda, they didn't make it so you'd basically exploit bug and kill her out of the nuke zone. I don't blame you in particular, as everyone do this. but the real challenge was to fight her and her minions inside the nuke area.
---
Jupp its is actually kind of annoying .. keep doing the same thing . Bulk junk to Sell and then collect a bit more junk on the way to a vendor and keep forgetting that i have bulked junk when scrapping so in the constant need of plastic.
---
Could be nice if bulked junk would be like bottles that you have to scrap seperatly or a ( do you want to scrap bulked items  yes/no ) option.
---
Still love this game and looking forward for future updates,fixes and extra stuff.. 
---
Lmao down vote harder guys. 
---
If you're in a team and your teammate have the perks , he can basically feed you when he feeds himself.
---
If you aren't in a team, well , god knows what your character has been stealing in Vault 76.
---
Combat is more versatile than marine armor.
---
I generally mix match Combat, leather and marine to get a all round protection
---
I like deep pocketed marine legs (+10 carry weight) and marine has best rad resist, but its other two damage resists are lower than heavy combat, so I wear heavy combat arms and chest. Looks badass too. 
---
Power armor depends what your doing. Excavator for scavenging, X-01 for scorch queen, whatever else for fun, I‚Äôm digging the nuka cola t-51 for running around atm.
---
Probably they are scared to break something else if they touch this...
---
Radworms increases the effect of marsupial, but recovering from it or curing it suppresses the effects of the mutation. You can only relog to fix it. 
---
Also the PA leg bug is most likely due to your actual armor leg having some legendary effect. For me it was a regenerating left leg that caused the issue.
---
You arent in the Nuke Zone.  Cant be angry at Bethesda for you abusing a bug and then it not working.
---
it's designed to kill mutated cells. is it hard to believe it also kills a lot of cells, including the white cells your body actually needs to prevent diseases ?
---
Yes, any player kill counts towards good grief
---
Were you meant to reply to another thread?
---
I think you can complete it alone. But you must be there until that event ends completly not only one round. Took me a while until i noticed this event have end.
---
That's got to be one of the best dialogue interaction in the entire fallout series, IMO.
---
As someone who ran a lot of times morgantown's high school, I feel you. I've did that 4 times in a single day. Really, nice "patch" Bugthesda. Very QoL on that one.
---
But eh, I mainly blame myself and now I don't hit "scrap all junk" button.
---
If they continue like this the game will be dead in a couple of weeks.
---
They need to improve so bad netcode and game code, optimizing it for all hardware.
---
I  can hardly believe what I just read. honestly wow. "complaining" that you only had 300 hours out of your 80 dollars.   
---
And "rest more". 
---
Yeah that protec you from being eaten by me.
---
It is well written. The claims that are made are so basic it really hurts. I mean why, in 2019, with tons of other sucessfull MMOs out there do we need to explain to Bethesda that separated PVP and PVP servers are a good idea?
---
**It feels like Bethesda rushed into this without even taking a look at the market and the standards that have been established for good reasons.** Even worse they can't even get their patch management right with errors re-appearing on the servers that have been fixed before. That is also basic IT management.
---
So what the heck has Bethesda been doing all along? 
---
So Light CA and X01PA? 
---
I don't do silos, I'm lost in them (seriously, I get lost everytime.)
---
I feel ya. I just got lost, twice in a row, trying to find the terminal to start uranium fever.. where the hell is thing! 
---
Is there a way to track how many you have in total?
---
xD people like him are the real problem but who cares this game is D-E-A-D, DEAD.
---
Depends.
---
I'd gladly start anew if it means no more duping, game is fixed, and new content is out at the same time. I don't care about losing all my 3* and everything else.
---
But It'd probably be the final wound if they don't get their shit right and still resets.
---
Bloodied board for me. I wasn‚Äôt best impressed.
---
Lifetime tab under challenges should.
---
Join on server, press map, press menu, challenges, combat, players killed ?
---
Level 50 T-51 has the highest DR, so there‚Äôs that too. 
---
You can find cool dudes and ladies on fallout76's twitch. I'm not even joking, that's one of the easiest ways to find teammates &amp; do nukes, quests, have some fun ;)
---
I know I‚Äôm being pernickety but Rose didn‚Äôt die in the flood but when a log crashed through the wall as result of the flood. I wanted to clear this miss understanding up because the responders are good people who don‚Äôt condone killing and so wouldn‚Äôt just let her drown. 
---
Dude, they don't care. It won't change a thing. Its just another carrot dangling in front of our nose.
---
Like the roadmap for the additional contents. 
---
We have bigger things to worry about this game than implementing a toilet 
---
If you drink too much beer you have a place to puke.
---
T60 for the sheer ease of repair. It requires steel, aluminum and plastic on all parts.... That's it.  No screws springs or gears. And u can get cool bos paint jobs. Lol
---
If thats all they're doing it must be one guy doing it for an hour given how little has changed 
---
This could be amusing on a pvp server if they add the animations to it. YouTube will be full of pvp players attacking other players while that player is taking a crap, or in mid wipe. 
---
A lot of the hate is unwarranted there are a few annoying bugs but otherwise the game is still fun
---
Not even a mention of any other issues that were introduced with patch 5 and where we are with fixing those.
---
rofl, Todd, is that you?
---
yeah, they definitely want to listen to Reddit, since the nerf idea mainly came from here, and half of the posts needs to be moderated/deleted because they're just hateful.
---
But I understand that what you mean. Some posts are well-made, quite well explaining the problems and offering solutions to said problems. To be honest, I just think it's the "oh yeah look at how we listen to community" strategy being used right now. But this strategy only works if they actually listen..
---
How is this a bug? Even if you drop the nuke directly on Prime you can still fight her outside the zone. Heck, she flies out of it herself all the time.
---
You are just participating in it as you are saying you aren't. The main problem with the game is the lack of content and lack of advance. We are only seeing regression and a dev team that doesn't give a flying fuck about player feedback. But whatever man, if you enjoy this boring grindfest then play it. More power to you.
---
How could you complain about some so shiny !
---
I had about 6-7 people in my Camp yesterday, all complimenting me (they had mics) and I was sat here like ‚Äúoh, stahhhp‚Äù *blush*
---
Yeah, and how did Bethesda respond? They didn't. Exactly.
---
lead-gendary 
---
Ah a fellow bathtub bottle collector!
---
&gt; Romancing her opens up even more questions...
---
Not really, after all, you the player are a [synth](https://youtu.be/k-HJHCSPyRk) too.
---
Hardly an exploit, she flies out of the nuke zone all the time even if you drop it directly on Prime, and even if you nuke over V9 and just tag Prime on the bottom right of the nuke field you can fight her right next to prime but out of nuke zone.
---
I definitely miss being able to fill my shelves with random items.
---
Do they fire miniguns correctly ? Ive only ever witnessed them running up to melee with the huge hunk of steel barrels.
---
System would help..
---
&gt;Thanks
---
She never usually stays out of it for long. Tbh
---
And you prime site has to be in the nuke zone.  
---
&gt; Just. *Read*. It.
---
I read this like [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZXsQAXx_ao0/maxresdefault.jpg).
---
&gt;If I had all the time in the world, sure I'd make sure my code was self documenting, well laid out and maintainable, however, I don't.
---
I feel you. Things like that make me sad. 
---
Had some serious issues with this yesterday. Ended up taking a few captures of it.
---
In fact 90% of my captures over the last couple of months have been annoying or funny bugs and glitches from 76. 
---
At this rate I could probably make a full length movie.
---
Firstly my camp budget is broken because of the pets, i hope the next patch really does fix it.
---
Secondly as you're asking for ideas ,, can we have new plans for basic themed camps- Surgery , Clothes store, military , Nuka, Slocums.. etc etc.
---
The Base plans added into the vendors , while some of the more fancy themed item plans added to event loot tables inplace of crap loot..
---
Things like 
---
 Light up Bottle and Cappy, Military gun rack, Med bay, Slocums Jukebox etc etc..
---
Event loot tables would have appealing loot, camps would have more individuality and players would play to complete their desired themed set.
---
DO NOT ADD THIS IDEA TO THE ATOM SHOP..No give us player more things to earn from playing the game...
---
10 events for a bunch of ammo and Leather left legs ain't fun.
---
They promised constant updates and content when they announced the game. How is the community asking for ANY content update in 4 months unreasonable?
---
Correct, unless you follow her out and engage her there, then she stays out.
---
And my prime site **is** in the nuke zone. Completely.
---
Unless ya Wana go for style points when u off yourself you don't want it lol. MIRV launcher is screwy. finish the organic solution quest u get the Daisy cutter. A 90%reduced weight Fatman. (So skinny man?)  üòÇ.  Comes with MIRV launcher get that and test fire a few. I did 3 killed myself twice and modded it off lol. 
---
Asking if there were more in the post is no immature behavior? Look who's talking rofl.
---
This is the exact complaint you pve'ers reach when you wanted to remove pvp from this game.
---
You must be joking. It does not have real multiplayer, you need to join someones session. And to see buildings from players not in the session (server I guess), they need to be uploaded and then you only see that snapshot.
---
There is no reason to play together, there are no challenges and nothing that would be better done with more people. Building is buggy and mostly pointless.
---
Real campaing, right. You talking about that Atlas "story" that is just about as complicated as a side mission in FO 76? Or those blueprint missions that just require you to kill X/bring X/build X.
---
NMS is only decent if you want to explore near identical planets (with \~15 variants) or enjoy pointless grind (no challenges!).
---
And you are moaning to tue game dev cause you are fighting her in an unintended way and she flies back to WHERE SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE.
---
Do you realise how stupid you sound?
---
Why do you hate the Plasma weapons?  
---
Should be atleast a 50% buff. They ARE the top-tier Fallout weapons, but difficult to use (hence the double-armour thing) 
---
Do these people not realise that you can be a fan without blindly supporting Bethesda when criticism is pretty valid 
---
Yeah, some of those questions seem like something you would ask a team of testers some time *way before* release. Getting player feedback is definitely a good idea, but these particular questions are asked way too late. 
---
I'm still playing FO76, mainly because I really want to see where the story goes (I have limited time to play, so haven't completed the story yet), but I'm still continuously astonished by how unfinished it seems in many places. 
---
The only enemy I can outright say I don't enjoy fighting are the Scorchbeasts. Not because they are powerful, but because they are annoying. They stagger you, blind you and then fly off out of range, making the fights more frustrating than challenging. 
---
All other enemies are fine, in their own way, as long as they don't suddenly scale way up because some other higher levelled player enters the zone. 
---
As for loot, I would mostly like to see more of it, particularly when I have had to spend some kind of effort to get it. Unlocking a door only to find a paintbrush, a screwdriver and a can of turpentine on the other side feels pointless. I don't mean that I want every single container to be bursting with caps, mind you. 
---
This one I know, you enter the mine, you go the furthest in front of you, until you can't go further.Then on your right you have the entrance with an armor bench I think, you can find the terminal going on the left side, then directly on your right. 
---
But the silos, ugh.
---
He's an idiot, don't bother with him. He's like: "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, YOU ARE IMMATURE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO GAME TO ACTUALLY WORK, SHUT UP" It's ridiculous.
---
Is this done already?
---
Yes this too! 
---
I remember redneck rampage, an old 90' shooter where food and booze where health items. Yet you had to balance the two so to not get drunk or overeaten. 
---
Something like that would be nice.
---
Yep
---
You are an entitled spoiled brat, telling everyone to shut up cause you don't agree with them. Can't you see that? LOL
---
&gt;I feel like people already forgot they fixed some longstanding engine issues with it like the FPS cap.
---
Yeah, because server-side physics and fps cap actually is a rework and proper fix of the engine, and they will totally release TES6 and Starfield with uncapped FPS with their oh so gracious fps-cap fix. I feel like people already forgot how to manipulate minds on the internet.
---
Doh
---
No team, no perks of his own along that line. He must be one crafty sob to sneak away for a snack while I crack a cold one. SNEAK 100!
---
Thats what im wondering too.
---
I mean their changes are infinitisemal... its like stuff i could probably fix in a week or two on my own and they take sometimes 2-3 weeks just to fix something, not even everything.
---
We also dont get content additions beside ATOM shop shit stuff and thats it...
---
They said its their biggest project with "all hands on deck" kinda thing, but you really feel nothing of that sort.
---
As others have said, i fear they already abandoned ship and only a skeleton crew fixes a few bugs here and there to keep up appearances...
---
Have you learned all the plans and mods in the game?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/
---
Yeah I know,
---
And I kinda expected an answer like this.
---
But come on!
---
Let's not always focus on the bad.
---
For me this game is still a bomb of potential.
---
Only logical that since games grew so much in size it takes 
---
The obligatory : if you don't even have the game installed what are you doing here?
---
this.
---
10‚Ç¨ for a book, read in like 10-30 hours? Fine.
---
20‚Ç¨ for a 90 minute movie, some nachos and coke? Fine.
---
50‚Ç¨ having a nice (4-5hr) evening with some food and drinks? Fine.
---
60‚Ç¨ for a game where he stated he had 300 hours of fun? OUTRAGEOUS!
---
As much as i dislike FO76 - i had 150-200 hours of playtime. Bought at launch. Im frustrated, didn't log in for 2 months and am waiting for possible content. Will maybe never log in again. However even with half of my playtime i'd happily spend the same again for the amount of (fun) playtime i got there. 
---
Honestly, compared to 76 Andromeda was a master piece...
---
And it honestly wasnt a bad game, it just wasnt a good Mass Effect game.
---
Compared to that 76 is a bad game in general, especially in terms of Fallout, but even without that brand name, its not really a good game...
---
Extremely dead= less than 100 players playing so no. Just play some other games and forget this game. Or just keep posting useless posts like this. You decide what to spend your time on. 
---
Yaawwwnn. Did someone say something ?
---
Daily salt content reached for the day
---
I dont. As a lot of others I quit after the Patch 5
---
The funny thing is, people like me including my friends that are immense Fallout fans and almost Bethesda Fanboys (see my name and account cake day date) were the first to call out the bullshit and consecutively drop the game... i dont know who those people are that blindly support either Bethesda or the Fallout brand name, because the hardcore fans like me with more than 5k hours over the last 3 fallout installments were really quick to see how awful this was....
---
Nathan_TK. You can add me and I should be on sometime this weekend. 
---
Yeah, I was surprised when I read it. I‚Äôm disappointed with what the game has become, but I‚Äôm still hoping they‚Äôll improve it, and make it more worthwhile. 
---
Articles like this are like a slap to the face, and make me feel that placing faith in the studio to improve the game are wasted. 
---
How is helping other people fun? I am puzzled by this behavior ;) 
---
I laughed.
---
&gt;I also suspect that it does not represent the majority of people who play/want to play this game. 
---
Dude you couldnt be further away from the truth...
---
I hate min maxing, i hate grinding and i love fallout.
---
Fallout 3 was my favourite because it was so desolate and bleak... 
---
You should just realize that 76 is an awful shitty mess, sure you are allowed to have fun and like the game, but dont pretend that its the majority vote.
---
Just look at its critical ratings, look at its user ratings, look at this sub and its vote cycle.
---
Its clear the majority really doesnt like 76 and how it is much.
---
I will 
---
The first thing i said when they revealed 76 was "split pve and pvp, everything else will result in hate from either side" i was downvoted to hell just to say this...
---
Mostly by pvp people that love picking off pve players that dont want to fight back...
---
This is such a miniscule change that would already have improved the game so much, because i fucking hate pvp.
---
PvP should've been like nukaworld arena on a larger scale
---

---
This is kinda interesting, I'm not sure if it would make adding text chat harder or not though. 
---
If this is the thing that finally gets fixed, Reddit will come for your blood.
---
&gt;I'm honestly pretty confident Bethesda, at a managerial level, got complacent with bug fixes, knowing the community would handle most of it.
---
I have yet to see (indie or not) a game that allows for such a big open world and such extensive quests / questlines / communications / dialogues, etc... etc... GTA V had lots of issues with a linear storyline, it's pretty much a miracle Bethesda can actually game that even compiles in a working-ish state.  
---
Working in a company environment doesn't make devs complacent, there is things you're not allowed to do, things you can't do without spending a sum of hours you're not allowed to spend, things you can't fix without breaking a whole pan of the game and then fixing those broken bits, rinse and repeat.  
---
They clearly have defaults, make mistakes, but even if they rely on the mod community for fixes, that's more likely because none of their devs is immortal and time is a finite thing, and all this is ruled by corporate monkeys, management, etc... who gives a shit about anything but cash income.  
---
Bethesda always was a glorious garbage tree house.
---
This changed my life. You are going places. 
---
For us casual, lower level players who only manage a couple hours per week, it's the players like this we encounter that highlight the best this game can offer. 
---
Buffs and numbers might see a bit of tweaking (looking at furious and automatic guns), but nerfs and the general idea of your suggestions is exactly what this game would need!
---
u/LadyDevann you know that i adore Fallout to bits. But this is so bad, these lads have little love for the games like we do.
---
They need to look at DE and Warframe my god they know how to do things in the public arena. 
---
I am disgusted with this and even me a loyal fan has grown sick and tired of this. Gonna drop my hours right down. Fallout 76 deserves better than these people.
---
If any message you can pass along tell them to just give us private servers and modding support so we can just do this ourselves. We can provide patches and content much better than the skeleton crew left behind.
---
You are right, sorry was having a bad day and I took it out  on you.
---
A
---
The amount we have to drink at the moment we'd never be off the damn toilet lol
---
This is why we need another mode. One with no legendaries. Wether PvP or PvE for crazy ppl. Give us a reason to use all the plans we grind for. I would play a mode like this
---
The daughter kills the mother and in turn the boyfriend kills the daughter. You misspelled a few things there. But yea it made me sad too. The daughter had it coming she killed her whole family and her "sisters". Would be cool if they didnt have completely dead factions so we could do more for them. 
---
Not...us...
---
Tell me more
---
320 hours in not bored yet
---
I had a 3 star ghoul at Whitesprings drop a Drill for me the other day, it was just a plain old Drill :(
---
Very nice post. 
---
I tried to compare ingame credits but where F4 allowed screenshots F76 didn't, and F76 neither allowed pausing so it was just too difficult to compare.
---
I have Healing Factor and Assassin's Armor. He was eating through those. Healing Factor had a hard time keeping up being he was just spamming the punch button.
---
Really disappointing. Everyone knows now that the game wasn‚Äôt ready to come out. Players know it, obviously the devs knew it. But the shareholders demanded a game out this year. They didn‚Äôt want to face a year without a money maker out in the market. And they got it released, no matter the cost 
---
SBQ is such a tease with that rotating arrow. Last two scorched events I patiently wait for the arrow to stop spinning and the corpse just disappears.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Camp is south east of watoga station
---
Agreed.  Walked away from that area feeling sad
---
I cannot believe the artist who created that stupid gay ass shit ever played the game. Give us useful faction stuff. Enclave, BoS, Responder, Army...even some branded mining stuff or Watoga High jerseys. Make the shit lore friendly. Fuck your faggoty princess bed.
---
&gt;Valve isn't patching old games, once in a blue moon they release a hotfix to fix 1 exploit that covers the entire source engine so the source engine games get the update.
---
I truly wonder what sacraligious engine Bethesda uses since the 90's just like Valve \*rolls eyes\*.  
---
The only difference in Valve compiling newer fixes rebased to their older games is because they actually have sane working habits and conditions, they have a clean, properly managed codebase (Hl¬≤ had so many branches during initial dev, yet they didn't fuckaroo the rebase all and upstream process, more than 10 years ago).  
---
Comparing Valve and Bethesda is a bad joke, and you're a sad clown, this has nothing to do with the game (gameplay / game related content), how they work and how professionnal/experienced they are, are totally independant of their respective projects.
---
You can add me if you want IGN: Plankman33367
---
I'm german though so my spoken english isn't the best, but good enough for you to understand.
---
It doesn't really matter because the game is objectively garbage, no matter how you play it.
---
Well I didn't expect that, but that's actually a really helpful comment. Glad I clicked this post, thanks. 
---
Then it's stacked Bobbleheads Ya fuck... 
---
Finally a good cause for all the pre-war money
---
Porta-potty in your camp should be an AFK safe space.
---
&gt; No idea when a patch is actually coming.
---
You did not read. They said "later this month".
---

---
That would be great. There's something intimidating in seeing and hearing the Power Armors. If I heard "Not us" through the PA voice filter I would get scared for sure... 
---
Reddit is a cesspool man, I feel your pain. That other forum is a pain to use. Reddit is like golf, the lower your score the better you're doing. If you aren't getting downvoted then way to many morons agree with you and you have to start wondering if you're stupid. Bazaar had a scandal awhile back though. Good luck!
---
Fought a SBQ with one other high level got it down to around 50% and it flew off north of the map and stayed there, we both gave a cross emote, nothing to do really, if the game is coded this way so be it. They had there reasons I guess.
---
I reckon Bethesda/Zenimax have done what EA done to Mass Effect Andromeda. That is they've just wrote the game off now. Probably have a skeleton crew working on it and have scrapped all future content and DLC. I mean what are the odds they can turn this car crash of a launch around??  Seeing as every update they do just breaks the game all over again i genuinelythink its impossible.  
---
No reason to throw good money after bad, thats a surefire way to go out of business. This game is dead with zero hope of it ever getting fixed. Such a fucking shame.
---
Yes to all of this!!
---
Atom shop designs are created by a solitary unpaid female intern who has never played any Fallout, knows nothing about the lore, and is still salty about Gamergate.
---
Warning launching several nukes at once may close it down permanently.
---
I will and im from Switzerland so 
---
It's code, not a real creature, the code is broken or badly designed or it's by design to just piss us off.
---
The real question is why can't we stomp on cockroaches?
---
And all hail the mighty radworms!!!
---
I'm not suggesting Austin should take the blame, only that people shouldn't take this as a Bethesda problem across the board. I've seen people say they arent looking forward to Starfield, or ES6, when those games are being developed by what is essentially a different company, and more importantly the same company that brought us all the bethesda games we all loved. I've always kind of viewed 76 as an experiment for bethesda to see how multiplayer would work in the engine. Is it unfortunate that they charged people for it? Absolutely. But I'm not letting this game affect my view of Bethesda as a whole.
---
I hear ya. I was hoping for a TSE Handmade or sniper rifle so when my TSE Gauss dropped I grinded levels just to build around that weapon spending points on Batteries Included and any energy weapon related perks. After the nerf my Gauss damage is like throwing empty cans at enemies. I was ok with the nerf but since then and now I had to grind levels again just to accommodate the Lever Action and I'm still not done.
---
Are you accepting new members to your discord? I'm gonna be playing this game for years so I'm always looking for new people and ways to play.
---
Even thought my luck is at 15.... it mind as well be at -500 when it comes to legendary gear dropping. If I couldn't craft I'd be naked.
---
Lmao fuck yeah 
---
A lot of people here complaining actually enjoy the game or at least has been. I am rather bored with it the moment but i got my moneys worth long ago which was 80 EUR. 
---
Posts like yours give the impression that you are only here too feed on negativity. 
---
‚ÄùMost of us‚Äù enjoy or dislike the game for different reasons but you are not even a player so i do not understand why you spend the time posting about the game. Even now long after launch you are still here spreading negativity and only negativity.
---
You and the alike is the biggest issue with Fallout 76 for me, along with all the stuff Beth fucks up with the game, which i still think is overall great.
---
Stop trying to pull the playing community down. Just play another game and try to enjoy that or discuss imorovement FOR A GAME THAT YOU PLAY.
---
or a toilet paper cannon so we can tp each other's camps.
---
The entire game is lazy. Fallout 4 with a multiplayer mod would be a better experience.
---
you have my strong support!
---
This challenge is doable, but if I'm not mistaken you must level up 7 cards in one playing session. 
---
Yeah the game is dead because of the piss poor dev decisions. 
---
Just uninstall like everyone else. I have literally 0 friends online when I have opened the game after the last nerf patch.
---

I got a piece of legendary chalk tonight in Whitesprings. 
---
with an xbox and a controller.
---
Yep. Haven't touched it in days.
---
Look at my post history and you'll see just how invested I've been, clinging onto a frayed strand of fading hope...
---
Not going to waste my time anymore.
---
I came to 76 from NMS. I don't know if they're similar enough to compare. 
---
NMS had the benefit of a procedurally generated universe to keep fans busy. That combined with a fan base who took content creation into their own hands was what kept the game going. 
---
You had people creating web apps to show you where you were in the galaxy, others were organizing communities, and even naming conventions were agreed upon to help share resources. All of this was before true multiplayer was even released. People wanted the game to succeed and the fans worked to make sure it did. It was a casual space exploration game that scratched an itch for many.
---
76 doesn't have either of these to fall back on. The map is large but still limited. It's not inconceivable that someone has seen every major location at this point. 
---
While there has been many great based tools created (looking at you nukesdragons) the motivation to create you're own content isn't there. 
---
I hope I'm wrong, because I do really enjoy the game, but unless they capture people's attention soon then the game is going to have a tough time bouncing back. 
---
you post this like once a week.
---
Ja dann k√∂nnen wir ja auch Deutsch reden.
---
Please fix this! I can't stand having to spend literally at least 1000+ ultracite 5.56 rounds(yes it takes that much to take her down and that's on a good day) and then see the queen, which is supposedly the boss in the game, drop me 1\* nocturnal wood armor!! My worst experience so far is when there are no legendary drops at all 3 times consecutively in a row!
---
THE NUMBERS MASON
---
#WHAT DO THEY MEAN
---
By installing the game, we signed an arbitration agreement which is valid in every US state except for California. That's sufficient to be denied class status in every other state (and even in California, unless the class is restricted to exclude out-of-state purchasers). 
---
The good news for Californians is that a California lawsuit has ready been filed.
---
The bad news for anyone who signs on to a class action is that individual recovery is usually very low because it's capped at individual losses times class members--and the attorneys are paid out of that amount as a flat fee, meaning that they have little incentive not to settle for even less.
---
I deleted this garbage off my PS4 weeks ago. It should have been a normal Fallout game with co-op.
---
It‚Äôs surprising we don‚Äôt already see Brotherhood of Steel members turned scorched inside their power armors. 
---
Does power armor have resistance to the scorched plague?
---
It would be pretty insane to fight a couple of power armored scorched with an entourage of scorched soldiers AND a scorch beast over head. 
---
The heavy scorched should use miniguns, Gatling lasers, missile launchers, and grenades.
---
What do you guys think?
---
If you hit it it actually blows up the datacenter
---
yeah, and the robot operating it is a giant boss, MUCH harder then the queen. beating it gives 200 atoms.
---
Did you read the comment?

Nope. I‚Äôm irritated with the 8000th reiteration of ‚ÄúFallout 5 would have been better than this!!‚Äù. Because it‚Äôs a tired and boring argument. Yes, we get it. You (generic you) wanted the single player fifth entry in the series. You‚Äôve been crying about that since FO76 was *announced*. This *isn‚Äôt* FO5. It‚Äôs not even *trying* to be FO5. FO5 hasn‚Äôt even gotten on the damn radar yet. Stop freaking whining about something you were *never* going to get at this point already.
---
It‚Äôs fine to be upset that you didn‚Äôt get your single-player FO5 game that you‚Äôve been dreaming of. A lot of us are disappointed by that. But if you have *nothing* to do with FO76 and don‚Äôt even play the damn game, then why the fuck are you *here*? If you don‚Äôt play, never purchased it, and never *will* purchase or play it, you have absolutely *nothing* to add to the conversation about it because you are *not part of the community*, so go away already and leave those of us who *have* purchase and *do* play and thus have actual experience with it alone. 
---
Yeah he's just annoying now.
---
Much better with friends......maybe that's the problem? üòâ
---
That was a legit surprise ending for me. I don‚Äôt have high story expectations from a COD game, but that, I‚Äôll throw a comment down about. 
---
It makes me laugh sometimes that folks think devs get to make decisions.
---
Lead devs maybe, if a project manager doesn‚Äôt overrule them. 
---
Basically what 76 is, is sadly an unfinished mod rushed out the door by a newly acquired studio who were likely ordered to ship before it was deemed ready for the Christmas rush. 
---
The developers likely will not have been happy with this decision, but like any of you in work, if your boss says do the thing, you usually have to do the thing. 
---
And then what you get is an infinite number of months of hate filled swearing at a community manager about the devs who didn‚Äôt even want to release the game in the state it‚Äôs in.  
---
Likely who you‚Äôre pissed at is the publisher, specifically the one who made the decision to ship, and that probably isn‚Äôt someone who knows Jacko about programming nor development. 
---
On another note not wholly related to this subject but sorta,
---
I‚Äôve been reading this forum for about a month now and seriously, how these community managers continue to engage on here with post titles containing the word fuck, and replies swearing at them is beyond me. If you went to any customer service desk in any bricks and mortar store and started your sentence with fuck you‚Äôd be led out by security and never allowed back in. They must have the patience of saints.
---
TLDR: make sure you‚Äôre pissed at the right people. Devs work for a living, and rarely get to do what they would like. Look to the publisher who ordered them to force this out the door. 
---
Todd Howard

More than Preston.
---
Stackef Bobblehewds were patched, mate
---
I have a two shot alarm clock
---
And yet, here you are, still bitching about it. Surely you have better things to do with your time now?
---
Yeah, no kidding. But FO4‚Äôs code is the basis for FO76. Didn‚Äôt you watch the documentary? They actually talk about how one of the reasons they were having so much trouble was trying to turn the single protagonist oriented code of FO4 into code that allowed for multiple protagonists without glitching out. What‚Äôs your point?
---
Throughout the world in 76 there's dozens of stories told through props; teddy bears, skeletons, etc. This level of detail is what I expect from a Bethedsa game, but it kinda bugs me knowing that their team spent hours posing props that the majority of people won't see or notice instead of devoting more resources to developing the game itself.
---
No, you can build only the bone traps that are in wendigo Cave 
---
*Fallout 76 didn't just die, it was murdered.*
---
You make a good point.  I get where they are coming from with the request but agree they probably have enough actionable feedback to keep them busy for a while without requesting more ;)
---
If you don't like it, bye
---
The Elder Scrolls at least IS developed by BGS (and, coming soon, Starfield too)
---
Rare to see such positivity in an otherwise negative environment 
---
It was ‚Äúbetter‚Äù during beta. 
---
I agree with what you're saying.. but then again, you are in a dedicated conversation about a game you don't like or want.  What's the point?
---
Hey, Bethesda, 1) limit PvP ONLY to PvP servers; 2) wipe the inventories of all characters in an account where even one character has 500 buff items or legendaries; 3) wipe all TSE from game, restore perks then reintroduce TSE; 4) fire the useless intern designing fucking stupid atom shop stuff and hire someone who knows the lore and who doesn‚Äôt hate men.
---
You should look his post history, for someone who doesn't own FO76, he's been a bigger poster here than most FO76 players :').  
---
Not sure if broke and unemployed or just broke, but heck that guy is so active in this sub one's gotta wonder.  
---
That guy has to lack the 10$ the game now costs, so here he is, farming downvotes... do you need help memnoch01 ? I'd put half the money if someone else wants to help an "akshully guy" like you.
---
See ya. I do and will continue to enjoy it. If it's not for you, don't play.
---
Oh I agree it has a shit tonne of potential. Buy I'd rather things ran correctly than be focusing on new stuff just yet. 
---
yeah i brought this up recently cause i was trying my hand at a dedicated crafter RP &amp; it all felt like a waste of time &amp; caps even though crafting was a basic foundation cornerstone of the game's design.
---
The no level cap &amp; being able to max all perk cards makes the RP feel hollow since we basically all become wasteland gods who can do everything.
---
True. There are hundreds of wepaons, and only a dosen are playable. I've been using plasma rifles since FO1. Give me back my plasma! Give me puddles of green goo! But make this goo lootable. 
---
You forgot whiny babies, the subs full of whiny babies as well
---
 Very constructive thread, you will be missed
---
Increased the stash limit by 200, plasma's are still crap, and fixed 1 single animation that was broke back in fo4 btw....in 3 months (bobby pin weight your scrap.
---
We've come far....your mental or trolling.
---
Each patch has been a small list of bug fixes which lets be honest shouldn't have made it through Alpha, let alone Beta and then onto live. People have given them the benefit of the doubt and given them more time than they deserve, then they release a salty ITV with an air of were sulking to it and a shameless troll bait plug for Atom store at the end.
---
Your smoking the same shyte Todd is aren't you?
---
They think it's acceptable to post 1 vague ITV per week and call it customer service? Bethesda are going to be having problems because of this mess for years to come. It will ripple outwards and effect sales of all there future game's, can't wait till they book slots at E3 or whatever other convention they dare to show there face at (both of them). Some guy with maxed out NERDRAGE is gonna shove a copy of fo76 up there arses side ways ad stream it live on you tube. This isn't the 90's when you can rip everyone off and hide away for ever, personally i can't wait for the shit show to continue when they have to show there faces to start plugging the next broken product.
---
It may even but a halt to es6 or fo5 depending on how salty Todd actually gets.
---
Teenage angst and reasons, better than doing their home work or cleaning their room.
---
I didn't gel with Far Harbour. The synths killed it for me, honestly. Didn't like them in the base game, didn't like them in the DLC. The map was nice, though there were real missed opportunities to introduce aquatic enemies... I would've settled for those mutated dolphin as real entities but they were lazy. Hell, it could've just been a Slaughterfish retexture and I'd have been happy.
---
Nuka-World on the other hand was great. Loved the entirety of it. Having said that, it was tacked onto Fallout 4. Besides two side quests in F4 (Some organised crime thing in Diamond City and the Kid in the Fridge) there were very few opportunities to role play as an evil character. Nuka-World fixed that, but not in the Commonwealth. You're still the general of the Minutemen... Life goes on, only Preston notices.
---
Not only that, even with Vaccinated the rate at which the checks are made means that if you wander into Whitespring club house IN PA and WITH VACCINATED you‚Äôll still likely walk out with Rad Worms. 
---
Apple is my favourite with pulled pork.
---
Well the CM's have an impossible job, they've been thrown in at the deep end and asked to manage an understandably pissed-off community for a game in serious trouble.
---
This is the Dark Souls of community manager jobs
---
I had to scrap them one by one, not scrap all for it to work 
---
And it feels like they‚Äôre doing a naked run to boot.
---
Most products in life (and companies, etc.) start to fail when their vision becomes rabbit-chasing. That may stall / prolong things as you‚Äôre chasing populist opinions or $, but really the lack of cohesive vision makes it just as you say - schizophrenic. 
---
Get your tongue outa there ass, i know you love that taste but Todd can shit on you just fine without it being lodged in there.
---
These CM's that have been passing on all the bugs and feedback we've been giving them for months? The ones that have gone that extra mile for there customers and pushed what was important to the community to the top of the dev's list of to do?
---
Your part of the problem, keep thanking people for doing the bare minimum at there job and fo76 is what your left with.
---
I agree with you - but you lost me at ‚Äúfanboys‚Äù.
---
Having any customer service job is draining as fuck. I wouldn't want to deal with mad nerds on forums all day.
---
Ladies and gents, example a
---
The Bethesda way ofc!
---
Id take the money, run and tweet you guys about a new product im launching every few weeks :P
---
I don't know how it would work in practice, but i thought it would be cool if an actual dedicated smith/crafter type could open up a sort of skill tree to make specific types of legendary items.  This would tie into the vague premise that bethesda promised of rebuilding Appalachia &amp; player vending.
---
We have dedicated crafting players who vend their special legendaries to other players.  Adding custom naming would be cool as well because folks could see that.  "oh you have HuntaKilla's legendary combat arm?  Well i prefer the bonus of 420noscopeXX's marine armor myself"
---
Waiting for the "alt opinion" guy to show up with his ~~corporate~~ honest opinion.
---
Maybe if we say "shill" three times in the  mirror and turn the lights on and off, he'll show up.
---
Andromeda: Single player with optional multiplayer on the side.
---
Fallout 76: Online only multiplayer survival 
---
Yes very accurate comparison 
---
\*Hold breath\*
---
I think it was somewhat lazy, but if you see the term fanboy on here it pretty much is always either respawning circlejerk or brigading.
---
Iirc, sea of thieves HAS not done that. It still is boring and bad. I believe you're thinking of No Man's Sky.
---
Pay the modders who normally fix the other Beth games to fix 76
---
We need wall-bound stairs, not this middle of the platform and massive 1x2 space take up platform
---
In my experience you get less tokens if you fail some aspect of the quest... but sometimes you fail because the quest glitches...
---
You are the only one whining about downvotes.
---
I have issues with games being rereleased for full price with the same *known* bugs. It‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt know about what the modding community is doing. They could even have looked at the unoffical patch mod and rolled those fixes into the next gen release since by the point of the first rerelease of Skyrim, they knew the fixes in that mod were stable.
---
Instead they tweaked the graphics a little and held out their hand for another $60 and helping of butt pats for being such good boys and rereleasing it. Over and over.
---
And end up killing it as an online game?
---
I always appreciate a nice gold fork. Gold is one of those items I never need, so beyond cutlery I don't know where to source it. It's genius that I need gold to craft canvas pockets for my armour, truly. 
---
Count me in!

i couldn‚Äôt lmao i have 0 lockpick
---
Jeff is actually working on the buglist, currently on bug *b2018/11/04\_v.08.1.2unstble* while Bill is making coffee, deleting comments in the forum and writing "inside the vault" articles.
---
Im already getting tired of the scorched tbh
---
Why wait a year when if it launches at the beginning of November, it‚Äôll be 50% off in mere *weeks*?
---
Bethesda posted about it in this thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alufua/psa_after_patch_scrapping_all_breaks_all_bulk/efjlohc/?context=0
---
But I was doing dross toss, I hit all 3 targets, that one I really don't see how one can fail that.
---
Yeah, it was super tragic.  Fucking Brody
---
Why do the moderators on here allow circlejerk? Criticism is one thing, insulting the entire playerbase is another.
---
To sum up my frustrations with the game in one sentence.  
---
I'm going back to collecting Mugs.
---
Why? The quality of work of mod community varies greatly. Free they are fine but questionable if paid for.
---
I think it‚Äôs a hivemind.
---
Straight up nightmare fuel.
---
HOW ABOUT FIX THE ANIMATION SO THEY CARRY THE WEAPON THEY USE????!!!!!
---
My girlfriend said the exact same thing. 
---
Because the modders that fix the game arent questionable? I didnt say ALL modders, i said the modders that usally fix Beth games. Hell id trust anyone BUT Bethesda to fix the game.
---
It's harder to get attention that way, though.
---
Why would you preorder anything? Seriously. the days of gamespot or Walmart running out of physical copies is long gone. There is absolutely no reason to preorder, all it does is encourage the shipping oc broken games they *might* work on after release.
---
You get 5 dross - did you miss two? Or maybe you didn‚Äôt say inside an invisible box you don‚Äôt know about. Or maybe it glitched for some reason... 
---
&gt;a few annoying bugs
---
I wonder if the Rad Worms bug could amplify the damage in any way.
---
Having Melee Builds ridiculously, insultingly overpowered is not a minmax issue, because as you point out it takes zero skill or analysis to start using this build.
---
The min-maxing comes into play for people who use VATS/Luck/Crits builds that, when constructed properly, can one-shot you with almost any decent ranged weapon because they are getting Crits every third, every second, or in extreme cases, with every single shot.
---
My wife says the same thing and it‚Äôs like I wish it just all shot out like that but it‚Äôs a process. I might need more fiber for sure.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm not even sure it‚Äôs a money issue.
---
Assuming this game is the bastard child of fallout 4 and Skyrim, which there‚Äôs no reason to believe it isn‚Äôt. 
---
You‚Äôre a dev at at new studio and you‚Äôre handed the code for two games, told to make these games into one game, and then build on top of that. You aren‚Äôt getting to start from scratch, you‚Äôre infact inheriting two sets of spaghetti code from another studio and merging them, trying to do so without spawning infinite bugs, and you‚Äôve got to meet the Christmas rush deadline. 
---
It comes out and it‚Äôs exactly as you expected. Merging this much code and then pasting over the top of it has created Frankenstein‚Äôs monster and everyone can tell the skins falling off. 
---
You try and patch everything at once to please the community and all you end up doing is introducing more bugs, because you‚Äôre literally playing operation on a patient whose biology is built from 20 other patients. 
---
So you change tac. You release an inside the vault stating that you‚Äôre fixing one thing. One thing at a time. We can probably merge that without screwing up everything we did last patch. 
---
Nope, community hates it. Patch everything at once again. That didn‚Äôt work last time but only because ‚Äúyou suck‚Äù.
---
No matter how much money you throw at this I‚Äôm not sure you can fix it quickly or all at once, merging that much code to fix errors, in a game made of two other studios code, is going to make more bugs. But you aren‚Äôt able to delay the patch to get everything bug tested post merge, because the community will still complain it‚Äôs taking too long.
---
It‚Äôs a complete catch 22
---
I here you Apex is so amazing and fun 
---
I'm in the process of switching out of a heavy weapons build to a single shot build and repairing heavy weapons is one of the reasons. Always loved my heavy builds but certain mats seem to be scarce as it is. Granted I don't have the amount of play time a lot of people have, I'm around level 80. My Tesla Rifle I haven't needed to repair, it's still over 150% and I've put over 1k fusion cells through it. But my heavy weapons broke constantly. 9 luck, Luck of the Draw at 3 stars. 
---
Sack everyone, bring in the design team from Eve Online, transfer to a new game engine and buy three new servers one for PS, XBox and PC
---
And I've used mods that "fix" the game for skyrim. Suddenly a game that rarely crashes suddenly crashes frequently. 
---
You also ignore large groups like Skyrim Unofficially Patch literally taken years to address the issues. Yet in a quarter of that time people expect Bethesda to do similar amounts of work.
---
Top of the world, top floor
---
That was me telling you to get your tongue out of there ass....nothing directed towards the CM's. So really it's just an example of you being a snowflake thinking anyone that disagree's with you is wrong / rude / (insert whatever you want).
---
The CM's dont do this for love they do it for wages. Simples.
---
If they did love the game or even care in the slightest we would have better lines of communication with Bethesda as they would be taking the feedback from here and putting pressure on there boss to do something about it / with it you under stand that right?
---
Check any CM's comments, posts from 3 months ago say "well pass this long" when someone mentions a bug. Pick a bug and then check there comments from the same month, guarantee the same bug has been posted about and the same CM comes along and pastes the same shit in the comments again....were passing it along.
---
Then to boot, Bethesda come out directly and ask for feedback....WTF have they been passing along, or are they passing it along to file 13?
---
I just wish for that green power armor paint in the trailer to come out but 3 months later and nothing atomic shop that i want.
---
Inner walls, pretty please!
---
You should definitely stop playing if you don't like it. 
---
I'm still playing because it is awesome and fun and a great way to spend my free time.  
---
"And your 'time to put this mongrel down' comment gets a big "fuck off, asshole" from me. Don't like it? Don't play it, stop trying to ruin other people's fun.
---
While she did a good job during late-Jan patch, you seriously didn't expect CM to give you an update/news OUTSIDE "what's inside the vault" ? right ?  
---
Because they may look nice and compliant, trying to help, there's not much they are allowed except damage control and vague answers.  
---
Here's my attempt at CM'ing you an answer :  
---
"While we definitely stray to push forward and release a roadmap, we're actually for the moment rethinking the way we're going to deliver content, content announcements, and overall anything related to *coming* update.  
---
Sadly, I can't confirm or deny a roadmap would eventually be made, let alone published, but we definitely look forward to do so in the coming weeks !
---
Meanwhile we understand your concerns and appreciate your feedbacks which, we'll make sure to pass to our dev team !  
---
Stay tuned for more infos on FO76 soon(tm) ;). "  
---
Sound like the Minute Men or Responders to me
---
Let's hope your girl's don't meet Jody hey whilst your to busy in the wasteland ; )
---
To be honest, I want complete freedom of mods. So much could be done to make this universe at this point in time so much more booming, it'd help so much.  
---
I do think you got your $80 worth and I did too (albeit at a cheaper price) but I'm with you.  
---
I know I've not done everything possible but done the big ones, and it's pretty much grinding right now - currently screws to make handmades so I can scrap them and get a darn suppressor, and before that a full set of T-51 at lvl 50, and before that a full set of T-45 at lvl 45 (to go along with my T-60, X-01, Excavator, Ultracite).  Still waiting for ability to display my "preciousss" in my CAMP !!
---
Sure there are plans to still pick up, improvement of CAMP etc. but effectively done the end-game and its time to either restart with a different build in mind or try PvP or just put it down for a while until a new DLC hits.  
---
I've had great fun.  No regrets in buying the game and looking forward to more new content whenever it hits.  
---
With that said, I am concerned about how much content Bethesda can push out vs reacting to bug fixing.  It would be great if they allowed mods as that is a whole additional resource pool to tap into to make the game great.  Don't know the practicality of that but without modders, the game won't reach its full potential IMO.
---
I feel like we need to update Godwin‚Äôs law to include the word snowflake. 
---
It‚Äôs being passed around in much the same manner, as if uttering it wins an argument. 
---
But whatever makes you feel like a bro.
---
You do you.
---
It can't be worse than the paid pro's Bethesda has working on it though can it...
---
Are you sure fireproof mitigates mirelurk sonic?  I was not aware that was in the explosive category.
---
Poison is also cheesy....
---
Umm do you remember all the crashes in FO4? And more bugs than I can remember. Even FO3 and NV had bugs it's to be expected from this series and not a game breaker. I bought this game fully knowing Fallout has always been a buggy game.
---
We should continue to report bugs and expect them to work on it However history repeats itself and this game is no exception
---
I don't think it's really fair to include suggestions on a 'bug' list.
---
Bold of you to assume I have any of that
---
Good riddance hopefully more of you carebear karma whores leave
---
Funny
---
Turret blocker. Love it :P
---
If you didn't use such lazy, generic tactics people would take you more seriously.
---
But instead you call people kids, say they're angry and make yourself look stupid.
---
You tubers are a cancer. Stop watching all of them.
---
I really only kept playing because my friend never played a fallout game before so I thought it would be better if I was there to ease him in
---
I missed that in my play-through, only noticed after reading about it now. Thanks for pointing out.
---
Can you cannibalise them?
---
Probably not but people already complain about what the paid pros do. So you would still have the same problems.  
---
I enjoyed ARR for like a year.. at the "endgame" at that point the bosses were so hard it was hard to do with randoms... so then you couldn't even find a group unless you had elite everything. Got un-fun so I quit....

Is this sub just dominated by people that bitch now?

Paid his cash, hes allowed to be vocal about a product he own's....hell doesn't even have to own it.

If it stop's potential customer's being ripped off as well it was worth the post no?
---
You get downvoted in this asking for advice.
---
So whatever. 
---
I was eavesdropping on a Gutsy fighting something yesterday when I heard something like "Nothinh I like better than the smell of plasma in the morning."
---
I love the robots in Fallout. They're all perfect!
---
"Buddy be wise, and don't believe his lies.'
---
From what metrics I have been hearing through the backroom channels, they are making a lot of money via people buying stuff from the Atom Shop, the problem is, they are looking at "what can we do to make more money" than "what fixes can we put in."
---
From previous comments on Reddit I am right in assuming the new studio is involved in the game, and BSG Maryland is now completely working on Starfield, so if you want to use your EA comment, we have guys who don't know the engine inside out working on the game, deep level fixes are going to be rare to non-existent, because it doesn't make them money.
---
One married man to another, your wife is always right. Put this game down and move on. 
---
Oh you work at Bethesda? They didn't see people nuking Prime in a way to be able to fight her without being in the blast radius?  I've been nuking her like that since my 1st nuke when I realised that as long as Prime is in the blast radius it triggers. Since I've not see too many blasts dropped directly on Prime, I'm going to make the assumption that I'm one of **many** that came to that conclusion very quickly.
---
It is not a glitch/bug to drop the nuke off to the side. If this wasn't wanted/they didn't see it coming, they wouldn't have allowed you to activate the Scorched Earth event unless you directly targeted Prime. Figuring out fight mechanics and a way to beat them isn't cheating, it's how you play games with boss mechanics.
---
Where she's supposed to be? She either flies out down to an out of bounds area, where she's very much **not** supposed to be, or she flies out to circle around to do .. whatever she does. Her ground spray attack or whatever it is. Are you telling me we're not *allowed* to follow her when she flies off? And that we're not *allowed* to engage her if she flies off? What about the times she flies up to the train yard and starts fighting mobs? We're just supposed to sit there and twiddle our thumbs waiting for her to come back while the timer is ticking down? Don't be ridiculous. Do you realise how stupid you sound?
---
Can you technically kill your friends over and over to get it?
---
As someone who is a rifle build and never had aTSE all I can say is you'll live. I farm lead and acid at home to make enough ammo for nuked zones. I know this may not be you're thing but I'm into self inflicted pain, I'm Catholic.
---
Thank you for the information.
---
I really enjoy the story and taking my time to get through content. I was level 60 something before I even got to the "drop a nuke" in 76...  
---
I also really enjoy the Elder Scrolls/Skyrim world... I wouldn't say Lore so much as the setting.
---
I don't mind spending a little extra on micro-transactions as long as I am enjoying the game. $15-$20 a month is pretty cheap really,  considering the hours one puts in. Hell of a lot cheaper than the bar!
---
It would seem that the forums are even truning against them. I've nearly finished everything. It will be time to move onto a different game soon unless there is a serious content drop.
---
&gt;Scorched in overalls with Pitchfork in the bog: Level 68
---
You only think its a pitchfork!!  When you loot him it will be a combat knife.
---
Nah, if the people working on the skyrim unofficial patch had been paid and it had been a full time source of income for them it would have been done a hell of a lot quicker and probably would have been better.
---
What's disgusting is, they proved it could be done to fix all the bugs etc whilst Bethesda slopped out the back door forgetting about it counting the cash.
---
I generally don't have enough time during the week to launch and then enjoy the aftermath so what I do is login and check the silo tubes for dots. if there is someone there I'll stay on the server and wait for the death from above notification while I repair my gear .
---
If the tubes are empty I'll reroll to another server.   On weekends I'm game to launch with the keycards I've scrounged during the week. 
---
Your title makes you sound like an Italian mother
---
Whilst I‚Äôd love to see groups of raiders in ramshackle vehicles mad max style.
---
I have a feeling what you‚Äôd get is griefers doing donuts round the vault running over newbies. 
---
Plus a good 99% of Appalachia seems to be hills, at least when I‚Äôm trying to place a camp it feels like that. I‚Äôm not sure vehicles would deal well with that, and the road networks seen better days.
---
Maybe if we could restore the rail network. That would be a good halfway measure.
---
It‚Äôs under the same tab as advanced power connectors
---
lol..you never know..all types lova to play fallout
---
In other words: "Mooooom, my 15 dollars aren't OP anymore!".
---
So their roadmap would like an early access one?
---
I have to test that a bit more but it seems to be an AOE sonic boom - in the past people thought it might do energy damage, but I suspect its actually explosive/flame.  I feel like kings have always been a threat even when you're in PA (which has strong energy DR).
---
There are arrows on the floor pointing you in the direction you need to go. I didn't know this the when i ran the first one solo and getting lost ate up time. The second run I did with a team and one of the guys pointed that out. 
---
No, I dont want to share my private address ;)
---
Lol. That is really sad.

I would donate for a game to the poor bastard.

I am lvl 100 and haven't found a single usable legendary weapon for my build so I use crafted weapons.

I am able to kill any enemy with 2-4 bullets with my crafted weapons and build.

Scorchbeasts take a couple more bullets but still die quickly with minimal effort.

Stop bitching about a nerf to a very op legendary effect. Be grateful you have a gun with any kind of damage boost. My gun has no effects at all. I seem to be killing stuff easily.

Sorry Bethesda nerfed your easier than easy button. God forbid you actually have to try to aim rather than spray you bullets with no skill involved.
---
No it's not what they have been doing. 
---
We had 5 patches in 3 months, that's nothing compared to basically any other live service game out there. 
---
The Division 2 Beta had an issue with the Beta yesterday, yes, a Beta. A few hours later a patch was ready to address that issue. Just now, a few hours later, another small patch was delivered, addressing more issues. 
---
That's how you patch a live service game. This whole shitshow of announcing a patch weeks in advance only to break more than they fix with the patch eventually - that's just sad. 
---
Bethesda wanted to test whether they can operate a live service game. 
---
We've all found the answer now. It's no. 
---
Lol, yes!!  I complete the Grafton Quests by just walking to Greg to unload bulk junk. Although I like the free stimpacks and the lvl 50 metal armor chest... I feel bad man!
---
Agreed.  After that and a couple more blue screens, I uninstalled yesterday.   My free time is too precious to waste on a buggy game from a company that doesn't care.  Good riddance!
---
Yeah.  I run the T-60 for repair costs too. It's the workhorse. Decent all around and great rad-resistance.   
---
You might want an T-51b , Ultracite, or X-01 frame to use for special occasions, but they're like fancy sports cars that spend too much time in the garage. The increased performance is rarely meaningful. Likewise, the excavator set is useful for mining or looting runs, but usually sits in the stash. 
---
I've uninstalled prob in early Jan, though I still visit reddit in the hope of things turning around....  guess it'll be a while.
---
You're doing god's work over here you know that? 
---
If you think there's a shitpool in here then why do you choose to swim in it? Your upvoters should consider that too
---
I make plenty of ammo as well. My favorite gun is my handmade. But it should not take a minimum of 5 hits to kill a bug. Or unload a mag into an enemy. I‚Äôm talking hits not misses. That‚Äôs ridiculous. Meanwhile melee is now the ‚ÄúOP‚Äù and everyone is complaining. I understand the nerf but they went to far. It needs to come back up some   What‚Äôs the point of finding a 2 plus star LEGENDARY weapon and it does crappy damage?? That doesn‚Äôt sound fun at all. I‚Äôve been here since the first BETA, when we were on time limits, I‚Äôve finished all the quests so I‚Äôm sticking around bc I‚Äôm a fallout fan. But it‚Äôs stupid having to go thru thousands of rounds to kill a big enemy, mainly the SNQ, and it takes days to get it back. That‚Äôs not my idea of fun. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll share my sentiment when you‚Äôre where I am in the game. 
---
You had me until the lawful good part :(
---
Copy and paste template. Those suggestions *will not help*.
---
Just have a little looksie over here...
---
you can't do that while in power armor
---
And then you get a 3* from a non-legendary kill. Too bad it's a level 10 item and all the stats are trash.
---
Arhahaa! You truly made me laugh out loud :D
---
Thanks kind stranger.
---
What your wife was trying to say: "John you are a grown man I'm tired if hearing about your video games"
---
Please learn how to use ‚Äòs correctly. 
---
It's amazing how few people sell gold and silver. You don't have to bundle it to sell.
---
Maybe they should have given it to a team that knows how to do games like this to develop, like Zenimax, The Elder Scrolls is doing really well.
---
So RadWorms is bugged and instead of multiplying rads by 150%, it sets *all* character "spells" (things on the Effects tab) to 150%. Then when it wears off, it sets these effects back to 100%, which overrides the jump modifier back to 100% (or normal height).
---
Rad Rats, Mirelurk Kings, Hermit Crabs, Gulpers are all excessive bullet sponges. I really hate Mirelurk Kings and Gulpers as they also hit hard even in power armour. They are not fun, they are just a slog, with Kings being like SBQ with their sonic attack.
---
Never heard about it, do you have a picture ? :)
---
Or do you only mean the "Open" sign plan ?
---
Start a new character with different build
---
Is that Jody I hear in the background?
---
Did you figure out what exactly it does? Cos I‚Äôm stumped
---
Hah I once got a single loose screw get on my level
---
Inb4 passed onto dev team
---
Actually, there's a history of the Creation Engine on YouTube and it turns out the very first iterations of Gamebryo had an online component that was ripped out - kind'a funny in retrospect :)
---
I think it changes the colour of light boxes and can play holotapes, though they‚Äôve really missed a trick here as they could have added things like a multiplayer channel for people to message ea h over through
---
that was a meth head.
---
Would also like to know this!
---
True nothing is perfect, but I have been playing videos game since my Atari 2600 days. I have seen, lived and played through the virtual evolution of the game industry.  Odyssey 2000, Commodore 64, Amiga, NES and virtually every major console since and numerous ones you likely haven't.  1000s of games and Dozens of MMO taken to End-game.
---
I know a beta level game when I play it. Fo76 was a fruit that needed 6 more months on the tree. I want to see this game ripen into something magnificent not rot into obscurity.
---
Dev seen lost and not in touch with what the community wants.
---
It seems to me at least that Bethesda have fallen into the same trap as Bungie regarding PvP. 
---
You people act like its such a big deal that you're quitting the game and leaving the sub reddit. Like you're expecting people to gasp and panic or something and then when you get called out for being cringy and dramatic you hide behind you're little word "fanboy" and hehe and haha like you're having so much fun seeing people react to your pointless post. Like good god, grow up.
---
I seem to be in the minority in enjoying this game but my one gripe would be that we can‚Äôt fall back on the modding community who have always helped to make games in the series slightly less buggy
---
Deleting WHICH items over the 1500lb limit?  Random items? Weapons tab? Stims? Ammo?   Please think a bit more before posting what is obviously nonsense.  
---
Just uninstalled the game, I don't think there is any future for fallout sadly.
---
I am enjoying Apex Legends but what has it to do with this game, it's a totally different genre
---
Sending us to an outdated list of bugs is ridiculous! This sub has been full of bug reports all week but nothing is ever acknowledged. Everything we are saying is falling on deaf ears. 
---
Homemaker. OCDecorator. 
---
I highly doubt it tbh. Compared to the FFXIV devs, I sense very little care from the FO76 devs anymore. 
---
üòÆ
---
I don't do role play and neither min/max - I just do things with efficiency and balance in mind (running my own hybrid build because of this)
---
What I don't get is why some of the players look up to youtobers or other social media "stars" for their opinions and take them for granted (worst part of this)?
---
These players can't think for themself? Is it not enough to see a few short clips with the game play in order to decide if you will install that title or not? read the release/patch notes to know what you have to do/change in game?
---
Why would someone trust the opinion of a nobody with more subscribers then average when there is a good chance that what he sais/does is not an objective view, or even when it is, in some cases your own subjective view will outclass the reality because you just like that shit!?
---
It‚Äôs not thrown away.  You were entertained for 200 hours.  That‚Äôs 30 cents an hour...pretty cost effective form of entertainment.  
---
I semi RP just to get that old FoNV feel, or a quasi Skyrim feel since a lot of the fauna and flora and even enemies remind me of Skyrim, ghouls/drough, sb/dragons.  I RP'd over 1000 hours in Skyrim.
---
I'm still grinding for that sweet point where I can go out unhindered and just play, it's just hard when so much inexplicably goes wrong. Farm fort defiance for my outfit plus supplies and items to sell for caps, no outfit spawn, supplies are okay, but what good are any items to sell when *every vendor has 0 caps?*
---
So I am a Vault Dweller turned Responders Nurse trying to rekindle the medical branch of the Responders and then some.  I intend to player vend a bunch of aid items, mainly healing salve, chems/alcohol, and possibly spare food, ammo, armor, and weapons, I'm finding my biggest trouble in terms of resupplying will be disease cures.  I intend to help new/low level players stand a chance should they make a mistake, as well as offer our alcoholic doctors and partiers their fixes.  Won't be selling serums though.
---
I literally am a combat medic, field medic, and stealth sniper.  I use .45, 5.56, and 2mm ammunitions, I'd use the syringers but can't hold so many, endangerol is about all I'll take space up on.  Wish I found more too, and I hope there's one where you can shoot a target to heal it.
---
Overall the game is more fun playing with that purpose but it is still an empty feeling grind sometimes when, again, I'm stuck with a bunch of stuff I can't sell taking up my space and all my lead and steel go towards ammunition leaving me perpetually searching for more of each plus acid and cloth for gunpowder.
---
This is an online loot and survival game while also being a Fallout game collecting stuff and making stuff is what this game is about.  So yes if you do the end game content it will cost you materials that will take time to replenish that is how you play the game.
---
I wondered where I amassed the ‚Äútokens‚Äù. Got about 40 and have no idea what they are for.
---
It sucks we can't but Beth wouldn't be able to stop cheating if they allowed it. We'll have to wait for private servers:(
---
Definately should have been single player co-op option, hosted locally (i.e. what players actually wanted).
---
Then, we would have had FO4 style permance to what we build, and modders would have actually be able to do something with it.
---
I've basically played this game solo, the few group events I've tried have not been rewarding enough based on ammo/repairs spent, and the few PvP encounters have been basically griefers.
---
Instead they wanted a MMO with a Shop, and failed at both. Servers should be able to handle 100-200 players (maps big enough) with a proper faction system (aka guilds) which defines which players you encounter are classed as hostiles or friendlies. A level cap should have been introduced (which can be increased with later DLCs). There's enough sucessful MMO's out there to show how it should have been done.
---
I would make a list of 500 features/fixes that would make this game perfect, according to this subreddit, and pay a Dev directly 100k for each one on perfect completion. 
---
Yeah... I just want dogmeat to protect my camp like the canine turret he is
---
I'm totally ok with that. 
---
I doubt it because they would be given a budget to work on and a time frame to complete it before they are pulled to other projects. Modders even unpaid have as much time as they are willing to devote to their mods.
---
Don't post them on sub reddit submit a bug report though Bethesda's website. If you only post it on social media rather then offical channels that brings it right to the dev team. You lose your ability to complain. 
---
Ccombat system is trash though
---
Eh I was more on about adding a different perk card that allowed to reattach mods
---
I just watched Joseph Anderson‚Äôs video on Fallout 76, and I found it super interesting. He‚Äôs a very talented critic and the entirety of his video talks about the flaws of the game itself entirely divorced from bugs and glitches. But the thing that struck my interest was a kind of conspiracy theory towards the end following the patch that reintroduced old bugs that would explain how the patches have been so bad. Highly recommended. 
---
What levels are and are you melee? If so that explains everything. There‚Äôs no way guns should do crap damage. That‚Äôs absurd. If we‚Äôre gonna ‚Äúpretend‚Äù to be in an apocalypse then let‚Äôs not screw up the one thing you need to survive. My gun does no damage against the mutant with the SAME gun but it‚Äôs killing me. Yea that makes sense. I can shoot them in the HEAD with hardly any damage but you can hit them with a Tambo and kill them? Yea total sense there üôÑ To be clear, I‚Äôm not complaining about melee, I don‚Äôt want them to do what they did to our guns to you. PVP, I‚Äôm good. Players can‚Äôt get me easily but the game enemies are different 
---
Jody's got your corvega....
---
*No, man. I know exactly what I'm doing. I just don't know what effect it's going to have. Over there controls power in this building. That station has readouts on the computer network. That big knob there makes a crazy noise. Sparks come out of that slot if you put stuff in it. And I'm learning more every day.*
---
Might mutate into better content.
---
Lmao I‚Äôm way higher than you and I definitely know how to aim. I‚Äôm trying to be realistic but it seems the people who kept getting killed by tse are out today. Lmao
---
&gt;BGS is well known for great games and Buggy games
---
And now they're known for a bad and buggy game.
---
the problem is that respeccing is such a major task that few people even try out other builds. I WANT MY RESPEC
---
but it is not like "Switch of buttons" to add PVP server. They are taking months to build that, means instead of wasting that resource on building something meaningful, they are wasting it on bs.
---
And also you‚Äôre definitely doing something wrong if you haven‚Äôt found one legendary weapon. I find hundreds. I give them away. Found a bunch of two shots yesterday and gave them to a level 8. So yea you‚Äôre doing something wrong. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ
---
You‚Äôre sinking with the ship. 
---
Half Life actually got quite some patches last year (HL1, FYI). And the problem is *quite big game breakers* still exist in all of Bethesda's games. Bigger problem than a few tiny bugs.
---
Beth's been relying on the modders for too long to fix their shortcomings, and it's showing quite hard now.
---
I think it's a perfectly fine game for the first \~100 hours, which isn't so bad to be honest. It's not the best (especially for an online game), but it's not the worst value for your money. Up until I stopped playing, I enjoyed the game a lot. There were two things that prompted me to lose interest. First, I was very involved with trading and enjoyed it a lot. I wracked up max caps on all 5 character slots, plenty of two-shot weapons and was just starting to legitimately break into the TSE market when the dupes started flooding in. EVERYTHING was being duped, and all that time I spent trading felt wasted. Second, end-game consists of three things: farming Queen, farming nuke zones, and just exploring new places for the sake of exploring (because there's literally no other incentive). End-game just got stale for me.
---
I'd come back and probably enjoy new content additions, I don't see a reason to play until then.
---
They haven't stopped any cheating. Ebay is full of listings for duped weapons.
---
I mean, the game is a financial failure and the only buzz or press it gets is negative.  EA closed an entire studio and canceled all the DLC for ME: Andromeda when it went through something similar.  The situations are obviously different because Bethesda self-publishes and clearly isn't going to shut itself down over one flop, but I wouldn't be surprised if they scale back any future DLC plans (which could be why they aren't talking about or hyping anything up) because it just doesn't make sense to keep pumping resources into a dead game.
---
These posts are still a thing?
---
Then OP wasn't as passive as he wants to think, mate
---
remember that thing in Fallout 4 where you could use a Traffic cone, a SINGLE FUCKING TRAFFIC CONE to glitch through most of the game and complete the main story in like, half an hour. and people don't know why Bethesda removed that feature for 76...
---
What? I don‚Äôt spend actual money on game items. Not even the stupid atomic shop. Instead of trying to sling insults, go work on your game play. Can‚Äôt find a legendary weapon. Are you serious??!!!!! Hahahahaha
---
Can you blame people for being negative?
---
Sure we will fix the nerf. We will remove them from the game. Then your gun won't be broken! Your spirit will be!
---
All humor aside- No. Leave them broken or remove them completely.
---
Sure does! And oceans of it have been offered both here and on the official forums for *months* now
---
Na. I'm calling bullshit. You aren't obliterating everything in the game with crafted weapons at level 100. 
---
I'd be down with a bike as well. 
---
honestly at high level play, you just build bloodied melee and use all defensive perks. there is no need to boost damage on a bloodied weapon, you just have to survive. you'd probably be surprised just how unstoppable a full defense build + bloodied weapon is against any other build
---
I just don't get what is taking them so long, as a modder since Morrowind, I know how easy it is to change some things in the construction kit. Rebalancing weapons, etc would be at most a days work for one person, knock up a spreadsheet, work out new values, then change the relevant entries. It's damn simple stuff, and most of the issues people are reporting are simple number tweaks.
---
I have only just started playing. Me and my girlfriend are huge fallout fans...so I finally bit the bullet and got FO76. I figured hey its a FO game we can play together, if nothing else. We haven't played much due to getting a late start last night and me having to be up for work in the morning, but from what we played we enjoyed. I'm actually shocked, you hear so much bad stuff about this game and we both found it to be really fun. We were doing co op. PLaying together roaming around killing npc looting etc. It was a lot of fun. I agree with the OP. I can't say I know anything about the game yet really but I saw a higher level player killing other players last night and thought to myself.. "Hmm I don't think I'll care much for PVP". 
---
You‚Äôre supporting a company that released a shit game and does nothing but continue to alienate what‚Äôs left of its diminishing FO76 fan base. I applaud you for sinking with the ship.
---
I got the same question and it made me realize I have a huge backlog of games, so I'm actually playing Shadow of Mordor now. 
---
I see this argument but you fail to realise this is a live service.  It's meant to played all the time.  Having seasons, content updates and events.  
---
I still play other live services like r6, overwatch, and just recently, Apex Legends.  Sure I don't play them constantly but I can hop on every now and then to enjoy.  I can't even do that with 76 as each session has at least a bug.
---
I‚Äôm on most evenings by 9pm EST.  Add me as a friend on Xbox and I‚Äôll hold it for you.  Gamertag is same as name here.
---
She does seem to glitch more then she should. Flying outside the play area is rather annoying.
---
Because we were sold a nice pool and paid for a nice pool and if we just leave without calling it out for what it is, all that‚Äôs left is crazy people saying shit doesn‚Äôt stink. 
---
Then, we continue to get shit games because, apparently, that‚Äôs enough. 
---
There is no future. This game is dead and making money off atoms as long as it can
---
I guess, for me, it felt nice to share something positive. This game catches a lot of shit and I just thought it was super cool to run into some folks who appreciate the game like I do üòä. 
---
Seriously. You‚Äôre saying you think it makes sense to shoot the enemy in the face multiple times without much damage? That makes sense to you? Even non-legendary weapons shouldn‚Äôt be that bad. It‚Äôs funny bc you guys complain about energy weapons being crap but ALL the weapons except melee are crap. 
---
Everyone‚Äôs quitting
---
Hmmm. Well I still play because smashing things repetitively is entertaining. Blowing up players with a TS fat man is amusing. Almost as amusing as reading all the "My gun is broken! QQ" post on Reddit. But I am also swapping up between this and assassins creed oddysse so I get the best of both worlds
---
The T-Posing Scorched that doesn't attack you until you hit it once approves of this message.
---
Yawn
---
I totally agree. The whiny, "Why can't I one shot everything" crowd has dominated this reddit and act like theirs is the only voice Bethesda should listen too. 
---
4 may have had less crashes, but I swear it is **the** most unstable quest wise of all the games. Having the console handy to setstage or disable/enable an NPC to reset a broken one is a must have.
---
pwe dedicated servers, or pacifist mode to turn off any kind of pvp option
---
also, not all mmo's force players into pvp, like bethesda did with the slap damage; taking damage from another player should be something agreed 1st in some form; also an real incentive is needed to do pvp, not the lack of things to do for the end game players
---

Nothing can be compared to Scorchbeast queen giving you a legendary piece  nothing after a long fight when you've spent 300 .45 ammo on it. Sure, it drops dead, then it thinks for 5 mins and then the corpse disappears.

If they want to make an MMO, they have to start acting like one. You can't cut costs where you think you can
---
I'm with you OP. I don't care about min max or the best builds etc. I care about having fun and enjoying the games content my own way. In every online game I've played the min maxers are just always the most vocal. It's a turn off for most people who just want to play for fun. I wouldn't worry with them, just do your own thing and have fun. I hope...they wouldn't only take these people into account when moving forward with the game. 
---
Yeah, kindness is still cool, even if it‚Äôs old-cool. Helping someone out is also rewarding, in and of itself. 
---
Same here!
---
Change the game to a single player with invited co-op.  Put more monsters scattered around and not always sitting in the same place.  Have an actual beta where I would read the reports and actually fix them before release.
---
The problem isn't that it's buggy the problem is that at launch it was so buggy it was almost unplayable.. 
---
Ruggle, I have seen you make your point in this and other threads. Yes, Bethesda d(id say there would be always on PvP. The link you provided to the panel video (in a different thread i think), which I hadn't seen before, was informative. I would say that in that video Todd talks about an individual player killing another player, not teams of players exploiting loopholes in some of the mechanics to prey on entire servers. even so, your posts have been correct that those of us who were hoping for a FO game where we could COOP was enough for us to try to deny that PvP wasn't going to be as disruptive to us as it clearly has been, given the number of voices on reddit. Again, you're correct, they said it would be there, but, again based on the link you provided and my memories of a couple other interviews, they didn't really think it'd turn out quite this way. 
---
I chose to take a chance on this game because I wanted to believe it could still be enjoyed despite, not because of being always online. I dont play online games. I've given it a shot a few times and in the past and was simply just disgusted by people's frequent reversion to purile, base, and reprehensible behavior, simply due to the lack of accountability. I had naively hoped this experience would be better than my previous forays, and overall, until recently, it has been. Maybe this is the inevitable evolution of all online games with always on PvP. If so, that is disappointing as I'll simply leave the game. I figure at 400 hours, I've probably gotten my 60 bucks worth, but it isn't what i'd prefer to do. I'm sure I'm not alone in this sentiment, so Bethesda could either fragment the base, yes, and end up just left with those who enjoy the PvP aspect, or attempt to appease both camps and perhaps actually retain more of the player base who want PvE. This isn't a subscription game, so they've already got our money, so i'm sure they could care less at this point, but even as a PvE player, i could still be inclined to purchase from the atom store if the right items were presented. I could certainly be enticed into buy expansions if that was a thing, really no different that the DLCs for the previous games, which i bought all of. 
---
I think Bethesda has alot to answer for for this game: the bugs, the lack of content, the knee-jerk balancing reactions, the lack of thought about PvP elements, all of the merchandise crap (the rum, the bag, etc) so it isn't just the PvP that is frustrating, but it's more the last straw on the pile of everything else. 
---
Anyhow, yes, you are correct, Bethesda told us PvP would be there. I still believe we, as customers who did  pay for the game should feel free to express how we are frustrated. I think giving PvP its own space is the best solution at this point, be it other servers or specific map areas. I don't tihnk PvP should be abolished from FO76 entirely, but you can try to meet the needs of both camps of consumers. 
---
I think you mean u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
Isn't the unofficial patch managed by like 5 people or less... for free?
---
Bethesda as a company isn't strapped for cash, and chances are they have a minimum of 15+ people doing bug stomping
---
Good to see not everyone just kills on sight! Makes me hopeful for the future. 
---
Looking for company/community too, count me in if you find something which is fun, ign gergoe
---
Though I'm not really interested in the faction part (but must admit free states is the closest to my liking).
---
I have loads of agility (ap) and speed demon. Sometimes when i run too far away my game freeze. No vehicles!
---
 I think you're more booty tickled then the op is about 76. 
---
Didn't know that, I'll check it out! Thanks
---
I can help if you're on now. 
---
Which has been a self-fulfilling prophecy from the beginning.  The *only* feature in the game that's been implemented well is taking selfies, so you can post pictures to social media of all the atom-store-purchased cosmetic items you purchased for cold, hard currency.  
---
The entire game is a low-effort, cash-grab scam.  I feel bad for the developers that actually did give a shit about it, as the map, level, and creature design are all really good quality Fallout.  Bethesda management should fall on their swords.
---
I‚Äôm at work now until tonight 
---
It's such a great quest line. Up there with some of the best in past games. Shame it's inside such a troubled game.
---
And in Ocarina of Time you could wrong-warp from the start of the game to Ganon's Castle and complete the game in 5 minutes. But when Nintendo release a new Zelda game people don't go 'Oh boy, here comes another buggy mess'. Nintendo don't get in stage for game keynotes and lead off with jokes about how buggy their games are.
---
Whenever someone comes here to defend the state of the game it is always some rehashing of the 'No game is perfect therefore this imperfect game is acceptable'. No concept of scope of bugs or degrees of issues. Just the hardline 'Bug free is impossible so bug-ridden is expected'.
---
Ok, I could've sworn I got tagged doing a workshop defend a couple weeks back. I'll have to see if I can get another player to let me test on their camp/workshop. THanks for the response!
---
On this I disagree, it will soon be a little poorly made Fallout 4 singleplayer mod.
---
Or into loot boxes.. Yikes. I wouldn't want that boss to appear in FO76.
---
I realize that rifleman perks work on plasma rifles, pistol perks on pistols. But could we give some more love to energy wepaons and give them their own perks?  Maybe smth like lowering the enemy's resistance to energy by 10-30%.
---
&gt; The real thing is, as a RP player, you would have been happy with whatever multiplayer was provided, even if there was no last boss, no workshops, no nukes... Because doing RP doesn't require anything. 
---
That what I was wanting to say aswell. The world design is great and all, but the game lacks in so many other areas that I feel most of the critique of this subreddit is justified. 
---
Scorched conquerors should really have auto-grenade launchers or gatlings
---
Just give us everything that was available in fo4. Doesn't matter if it looks 200yrs old...everything already does. 
---
no, zero merit, this isn't sponge bob, we're not fighting sea creatures.
---
No. How would you expect someone to prove that he/she was attacked by 3 scorchbeasts and that they spent the whole time attacking with sonic blasts?
---
Clearly you got caught accusing someone of copying an old post and when the OP protested, rather than apologizing and saying that it sure sounded a lot like another post, you made the ridiculous assertion that the OP must be lying because he couldn't produce evidence of the event. 
---
I found a dead radstag with its head stuck in a locker last night. Do I have to screen shot it to discuss it?
---
And how do you know that an encounter is going to be noteworthy?  Should we stream our entire online sessions?
---
If the OP was copying and pasting from a previous post, put a specific sentence he uses in quotes and do a search for it. It should take you about a minute to find the original. 
---
If you ask me to *prove* I saw a radstag with its head in a locker, I can't. ... But it is absurd to say that my inability to prove it means that I made it up. 
---
That's why I said you're being idiotic. 
---
I really liked the fact that even though most of them were well over lvl 200, they were still enjoying the game. 
---
Got the entirety of Bethesda suckling my teats and it feels sooooo good
---
Yes oceans of varied feedback which makes building specifics to be addressed difficult. 
---
I have all 18 mutations and a few nights ago all of them just stopped working. I went to jump away from a wendigo and couldn't. It killed me and all my loot never dropped so I lost hours of scrap. I logged off.
---
Yeah it would. Like revered with Argent Dawn to craft the hammer of eternal doom, etc., in WoW?
---
Very cool. It would add a point to grinding. 
---
And if making it impossible to be on a good footing with two quarreling factions, you‚Äôd have organic separation of the player base into factions, based on fluff preferences and crafting abilities. 
---
Afraid the technology just isn't there yet.
---
Not sure how plugging a youtuber helps fallout when people here recommend fixes or report bugs but, I guess, keep on keeping on. 
---
It's a fine enough game for specific people and it could use polish and tape. 
---
HAHA.....he said "selling my physical copy for $20.00"....hahhahahahahhahaha...you can get them brand new on ebay for $9.99.
---
A game based mostly on gathering junk to survive will give ...well.. junk. 
---
It is what it is. 
---
I recall seeing a YT video where someone mentioned this issue with gulpers a couple weeks back. it wasn't the main point of the video, more of an aside though. If I can find it i'll post a link.

Jeez, looking at comments: this community is slowly beginning to look like a Star Citizen 2.0 case.

Buy recipe from modus medical bay not a lot of caps less than 500 I believe 
---
&gt; Anyhow, yes, you are correct, Bethesda told us PvP would be there. I still believe we, as customers who did pay for the game should feel free to express how we are frustrated. I think giving PvP its own space is the best solution at this point, be it other servers or specific map areas. I don't tihnk PvP should be abolished from FO76 entirely, but you can try to meet the needs of both camps of consumers.
---
You certainly are. And like you are doing now, many people did on day one. From my perspective the interesting thing is that people that were disgruntled 2 months ago, reviewers and normal players alike, were told soundly by this subreddit (based on overall sentiment, not just individual posts) to promptly fuck off and play something else, to stop complaining about what they bought because they were told by Bethesda what they were buying.
---
Prime Example: 'If you wanted human NPCs to make the game world feel more alive why did you buy a game where you were told there would be no human NPCs?'
---
So where is that sentiment now? Is this the looming of the 'I told you so' moment, where the fanbase at large is realising what the doomsayers had pegged from the start? Where are the highly upvoted posts on the front page saying that the game is exactly as advertised and anyone wanting PvE should just not have bought it? I know I'm certainly not reaping the same karma for pointing it out that was on offer 8 weeks ago for repeating Todd's words on NPCs.
---
I can give ya some at 1 cap apiece, also at work, hit me up later Gt TeamRagnar48
---
This game needs Muggy.
---
it's kind of annoying how people thought that what they did with yesterday's post was cool. i fucking love the game and im not at all bored with it or ready to quit - but be *real.* three months in with no vision of the future of final product? we're getting weekly updates, which sounds nice, except they have gotten to the point where the focus of the entire post is a single issue. weeks ago they said we would be getting full patch notes in these in advance of each upcoming patch. we can barely get them to comment on more than one issue. this post is objectively true, and it's a shame that people will defend even objectively poor decisions. you can still love, and be passionate about, the game while being realistic.  
---
That‚Äôs epic

66% upvoted. I'm not a roleplayer, but I support the game.

Maybe don't promote youtubers though. No way to tell i it's self promotion.

It's really early in the morning, so if I seem grumpy I don't mean it that way.

Was playing for the cooperative gameplay, but there is no content. After playing The Division 2 beta I dont know if ill come back to fallout come March. If all Bethesda has to compete is a pvp server by then my friends and just wont have anything to do
---
that's rather disturbing...
---
You guys on PC?
---
If so, drop your ign. My RP group will pop into your world and start some drama. 
---
We'll do your quests. You can try ours if you want, then we can kill eachother. Or not kill eachother. Depending on our choices of course!
---
Maybe:
---
1. Start over with a new character and actually follow the story line rather than what I'm guessing is power levelling, or
---
2. Stop playing the game and spend more time with your wife. She seems like a smart lass.
---

I've got word of a game publisher that needs our help....
---
God no more perks. I already don't have enough points to build a proper build. It's best to just buff their damage overall.
---
Would you be able to link me to this? Id love to see it
---
God I stood up for this game for the longest time, but I just absolutely hate it now. This game is literally a joke and it‚Äôs obvious the deva have just let it go. It‚Äôs not fun it‚Äôs repetitive. And honestly I always stood up for this game when my friends would call it bad, until I opened my eyes and realized it was just the same thing over and over again. There‚Äôs nothing exciting that happens like in fallout 4, Fallout 76 is a shell of a game and we should all be pissed Bethesda gave us this disappointment of a game.
---
Coming from a previous fanboy, try not to downvote me
---
[Mysteriously disappers](https://youtu.be/VpoDJf6PcKk)
---
Still playing, fan of the Fallout series and enjoying the world they crafted.  
---
Could be I don't really keep track though I do respect their work.
---
Bethesda as a company might not be strapped for cash but they still budget out for yearly expenses.  The idea they will throw unlimited cash at anything is pure fantasy.
---
Considering how mod makers will go though multiple versions of their mods. And the fact players threw a shit fit over updates causing additional problems.  The idea that the community modders would do such a better job then Bethesda is just silly. 
---
I was previously a fan boy myself. 
---
I never see mine on anymore either. One here and there, but not like it used to be. Seems when I do run into any player though they question why they are still playing the game and have a bad attitude about it. I'm still having fun though
---
That does sound alluring...
---
That's some minmaxing, fair enough. Wish MythBusters would do an episode explaining why a rocket-power sledgehammer is a dangerously bad idea.
---
I believe it was Assorted Lights
---
No, the complete opposite actually. It should be a solid pvp survival game, with parties and whatnot and not fucking build limit.
---
Basically Rust.
---
They ruined this by adding the retardo pvp system and catering to the casuals that wont play the game.
---
Also what fucking pve are you talking about? There's no fucking pve in this game.
---

I thought about getting it for playstation but I don't have playstation plus and I don't want to pay extra to be able to play.

Try that.  Shows the two lights in the elegant light set.  So you know what to look for.

I would fight a giant loot box, that explodes into castle beds.
---
well, an NV fan (the most obnoxious type) definitely would. I had to look him up, then Helios one, to jog my memory.
---
This is easily my favourite major side quest in Fallout 76. The whole thing is really well done, and makes the absolute most of the "notes and tapes" storytelling format of the game. It's also pretty coherent compared to some of the other similar content, which sometimes feels a bit scattered. 
---
Sadly, I sold the sword and pistol because I was desperate for stash space about a day before I heard about the upcoming stash increase :-( 
---
By Harpers Ferry a place called sonny brothers(I think) to the west has mutfruit tatos  razorgrain gourds wood fertilizer sometimes a PA will spawn
---
i hope we get some content before then. i don't think this game could survive a dry spell like that with the state of everything.
---
I don't follow the update info, but I really like the game. I play it much more casually than everyone in this sub, but I'm still having fun.
---
Dude. The tse nerf was done and accepted cuz of duping. We all had to change around our builds to adapt with the nerf. It took most tse users a good 10 to 20 levels to move points around and buy new perk cards. another nerf over what we had would be too much, given that most players using the following builds had to buy the proper weapons and equipment to suit the build. This time, duping didn't inflate the market with easy to buy stuff, so the value of said gear costed loads of caps and effort. What you are suggesting would not only increase bullet sponges and reduce fun, but it would be screwing over players of the nerfed builds twice at this point, adding a wide range of melee users to the mix.
---
Your suggestion doesn't even add balance, you are just replacing current meta with a new one and making the game more spongey, which would take more ammo and repairs, which also means more junk trips just to clear one location.
---
put your glasses on, it says PS4
---
Can you put the terminal on a rug and glitch it into a table?
---
I was a melee build up to level 150 then Switched to heavy build and have so much ammo
---
care to spoil it for someone who vaguely remembers that but not really?  was that one of the black ops, because the first one was total shit, think maybe I liked 2 a bit more.
---
&gt;I have began to think they really have no determined direction for the game
---
this was my biggest takeaway from this blog tbh. it's not just today's post either. the past couple weeks have been leading up to this, so many were hoping there would be something meaty for us to dig our teeth into. instead we got mention of a single aspect of the game that had issue (which had been identified and harped on from the very start) and more vague promises for the future. it's very concerning.
---
the longer they delay revealing what they have in mind for the vaults, the further they exacerbate the situation as well. not trying to be cynical, but there was a realistic post in the past week that pointed out that the vaults will prob just be raid dungeons and nothing more, adding only a small margin of content. while that isn't a fact yet, if it does end up being true, and they continue keeping people on the line, there is going to be *major* backlash. like, *irreversible* backlash, and it wont recover unless they do a hard reset/reboot. the last thing they should be doing is birdboxing their most loyal and dedicated players through this process. we need some real transparency.
---
One of the best questlines imo. 
---
a quote from what?
---
Unerf TSE guns (or buff guns in general) so enemies really die to bullets again instead of being bullet spounges and put a pvp server with disabled legendary affixes. In PvE no one is obligated to use a weapon they deem too strong to play as it is in pvp. Problem solved.
---
Someone needs to file a missing persons report for Pete Hines.6
---
I prefer melee now. I never knew the damage that could be done before patch 5
---
Hand full of enemies represent 90% of what I kill.

Hello! Thank you for your post, and for your feedback. We want you to know that we're always looking through posts, tweets, and comments for any and all feedback on the game. We truly appreciate you reaching out to us, and letting us know your thoughts, concerns, ideas, and giving us an idea of what you're looking for.

Yah I used it to Level my mules from 40 to 50, ironically until yesterday.  I had a 35 Mr handy saw drop with Anti-Armor, 40% speed and something else.  At 200% nothing lives past 5 seconds and that's with out perks!  (But being mules their strength is stupid high)
---
Had a crazy amount of replies but you are the most recent, so. Fireproof did nothing a month ago, they knew what they were adding to the game when they changed it to prevent explosive damage. They arent going to nerf it 
---
for the belly of the beast quest just run and grab the objective then run out of the place. its not really cheating just think of it as tactically retreating
---
fo3 was better. bathe me in downvotes, you obnoxious wankers.
---
Why is?
---
On the 7th, there‚Äôs 3 more weeks in the month.
---
Where? 
---
That's cool and all and as someone who honestly isn't trying to be the most broken build ever getting into the level 75+ range is just filled with bullet spongy enemies so much so that my meh shotgun and all-American break after clearing out one location and there's no way to solo the game at that point... I also finished the main quest so what RPing is there left to do?
---
Yeah it was fun along the way but you can't never outright denied the issues in the game while playing because there are a lot of problems and crappy patches and lame ISV don't help to fix them.
---
thnx will check it out
---
&gt; Actually, the weapon damage is decoupled from the individual weapons in F76's omod entries, so it's a little weirder. The way the weapons inherit their stats comes from generic modules, so changing one ends up changing a whole class of weapons, is just a little weird.
---
I've suspected something like this is going on when I was doing some in-game testing with the Scorched Killer's Receiver. That each receiver for a ballistic weapon modifies the damage curve based on the standard receiver as opposed to just having a hardcoded damage value. Knowing what little I do about how energy weapons apply their damage differently I can see what you're saying.
---
I don't know the complexity of the engine or the priorities of Bethesda so it's just frustrating to see this issue unresolved for so long.
---
Are you sure? The wiki doesn't mention this.
---
I'm just told you EBAY
---
Yea I loaded up YEARS worth when it was like $30/year or less that one black friday
---
eBay usually do it cheap
---
Idk, I‚Äôll try tho thanks 
---
I think we should make a petition to get everyone to stop playing the game. They aren‚Äôt even sorry. Let‚Äôs stop playing their shit game. 
---
Weird... Cheapest I see is $19.97.
---
I was going to different vendors and the cap limit was always 200 across the board. Now if I was hitting all Responders Vendors, IDK. I thought each Vendor had 200 caps limit so it sounds like you're saying their grouped.
---
Not that it matters, since there's nothing worth spending the money on anyway.
---
If you look at what Bethesda did since launch and  you say that We have come far then fuck me we sre all screwed. 
---
You are saying that it scrapped bulk scrap that was in your stash?  Are you sure?  Because I find that a little hard to believe, since when doing a scrap all junk, it has never scrapped stuff in my stash before.
---
you see im stuck at the part where i follow those transponder radios 
---
3 scorchbeasts. what am i suppose to do i cant kill nor outrun all those things 
---
They planned to autopilot this game as a live service with a skeleton crew from the very beginning. They have no real talent left on the team to pound out the real problems in timely fashion.
---
Don‚Äôt know how familiar you are with it, but search rug glitch on YouTube, the techniques used in fallout 4 still work for me mostly in 76. 
---
Fallout 76 did something right for once
---
It made Polygon finally tell the truth
---
Amazing
---
&gt;Play any decent MMO, and show me where you can 1-2 hit any mob equal to, or above (yes, because any player level over 50 means jackshit), max player level.
---
50 players on the server is not MMO. The basis of the Fallout gameplay ‚Äî grind. Grinding games are usually built on the fact that you kill crowds of enemies. And the whole point of such games is to minimax the grind process. Path of Exile, Warframe, Diablo‚Ä¶ Fallout 76 is not the World of Warcraft, not at all. We kill the enemies, to get armor and weapons, to kill the enemies again, to get the best armor and weapons, to kill the enemies again. There are no bosses here. No raids. Only crowds of enemies who need to be killed.
---
Unless you go melee (what is an absurd as melee in fps games SUCKS) you are screwed. Enemies are spounge bullets in this game, its pointless to use a gun unless you want to feel weak. Nothing kills more the mood of a First person SHOOTER than guns that do NO damage.
---
After they nerfed the only gun that actually killed stuff like a gun would (the legendary guns with TSE afix) I just stopped bothering with the game. My 50 cal that was actually cool to use and felt like a gun you put in a vehicule became a joke, enemies that I could kill with a couple of shots now take a full clip to take to half health.
---
What kind of weapons do you use and are you into chems? 
---
This gotta be satire, right?  Especially the bolded grateful and the stupid salutation at the end. 
---
&gt; Bethesda you need to know something. You were the Gold standard of gaming. The pinnacle. 
---
I think this ended around the third re-release of Skyrim.
---
That's what I need to do.  Keep an eye out for the sales.
---
I promise you it did, I'm so over encumbered and no plastic left to re bulk. 
---
Thanks 
---
Do nothing.
---
Write a season of "Bomb Shelter" blogs being very clear that a) you are actively listening, b) really appreciate all the suggestions, and c) have something exciting to announce soon!
---
In what world do you fail reading comprehension? Free - I paid for my game, I don't know about you but mine was fifty quid (that's $10,000 in US Dollars btw) - they already made millions from the game so they can go fuck themselves and work for their money which they obviously didn't do since FO76 is probably the shittest made game in gaming history.
---
Ok, I see your point.  But for those who do not have Skyrim, then its good for the new release.  Also keep in mind, they released FREE updates for textures.   Plus you also got bug fixes as well.  No one forced anyone to spend more money for another copy of Skyrim.  But it kept selling.  I do not fault them at all for releasing it over and over if it keeps selling.  &lt;shrug&gt;
---
So not sure where you say "Instead they tweaked the graphics a little and held out their hand for another $60".   I have all the high quality graphics updates and never paid another dime.
---
Now I want the VR verision and I am willing to pay more money for that because its really different on controls and environment, so not counting that.
---
They gave all the updates to people just fine.
---
This whole comment is pathetic af. Instead of providing a good counter-argument you INSTANTLY go for the personal insults, and then insult everyone else that don't agree with your opinion. 
---
This may be the most pathetic "rebuttal" I have ever seen.
---
lol Shit game to shit game, but the difference here is one is at least playable. Kudo's to Bungie for at least making a game we can reliably play. 
---
Yeah, since BETA melee is the way to go to kill stuff in this game what is both an absurd and boresome as there is nothing worse than melee in fps games (hence so few games that relly heavily into that for first person games). The only time guns actually felt like guns was during the pre nerf TSE guns, ony ones that worked until the recent patch that ruined them.
---
Stand still and 1.5 seconds later you're invisible. Firing a weapon removes the cloak, and 1.5 seconds later you're invisible again.
---
The most powerful part of invisibility is that you are untargetable in vats.  Cloaking armor + chameleon armor will help drastically in pvp as most players have no aim and a non-vats supersledge is easily dodged.
---
Imo, the chameleon mutation is best for pve snipers with patience and single shot weapons.  Stealthy armor weight reduction only effects pve.
---
Although I have won a pvp battle or two simply because i could stand and shoot invisibly.
---
What platform? PC, Xbox, PS4 
---
That is awesome looking.  Put them in the mire have a field of them but they are not all alive maybe have them randomly sprint up and attack the player as they go by.
---
It shows those bugs aren‚Äôt nearly as big of a deal as they seem if so many people don‚Äôt mind them. Many people have played Skyrim for years still going with no mods. In fact most do. Same with every other ES and FO game under there name. 
---
Pretty sure you can skip the Transponders and just go to Glass Caverns and finish it.  The transponders just lead you there with some backstory.
---
It also sounds like you are very low level, still running around in Raider Armor, can't imagine you have much in terms of weaponry.
---
Talk to your console manufacturer about supporting unsigned code and 3rd party mods.
---
Yea 2013 black friday was sweet.
---
Once I heard you could stack them I went gangbusters haha
---
Definitely got enough to cover the entire lifespan of ps4 and into ps5
---
I've reported a similar occurance. my items vanished 3 times now. a legendary armor once.
---
I hope this gets traction because these disappearing bugs should be their top priority. if they're going to fix one bug, let it be this.
---
loot we farmed for weeks randomly getting deleted is unacceptable.
---
Same here, would be happy to help.

I installed No Man's Sky after wiping out 76. Put more hours into it as well.

Excellent point. Businesses are in business, to make money, not keep customers happy. If a business can make the profit it needs from a good/service, they may feel they accomplished their goal. Not saying it‚Äôs the case with BGS, but likely is. They may not feel obligated to maintain high quality after launch when they realized how many issues existed, including merchandise. 
---
It‚Äôs also entirely possible that ‚Äúyes men‚Äù stand between players and top management. Decision makers may be getting filtered info. If they put someone on Reddit to monitor player feedback and that person/team is selective about what rolls up, top dogs really may not know our long-lasting concerns. If we complain there‚Äôs no end content, management may hear monsters are boring. 
---
I‚Äôm not cutting BGS slack or defending them. However, it is very common to find this filtering in organizations. Could be why they‚Äôve ignored our biggest concerns since BETA. 
---
It's not like there's actually cross play. Because again, your console manufacturer didn't want it.
---
Well, it‚Äôs not cross platform, so there‚Äôs zero advantage they get over any console players.
---
Adios.

That and the ability to snap it to the left or right of a floor piece, not just straight up the middle. I used to use those half stairs to make a U-shaped kinda stairs. Only took up one foundation square of space. Dug the hell out of that in Fallout 4. 
---
Fallout being better on pc is not news... 
---
I'd agree with you if there was crossplay. But everyone you play with on console has the same restrictions, so it doesn't really affect you. 
---
Consoles and PC have different game servers.
---
In addition to mods, players on the PC have another monstrous advantage: a keyboard and mouse. I propose to prohibit playing the game with the mouse and keyboard, let them buy controllers for the PC.
---
In addition, computers can be with different characteristics, including those that are more powerful than consoles. It is necessary to prohibit those who have too good computers from playing the game.
---
Seriously, what are you counting on? Players on the PC have no advantage, as they CAN'T COMPETE with players on consoles. These are two different worlds. If you knew that there would be no mods on the console, why didn't you buy the game for the PC?
---
i think level 32 is pretty high
---
but scorchbeasts are just broken af
---
These fake sob stories are getting worse and worse. I'd rather listen to Rose all day then read another one of these fake made up stories. 
---
I agree with PVP not being the greatest in this game and as for being so hated I have no clue ü§£ I'll be farming events or running around the map getting materials and plans and all of a sudden there's a player who starts shooting me as soon as they see me and before I can even react I'm below half health, my gear and character isn't terrible either. So it's not like I have bad resistances etc
---
This too! Like, a couple variants to brick walls that‚Äôs double-sided. One that‚Äôs just the white texture on both sides and the other just brick on both sides. 
---
Set some traps around the crops and hide in chameleon and wait for a thief and jump pit and say don‚Äôt eat my taters!!

---
Rad Worms amplifiy mutation effect and some others. Apparently Rad Worms buff Bloody mess. Tested it several times now.
---
If you cure Rad Worms, it nullifies the effects pretty much. You can only relog to fix it. 
---
No. You cant eat any dead humans, weird right? You can usually blow their heads off with a gun though.
---
So FO4 at launch was more or less unplayable then after patches still had to save every 5min to prepare for crashes. Thier games have always been buggy. When I check my PS4 blue screen history it's almost entirely Fallout games. 
---
The fixes don‚Äôt seem that hard from my perspective. 
---
-Make the survival needs more like NV or even Fo4, I should have to pack ten bowls of soup and 13 waters to stay well fed and hydrated for thirty minutes to an hour of game time. The radiation must have given super metabolisms. 
---
While at it, go back to NV‚Äôs condition wear and tear, I don‚Äôt have the numbers but it felt like NV, your guns would wear out at a much more reasonable pace but maybe that‚Äôs because the game wasn‚Äôt 24/7 enemies. Regardless I think it needs some rebalance given that there‚Äôs enemy mobs every ten steps.
---
-up the stash and budget limit for more use of all the junk we find. While at it, fix scrapper to what it was in fo4. Real odd that they made it worse in a game that‚Äôs more junk intensive. I‚Äôd like to get something worth a shit from scrapping weapons and armor. 
---
Basically all I want is for the game to be less grindy so 
---
In-game polling would be amazing. They shouldn't rely on any external sources.

nice..i have been playing around with it a bit today..now all i have to do is lose 200 lbs..iv been in excavator since birth
---
Well, this is the "end" mission.  And (in reality) level 50 is the max level (beyond that is just perk juggling).
---
A level 32 with raider power armor (Maybe get some T51b?  I think that is level 30) isn't doing much against level 50-65 Scorch Beasts (obviously).
---
lol...sounds like a plan
---
You‚Äôre wasting your time defending a game that won‚Äôt even support its own player base fam. They won‚Äôt even put the time in for you
---
I take the jackpot one time. It gave me a camp plan , a weapon mod, junk (mostly all junk that you can melt from minerals) and many   different minerals
---
I was MATE I've never turned it off because PVP in this game isn't the greatest and it's not what I enough playing this game for. 
---
You don't play against people on PC, so your argument is invalid.
---
My name is Sadie and I am happy to be of service. I am an AI chat bot that doesn't give one hot shit about your issue. Grrrr... our game sucks.  I definitely see how this could be frustrating! Not to worry, we are here to help.

Learn the mechanics.
---
Also, post your IGN so we can be on the lookout and take your caps
---
Ideas are cheap, and I can guarantee you that every single idea that has come up here also came up during development. Feel free to disagree with the devs about *which* ideas should have got the development time and budget, but a lack of ideas is never the limiting factor. 
---
are you using the enforcer perk card w/ shotgun to take out their legs?
---
Yeah, they will probably learn from that... FO76 might be dead, but hey Fallout 5's co-op multiplayer will be good, riight!?
---
first i would need some luck cause all i find is A. frame with a low power fusion core B. armor that somehow still isnt my level
---
this sub is lost in negativity, all normal guys went to filthy casuals.
---
This is what makes me so sad :( The game world is unbelievably cool, the monsters are intimidating and interesting. But the game play itself is so unbelievably boring. I don't know why they didn't just do it right. :|
---
They never cared. That's how fallout 76 even exists 
---
Jesus, yes. So much backseat game design in this sub. 
---
I tend to agree here, what happened to listening to all of our feedback? Why is water being consumed like we are all type 1 diabetics? Why are bosses and legionaries still disappearing and leaving no loot? Why do scorchbeasts follow me and others like a star-struck stalker? There is plenty to already be addressed without adding more to your list....
---
I see no problem with that
---
If cross-play ever comes into effect, let's discuss it. Until this, stop being so sour about it. It doesn't affect you in the slightest and if it does, that's more on you than the mods.
---
Mods have made the game so much more playable on PC with stuff like better inventory management and perk loadouts. It'd be nice if it were in-game for everyone but let's not take away a good thing just because you can't have it.
---
Too much. 5 atoms, take it or leave it.
---
Meanwhile I'm in the same boat as you with Overwatch, I can hop in there but I find myself before because of the lack of things to do. I don't know what you're doing to encounter bugs in 76, I've played a decent amount and the only bug I ever encountered that affected my gameplay was the power armor bug but after the fix a couple of weeks back I haven't encountered it again.
---
Only because it's a 'live service' or in other words, an open, multiplayer game, it doesn't mean you can play the game endlessly with new content all the time.
---
If you ever played any theme park MMO like WoW, you'd know that there are periods where there's nothing to do in the game because you've accomplished everything, and I feel this is the case here with OP, the feeling of nothing more to accomplish.
---
There'll hopefully be more, fresh content that will give new and old players reason to visit the game again, but that isn't now.
---
Yeah, sorry its not fallout 5 and you apparently don't like mmo lite games. Congratulations, you don't like the genre, stop taking it out on the sub with these QQ posts.
---
Lol. Git neked!
---
so many known recipes. single action ivory handle anyone?
---
So its interesting, I have added 10 or so in the last month. Was excited over this because I hadnt had any in game until now. But I havent really seen any of them since or even talked with them since. Oh well just the way it is I guess, I enjoy playing the game solo but it would be nice to have a few to run with for some of the bigger things I need to get through....
---
Even harder if you live in Australia. I cant find anyone to play with
---
&gt;	They complain here all the time that things were rushed, then expect a rush fix.
---
This sub in a nutshell. 
---
Wake up, Bethesda you're talking about, the one that gave us Morrowind, Skyrim and Fallout 4, doesn't have anything to do with Fallout 76. This game was made by some [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda\_Game\_Studios\_Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin) . It doesn't have anything in common with Bethesda except for the name. 
---
It wasn't a bug. A bug is unintentional, the lever action was designed to do a full reload animation. That's why it was so fast.
---
That's why when modders took it upon themselves to address this in Fallout 4 they had to many whole new animations. The was no animation for anything but 5 bullets.
---
It didn't look right, because it didn't behave how most people expected, but it worked perfectly as it was designed to.
---
&gt; on. Always have tons of them and never had to farm them. Great for any build while exploring.
---
I use Pharma Farma and I am way over the number of Stimpaks I need. I currently have about 402 and some of you have run into my nurse character running through Flatwoods giving Stimpaks, Rad-X, and RadAway away. I have probably given out more than a 1000 of each. I just dropped off 50 of each twice in Flatwoods in a 1 hour period.
---
The other perk card I have that goes hand-in-hand with Pharma Farma is **Can Do!**. It works like Pharma Farma and has a 40% chance of finding extra food in containers at rank 1. At rank 3, it is 80%. I only have rank 1, and it works fine. 
---
The other day I had more than 600 Stimpaks and 200 Super Stims. I just went into the various train stations and dropped them off. I have about 50 Super stims now. They weigh too much and I never use them since the Stimpaks and diluted Stimpaks seem to handle all of the cases. 
---
I know I should just drop some more of it including food, but it just so hard to do it. It's like doing Spring cleaning. 
---
The reason I believe I end up with so many is also because I can use food to heal, and I have regenerating combat armor when I am not in PA.
---
Even a little south (very little) of sonny is water for boiled water which has a lot of brain fungus the house usually has a recipe under the counter 
---
Oh and another thing..... Why does a scorched that shoots at you with a gun, have a pitchfork on it when you loot it? Where is the gun and ammo???
---
Ah, yes, I see, you might be right! =]
---
So any level 8 with a level 1 hazmat suit who shows up and pings it with one bullet should get a 5-star legendary?
---
A week of waiting for 'communication' and they give us "we're listened to your feedback" about something that was obvious from day 1. They mention fixing loot from SBQ to allow variety in plans dropped (finally) then say they will look at implementing something to make her loot feel more legendary IN THE FUTURE. Then it's basically "tell us what you think" and a bunch more "IN THE FUTURE" crap.
---
To summarise it - tell us what you think and we'll do things IN THE FUTURE. Yeah, I'm done. I said it before but wanted to see what this would address at least. There's no mention of the terrible patch 5, no apology for the mess it added to the garbage pile, nothing. The community managers are doing a thankless job while the game burns to the ground. Whoever is responsible for all of this should ultimately pay a heavy price. It's a failure of leadership, a failure of planning, everything.
---
Hey Bethesda here are some free tips for you. Your game is a massive mess NOW. It needs to be fixed NOW. Issues need to be addressed urgently NOW. If you don't then there won't be any players left IN THE FUTURE. There's your damn feedback. Honestly, it's insulting they ask for feedback because even a second or two looking at this subreddit is enough to see a lot of feedback. Good luck to anyone trying to stay with all of this.
---
sentinal table lamp bitcheeeeessssssssss
---
Whine to Bethesda about making an UI that's garbage and forgetting the most basic features of online games. Quality of Life features.
---
And while you are complaining to them don't forget to mention that ANY mods that get released for consoles are made on friggin PCs in the first place. 
---
I wanted to, but it was so expensive. Been waiting for a deal, but it never got more than 40/50 % off.... I want, like, 70/80% ahahaha =]]
---
Ummm, whaaa?
---
thnx yeh just found the recipe..known..mirelurk something or other
---
I tried adding the rank 1 +10% damage with shotguns perk and the displayed damage didn't change.
---
all i read is a bunch of crying. if your sooooo unhappy with your console why dont you give your console to your little brother/sister and buy yourself a pc. i cant believe what im reading no one forced you to use a console for fallout and it has always been clear that console isnt as ego shooter friendly as a pc. now for the last point consoles have one advantage the maintain costs are low. we pc users must buy atleast every 2 years a grafic card that costs more then your console soooo for the love of god your comparison between pc and console is the real bullshit here.
---
Murphy's Law isn't to expect the unexpected.  Murphy's Law tells you EXACTLY what to expect: that everything that possibly can go wrong will go wrong and at the worst possible time and in the worst possible way.

How about some legendary scorched? I never see a legendary scorched enemy. Since scorched are the raiders they are common as hell but damn if I've seen a legendary scorched and I've played since beta.
---
lol..guess i better empty the junk..outta my trunk
---
Lol yep it was crap.
---
Glad i managed to sold this trash.
---
Yeah there just isn‚Äôt much to do at this point. I think we all just wish this game was more than it was
---
I did it solo too. It is hard, but doable. You will use a lot of Stimpaks, ammo, and possibly break some weapons. However it is possible. I have a house in Watoga now, and if I see someone over there doing that quest, I will join them to help. It is easier with assistance.
---
This is especially true at lower levels.
---
&gt;	3* Legendaries should drop 3* Legendaries. Loot should be commensurate to the expenditure of killing the creature. 
---
I‚Äôve killed plenty of 3-star ghouls in Whitespring and none took more than a few headshots, so...
---
Yep, exactly. The chameleon armor activates when you are crouched and not moving. Only deactivates if you stand or move.
---
Had the same issue last night and again this morning. Marsupial was definitely not working.
---
If you play this game and try to have fun you very well can if you play this game to complain you very well can even though we have heard it all I choose to have fun my 650 hrs says I am üòÄüëç
---
This is how we end game.
---
ahh nice..i have the mutation..but when i fire my weapon i become visible
---
I'm level 143 still having a blast with lots o the map left to discover. I'm sorry if you guys allowed "helpers" to ruin your game experience by loading you up with overpowered weapon and serums early on. 
---
Level 32 is really low for this part of the game
---
Self.Nuclearshowerthoughts
---
Welcome to the uninstalled club friend. Check out Apex Legends. You'll instantly have more fun in 5 minutes than in the 400+ hours of Fallout 76.
---
What a waste of a potentially bad ass game that 76 could have been. Their legal team is being hit with all sorts of lawsuits in February. They have bigger problems to worry about right now. Funding coming from the atom shop of course.
---
FO 4 NEVER crashed for me. The problem is not the bugginess, it's the fact that this is an online game and also that the devs seem to be incompetent to fix even simple bugs. Now, it might not be their fault because the engine is like 1000000 yrs old and was not designed for multiplayer/online play at all but from the outside it seems like they are either incompetent or don't care at all. Couple that with the fact that mods are not supported and now even the community cannot fix Bethesda's shit. All their other games survived so long, because modders fixed their shit. Not the devs, the community.
---
Them and Bioware in the old days. 
---
Oh I've been playing, it's what reminded me of what a good game looks like. Pathfinder is my favorite! 
---
Are you saying you got to level 157, hit all of the achievements yet didn't get your money's worth?
---
That's who I'm rocking!  Best of luck!
---
They didn't give you this game, you had to buy it. There's no need to be "*grateful*" for this low-effort cash grab, especially to a billion dollar corporation.
---
It's not like they stopped any cheating with this game either lol
---
Nice! May the grapples be in your favor!
---
Lol, I was thinking that 76's development  was like watching a dog slamming into a glass patio door. First few times it is funny. A few times after that and you feel bad. If it keeps happening after that you start to worry that it has significant brain damage.
---
nobody buys grafic cards bc they don't exist 
---
You brought some valid points to your discussion, I especially liked how in depth your points were put and explained them fully with adequant connotations.
---
always! I will send a DM when I get off work!
---

---
I removed the science expert perk point and made Ghoulish 3-star instead of 2. Other than that, I think it‚Äôs a pretty solid build! I was actually considering doing this and ran a search for it and found this post. 
---
Nice work!
---
That's a rather immature argument isin't it? Let's apply the same reasoning to something else...
---
 *It shows those racists aren‚Äôt nearly as big of a deal as they seem if so many people don‚Äôt mind them* 
---
MLK stood up against that - it's not about what people "mind" and you're argumentation is simplistic.
---
For a start, people don't have a choice but to put up with it and people can put up with quite a lot. Your argument is they don't mind - I'm pretty sure they do mind or in your world, if they were asked they would all say to keep the bugs in - of course they wouldn't and nobody believes that stupidity for a second.
---
Secondly, it says Bethesda is a 2nd rate video game producer incapable of releasing working games and yet they charge AAA prices for their games. Other game company's manage to release working products perfectly fine - Bethesda are that incompetent they can't be arsed to bother with any QA - that and they like keeping more of the money whilst you get a shittier product.
---
Thirdly, you conflate your statistics - 30 million bought the game - ok, and 86% of those were for console according to this ([https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/615805-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/64542105](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/615805-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/64542105)) so let's do the maths...
---
30,000,000 - 86% = 4.2 million which is 24% of the player base which is quite a significant number. Your reasoning also fails to take into account people that can actually mod a game and have the technical know-how on doing that.
---
You also fail to take into account the people that played it a little and dropped it because it was buggy or didn't interest them enough to finish it which would then increase the percentage of players that did mod the game.
---
just remember they are random items that are consumables now for a temporary effect. they spawn in from time to time
---
A lot of this "feedback" is absolutely terrible and Bethesda should ignore it though.
---
Is the rad worms bug related to power armor pieces unequipping? My excavator torso is always unequipped whenever I put my armor on/back on. Bugs the living hell out of me especially when I‚Äôm surrounded by enemies.
---
I don't want to believe the atom shop is making money. It is so incredibly low effort and lackluster, they shouldn't be rewarded for that.
---
Good idea. I'll be sure to pass it on to the Devs.
---
Missed the chance for "bright idea" 
---
So like did they die like 5 seconds before the quest or did their corpses just sit for like 12 years in the same place without rotting? 
---
Problem is sifting through all the garbage with all the valid stuff.
---
TSE whiners they can no longer "play" the game now even though their weapon still does 189% dmg which is still OP and outdamages any other weapon in the game of that type (without perks involved, just straight damage). 
---
Others that want stuff easier for them to get Screws/Springs/Ect and store those in huge piles of 10000 materials in their camp.
---
Others that believe the game should be molded to only their playstyle for a feature.  Be it PVP or building or collecting.
---
Only thing Bethesda should really listen to is the bug reports. 
---
Well, there is always the middle ground of allowing an increase in the player cap if transitioning from Bethesda owned servers.  "Offline mode" could just be someone playing on a private "locked" server.  While this does away with server hopping, I would argue this would make this **more** of an online game than it is right now.
---
It could also solve the pvp VS non-pvp argument if they allowed people to make/join/find a server type they were comfortable with. (if they went that way)
---
This opens up a whole can of worms though. Things like character progress not following players unless they somehow saved your character and had official type servers.  (otherwise people can just join a server with xp/drops jacked up and move around). A small part of the charm of this game is the ability to server hop to reset some things.  Maybe allow servers with the same official mods/settings to cluster together and function kinda like it does now?  Who knows.  As a complete outsider I have not even the slightest idea if this even viable on the engine they use. 
---
It's a lot of work, and definitely not perfect. I just don't think the current game and development avenue is sustainable with how things are being handled. I feel something needs to change based on community feedback and my own experiences.
---
yes, but wouldn't they (Bethesda) be responsible by-proxy? They handed off the IP to a new team to the family and let them go at it.
---
I'm assuming your on PC they didn't allow mods on ps4 for a long time.
---
For ¬£10 sure
---
Depends on what you expect from it
---
Do u have friends that play it?
---
naahh...the hotfix would change it to -200
---
It broke my heart too. I now shoot every raider corpse in the face just in case they were involved.   I never liked raiders to begin with and now I have an even better reason 
---
Cost 200 atoms. Ftfy
---
This is too ridicuspurious to be in earnest. Isn't it?
---
This
---
fantastic...
---
Then please try roleplaying as a tech specialist using laser weapons and see how that goes for you.
---
Kinda shows the game is abandonware at this point. All honesty let loose a mod tool kit with private server options and just let the community fix the problems, just like with every other bethesda game.
---
I do happen to know others that play the game. But they say that it is broken?
---
 *makes me question why should we tell you which monsters we enjoy fighting:*  
---
TSE's only got nerfed because of places like Reddit. We know the devs don't play their own game, that much is blatantly obvious so yeah, everyone zip it LOL 
---
I thought that was partly what reddit was for....
---
Yes but I purchased it at half price. By today's standards, even that's expensive but aside from the bugs and some very frustrating aspects to the game, there are some great story lines, a few good characters and a lot of things to explore.
---
If you like Fallout 4, then you'll probably like this game too.
---
Just either wait a month or so to see if things settle in terms of patches/bug fixes or whether it goes off the rails entirely (more so than it already has).
---
Thanks, I did end up getting the serum from the poster above. Gave it to me for free, cause she‚Äôs nice like that. 
---
It‚Äôs a broken mess but it‚Äôs enjoyable if you set goals and know what you want to do. 
---
Say something like ‚Äòtoday I‚Äôm going to explore the mire‚Äô and tomorrow ‚ÄòI‚Äôm farming the ‚Äòsprings‚Äô 
---
And you‚Äôll have more fun.
---
It didn't work this way in FO4. You still even took extra damage from standing in water in the Glowing Sea.
---
&gt; Why is it that if I am playing with a friend and want to place my C.A.M.P. down next to theirs I go alllllllll the way out as far as I need to only for it to be not able to be placed the next time I join with them?
---
I think it's improved a ton. I've never had to grind- I just do quests and dungeons when I feel like it. Admittedly, I'm not in it for the top gear or whatever, I just like finding new locations and stories, so maybe that helps. Regardless, I think it's worth another try. They completely got rid of being stuck in one faction's zones. You can travel anywhere on the map now (aside from EPs) and stuff scales to your level. 
---
I mean. Look at the condition the game was in at launch. Howard's claim that the game having NO NPCs was a feature was the biggest scam. The game was unfinished and that was their line to cover the fact that they were rushing it to market regardless.   
---
They don't care. They're just fixing it enough to not get sued. 
---
If only you could scrap it for 100 lead scrap, would totally be worth it.
---
the council of supreme redditors are quite displeased, they yet again didn't read our minds on precisely what we wanted to be addressed.
---
No I was on ps4. I realize that, but now they do. Fortunately I never ran into game breaking bugs in FO4 but I realize there were a lot. 
---
Just when you‚Äôre close to killing it, it‚Äôll regenerate by draining your Atoms. You gain one Atom for defeating it, along with plans for Wood. 
---
Not surprising at all.
---
Thanks! Good to know even if it's too late now but the effort is appreciated :)
---
Yup. My phone dumped it off here for whatever reason, and here it shall stay.
---
Atom shop mutates which makes it a glowing atom shop, like a glowing one needs more bullets to kill it, items would cost more atoms
---
I expect a fallout style game that you can play online and be able to play through with other players. And hopefully good enough servers that it doesn't crash every half hour, like some games do.
---
Sneaky snipers unite!!
---
It's the unpaid intern Brandon handling customer support calls, moderating the forums, and posting on the blog.
---
or maybe its a suggestion that people stop acting like piss babies on the reddit.
---
I have to take a picture because somewhere I have a fusion core with a damage stat of 1.
---
They haven't done anything to make want to play again. At this rate, that won't be until next year.
---
Definitely be scrapping all weapons if you need steel, helps so much and you learn mods.
---
Don't forget you can buy some lovely items in the atom shop with your free atoms gathered in the game
---
Ok, so where is the incentive to fix these things that people will still do if they are broken?
---
Biggest let down of a game for me in ten years. I pre ordered, and got the physical tricentennial edition, only for it to arrive with a broken case- ‚ÄúOh no!‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúthe CD could be broken!‚Äù Nope, it‚Äôs a cardboard disc with a game code on it. What was the point of paying extra for a bonus physical edition if it‚Äôs just literal garbage/recycling? 
---
Of course the issues didn‚Äôt stop there, but everyone knows the issues with the game itself.
---
Just... wow. This game was such a let down. Got to level 80 before I had enough. What a damn shame. 
---
Also the Scorched beasts are complete ass, and I got to the point where I would alt+f4 upon encountering ANY Scorched beast. Then I realized that the initial ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù phase wore off, and literally nothing was fun, and everything was a chore in the game. So I said to myself 
---
‚ÄúWhy the fuck am I playing this game, that is zero fun? Oh right, because I love the *Fallout* series, and I‚Äôm desperate for this new *Fallout* game to live up to its hype.‚Äù 
---
So at that point, I stopped, and never booted up the game again. Thanks Bethesda, you got my $80 (+$60 since I bought my little bro a copy to play with me) hope it was worth the short term cash, because you lost a long time fan. Also did I say how much I fucking hate scorch beasts? Worst designed enemy in years.
---
Loves to fuck fags ^
---
Would you rate it as one of Bethesda's best games?
---
Considering this is the first online fallout game
---
I was just making a joke. Stop acting like a piss baby on reddit.
---
Maybe they should make an Inside the Vault reminding people on Reddit to get a sense of humor.
---
I like building, and the creativity of it is what keeps me coming back semi-regularly. I hoping for that patch that allows us to build a town, or even our own robot NPCs or something. 
---
Fallout 76 is an open world exploration game with some RPG elements that you can play with other people.
---
Server stability is really a random thing, sometimes they crash each 5 min and sometimes you can play for hours without any lags or stutters.
---
Put around 400 hours into it, taking a break until March update. Not really a break because I'm still logging in to farm legendaries to sell/trade on the market subreddits. The market aspect is kind of addictive. People think dupers ruined the economy or whatever but really just made things tradeable. 
---
I also do the daily challenges when I can, so I can buy what I want in the atom store without having to be concerned about the awful exchange rate
---
The game currently is sort of like Minecraft as the people who get REALLY into FO76 are in it for the base building. There will be a new PvP oriented Survival mode released soon, that should spice things up
---
Damn straight!  
---
I AM a Bethesda fanboy and this game had me pissed off after 2 weeks. It was UNFINISHED. There was no actual plot, no real storyline, and none of the things they claimed the game could do are actually DOABLE! They built a game world and were 10% of the way through writing quests and adding in NPCs when the publisher told them they had to rush it to market. The world is beautiful, but that's all there is to this game. 
---
I feel quite similar. Bought the game three times myself (girlfriend, buddy). 
---
Hell yes. I really have to say that I actually enjoy the multiplayer aspect in Fallout 76. So far I've only been trolled once and they got bored of me ignoring them after 5 minutes and ran off to annoy someone else. Every other time I'm met other players they have helped me defend my C.A.M.P. , given me some extra junk or ammo they didn't need, or helped me defeat enemies. More team and co-op play would be really nice though! 
---
I'm going to hang a neon sign on my ~~base~~ wooden shack that says "ATOM SHOP" as a way to anger players into attacking it, making them wanted so I can farm them for  junk.
---
It just works.
---
Now this is a ridiculous suggestion that I can actually get behind. +1
---
My Character just fell through a space-time anomally and is currently just outside the city of Haran with my friends and we just fixed a water pipe. Tonight, another hole in the space-time continuum is going to swallow us into the Warhammer 40k universe where Fallout meets Aliens in Space Hulk Deathwing lol.
---
You don't say?  I'm always every other invo management dropping scrap gold and silver.  Maybe I'll add them to my junk supplies for my medical supply shop when player vending comes out.  Better start saving up again.
---
I'm not a min/maxer - but what's the point in trying to roleplay a chef at the red rocket truck stop cooking up good eats for players if I'm going to disconnect every ten minutes or get griefed by people who just want to ruin my day? 
---
If they did that they should at least let anyone who is over level 50 start with a level 50 and pick all there points and perk up to that level so we dont have to go through the pre 50 parts again if we dont want to
---
Yeah I was plauged by crashes and game freezing but the game was fun so I dealt with it. You my friend are in the minority.
---
I don't understand how every other post is about yesterday's ITV and they all get approved yet half the legit posts I make about playing the game get Rule 6'ed...
---
The trick is to make your posts at night after that overbearing mod's bedtime.
---
Yes‚Äîit is a flawed game but fun 
---
Nope, no diseases at all.
---
I did have two diseases, but marsupial was working while I had the diseases.  Stopped working after the diseases wore off.
---
How about no more scorched...ever.
---
This actually made me burst out laughing
---
Great. Just what the game needs. A shit meter.
---
Perhaps they could tie it to thier metacritic score and dwindling player base?
---
That would be for the best.
---
Bring back Cazadors would be so fun to fight in the servers
---
wait until November 2019, when the game is out of the early access 
---
A point about level scaling: right now, enemies in an area adjusts according to the highest level player in the area, which is... annoying for lower level characters. 
---
A more user-friendly way would be if our characters somehow scaled to the base level of the area we are visiting, at least when visiting low level areas. A high level character will still have more perks and better gear, but if the base damage resistance and damage output scaled down, the game would not have to scale the enemies up causing problems for low level characters. 
---
I obviously don't know how difficult this would be to  implement, of course, but I think it would work better from a user perspective. 
---
Maybe go pick on people your own level who are more likely to fight back?
---
It's becomming increasingly obvious that Bethesda don't deserve the fans they have.
---
PvP ruined the game for sure
---
There must be a shitpost competition I'm unaware of. 
---
W-what?
---
One  thing of the huge list of things we cant do for reasons. 
---
It is not too early. Anthem released one before it came out, and Apex Legends, a free to play game, released one on launch day, it is not too early. And if all they have planned are bug fixes and PvP, the game will be 100% dead by June.
---
Except I didn't have radworms or any other diseases at the time.
---
Where is this? 
---
I have aquaboy, and unless I found the master glitch, you take no rad damage in nuke zone if your in water.
---
If he's level 16 and struggling to find Stimpacks, it's not likely that he has finished the Enclave quest line and gained access to the Bunker and its shops.
---
The servers and the Fallout style will disappoint you. It's more of a Fallout themed survival game than a Fallout style game.
---
&gt;Final thought: the way you've handled the unexpected nerfs to fun and buffs to grind makes me question why should we tell you which monsters we enjoy fighting: so you can suck all the fun out of those too? I dont want to think this way, but youve made me a cynical asshole.
---
I agree here, I have been an active member of the FO76 sub reddit, and I have definitely noticed a decline in "feedback posts", and a rise in "I'm done posts". I think this is partly due to people being afraid of more nerfs based on their feedback.
---
At first, we wanted events fixed. Many were broken, didn't register if you were there (some are still broken and can steal your stuff if you are not careful), never completed (protest march), and don't give a reward (swarm of suitors). 
---
Then they made an attempt to fix that, and made it so the event "feed the people" now did the exact opposite. 
---
Then some people started complaining about the overpowered TSE weapons. Instead of doing a balanced nerf from a lot of feedback, they went ahead and power nerfed it into the ground, along with some heavy explosive weapons that weren't that great to begin with. 
---
And now they want feedback on enemies, and I understand your point. They might make the enemies have slightly less damage resistance, but accidentally make them spawn infinitely, or give them respawning health back like we saw in the last patch. 
---
We could ask for better loot drop on enemies or better melee hitbox registration, and end up with teleporting enemies that can hit us with their fists from 100 yards away.
---
It just doesn't feel safe to give feedback about stuff you care about, because it might get screwed up.
---
must not say bad things or todd will cry.  
---
OMGOOODZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I sold one of those thinking it was just a freakin fuse! It's going to be months before I find another now I just know it!
---
arrrghhhhhhhhhhhhh!
---
I like pacifist mode for nuke zones because without it so many people would be getting murdered because someone decided to run in front of them to make them hit them so they can kill them. I use the tesla rifle and I dont want to be making everone hostile towards me lol
---
Ok thank you
---
Oceans of *specific* feedback, which they could have used months ago to assemble say, a top-ten poll of things to be addressed if they were genuinely interested in fixing things and not sure about where to start. I mean, have you ever made an online poll? Not hard. And advertising it would have been as simple as creating a loading screen.
---
Yup I could have told you that would be their exact response. 
---
Xbox one x
---
rather "illuminating" thought though.
---
Others reported it before too.
---
The PVP only mode picture was shown to be a menu selection just like it.  Imagine it's related.  It's offset cause the other option is the PVP servers.
---
Polygon is a joke, Kotaku is a joke, they're basically all a joke (inb4 blanket statement muh) these are good changes and they're writing them off as "inspiring little confidence".
---
I personally have not played the game in a while and therefore don't know the current state of the game, but these changes sound good and they're writing them off as negative. This is the reason why so many players don't take the critisism sometimes.  Because there are articles like this that are a joke.
---
Don't blame the Community team. Like customer service, they are the low end of the org chart in most companies. Their jobs are talking to the community, keeping it excited, but they are dependent on other departments for information and approval about what they can say.
---
Easily the best quest in the game. Only quest I gave two shits about.
---
It‚Äôs a bug, Bethesda are adding in ‚ÄúSurvival mode‚Äù which is a PVP only environment. Adventure mode is what the classic mode is gonna be. They already gave us a preview of the screen you saw, only with survival on the right of the screen.
---
I don't think you know what roleplaying is... Voice &gt; text, get over your insecure shyness.  Character name display is meaningless, we don't have tags floating over our heads in rl and you wouldn't know someone's name unless you talk with them or physically recognize them. Back stories are learned through conversation, not reading a blurb on a character sheet.  None of the things you listed are essential, in fact they are detrimental to good rp.
---
that whole inside the vault felt like ‚Äúlets see what we have in the suggestion box‚Äù
---
Not even remotely. It's one of its worst by that regard.
---
It does have some moments of brilliance though. Like, better than any of the past entries. 
---
The Order of Mysteries side quest is fantastic and for me one of the best in terms of story and lore. For me in a similar league to the much beloved Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild quest line in previous titles.
---
The holotape acting in general is great. A lot darker and gritter than any past entry which brings something new to the game. Quite moving and disturbing and stirs emotions unlike past entries. Same with some of the environmental story telling. Some quirky, some depressing (in a good way though).
---
This game is certainly not for everyone and if you're a power leveller, you'd hit the end quick. However, if you like taking your time and exploring all there is to see, it's still pretty good.
---
Unless you're a hoarder. You'll need to learn to live without a lot. That was the hardest part for me really.
---
this was all addressed by Bethesda directly in yesterday's Inside the Vault blog post. it's on the front page.
---
LOL now you're stalking my posts on other subs lol. You really are embarrassing.üòÇ
---
Yeah, we need a nerf on fuses fo sho.
---
The title is a little wrong. It should be "Bethesda games have always been buggy as shit". You probably haven't played FO 1&amp;2.
---
Like the overseer's boyfriend.  When I got the quest to kill him I was all prepared for an awesome fight.  But it was just a level 6 scorched standing in the corner like he was in time out waiting for me to put a bullet in his head.
---
Just scavenge around the forest for awhile
---
I am criticizing those departments they are dependant on. Sorry if my post made it seem like I was blaming the writer, that wasn't my intention. Hats off to the CM's in this subreddit as well for doing a thankless job. 
---
plus tons of a new, worthless in game Nylon crafting material and this weird, vague sense of Pride and Accomplishment creeping everywhere
---
Austin is alone so very alone and out in the cold on this. It‚Äôs painfully obvious they have no fucking idea what they are doing. I stopped holding my breath hoping the cavalry would show up months ago. Maybe you should as well. 
---
They responded to community feed back, but not precisely what we had on our minds!... GET THE TORCHES, WE DEMAND resignation letter&gt;:(
---
thanks for the reply. I was always curious too as to what the jackpot rewards were.
---
 Spring fever.  https://youtu.be/IICy1YqCQ1U
---
Oh, I see.  I searched for 'adventure menu' in here first, but it didn't bring up anything obvious.  Thought I stumbled on something novel.
---
:: exasperated face ::
---
I used a grenade launcher but the point is that their health bar does not decrease at all despite the VATS bars being at zero, or very low. They are seemingly immortal which means I cannot get past the mission.
---
Yes a poll which is exactly what they are doing on their forums. They are asking questions specific to certain content to get specific responses to build a plan for those specific parts.
---
That'd would be great. Cheers
---
5 major patches plus a small smattering of hotfixes.
---
The USS Constitution quest is so much fun!
---
I recently started a new survival play through also. 
---
Bitter much?
---
Tell us how you really feel.
---
It's okay, you can open up.
---
I‚Äôve heard that nuking it scales all prices to their maximum level. You‚Äôve been warned
---
The mother was dead already, the daughter was hugging her I thought. After being betrayed by her lover, she realised what she'd done, now that she was dying and the only one left to comfort her was her dead mother. It was a sad story and one of the best ones in the game - imagine how much better it would have been if they actually had NPC's instead of walls of text to read.
---
I play on my Xbox one day one edition, and I experience a fair deal of errors, but I mostly agree with you.  It‚Äôs an ambitious game that is a lot of fun to play.  No regrets.
---
Try a shotgun with enforcer perk to take out their legs and they won't be able to move
---
I don‚Äôt even care how often they use their attack, but if they‚Äôre going to use the fucking attack, at least be looking at me when they do it. They‚Äôre such a shit enemy. 
---
bethesda: the players are not happy, we need $ 15 skins and more trash 
---
That's why I'm going back to Conan.  
---
I want Fallout, I'm replaying Fallout 4. The settlement system felt more engaging and immersive into the game world then anything in Fallout 76,  
---
I want Survival, I'm replaying Conan Exiles. I can build anywhere, setup npcs in my camp, and craft as much as I want without an arbitrary inventory limit.
---
Hate to admit it but this.  Placeholder enemy with little variety and overly uses.  How the hell did they even ever become a threat?  Scorchbeasts are one thing, but scorched-anything-else, just why?  I'll take endless feral ghouls over scorched.  I'll take cooperating mutants and mole miners over scorched.  How did they even manage to be a threat?  Their hivemind isn't very well linked, they have bad team work (for a hivemind), and their only real threat starting out would be their infection which honestly would've been culled if not for scorchbeasts shooting it around.
---
And what the hell is with the queen scorchbeast?  Where?  How?  Why?  What even.  Are you telling me bats are the post apocalyptic source of cthulu tier monstrosities?  We couldn't get a behemoth deathclaw?  Or a giant octopus mirelurk?  Had to be a bat that flies around like gravity has no meaning and doesn't sit still even when it lands? Talk about an ammo dump.
---
I'll take a megamothman even.  Or a graphton monster snallygaster, or a literal horde of dozens of feral ghouls threatening to reduce the surface to a zombie apocalypse.
---
Lol Not yet. I plan on trying them out since I received them for free.
---
You mean the atoms becomming glowing atoms!. My god the sheer idea is mind blowing.
---
‚Äúthey can‚Äôt waste resources trying to fix it‚Äù 
---
But it‚Äôs totally fine for all of us who feel like we wasted our money on this game? We don‚Äôt deserve something for our money?
---
HELIOS right? Dang, never thought I could remember of the guy just because of the dialogue, good one haha
---
Dude, like this week's theme, give it a rest and relax.
---
I wonder if the much talked about dev team is capable of doing anything but listening and being aware of the multitude of issues they need to fix. Those of us still trying, still holding onto some hope that they might do something worth our time are fading. I'm past that and just uninstalled the game after that pathetic excuse for communication.
---
Feedback? They ask for more feedback? Why is everything "in the future" or "upcoming new content"? The simple answer is that it's a noncommittal answer they hope will appease people. No longer. You don't release an online only game and then plan your future content. You release your online only game with future content already roadmapped with some loose dates at least and actual ideas you can share. At least that's what you do if you have something more than empty words.
---
As has been said very well by OP I want more than empty words and inaction. Vague communication that shows they have no clue at all about what players enjoy and hate after countless posts here and elsewhere is not even close to being enough. What happened to all the direct feedback that we're constantly told is being passed on? There are only so many ways you can tell someone the truth before you realise they don't want to hear it and are actively ignoring you. The hard truth is that even if there was some awesome content coming and actually close to release I wouldn't care. I don't trust Bethesda to get it out in a state that isn't perpetually broken. Worse still, they'd likely consider that enough to appease us and pat themselves on the back for a job well done.
---
The whole reason behind it is that they might not even have one themselves that's why they're asking for "feedback" and literally "re-releasing" the game with the PvP-servers without any actual content to be seen yet
---
I know the Game is broken and i wont defend.
---
It is just a suggestion. 
---
Delete the Game and re-install it, then Rebuild the Database of your Ps4. Maybe it helps.
---
They are fixing a problem we complained about? what a bunch of fricking jerk/idiots. The modders on the nexus would be able to scan our brainwaves and know what the most important tweak of fix was on our minds at the time of releasing the patch.WHERES THAT KARMA,  #GAMERSTRONG
---
https://youtu.be/sDEL4Ty950Q
---
Yeah. You're missing nothing. Nothing changed and it just got worse.  
---
My recommendation is play Fallout 4 with some of the survival option mods to get the experience you'd like. You'll have more fun then you would trying to get back into this mess.
---
It's called a bridge.
---
Rerelease Fo4 on Switch, charge full price.
---
Ill buy and Todd can wipe those sweet, delicious tears.
---
in my experience they are already strong. I've got a vampire's plasma thrower and that thing has ridiculous damage output. Also a nocturnal explosive gatling plasma, same thing. A minigun being able to reach 70+ damage per shot is already good enough for me
---
This is hilarious. Great moment. The people who down voted have obviously not played that game and can never be called a true fan. Just bethesda cronys.
---
They‚Äôre crap. I‚Äôm saving my atom for when they come out with iron man suit ü§ó
---
This was my answer too but with more maniacal laughter and cigars made from rolled up 100 dollar bills.
---
If they had enemies with Ghoul AI with guns. Imagine trying to shoot a scorch and it bobs and weaves  your shots, or it sneaks up behind you and can do sneak attack damage to you.
---
I have had a lot of enjoyment in the game.  In spite of the flaws, which are many.  I bought it prior to Christmas and played nearly every day since.  But this past week I have been taking a break, playing KH3 instead.
---
I'm going to keep it easy for a while.  See what the next patch brings.
---
I've got myself in a pretty good position in game.  Secured scrap sources, nice (non-legendary yet) equipment, level 60+, going thru doing side quests unlocking things.
---
Plenty of problems still exist.  Server Stability leaves a LOT to be desired.  The game is far from future proof yet.  And I was disappointed by yesterday's "Into the Vault" write up.  Regardless of whether or not that is all they plan on doing in the next update (I doubt that's it) it was a bit of a let down after waiting to hear word from them outside their few reddit posters.  These Into the Vault write ups are their real way of communicating to people, they need to do a better job there.
---
Adding this for anyone googling it and coming across this like I did, if you go to the crashed space station east of wild Willard‚Äôs and punch in the code to get in-[111418] unless it changes- inside one of the lockers with the space suits is where you can find a stealth boy nearly every time.
---
&gt;  I don‚Äôt care about Shaun.
---
Reason I never finished the main story
---
(curious) i'm not a PS4 player
---
Aren't PS4 patches cumulatives ?   
---
If you install the game and the latest patch you should be good to go ? 
---
So what you're saying is, the alien blaster will forever remain useless
---
Also explains why they gave a flat 20% boost to all auto weapons and 5% to rifles with auto receivers. Some of the weapons def needed a bigger boost and others barely needed anything
---
Yup I gave up 2 weeks ago and hopped on battlefield 5 since it‚Äôs 50%off in PSN. I can‚Äôt take FO76 anymore they literally just don‚Äôt give a fuck. It‚Äôs a complete shit show
---
Kevin the Sea Cucumber: *WILL YOU CUT THAT OUT?!*
---
Find me in-game if you are willing to look into my camp/house it's lacking details i think...
---
Agreed, I really hate this  bandwagon.
---
Like the other top commenter, you should relax.
---
Im just making a joke, Dude. The circlejerking on this thread is abundant. 
---
Dont worry, bruh, i didnt uninstall the game. 
---
This is where I am too. My favorite part of any Fallout game has been getting the chance to explore a weird and wonderful wasteland, and even with all its flaws (real and debatable!) the game still delivers on its world-building as much as any other in the series.
---
It's like being a CM for Puppy Kickers Inc.
---
This is true, but the hit mapping for cazadors was PAINFUL in NV. Like you could shoot directly through their body.
---
Imagine scorchbeats only they deal more damage via poison and are faster.
---
Thanks Waluigi.
---
Yeah mostly friendly. If they aren‚Äôt friendly, I just pop 25 bobbleheads and unzip my pants. 
---
Nice try Pete Hines but I prefer to know when something is wrong than get bounced to somewhere I didn't intend to go
---
Pacifist just stops you from accidentally initiating PVP.  Doesn't stop people from harming you.
---
The biggest flaw of this game's PVP system isn't so much the mechanics itself (some of which do prove to be exploitable), but how unexplained the system is to players.  After hundreds of hours and dozens of levels many people just don't know how it works.  And interactions between players are very infrequent, so you don't find out right away how it works.  Then it comes as a surprise when it all happens.
---
Enola walker's story tapes give som nice insight into what its like while turning into a scorched.
---
This happened to me last week for the first time as well. A rando at my base initiated trade (I was curious), and he saw my 3* lvl 45 AAE Handmade. He requested, I messaged back politely that it was not for sale. Another guy shows up, and they start levelling. Luckily I left the game before they hit my decon shower.
---
I'm not honestly too cheesed about it -- it's kind of immersive for me. What I do not like, however, is the pacifist thing. I always have it off, but when a situation like this arises, that time in the menu to switch is more than enough to die. I'm not sure how, but that system needs a rework.
---
That'd be cool actually, 'heavy scorched', sounds good.  But give them variety including gattling plasma's, plasma rifles, irradium rifles, gamma guns, switch things up with some energy and radiation weapons.  Also power fists and deathclaw gauntlet heavy scorched.
---
Power armored ones should drop with a fusion core and power armor pieces (like a suit normally has) and perhaps some should be permastatued because their fusion cores ran out but they don't know how to leave the suit making them little more than a standing power suit without a fusion core, can't pick up the frame unless you release the scorched inside or something.
---
kill the game, take the money, buy an island somewhere. its best for everyone.
---
I think it would have been considerably better with a minimum of 6 months additional development time. To think that they could have avoided most of this negative press by delaying it a bit for additional testing.
---
My wife and I play with our daughter (who is a much lower level than we are.) We were out exploring not too long ago, and this guy walks up, like 100+ levels higher than I am, in full power armor and just stands in fron of my daughter (who was like lvl20 or so at the time.) Here I am expecting a fight since we had been farming as we went, but this dude drops TONS of stuff for her. We weren't playing with our mics at the time (Xbox), but I made sure to message him with our thanks. Good people still roam the woods, I tell you.
---
The massive complaints about them for one and the drop in players. But the problems with PvE have NOTHING to do with making separate PvE and PvP servers. You can use the same argument of how bad PvP is, so why are they making the survival servers? But it's happening, whether we like it or not. And in case you havent noticed, there are quite a few people who want PvE only servers. Heck, it may even increase the population on servers because people who be less spread out across them.
---
I kept hold of mine and the dress even though I'm a guy and look silly in it lol. I kept my Firebreathers pistol too out of respect for Maxine and Rita - I burned everything to do with the DMV mission....
---
What are you playing on, I need to find a use for my skeleton friends and would gladly give them away.
---
I‚Äôm one of those friends. I gave up about 2 weeks ago because I just can‚Äôt take it anymore. My heart is broke . My first MMO love destiny made me quit in D2 because you have to grind for a month to get something meaningful and now FO76 with the shit show that is. Games are turning into a massive cash grab don‚Äôt-give-a-fuck for publishers and it‚Äôs sickening
---
Cool story bruh, great blog spot.
---
How do I join? I'm game to give it a go
---
Haven't they 'fixed' the scorchbeasts and queen multiple times already? Why would we trust them to do it right this time?
---
Head to the Lucky Hole Mine. There is a hallway where there are about 30-40 antlers on the ceiling. 
---
They asked me if I knew how to develop a game. I said I knew as much as anyone I ever knew.
---
The West-Tek Building, there are Supermutants and they got many bones!
---
Supermutants likes bones and they're everywhere.
---
Yes, simply buffing  the damage and durabilty would be nice.
---
So edgy üò©üò©üò©
---
I hate to tell you but....they are inside you. 
---
This.  Good I can get behind.  Lawful?  What law is left?  Who's?
---
Awesome thanks for the help.
---
"We will forward the suggestions to the dev team"
---
nah guy, the game is trash, literally a buggy mess and a garbage product. you can like it all you want, go nuts, still doesn't change this fact.
---
more power to you... However, please note that just because YOU don't encounter problems, 90% of other people can and had encountered them.
---
Caps available in exchange for pillaged loot. Pillaged loot available in exchange for caps. Previously owned loot for sale. Mostly blood free.
---
You know what's funny
---
The mothman is a harbinger of disaster
---
Bethesda put him in their game and it was a disaster
---
Food for thought
---
I wouldn't mind War Events where a point of interest becomes mired in combat between 2 or more types of enemies.
---
I can see it now.  5 deathclaws and their 6 children rush a super mutant outpost while a feral ghoul horde runs towards the commotion before a scorchbeast drops in to say 'RWBRAAWWRLGHH'.
---
You seem to think people WANT to argue with you. You were actually the one who ran out of anything thoughtful to say and resorted to childish insults.  I gave you a straightforward examination of why I felt you should be a smarter consumer and your brain completely shut down. 
---
What's a min maxer?
---
Pretty much. I can't recall the specifics, but in a nutshell it allows you to alter all of a certain group of weapons at once. It makes sense to make simple balance changes across-the-board, however making individual changes gets messy fast.
---
I know right?  I feel like everyone should be able to easily make enough atoms in game to buy one or two items from the shop, and there's only one or two worth buying.  I don't understand how people can spend actual money on that crap.
---
Seems to be that way, the update Installing right now is about 40gt.
---
My friends and I have moved on. I still have it installed but after the latest BS by Bethesda I don't think it's worth keeping it on my HDD. There's some good things about it - let's not forget that we could find something enjoyable but all games have their shelf life and you have to know when it's time to move on.
---
There's other great games out there to play.
---
I have embarrassed myself...
---
Soon, we all know that will happen. OF COURSE they would say first they would never do that but we know they couldnt say "yeah, we going f2p" while still selling the game, even if its not selling well.
---
I agree with this, the Scorched need some fixing, and some expansion. These guys have been glitchy like, forever.
---
tbh theyre probably being forced to develop new content over fixing the game in its current state, because god knows bethesda executives think we can wait a few months for a stable, functional product.
---
I find you need to swap and change those perks around and see which one is benefitting the most at any time. Sometimes I'll swap the junk one for the armor one, if I'm not carrying much junk for example.
---
They want our feedback but they also want to do it their way lol. 
---
Because over these 4 months it seems they have no real direction for the game.
---
Why do I feel you guys read other post, and then decide, OOoooh that's a good thing to write about to get attention! Yeah, that's perfect! I'll really rake in the karma!!
---
No problem, didn't think you were, but gamers sometimes attack low-level staff when the management is to blame. 
---
I'd go for neutral good bud 
---
Welcome to atom shop premium. Basically just everything already in game but 10x more and coated in rhinestones like a mom with a bedazzler. Because fuck it, some WHALE asshole will buy it.
---
You sound like a gambler trying to devise a plan to win the lottery. Game's broken, that's all. I've seen normal enemies drop 2 legendary items, some other being magically transferred from a legendary enemy to a normal one I killed seconds later ...
---
Never had anyone to play with anyway, they all avoided the game as soon as the first review came out. Almost did the same until i got it for my birthday. 
---
Currently level 20, this is by a country mile my least played fallout game. Must be 0.001% of my FoNV time
---
I thought bulking junk generally made it heavier, except for a couple materials?
---
Bethesda!  I really /really/ enjoy fighting scorchbeasts!  I love how i can kite them around, it is great fun and I can bait them into attacking other mobs and players!  Also I love the fact that I can get a chance to shoot so many bullets into high level mobs, it's so anticlimactic when they die in just a few shots!
---
Etc.
---
I can still admit that there were problems that I personally didn't experience. Most people here will just say "LOL I HAVEN'T ENCOUNTERED ANY BUGS BETHESDA IS GOD, SHUT UP, YOU SUCK". They are so hell bent on being Beth apologists, they turn into piles of shit.
---
Legendary wooden chest piece. I scrapped it and cooked mutt chops!
---
I sold the pistol.  I‚Äôve kept the sword as it‚Äôs one of the best one handed weapons in the game.   
---
*PR SPEAK INTENSIFIES*
---
No loot at all, or no loot because of the spinning arrows?
---
Because if it's the latter, that happened to me a few days ago, and about 5 minutes after the battle, I could suddenly loot the meat piles. It's still bullshit, but at least it finally worked...
---
That sounds a little like the BoS already if they were just a bit more crazy about preserving technology for themselves through the eradication of threatening factions (everyone else and their dogs).
---
Would fight, and probably die.
---
I'm a Lone Wanderer bored as hell High Level player that's done all the end game content add nosium.
---
Some of the recent fun I've had is attacking people's work shops.
---
News Flash:  if you captured a work shop you've just intentionally flagged yourself for consensual pvp.
---
That's the way this game works in it's current state.  You're not ment to own a resource or workshop indefinately.
---
Now I don't go after camps  but I could.  Once your flagged for pvp with another player you can attack their camp without flagging for bounty.  I know it could be considered a dbag move.  I personally don't do it, but it's an option.
---
Wish people were a little more knowledgeable about the game mechanics and what triggers can flag you for pvp.  
---
I don't agree with most of what you said in your post as I don't have an issue with Griefers.  I actually love targeting Honeypot bounty players In parties with my melee/vats sniper build I'm killing them an they can never find me.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is this game has a lot of nuances to it.  Once you understand the nuances you really can't be griefed if you your armed with knowledge.
---
Thanks for reading.
---
This is one of the stages of grief. You are currently in the denial stage. 
---
Not at all. I'm from Brazil and a Reddit Filthy Casual, lol. Level 56 by now. Send your psn name by pm if you dont mind.
---
Then that just means they are rare bugs. The rarity if them makes reproducing them in studio difficult.  If they can not reproduce it they can not identify what causes it.
---
I don't get how a + 45% constant aoe damage bonus is useless. It is better than any other legendary out there.
---
PS Store - sometime today
---
Triggered by the bethesda launcher, sad.
---
Yeah I wish some IT genius would invent "back up tapes" already!
---
I'd love to see Centaurs back and in 4k. Centaurs and Cazadors.
---
A big badass Legendary Scorched Cazador would be insane.
---
Rare? So bugs happening 90% of the time are rare now? 
---
That sounds like something they could have an employee do for them. 
---
Ohh wait, isn't that what a Community Manager is for?
---
Well this is a new one, getting triggered by other games because of Fo76
---
Old Bioware ended the day they  sold out to EA. The last thing EA cares about are lovingly crafted story driven crpgs.
---
If I had to pin and exact moment for Bethesda, it would be the Switch port of Skyrim. Knowing full well that there would be no mod support they released a version of Skyrim that still contained all the bugs and issues that plagued the base game. They could have spent a month or so porting in some community fixes but no. 
---
"it just works"
---
They can turn any connected switch on or off as well control the spotlight turret. 
---
I had a friend that every day would log in and he'd be missing soup he made or stimpaks and god know what. Never found a fix for it, the issue was Bethesda's naff coding and servers - he also lost the one of two dragons we ever found as a 3 man team.
---
Yeah perhaps but what would be the point in bulking it if it was going to make it heavier? The purpose of bulking is to make it lighter so we can store more stuff. I could be wrong that was my assumption. 
---
You gotta pay the troll toll, to get in.
---
Good stuff!
---
How about the ability to place anything, everywhere you want. I'm tired of trying to build something that seems perfectly normal, but you can't because of some idiotic restriction.
---
I don't know about you guys, but I'm all for some Legendary Glowing Emotes.
---
I craft lvl 5 to 15 brotherhood rifles for random newbies.
---
anyplace that SM spawn?
---
You've already done that. You've paid for all of us. 
---
there's a post on the front page right now about how a player's stash simply vanished and Bethesda won't do jack about it.
---
I feel like I beta tester. it's like I have to tip toe around the game in order not to trigger bugs. things that wouldn't get past the beta stages in other games are common occurrences here.
---
I have to echo this post.  Well said!
---
I've been trying to tell people from day one that the content is there, it's just not traditional.   Sure, there's lots of room for improvement and there are issues with bugs, stability, and balance, but it feels like they set out to make a game for the fans who were still playing fo3, fo4, and Skyrim years later.  Those players finished the main quest and kept playing, did all the sidequests and kept exploring, becoming immersed in lore and environmental story telling.  Along the way they continued to upgrade their settlements and add immersive mods to keep things interesting, but one thing remained in the back of their minds "I wish I could share this experience with my friends"
---
76 is a love letter to those players, with the final missing piece (multiplayer) as a cherry on top.  It's not perfect, but it's actually a damn good game that I'm really enjoying.
---
I should not voice my opinion just in case it gets lots of upvotes, got it. 
---
Okay, don‚Äôt read the entire paragraph I wrote after that then.
---
I love the sirens
---
Your source of 90% of the time? 
---
Last night I was making minor adjustments and moved a  wall off the end of a metal stair. Now I cant put it back. 
---
Or just plug in a mic and haggle?
---
I'm not sure how it would be "split in half" when we're already in servers with what, 20 odd people on each map?
---
Surely it would just mean that instead of spinning up 100 servers for 20 people each, you'd spin up 100-102 servers, with 50 of them having 20 PVE people in them and 50 having 20 PVP people in them.  No?
---
You could do this on almost any game I wanted a good fallout multiplayer with PvP and PvE I have gotten neither. 
---
You really ought to report him. The homophobic slurs don't fly in this game.
---
This reddits has been my extent for fallout 76 for the past 2 weeks or so.
---
I know I'm spoiled, but the lack of real content minus farming for legendaries.  If they don't roll out a far harbor esque dlc within the next few months. I dunno :/.
---
I‚Äôll be honest I didn‚Äôt read it well
---
Love the idea but they can't even get the base game running smoothly 3 months later. This seems way too involved for the devs 
---
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have one, and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs the case for others.
---
Plus there are many people who simply don‚Äôt like using them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
---
Not to mention the game Freezing is still a thing, i have to set CPU affinity to run FO76... i can think of no other software thats required that in my 20 some years of using a computer.
---
Granted, he probably had a buddy hiding on a cliff somewhere, but it's pretty hilarious to me that a Lv. 22 would come sauntering up to a Lv. 112 and start picking a fight.
---
&gt;they yet again didn't read our minds
---
Didn't read the bug reports either, apparently.
---
Wendigo cave
---
Copy paste response they send out frequently.
---
Unique dialogue from scorched in certain areas would do this idea wonders.  Scorched in a house, one spawns next to a baby crib and it has dialogue to remark about remembering a child it once had.
---
The scorched are said to be 'angry' so I could even see them screaming about things like lost loved ones even if ironically they were taken by the scorch plague.  Scorch spawns behind a bar, sees player and screams 'NO MORE FOR YOU!' all pissed like it's cutting you off of the booze.
---
Or a scorched officer that's screaming for backup (because they're usually alone).
---
Or a scorched at a company building screaming about how much they hate their boss, 'TERMINATE ME?  I'LL TERMINATE YOU!'
---
Give them some existence, they're not Borg.
---
Check the subreddit and check the player count now and at launch. Also, can you provide me data that these bugs are rare? 
---
but really, fuck the daughter. Serves her right. Yea, she liked Brody, but he was also just her "in" to the raiders...a group that she naively thought she would be running herself within a month. You know, after she murdered the only group of people who seemed willing to stand up for what's right.
---
THIS\^\^\^
---
 *You guys are a bigger company now, with a lot of manpower than ever  before.  This is getting ridiculous.  Fix your game.  You can do plenty  more communication with us.* 
---
No, they can't. They've lost whatever touch they had. Just because a bunch of people make a game that you happen to like does not make them pop stars or gods. JKust look at the history of their games, all the bugs they could never be bothered with. They choose NOT to fix them and choose NOT to communicate.
---
What they actually do is CHOOSE to rip you off at Christmas, CHOOSE to nerf your weapons and perk cards, CHOOSE to work on PVP that hardly anybody wants.
---
When a game company is in this much opposition to it's own customers it's time to tell them to go fuck themselves.
---
It's what they've been saying to us for years, isn't it?
---
Synths
---
It was hella sad, and dumb by the girl too, got very angry with that ending.
---
Its a survival game 
---
is there any way to go back and remake them in the mansion?
---
Rage 2 is made by a different developer. Looks pretty good too.
---
Honestly at this point they should work to open the game up for the player devs and let us have private servers. 
---
After three terrible months I have way more faith in the modding community to fix this game then I do Bethesda.
---
I mean for fucks sake they seem to not even understand versioning or have any QA to speak of.
---
I mean people are leaving, as well as a decrease in playtime for most. So most people who have played the Beta and are still probably playing half as much as they used to. 
---
F#$k that, i said I wanted it challenging not impossible lol obsidian cranked them up to 11 when they made them, in foNV I would rather face a deathclaw matriarch than a kill team of them lol
---
Maybe a toned down version yeah in toxic valley 
---
Hey, my character is male too, but who cares in the post-apocalypse? ;-) 
---
I actually still have the dress and the jewel thingy, it's just the weapons I lost :-/ 
---
Because currently the playerbase is a single entity, 'Fallout 76 players'. If you split it into 'PvE players' and 'PvP players' you have automatically diluted the pool of players that any one person will interact with. Whales don't buy atom shop items so they can look at them, and they don't buy them to flaunt to the same 20 people over and over again. If I am a Fallout 76 whale currently there are (hypothetically) 100 * 20 people to show off to. If I am a Fallout 76 PvP whale there are (hypothetically) 50 * 20 people to show off to.
---
Not really sure, but by the terminal entrances it is possible to discover when it happened, but I don't remember shit right now.
---
This thread is fucking Hilarious !!!!
---
Best thing on the internet today.
---
This thread is freaking Hilarious !!!!
---
What about the Salvaged Assault Head? Doesnt seem to have any perks to help it
---
Legendary atom shop. Drops crap for loot.
---
Yeah OP, never question a woman. Everyone on reddit knows that. 
---
Absolutely. I know it has a very valid reason. I guess I'm the only one who thinks the concept is just silly. It's just funny in a world where everyone has a weapon, pacifism exists.
---
I've scored 87 consecutive kills in COD, and been reported as cheating because people got mad over me killing them so many times, so trust me when I say, I can hold my own in any game, as long as the game mechanics aren't stacking the deck with exploits.
---
But why would there be a drop in players if, as you have said, people are still playing PvE in a broken state?
---
Yeah people should stop complaining about a broken product they paid good money for! /s 
---
Fuck this game. Uninspired cash grab that played on people‚Äôs love for the Fallout series. 
---
The best answer I can give is that within the detritus there are some beautiful locations and occasional stories that you can tell were lovingly crafted and that someone poured their heart into creating. You often need to crawled through 500 yards of shit to find them but that makes it hurt more.
---
They're too busy designing things for the atom shop.
---
Just annoyed, is all. People seem to have so many different views on what they game should be, the devs are gonna end up trying to please everyone.
---
Kotaku basically writes whatever they see on Subreddits. They literally pander to the crowd here. The internet craps on 76, so Kotaku craps on it. Its basically your 20 something cousin who re shares other peoples posts and writes over them. 
---
You can still stack RadShield for the time being.
---
Is it really? I could've swore I read an article stating that Bethesda were using the same engine for upcoming games including Rage 2
---
Uhh? What? Where are you getting your info on that? 
---
I had better melee weapons at the time, I was pretty desperate for stash space, and I unfortunately also forgot that you need the lower-level weapons to build the upgrades. I'm actually a bit sad that you can't get the supercomputer in the Mansion to make you new ones. 
---
Such nach swissagent bin heute abend online
---
&gt;A community of toxic hate hype from a majority that hasn‚Äôt even tried the game.
---
Change the record buddy. That was the line back at release when the people with foresight were already pointing out the flaws.
---
the game is a literal dumpster fire and instead of putting it out by fixing game breaking bugs, like items vanishing for no reason at all, they add a 10 seconds timer to SBs and call it a day. something a modder could do in 10 minutes or less.
---
that inspires little confidence in my opinion.
---
Rage 2 is published by Bethesda. BGS has nothing to do with Rage 2. You‚Äôre right in saying that BGS is using the same engine for Starfield and ESVI though. 
---
Well it keeps people from abusing it. S high level could run in front of a low level and then be free to kill them without it
---
I still like the game, but Austin clearly needs help.
---
Not apologizing, not defending. Pointing out reality so many of you find to hard to swallow. I wear these downvotes like a banner of pride in a sea of ignorance.
---
Yeah 100 was just a number I pulled out of the air to illustrate a point, I think there are way more than sufficient numbers even now.  How often do you randomly join a server and recognise every username?
---
Well said
---
I'm sure I will play again. But it's going to be a while. Both because I haven't even started physical therapy for my hands, and the lack of content.
---
Rage2 is made by a different studio. It is highly unlikely it will be as bad as 76.
---
Nope. I tried :-/ 
---
I sort of get why, at least the sword is actually made from a "historic sword" which is supposedly unique, but I'm still a bit sad about losing them. 
---
Welcome to the "waiting for content club"
---
Fair point
---
what you're saying is like if a building was on fire and the firemen were just chillin', telling you to relax.
---
no, dude. do your job and fix this mess.
---
...WHAT?  Wow!
---
What do you consider 'sufficient numbers' to sustain a whale market?
---
Sorry which suggestion?  
---
The fixes suggested or something else?

Last night I saw some guy who was level 84 or so, and was wanted, for only 5 caps. Decided to go claim his bounty cause I was bored and, hey, an extra 5 caps doesn't hurt. Get over there, he tries to trade, I do the taunt emote and thumbs up to try and let him know "hey, I'm about to kill you and claim your bounty" so he whips out his gun, shoots me to initiate PVP, and I kill him in one hit with my All Rise (he was one tap anyways, health looked to be around 20). He then proceeds to invite me to a party and starts throwing around racial slurs, threats, calling me a slut/bitch/whore, and a lot more worse stuff. I just reported him, called him a piece of shit, and left the party and server after blocking him.
---
People are assholes for no apparent reason, you definitely ought to report that guy if you haven't yet. Also, my thing took place on Xbox, so if anyone wants his GT to know to avoid him, let me know.
---
I have a gold .44 because I was low on atoms and absolutely had to have it because it was expiring in an hour, so I bought atoms to replace it. 
---
Fuck, I‚Äôm the problem. 
---
Why do you guys still exist? Like at what point to you decide not to whiteknight your favorite little old megacorporation? 
---
Yeah, those guys over at ~~/r/Fallout~~ /r/fo76 are just haters, the real fans are all on ~~/r/fo76~~ /r/fo76filthycasuals.
---
I like the idea but in practice it won‚Äôt work. One reason being that the servers would probably crash at some point during or before the event. The prep time of 120 ish mins is longer than some people play in general. Also saying that we have to kill every single one would mean that if we get the glitch that you sometimes get when taking a workshop and the enemies are glitched through the floor, the event will never end. Overall I love the idea tho
---
They'd choose some manner of priority order. Maybe highest quantity of weapon first.
---
No need to be a prick
---
Well damn. Good luck on your hands! 
---
But yeah, the lack of content is the minor issue here, lol. Get those hands better so you can enjoy the older wastelands again :).
---
Even if you just want your fallout world and are fine with all the bugs and broken systems you should at least acknowledge them.
---
LET THE PREORDERS BEGIN
---
This reminds me of that lame bandwagon that hated on the amazing Phantom Menace. 
---
Spending $20 isn't being a "whale". I suggest you people get a job if you can't afford $18 PA skins. The stuff in the store is relatively cheap. Most of it is crap though. 
---
What does it say about you when you get mad that someone who has more money than you is spending it. Grow up.
---
Along the lines of bunnyzilla, I suggest Chicken Kong, commanding an army of marauding chickens. 
---
NONONONO. You know the drill. Never preorder. Look at the sub we‚Äôre on lol
---
If you quadrupled the information and content in this ITV you wouldn't even come close to an acceptable monthly release.
---
Whitesprings service entrance to the Enclave - the dumpsters are full of bodies and there is a lot of bones laying around.
---
You said that whales buy things to flaunt to people other than "the same 20 people over and over".  By your own logic then all it takes is enough players that you dont see the same 20 people over and over.  My reply was just that, I don't see the same 20 people over and over.
---
The internet craps on 76 because it's really bad. This isn't a conspiracy.
---
Take another upvote
---
Rage was an absolute joke on PC and a pretty subpar game in general. I got it for like 5 bucks and honestly I'd rather have bought a few rolls of toilet paper.
---
lol, yes! 
---
Well. They have addressed the game breaking bugs. The problem is that every time they do, a new one crops up.
---
Then again, I'm one of those people who never experienced any game breaking bugs and had no problem with my playthrough so yeah I can't sympathize with the game breaking bugs arguement.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I will help you through that quest. We can also get you some power armor that isn‚Äôt for total brokedicks 
---
Week one required hotfixes slowly being rolled out after the game died. Fun times.
---
Now im not 100% sure how this works but id guess that if they delete you from their friend list, they just show up as offline in your friend list
---
This is excellent!
---
Get a fucking job if you really hate it that much. 
---
Considering it was billed as 'fallout with your friends' I think most of us wanted co-op/pve, not a pvp focused 'muh e-sports' chaser
---
Not sure if line intern can handle this.
---
If they‚Äôre near a radioactive area they will regen health over time. If their health bar doesn‚Äôt decrease at all then it‚Äôs probably a bug. 
---
Yeeeeessssssss
---
May I ask how many other sandbox survival multiplayer games you played and what they were?
---
And are you past 100hrs already?
---
&gt;noclip 
---
And clearly, you don't either. As a PVP game, Fallout fails miserably which is directly comparable to any other PVP shooter out there who all manage to do it just fine. On top of that, there's literally thousands  of multiplayer games out there that do PVE coop games that work flawlessly. We have real world examples, go and play a few more games toher than the fallout series and you'll see for yourself.
---
I also talked about 100 servers. But we know that's not the case either. I was illustrating a point that reducing the playerbase exposure to other players directly impacts the monetisation of the game. Bethesda are not maintaining the servers out of the kindness of their hearts so that people can 'have fun'. They are doing it as an investment to see returns from the atom shop. So why would they make a business decision that directly impacts that revenue stream?
---
Nylon is plastic -- I'd much rather have a nylon bag than some crappy canvas thing -- I get enough gunpowder from Super Mutants.
---
This is pretty common knowledge. Beth(the ones who made ES and FO 3 and 4) is probably working on ES: VI, and just supervising FO76.
---
Yes, but have they ever had a game where retailers ended up giving the game away for free if a customer purchased a used controller or there were large discounts within weeks of a prior game's release? I'm just wondering what their ROI is and if they've decided letting it die would be less unprofitable than devoting more staff hours to making it more successful. 
---
Definitely not quite than a wipe - can't really compare "delete any and all character progress" with "delete stuff about the max inventory size"
---
Now I'd wager that threw number of people who legitimately have inventories this large numbers in the low thousands. The hyper peer player. They'll figure something out; the long term positives for this would be worth inconveniencing a very, very small section of the player base
---
I might sound na√Øve, but I do believe things with the game are getting better, server wise and the glitching, not perfect but getting better. 
---
Do you feel an obligation to whinge in every single thread that rubs you wrong is it it just your general emotional response to engage with things you are supposedly tired of seeing?
---
Rise up gamer.
---
it might be that he is lonely as humans need to interact with others as it helps the mental state and we are a social creature
---
The peeps at Respawn are clearly super talented though... Titan Fall 2 is amazing and would have been way more successful if it had been given a sensible release window.
---
FO76 is working on the same engine it's used for over a decade iirc - what are you talking about?
---
Things are getting better slowly but surely. I think.
---
Take my upvote sir, I remember that as one of the funniest FONV moments.
---
So how do you want to pay for the game?
---
The other day I was walking in low level territory (I'm 95) and picked up a level 1 hunting rifle. Well, instead of scrapping it, I went to a weapons workbench, I specced it completely out. Then, I went to some random level 5 player, and gave it to him along with 200 .308 rounds, 20 diluted radaways, and 20 purified waters.
---
I think I made his day. 
---
FO76 has a chance.  Its up to Bethesda.  But if they give up on it, there‚Äôs plenty of games coming this month and next month that I can spend my time on.
---
Your assumption is right but Bethesda's execution is wrong.  If I remember correctly, the only things that get lighter are Aluminum and Lead.  All others are heavier when bulked.
---
Call it whatever you like. There's nothing in the game I find challenging. Most bullets spongy enemies are super mutants and they go down in 4 bullets. 
---
I don't need a legendary crutch to do well.
---
I can craft you one if your on PC 
---
There is nothing suggesting that I either hate it or don't have a job. 
---
This is the worst bug when it hits you. I can deal with server drops, wonky ness, even once where I got dropped and had to restart a mission, but in a survival game where resources are carefully collected and prioritized for weeks...to have it erased for no reason does suck. Couple dozen hours of scrapping only to have it all wiped..not fun. I hope this bug is a high priority. 
---
Truth
---
What ranged build where you using? I run a ranged build and can kill stuff just fine. 
---
Shigeru Miyamoto: Challenge Accepted! (He started as a toymaker-manga artist).
---
&gt; I suggest you people get a job if you can't afford $18 PA skins. 
---
Or just don't buy them.  I can afford them, I just don't want them.
---
There may equally well be an impact on their revenue stream if they dont do something.  It's up to them to figure out which will do more damage I guess.
---
EA is just the publisher as I understand it. They had nothing to do with the game which is why it's actually good, or appears to be by all accounts. The Devs even publish the drop rates of items so you know exactly what you're paying for. Andrew Punchmyface must be on a holiday or something for this to have got through.
---
Unpopular opinion: The hate against pre-orders is stupid. Even if it's a leginimately good game you're pre-ordering (like Kingdom Hearts 3 or RDR 2), you're still gonna get *somebody* calling you "a total idiot for falling into scummy business practices" 
---
Like gee, even after 2018 has proven to be a *very* good year for great AAA games, there's still people going on about how you should never pre-order ever
---
The little lake front of train station, near top of the world, good place ..
---
common place 
---
Common spots I have noted in approximate popularity:
---
1. Any junk node with water feature
---
2. Any junk node without water feature
---
3. Behind Whitesprings Golf Club
---
4. Just outside Watoga near Phoenix
---
Ah OK I may reinstall and see if it's just the lead that's weighing me down then. Thanks for the info mate 
---
According to the ps4 and Xbox stats the silent majority are below level 25. Good chance the silent majority of people who purchased the game aren't playing.
---
Its a bug, I got it fixed by dropping my materials and picking them up
---
Melee mostly and sniper rifles when needed. No chems. 
---
Why does this have to be the par for AAA games though. These games should be functional at launch. 
---
Their roadmap is, leave 20% of one person working on it and hope all the players leave soon so they can stop paying for servers
---
If you hit almost anything it blows up the datacenter.
---
Yeah I assumed all these hoops would do nothing. 
---
Are they using a retooled Creation engine? Are they basically a multiplayer version of a Bethesda open world game?  
---
The point is not that there's other games out there kind of doing the same thing, the point is that this is Bethesda's specific ancient engine combined with Bethesda's specific kind of open world game that makes it quite different from other offerings, especially the in comparison to Fallout 76 highly limited and constrained Apex.  
---
I barely play Fallout games.
---
I think SamahLama is talking about your claim that "Post-release, Bethesda came to help Obsidian, it's true, it happened."  I've never heard about that.
---
Agreed. In it's current state, now worth the price of a AAA title. I bought it for ¬£8. I'm satisfied with the quality  I'm getting for ¬£8. If I had paid full price, I could appreciate the anger of those Players. In my case, I got what I paid for...
---
Ha! That‚Äôs where mine currently is! 
---
It usually happens if you have some of the repair materials in your inventory and stash. Have them all in one and it works 
---
I guess this is peoples first real online game lol. I've been in many and they all lack direction. If you don't like grindfests then maybe mmorpg just isn't for them. That being said its funny to see so many haters down voting my post . Like it or not it's true it's a brand new game they have been working and patching and trying. I know everyone wanted a end something to aim for so they all figured being op with the best build and weapons. A long life RPG like this is everything changes. It a progression of a story line and as I said instant gratification. I have to be the best and have the best. Don't like the truth to all my negative homies go play world of tanks see if you enjoy a real shit show of nerfs and buffs and micro transactions and reskins.  I appreciate the work they are striving to make here. I'll stick to what I said cause it's true.  Sorry for the side run to your comment lol just say the -33 needed to be addressed. 
---
Tl:dr As you said it seems a lack of thought its a changing world, they want our opinions so we can make it our own. Everyone needs to quit being babies about it, and if you think this is bad you haven't been around real shite houses of games...
---
My hero.
---
Yeah, I thought that was odd, too.
---
All guns have very low durability 
---
Bad take. Pre orders are why we get games like Fallout 76 and why almost every game we get nowadays is a buggy mess. Did you play games before 2010? Remember the completeness? We don‚Äôt get that nowadays because people give developers their money in full months before their finished with the game. Bad take, friend.
---
I've played Korean F2p cashgrabs that were better. I've played dozens of AAA MMOs. None were this bad.
---
did you not read the part where they specifically addressed that? 
---
Got a whole box of Legendary Bobby Pins, Next patch they will only weigh .5 each.
---
I have extras available for 200 caps each.
---
I love the game, as broken as it is. But I don‚Äôt play much any more. Lev 155 and nothing to do. 
---
We're not - me and my mates dropped it after we finished the main story line. 20% was good, 80% was awful but we still had fun, despite the flaws and that's only because we played together. If this was a single player game, it would have been unistalled a few hours after launch.
---
Put all your junk in your stash, it's a bug, if they're separate it won't work
---
I need to get on and look at the recents list to see if I recognize his name...
---
Could also be because the materials needed are partly on your character and partly in your storage. Might help to have all the materials in one place! 
---
True that!
---
Yeah for sure. Back when I had people who played regularly we discussed pvp zones like a runescape wilderness. We couldn't figure out a reason why they would do it tho lol
---
Now cazadors wouldnt make sense lore wise as they are a Big Mountain creation
---
that's pretty neat!
---
definitely a bug. as others mentioned, this is going to be the screen where you pick between the current mode/rules (Adventure) or the one with no PvP rules (Survival).
---
Hahaha love them!
---
Science!  That's how it works.  Mr Fantastic is the only real scientist in  the wasteland.
---
The criteria for placement of my camp only requires it be central to the region I am currently exploring and a short walk to a vendor.  Have not had to consider the proximity of resources in camp placement.  
---
I wish they had a save option that was console based. So I can save manually and backup to USB. I know online games save to the cloud, but this extra level of protection would be so handy for restoring when stuff goes south. 
---
Why are you comparing this to WoW constantly. That's like comparing Batman v Superman to the TDK. One is horrible one was very good. 
---
The secret to Cazadors, no armor. As in they have no armor what so ever, so hit em with hollow points and they drop.
---
On topic, I don't care what they add as long as they add SOMETHING with a different amount of armor, I'm talking &lt;10 or &gt;1000, all enemies fall into the same narrow 100-200 range that completely defeats the purpose of the armor system and throws the entire weapon balance out of whack, also enemies with distinct vulnerabilities, what is the point of having separate energy and physical defense if both numbers are the same, oh wait, it's that you can't pierce energy defense, flawless.
---
If you're still considering playing I can hook you up with some ammo and mats, I'm currently resting on my laurels till the rumored shared stashes and vendor bots are implemented. 
---
Stealth Deathclaw.
---
I did.  But did you?  
---
I think misunderstanding this term is *part of* why people have different expectations of how it works.  It's not a *passive* mode.  You can't be passive and let people attack you and be fine.  It's *pacifist* mode.  A pacifist doesn't hurt others, but pacifists can be hurt by others.  I think the distinction is important, and maybe there'd be less confusion about how it works if people thought about what it's actually called.
---
Although, having said all that, I'd love for Bethesda to put a truly passive mode in the game.  I have no interest in PvP.
---
Splitting the playerbase is plan Z. Why is 'griefing' on the rise? Boredom. Why is there boredom? An awful endgame gameplay/feedback loop.
---
If they split the playerbase they might as well resign the game to being a wasteland-skinned building simulation game.
---
Didn't Skyrim sell massively more copies upon release than 76, though? And it was well reviewed upon release, as well. Lots of 9/10, 8/10, 94% on Metacritic, etc.
---
FO 67 was a flop upon release, sales are off, and I don't see Bethesda injecting a lot of staffing into course correcting. I tried to log in before work today and got disconnected three times (XB) and we're already four months past launch. 
---
The bean counters may have decided it will be less unprofitable to devote as little staff hours as possible to it to mitigate financial losses. It certainly doesn't seem like there's a sense of urgency on their end to correct issues to make the game more enjoyable. 
---
Bobbleheads don't stack anymore
---
At least melee is *kinda* badass
---
They‚Äôre truly just uninspired garbage enemies taken from Skyrim. 
---
Edit* 
---
What you just said is my main concern with the new pvp server. It sounds like it could be fun (except for bullying).
---
In my opinion, this game is very engaging and immersive. It looks like they really want it to work. 
---
I‚Äôve done a lot of pondering on purchasing the game, so many people I spoke to don‚Äôt even own it. 
---
I paid ~18 USD. YES. 
---
You should be coming up on a mission (I believe in a medical center) where you get a bunch of stimpacks as a reward.
---
By the water near mothman museum has a bunch.
---
I will be sure to hire a bunch of modders and release a mod-supported public client with that 30 million dollars. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
My friend lost his calibrated shocks excavator leg due to this same issue. I hope they fix that, because that Mod is extremely hard to find now. 
---
Pvp needs a rework for sure. All I know is unless I'm looking for a fight I keep pacifist on . To many times I have gotten a bounty because I tried to kill a wolf attacking soneones base and actually hit the wall or something stupid like that lol
---
I, thankfully, had a near flawless experience with nondlc Skyrim on the Xbox 360 and PS3 with I think only one side quest ever becoming glitched on me and beyond that nothing ridiculous happened, besides getting catapulted into the sky by a giant at low levels.
---
I enjoyed that game so much I played it on Master difficulty as a sneak archer build to purposefully challenge myself, and bonus played it like Hardcore difficulty from New Vegas was on so I had to eat, drink, and sleep.
---
Over a thousand hours combined total on Skyrim, I enjoyed it.
---
I love MMOs lite games. Destiny2 is great now. Anthem  was a blast. Borderlands was cool.  PoE is fantastic.
---
Neither were as buggy or endgame free as 76. They also have better loot systems.
---
I did not see any mention of them addressing the regular scortchbeast encounters besides the sonic blast. Only mention of reward payoff was for the Queen. So if you could please show me what I missed I would be happy to see it. And I am not trying to be mean, I would honestly be happy to see it.
---
i don't know which gun initially caused this but my main weapons were bloodied explosive 10mm submachine gun, furious explosive shotgun and a two shot automatic teslarifle.
---
It was working fine before but suddenly i noticed that nothing died, tried relogging, the same issue persisted, closed the game and still the same issue and then the game crashed but even that didn't fix it.
---
it doesn't matter if i use a lvl5 pistol or a tse, all damage is instantly healed back.
---
why so salty?
---
They have already gave up with FO76 on Bethesda. They sold almost 2 million copies and got some profit, but they aren't risking anymore money on this game and its development. All resources are addressed now to create a new bubble. I hope that people will remember truth when Bethesda starts marketing their next new game. People should remember how they marketed FO76 and what we got. We got only empty promises and broken game.
---
And they should. When a company makes a crap product, this is exactly the backlash they should receive. Nobody should ever buy an EA game, period, for how they've treated the gaming industry -  that's like you going on a holiday to a lepar colony, contracting leprosy and congratulating EA on their ability to remove your dead flesh as it starts falling off and yet, millions of people go to Lepar island each year.
---
Thats how you spawn a atomshop queen 
---
I want the Quantum Deathclaw that was cut from Nuka World in Fallout 4. It looks like a glowing one but with the Quantum blue glow. It would be an awesome addition to the game. Maybe a new event at the Nuka Cola factory that spawns Quantum/Nuka variants of enemies. Nukalurks, Nukalurk Queens &amp; Kings maybe. They'd deal radiation damage and move faster than normal variants due to their unusual diet of irradiated soda from the factory.
---
I haven't played in over a week.
---
I don't miss it.
---
I guess I'm moving on.  I just came here to see if anything wonderful had happened.
---
I know the hp regain may be a problem with the explosive effects 
---
I bought the game. I gave them $60.
---
Is the Beta any good? Played the original so looking forward to the next one.
---
This system has many similarities to New Vegas' armor system, low damage per shot struggles against anything with even a little bit of armor, but you had low health enemies with lots of armor, and high health enemies with no armor. Cazadors, the scourge of the desert had no armor, not even the legendary or the fearsom specimen 73, no armor whatsoever, 0, yet were still terrifying threats in the end game, and you really wanted a dps bullet hose firing hollow points to put them down fast. It's like if New Vagas put 15 extra armor on every enemy, suddenly most of the guns and ammo diversity of the game goes away, hollow points become worthless, every gun needs armor piercing ammo or bust, and the anti matteriel rifle becomes completely mandatory for dealing with most threats whose armor now crawls up into the 25-50 range requiring that full 110 base damage.
---
The way the devs use the armor system in this game dramatically favors burst damage to an almost comical degree.
---
The ratio of damage to armor determines final damage, and as all enemies have a ton of armor any weapon dealing less than 200 damage per shot is going to be heavily gimped in terms of damage, not 20, TWO HUNDRED is the critical mass where a weapon's damage starts taking a heavy drop against enemy armor, weapons like the minigun are straight terrible, having their damage reduced by a factor of around 7, while a super sledge in it's base form is dealing around a third of it's damage, but with perks can easily reach the point where it does the majority of the actual damage listed while the minigun almost crawls to 1/4.
---
I did the math, against 100 armor a gatling gun needs only 47 bullets to out-damage a minigun's full 500, that is how big a difference 79 damage makes against 14, a factor of 10.6 rounds to one for a damage difference of 7.5.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
There is a handy chart at the side that shows how shafted a low damage weapon gets, with a 25 damage weapon suffering a 70% loss of damage against a target where a 250 damage weapon only loses 30%, meaning the 25 damage weapon has to hit &gt;23 times to do the same damage, and a 10 damage weapon has to hit 80 times, dealing a theoretical 800 damage to match 250.
---
ALPHA is king
---
food for though, a high level super mutant has 178 armor, so when I say 100 armor, I'm talking mid game trash here or assuming you have decent armor piercing.
---
Armor needs a rework in this game, badly, or at the very least the devs need to understand what armor means for weapon balance. They give higher level enemies more and more armor like a second health bar, making them exponentially stronger and demanding higher and higher alpha strike damage to overcome these higher and higher resistances, if all guns did the same damage per shot this wouldn't matter, but there are weapons like the minigun that struggle against the armor of level 10 enemies but can't be acquired before level 35, as if it is supposed to scratch even lightly armored end game threats, lightly armored in this context being 100 or so armor on the shirtless scorched who are the lowest armor enemies at any particular level, super mutants approach 200 armor, and some of the top end enemies can close in on 300 armor at the top end. Remember, 14 armor is all that is needed to cut a minigun's damage in half, so even giving it 95% armor penetration wouldn't matter.
---
Then there are energy weapons, that don't get armor piercing, have lower alpha damage to compensate the fact that "most enemies are vulnerable to energy damage" as the devs seam to operate, in spite of the fact energy resistance across the board is HIGHER than physical, a honeybeast, which is "vulnerable" to fire and cryo (energy damage) has 132 armor, and 150 energy resistance, those super mutants with 178 armor, they have 300 energy resist. If energy weapons had double the damage output of their normal counterpart they would only be about the same, and in many cases still far worse. Remember, there is nor armor piercing for energy weapons.
---
Yet, if you can put a weapon over the critical threshold of damage you can negate the armor system entirely.
---
The problem is that it takes a lot to get over this threshold, and there is no reason for this threshold to even be a thing in the first place, it's just bad use of design.
---
Enemies can be challenging without any armor whatsoever, this type of enemy would require completely different tactics, mechanics, and weapons to deal with, but no such enemy exists because Bethesda decided to just give every enemy large amounts of armor without understanding the consequences of doing so. The minigun is a weapon that has a minimum level of 35, but is only good for killing level 10 and below enemies, yet Bethesda seams to think it would be useful and have so many in game references to it as something praise worthy when it is completely worthless.
---
If there was one enemy in the game who had no armor and a ton of health then the minigun would have a use, as it has the highest theoretical dps there is, it's just complete wank because the least armored enemy has 100 armor and it only takes 14 to cut it's damage in half.
---
If you took all the armor off a super mutant, and gave them 10x more hit points then a minigun would kill faster, while a super sledge would kill slower and both would end up about even.
---
The system also makes buffing weird, double a weapon's damage and you nearly quadruple it's effectiveness because you also end up halving armor, which is why explosives were so over the top powerful.
---
Honestly, all they need to do is make some enemies armored, and some not.
---
Give scorched 3 times more health and no armor, suddenly the minigun shreds through them, while big hitters take longer to kill.
---
There is no reason for every single enemy in the game to have heavy armor.
---
This system has many similarities to New Vegas' armor system, low damage per shot struggles against anything with even a little bit of armor, but you had low health enemies with lots of armor, and high health enemies with no armor. Cazadors, the scourge of the desert had no armor, not even the legendary or the fearsome specimen 73, no armor whatsoever, 0, yet were still terrifying threats in the end game, and you really wanted a dps bullet hose firing hollow points to put them down fast. It's like if New Vegas put 15 extra armor on every enemy, suddenly most of the guns and ammo diversity of the game goes away, hollow points become worthless, every gun needs armor piercing ammo or bust, and the anti materiel rifle becomes completely mandatory for dealing with most threats whose armor now crawls up into the 25-50 range requiring that full 110 base damage.
---
Enemies who are heavily armored should scale with level, if you make super mutants the "Heavy" humanoids, give the low level ones 80 armor, and scale that up over the levels to 160-180, adjusting health appropriately, enemies relying on armor should approximately double at high levels to match player weapon scaling. However enemies with little to no armor need the same scaling, if scorched have no armor at level 1 then they should still have little to no armor at level 68, I mean maybe 10 max, enemies should either have huge health low armor, high armor low health, or medium amounts of both.
---
Put an enemy in with 25 hitpoints and 10k armor, that's completely fine, put an enemy with 10k health and no armor, that's actually fine, don't make every enemy the exact same 175 +/-25 that completely wrecks specific weapons.
---
And make enemies with meaningful differences in resistances. 200 armor and 180 energy resist does not automagically make an enemy weak to energy weapons, especially considering energy weapons are on average worse than bullet guns by a larger margin than that minuscule armor difference. There was exactly one enemy in fallout 4 that was meaningfully weak to energy weapons, and only because of a misplaced decimal point. The enraged fog crawler, with 350 energy resist and an unrivalled 4000 armor, consider the morphs before had 250/300 and 300/350 and it's obvious it was meant to be exactly as boring as every other enemy in the game. This was the one interesting enemy, who's defenses made gameplay different,  that made energy weapons something you considered using for their effectiveness, and it was actually believe it or not slightly vulnerable to the minigun because it's armor was so over the top it came back around, because the game has a damage reduction cap, so when all weapons are doing 9% damage, the minigun having the highest base dps meant it actually started to be better than other guns when armor started climbing over 1400, meaning completely over the top armor can have interesting idiosyncrasies of it's own. But all enemies must far into a very narrow and mind numbingly boring range that ruins automatics and dramatically favors heavy hitters.
---
this is what‚Äôs actually supposed to happen. the lvl 100 players are causing those lvl 60 enemies to spawn. same thing happened to me, a server hop or 2 should help.
---
Yes WHAT is the purpose of bulking?? Never figured that out. I thought it was to reduce weight for storage but it was just a guess. 
---
Whitesprings, tons of camps there
---
.. but I do have more on my blocked list due to griefing practices.
---
Yeah, gear is much deeper. I have a blue chest piece with 2 talents already
---
I think that‚Äôs fair feedback.  System or server glitches need to be addressed and there‚Äôs plenty of feedback out there if Bethesda really wants to solve those problems. 
---
Instead, I sense more knee jerk reactions (see the last two patches) and that‚Äôs pissing everyone off.  I‚Äôd rather deal with ridiculous TSE levels or body armor that never breaks down than my bulk scrap disappearing or constantly being disconnected in the middle of events.  
---
Were can you find player count?
---
Well I've had this game since early January.  Ive been kicked from a server 3 times. Had the game crash 1 time and got stuck in a loading screen 1 time. My wife has had similar experiences only hers is more linked to wifi because our appt has poor internet and solid brick walls that weakens wifi. Our 3 friends who have it do not report any major server connection issues.  But to listen to this and other sub reddit the servers are so bad you can't play for more then a half an hour.
---
Equally each and every time my wife,friends or I kill a legendary mob we get a legendary weapon/armor.
---
We have never had any item disappear from stash box.
---
Never noticed diseases effecting mutations we get though radiation exposure. 
---
Never noticed perk sharing being interrupted. 
---
Never see the well rested buff ending early.
---
We must have won the lotto.
---
Hire two modders from Nexus with $100000 and have them fix most issues in a week. Then use the rest on Coke n hoes.
---
And you evidence for this moronic claim you're making is where?
---
even if they can't do that because of copyright they could have it like team fortress 2 where players create cosmetics for others to like/promote and then the fo76 team could pick good ones out of that
---
But i would have to use melee perks which are in strength but then i cant use my carry weight perks so i would be constantly over encumbered,i would use my legendary armor which makes guns almost weightless but i cant because you have to use power armor in nuke zones and i have to be in nuke zones because that's literally the only content this game has.
---
Its a never-ending spiral of disappointment.
---
It's my opinion, you dumb fuck. 
---
No its more like if the smoke alarm is screaming becuase some smoke blew in theough the window set it off and the fire fighters are there saying theres no fire but everyones going batshit crazy because the smoke alarms going off so there must be a fire
---
Varies better than 76 atm.
---
I would accept "Season 2" servers that require a new character.
---
quickest reply ever LOL - cheers :)
---
While they're working on TES6, i think their main priority is Starfield since it's much closer to the release.
---
Video's or Screenshots. 
---
I don't think OP is lying at all. All I said was for OP to provide proof, as OP was the one who wanted to play the proof game.
---
So you see, I am not being idiotic, I am just responding in kind.
---
well doesn't matter anymore, if i launch the game and shoot with any gun the enemies still regain their health back.
---
Anywhere in particular in that area?
---
&gt;In my opinion, this game is very engaging and immersive.
---
So says everyone on their first 20 hours. That shine is superficial.
---
&gt;It looks like they really want it to work.
---
Not sure what developer commentaries you've been seeing.
---
Well, they're already going to split the player base with the incoming changes, so it's not *their* plan Z.  Would I prefer to see a massive overhaul with fixes and proper balancing and meaningful content?  Of course.  But the chances of that happening, compared to the chances of PVP/PVE servers...
---
And shower too.
---
Uhhh plasma is still practically unusable...... Four months later...
---
True, my friend list is 100+ people and there's only 3 - 7 people ever online.
---
It's been an issue since Beta my man and reported so many times i have lost track. 
---
u/LadyDevann here is another case of it. Can we expect a fix this year?.
---
Yeah, it's totally the same engine as the one designed for a single-player RPG. They didn't have to rewrite and retool large parts of it to get it working for multiplayer.  
---
Sigh.
---
The exact same thing happened to me.  
---
Levels 172, 56 and 42, and playing The Division 2 beta at the moment.
---
Can‚Äôt buy back from vender!???
---
Is this a bug or is it intentional? 
---
I think people have more important things to invest their money, and Bethesda should work hard in fixing and improving their game, not only in cosmetic things to take money from kids like you ;)
---
What do you think is causing all these people who posted positively about the game to now post negatively? 
---
Thanks! :) Which is your favorite boss you want to fight tomorrow?
---
Enemies spawn to whatever the player in the area is. So if a level 200 was there before you, the enemies will be higher level. Some enemies have a max level cap of, i think, 62, so that's what you're seeing. Believe it or not, once you get past level 50, if you choose to power level, you start leveling ridiculously fast. You get good gear, and a good weapon, and you start burning through ghouls at Whitesprings easily. Before a nerf a few patches ago, these enemies would give between 300-400 exp, and you could expect to kill no less than 50 in a nuke zone session. They still give about 150, which is still a good amount.
---
Might be server lag. Idk what platform you play on? 
---
I had to go explore the wasteland for a bit and come back to it. When you get to the point where scorchbeasts aren't so hard to take down it is pretty do-able.
---
well done!
---
They aren't splitting the playerbase because you don't *have* to go to Survival for PvP, you can stay on Adventure and do the exact same thing you do right now. Survival will be DOA because it doesn't offer anything new.
---
Lot's of Buffout mixed with Whiskey, Xcell, and probably the ~~blood~~ oil of their many fallen enemies.
---
I know that high level characters spawn high level enemies, however I'm uncertain to the specifics of how those mechanisms are calculated.  Do know though that certain areas are simply considered higher level areas, you'll find higher level enemies more easily in places like The Swamp, Cranberry Bog, Ash Heap, Savage Divide (Great Divide), and the Toxic Valley.  I think in order the low to high areas are the Forest, Ash Heap/Toxic Valley, Savage Divide, Swamp, Cranberry Bog.  So if you're exploring to the far east, prepare to run, heal, or fight a lot if you're not using 30+ level equipment.
---
Skeletons are spoopy.
---
Seconded
---
The numbers have really dropped off the last two weeks.   On a normal day, there‚Äôs less than 15 players on a board with me.  A month ago it was double that.  Since I am a lone wanderer it doesn‚Äôt bother me much but for some events it‚Äôs fun to team up with others 
---
Killed by tse? I have never even been shot at by another player. 
---
Sorry you made your tse a crutch. Sucks having to aim at the enemies instead of the ground huh?
---
Yeah for sure, I haven‚Äôt played in almost a month so I only know what I hear on reddit. If it‚Äôs getting better I‚Äôm glad lol
---
Fallout 3 was good, but I think there was less character to that one than the others. I thought the ending was really lame though.
---
FONV still runs like shit on PS.. Never was all that stable.
---
Basically everywhere 
---
Maybe, I don't know anything about the production of Starfield, and if it's really Beth game like ES:6 or Beth game like FO76?
---
I think i've just found my new hobby. I love brainteasers like this. Maybe I should drink first so I can run around nerd raging Scorched. ''Give me the 4th letter of the second line in the first cipher. I WANT NAMES!''
---
yes you are correct
---
I love that as soon as they announce they're going to mitigate the SBQ's spam attacks by a few seconds a thread pops up on the Bethesda forum pleading with them to change nothing about the SBQ. 
---
K.
---
An extremely charitable interpretation of that is that the forums and Reddit represent only a small fraction of the (even active) player base, and Bethesda wanted feedback from a broader selection of players. Of course, I see two issues with this:
---
1. Players not on Reddit/forums probably don't read Inside the Vault either.
---
2. The right way to do this would be to implement an in-game survey feature, or even just do a survey via email.
---
I think for now melee is fine but I know they'll nerf that too. I'm working on a new sneak build but with Secret Agent and covert operative. Not sure if I want VATS in it yet still deciding.
---
I prefer X01. Looks cool and I'm nigh immortal with emergency protocols and dodgy.
---
Can‚Äôt even bring myself to level another char. I tried and got him to twelve and couldn‚Äôt go anymore. I‚Äôm back to OW and waiting on Anthem. 
---
If you leave the vendor trade menu, then go back to trade, your items should be there.
---
Come on by, we have pie!
---
I keep playing because I simply enjoy it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong tho, I fully understand people‚Äôs frustration and hate towards Bethesda over the entire release. Their level of negligence and poor decision making is straight up incredible at this point. 
---
For me, I truly enjoy wandering around, working on my base and selling items. Each day that I play my goal is to clean out 7 vendors of their caps, so I head in their direction looking for things to gather and sell. Hoping to find new small details that I‚Äôve missed. I guess I‚Äôm just keeping my head buried in the sand hoping the game will catch up with its potential, but  I‚Äôm not bored of the game, and I can find things to keep me entertained. My friends and I seem to be like minded and enjoy it together as well. 
---
Waste is wrong even if you can afford it
---
Yeah, but it was really, really bad at the beginning. Like FO76 bad or even worse.
---
I've been saying that instead of farmers or mechanics with super high hit points being the scorched in high level areas.
---
It needs to be faction based, Raider ones in Savage divide, free states and BoS in the Mire, BoS in the Bog. 
---
At least then they got armor and better guns and that should be why they are hard. 
---
What style? Game looks like shit and cash shop has nothing good.
---
You're knowledge about game engine's is flawed then - just because an engine is "Ancient" as you put it, isn't a bad thing. Look at Armed assault, manages just fine to incorporate PVP and PVE and has been in development for almost 2 decades. That's the thing with game engines, they add more to them to make them more capable.
---
Bethesda have no more a "specific type of offering" than any other game out there and there's also a thing called beta testers and quality assurance. We've already heard from Todd Howard in the noclip documentary that MP fallout was on the table when they started developing FO4 and according to all of them, they new it could be done - they just couldn't be arsed to invest in it and made a substandrard that easily required another year of dev time,.
---
I just restarted with a new character. Always down to play with others. Ign is gennisib
---
We never left the beta 
---
The only problem with that is that since this is an MMO you can‚Äôt exactly have a local save and the save that the server has for you. There would be a conflict between the two saves and if they tried to compare and match the data may corrupt. Also, say you went and got killed and lost all your junk and then you just loaded a save from before when you died. It takes out the consequences of dying in a ‚Äúsurvival game‚Äù
---
They don‚Äôt even look at the game internally much while they‚Äôre making it. See: all the bugs from FO4 that still made it over because they just copy pasted.
---
SE of Top of the World and N/NW of Site Alpha seems to be a popular site (it's where my camp is). Lots of open space, nice views, sources of water, not near any enemy spawn locations, etc.
---
Roughly this area:

That comment right there. It speaks to my soul
---
There is no need to preorder a game.  You can just buy on the day.  They will never run out of copies.  
---
Same here really,
---
And then all the jackasses in this sub start their screaching "GOOD GET OUT WE NEVER NEEDED YOU IN THIS PERFECT GAME ANYWAY. I SEE YOU LAUNCHED 30 MODS FOR SKYRIM BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE JUST A FAKE FAN SHITPOSTER GTFO".
---
I paid ¬£60....
---
You have to be fucking kidding me with that response.
---
Never before could i be bothered to spend money on reddit coins/ rewards. But this one, this one did it for me.
---
Do something? This "threat" currently is and will always be completely irrelevant to Bethesda. Hell, I don't know that I've even see proof that Bethesda pays attention to this sub. If dude wants to rant, then fine, rant. But inflating your sense of self-importance to the point where you think some AAA company is going to suddenly quiver in fear, well, how delusional can you be?
---
It also was a common knowledge at the time.
---
This sounds pretty cool, I hope something like this happens!
---
Yeah but all of that would look pretty sloppy to me, I like how neat and organized I can make planters look
---
Her flying off into the distance os literally her exit from the encounter, she was not killed in time and won the encounter.
---
And yeah, she is coded as a character in a story. Your character is code too.
---
Something about my playstyles keeps me from encountering all the "GAME BREAKING NERFS" or whatever the latest craze is, and something about my setup or location or ISP generally keeps me from getting on problem servers.
---
As a result, I still play because I still enjoy it. 
---
(That's not to say other people don't have those issues, just with my setup I haven't really encountered them.)
---
&gt;Liberator MK-256
---
I hate Liberators so getting to fly in Vertibirds to fight it would be cool
---
There isnt. And when Rage 2 arrives to middling reviews (probably) and they go to E3 2019 with another fucking Creation (Gamebryo, and yes, it fucking is)  engine game, there wont be much future for Bethesda, either.
---
You might be right about that part.  Nobody enjoys being beaten, why go to a server where you're more likely to get beaten, when you could stay and pummel lowbies?
---
Like I said though, I still think the chances of us getting PVE servers are greater than the chances of griefing being solved any other way.  It's up to BGS to decide which route will do the most damage to their revenue stream.
---
Yeah lost something cool I can't remember what it was now but till that glitch is fixed I'll be skipping that event. 
---
Definitely. The structure is already there, they could still make money on microtransactions (sigh), but the content would actually be what we want.

Engery weapons do more damage and less mobs have resistance to them making them more powerful.  That said they are looking into increasing durability. 
---
What specifics of QBQ loot?
---
Super spooby
---
Huh....This game is faaaaar worse. Andromeda had at least 70%. This game is 50% which is nearly unheard of for an AAA game.
---
Anthem is poorly balanced, poorly performing, mediocre, late to the party again tripe. 
---
I completely agree on it not making sense. But I've see a few people post docs of what 10 regular junk material weighs and then what that same thing weighs bulked. I think like 3/4 of the junk ends up weighing more after bulked.
---
Handing out PvE servers as an 'easy fix' is tacit admittance from Bethesda that they don't have the necessary development macguffins to keep the game interesting. That should be a death knell either way.
---
What u/unashamed_liberal said. Alternatively, block them, then fast travel somewhere else.
---
Not really. When they take a game that dosen't crash and causes it to crash. That is a problem. 
---
downvoted you for that last line 
---
We see what you did there!
---
I wish the vault boys were animated, would be hypnotizing.
---
I'll go ahead and thank Disney for this one. I think if it wasn't for our outlash on BF2, they wouldn't be updating right now.
---
Leave and reenter menu.
---
a guy just has his entire stash disappear. I'd say that's fire, not smoke.
---
I was honestly gonna list everything that definitely configures a fire, but why bother. if you think this mess is fine as it is, then there's no discussion to be had.
---
&gt; If you like Fallout 4, then you'll probably like this game too.
---
I played FO4 for more hours than I'd like to admit. 
---
I used up all the content this game has to offer in less than a month.
---
Gives you that beehive hairstyle
---
Only dropping in because I recognized your name from the Conan sub and played on your server aswell.
---
I don't understand why after all this time if I craft ten boiled waters on a non nuked server, 'server not responding' 
---
The way they worded that.  There must be a considerable amount of players hoarding their free atoms.
---
Bethesda doesn't like this because you won't then pay for atoms with real money.  
---
ah gonk, ive seen you furiously posting this anywhere the chosen game gets criticized.  
---
they dont need to quit, that would be more of them not doing anything productive.  
---
i just think they are shitting in an already shat bed.   
---
and buy atoms!
---
Remember before the game came out?  People were SO into the idea of roleplaying.  I saw so many amusing Reddit posts about different things they were going to do.  One guy was going to tell campfire stories to everyone.  There was a group of Gary clones.  Post after post would roll in, with someone telling us what kind of wacky characters we were going to be running into.
---
I haven't seen much of that when playing.  
---
Bf2 has released new content quite a bit recently.
---
By the end of the month they will have pushed out a new map, 2 new heroes, a handful of new skins, a new game mode, and a number of patches within a 3 month span.
---
All for free. To me that is a considerable amount of updates.
---
Just give me a Mario event or some kind of fun whacky crossover event like Monster Hunter World does.  I would totally collect 'coins' (caps) while traversing specific trails fighting specific enemies until I got a power star (legendary item).  Make us fight mirelurks (goombas), a mirelurk queen as a bowser ripoff, and other enemies that mimic koopas and the various other enemies.

Dude, that's not even the problem. People don't hate whales JUST because they have more money. There are some games out there that aren't even technically pay to win that have them, and "normal" players still dislike the whales. There's one reason: the company tends to lean towards what will make the most money, and that means catering to the whales. If they see their "money-maker demographic" is a bunch of kids who steal their parent's credit cards, then they'll design their game around tempting those kids (this is already a thing with games like Fortnite). If it's based on lonely NEETs, then they'll amp up the waifu factor (see: F/GO, Azur Lane, pretty much all the asian gacha games). Even games like EvE slant their marketing towards the people they KNOW will shell out, even if the effect is less pronounced to an outsider like most people.
---
So, before you wail about haters or whatever, realize that the very existence of whales kills games for the causal player unless the devs are VERY conscientious and the company backing the game can restrain their visions of short-term gain for a long-time player base. Your spending habits represent a very real threat to a game they currently love, and want to keep enjoying.
---
by now I don't think items in the database aren't the actual problem even if Bethesda wants us to believe that they are because even when dupers were a thing (and apparently still are according to some posts?) they only let the servers crash for the duping process and otherwise the servers were just fine even if people carrying amounts of items that weight more than the entire map of Fo76.
---
I get the feeling the devs are just trying to talk around the real reason here and that's why it's always "stability problems" without even mentioning WHY and WHAT the problems would be.
---
I'm on ps4 myself. I checked my list the other day. There were 15 of us (including me) who used to play everyday. It was awesome. We couldn't even all get into the same server usually. Now it's just 1 person, if I'm lucky 2 online. 
---
I personally don't have the same drive to play. Since I hit platinum I haven't had a reason to play apart from pvp.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love this game. It just might be time to take a few month break.
---
I wonder if EA will make a bid to buy Bethesda.
---
It's easier running it solo. Less enemy spawns. 
---
Sounds like someone (not you) is having issues with their own sexual identity...
---
That would be so awesome.
---
From what I've seen, the only purpose of bulking items is to sell it. Not That we don't have enough other stuff waiting to sell with the vendor cap limits.
---
nobody tested it extensively but it seems to cap at 30% of your total damage (and not the weapon's base damage)
---
I just recently googled this and found a reddit post that it's something like 15% of base dmg added with each consecutive hit.
---
Example 100 base would be 100 115 130 ect.
---
Oof...shoulda spent it on Monster Hunter
---
Pc, everyone else killed with guns, not me though
---
It takes 3 wood, 1 steel and 1 ballistic fiber to craft 1 wood
---
Cool, thanks for letting me know you've seen me post on here. Graded +A for quality.
---
You can get through the game via guns still easily, but Melee is extremely strong in comparison.  It's one of the reason so many people are quitting.
---
The one saving grace to this is if Bethesda's done with it, hopefully they'll open it up to modders. 
---
Careful, Bethesda apologists will say you shouldn't be spamming conform in the menus what ghouls are chewing on your butthole.
---
As I said, I would love to be proven wrong and for them to fix the bugs, introduce meaningful new content, and balance it out well.  Unfortunately, as it happens, I don't think they do in fact have the macguffins to do that in a timely manner.
---
The thing in luckyhole mines as well
---
...and walking distance from my spot!
---
I played the demo weekend.  It was fun to play but it was PUGs.   Its like a diablo game with actual fun combat... as long as people stay in the zone to do the actual combat and not fly to the zone edge and force everyone to leave while killing nothing at all.  Repeat until get to the boss.   Pretty environments and nice to explore... If you can do that.  
---
After finishing all the demo quests, you are allowed to explore but could not figure out how to get grouped in that case.   But there was no bosses or quests or anything, just a sandbox area.
---
Absolutely 
---
It's not "forcing" you to. It's just because you want the highest damage possible. At a certain point damage is just dick measuring.  
---
There's a few other builds that are almost as good and tuned. They all need their own perks and legendary gear to be really viable, just like melee. Plus explosive is currently bugged with some effects.
---
Consider: crit rifleman with anti-armor+aim damage rifle and Chameleon/Weightless. Not as good DPS but still good enough damage for everything in the game. Or a heavy Gunner with a Furious+fire rate build. Plenty of damage and viability. Shotgunners are still set with their TSEs
---
Really the only builds that don't seem to have the damage output is a pure explosive build and also pistol builds seem really weak.
---
the same reason anyone posts on here, some spare time to waste on a mobile app.
---
Don't know what to tell you.  Might be s problem on your end then
---
I didn't say any of that dumbass, hope you feel better now that you've projected your retardation onto someone else 
---
Ok, it get's more weird. After I log on the next day, my normal Gronak Axe is gone and the one I was missing is back. Ahh well, I can live with that option. :)
---
We're talking about Bethesda backing up their own data that saves your inventory on the ~~cloud~~   internet- It might not get everything but at least people wouldn't lose their entire inventory of items like the OP did. The character data needs to be held on the servers since PC's could have a HDD failure and then you're.... oh - in the same position as you are now with Bethesda saving everything lol! If that was intentional it was quite genius ;-)
---
 I'm hoping for a 3-Star Furious Fuse with Anti-Armor and Faster Attack Speed. If anyone has one they want to sell, I have caps.
---
I'm sure none of those games had the dreaded and frankly CRIMINAL development cycle of updates,patches and hotfixes. 
---
Given, lol 
---
Omg it *has* been since 2010 when video games started going down hill.
---
I feel like the intro to Samurai Jack's fifth season.  'It's been 8 years, video games have stopped being released complete and polished.  The suffering continues.  Gotta get back, back to the past.'
---
I‚Äôm surprised I haven‚Äôt seen any Radi-gators instead of gator claws. A variant of deathclaw that looks like an alligator but weaker is quite boring
---
You're right about all the issues with looting, the only thing i disagree with you is the viability of ranged weapons.
---
I only use ranged weapons and my main damage dealer it's a 1 star Instigator hunting rifle. I can one shot pretty much everything. Today i encountered a lvl 92 Glowing Deathclaw in whitesprings. 1 sneak crit shot to its head did about 60% damage. 
---
Maybe you have encountered some odd damage bug, or perhaps your perk cards aren't really focused on a weapon type. I can't kill anything with automatic guns for example but that's because i invested so much in rifles. 
---
Melee is indeed powerful, and really popular but today during uranium fever (or whatever it's the name) i was able to pick up targets and kill them before the other people nearby got the chance to tag them. Felt bad and switched to the Tesla rifle. 
---
I do believe that a good rifle combined with a build that's heavily focused on improving rifles has more stopping power than a melee build. 
---
I can't wait for the day when i'll get an Instigating+VATS critical shots do +50% damage+25% less VATS Action Point cost rifle. 
---
Yeah, sure. None of those games Ever had any bugs shortly after its release, or required patches/hotfixes after an update. GOT EEEEEEEEEEEEM.
---
I just recommend not giving Bethesda money until they get their shit together.
---
Yeah that happened to me once (thankfully it was my mate's base so he just got the 10 caps). I avoid people's camps for the most part. When the wolves come I just grab my trash weapons so I don't accidentally hit their walls.
---
Personally I leave passive off. If I mess up and get a bounty, I deserve whatever comes my way (I love when bounty hunters show up just to get wrecked).
---
Thanks for the offer! I will keep it in mind. Not sure what my next move is, maybe take a breather until the game is more stable...
---
Awesome CAMP blocker, but could do without the sirens.  Or perhaps put them on a timer switch.
---
Yeah its relatively cheap to the past few years of extreme gouging. Fortnite highlighting their 15 dollar skins.  20 bucks spent gets you one thing. Also  that is not being a whale and is a horrible example. A whale doesn't buy one outfit. He buys the store. Currently the game doesn't have enough store items to break 1k. I know most whaling comes out to like 1-50k+ on most phone apps. Games like bdo where your spending 300-400 a month just to stay relevant is barely the fish game makers are searching for.  I get it. 
---
I don't know what your exactly trying to get at as far as me getting mad. Because that's just pulled out of thin air.  If anything i feel next to nothing? Yay capitalism? 
---
 I actually make plenty but still smart enough to not make poor financial decisions i guess. Rather i budget out expenses. For gaming i have a set rate im willing to spend a month and whatever doesn't, ends up in stocks. Now personally i can do up to 300 a month on gaming.  Take away 45 for buying the game on amazon and  saved 15 there but i guess only the poor jealous people would do that?  Also bought elder scrolls online last night for 10.  A little indie game for 20. SO in total i have spent 75 dollars in 3 months. Leaving me way under budget and bethesda not picking up that coin. I mean i don't see anything wrong with being frugal and saving money instead of shitting it down a toilet. Are there people above me with larger disposable income just for gaming? I'm sure of it and how they spend it is their decision. I can still have emotions that disagree with yours. Growing up has nothing to do with this.
---
 In the case of these in-game items i don't agree with pricing nor am i willing to shell it out. Many people agree with that stance and you so happen to be here in the platform that supports that viewpoint. 
---
Because the normal assault was there first and they‚Äôre not just gonna throw away one asset because one does more damage.
---
C ycloPhile... Xbox one s ... my missile turret has been mia all week.  Budget is full as if it's there still,  can't build a new one. 
---
Wow so woke dude thanks for responding
---
that's right, this is a no fun zone. IF you are not here to pin all your frustrations on a video game, you must go back!
---
Bones galore at the bottom, -shudders-, so many...  Just so many...
---
Congrats...I have over 500 hours of playtime and still no tse. 
---
I have one, two actually!
---
Im gonna see it myself
---
"broken" name a online game that didn't require updates,patches and fixes  in the following months of its release.
---
Nobody is saying they didn't. We're talking about releasing a game relatively bug free - so Apex didn't have to be written from the ground up just like every other game, ever developed, even when they're using a game engine other than their own? They're still using the FO4 engine - it's now being developed to include MP aspects - they didn't scrap the FO engine and start from scratch to make a completely new one, did they?
---
The one that spawns brahmin, right?
---
Cause that's the only lake around there, so no one needs to go looking for other base locations near there.
---
The ONLY lake around there, GOT IT?!?
---
I can't speak to the formula, but you're right, the higher the lvl of a player in the area, the higher the lvl of the spawns.
---
Turning up in an area thats been spawned by a high lvl player kind of sucked at first, but looking back at it, the challenge was kind of fun.  Being scared of stuff was fun.  I'm by no means high lvl, but that anxiousness is pretty much gone.\*\*   I'd say enjoy it while it lasts, because it's fleeting.  
---
\*\**Except when a squad of 4 150+ show up at my workshop*.
---
That's a good chem mix, I was told to never mix drugs!!
---
But seriously, I'm aware of the higher level areas but considering the player is being sent there in the main quest at as a low level character, it seems odd that there isn't a way to either match make lower level characters into the same servers or provide instanced enemy levels as they do with instanced loot.
---
Welp OP, better get that bonesaw and get to work on that arm, you'll still have the other one to use your new gauntlet with.
---
hahahahaha you bought the power armor edition
---
I would get reported for wasting everyone in bf3 using the lmg's and bipod lol.. good stuff. I dont think fall ok it could be that level of blanched with the character customization the way it is but still some fun to be had!!
---
I surprisingly found a fun challenging experience with customization to a good degree more than i expected when i went in for the d3 expansion on their holiday sale. after what made 76 fun i extracted a lot of fun in similar ways of playing the action dungeon thing (without any of that slow game that i also enjoy and 76 offered me) that feels way more finished and allowing the player the freedom to try out the different special equipment and make a playstyle they enjoy. i think 76 is an awesome game and find it odd how badly they are failing to hear the actual playerbase of the casual players who would sustain it. i'm still here, just playing slow and spending time in different games and in the community conversation to see how its gonna keep on going, hopefully less bad but my hope level is low.
---
One of us is the dumb fuck here and it's you.
---
This happen on xbox also. And it happens alot
---
LOL That's the same question my wife asks me. She asks "if everyone has left and you say no one is online playing this game why not do something else?"
---
Like what clean the bathroom? I say.
---
I don't know, I have always thought Bethesda made great games. I played Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Skyrim to death. Fallout 4 and New Vegas a little less. 
---
I keep playing probably because I remember the words that drove me mental.
---
"War...... War never changes"
---
and
---
When you watch trailers like this and they still give you chills.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1AenlOEXao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1AenlOEXao)
---
I guess I just love their games.
---
Will still play, will discover.
---
That‚Äôs their plan
---
Yeah OP was huffing some strong paint if they thought Bethesda's bug filled releases were the gold standard
---
The Sirens give it a Silent Hill kinda vibe
---
Wish Order of Mystery: Novice quest was not broken for me and perhaps I could get that far.
---
I'd be shocked if the number wasn't in the low tens of thousands.  
---
The mule account is a staple of MMO's, and maybe of us buy in with the understanding we will be purchasing 2, 3 or 4 accounts. This is doubly true when 4 weeks into '76 you could get Keys for $11.00 USD.   
---
Those of us using mules, for most of us it would be just as bad, we see the lost items as lost progress.  
---
Lol ur such a noob! Lern 2 play! \#hashtagREKT!
---
I mean i literally cant use guns, enemies wont die. I can spend 10000 rounds on a radroach it wont fucking die.
---
Heavy Gunner is not a viable build in this game...
---
Those complaints are extremely overexaggerated. I'm level 130 and only once ran out of ammo and had my most useful weapons break, and that was when I did 3 Scorchbeast Queen fights in a row without visiting my stash in between. My power armor was overrepaired to 150-200% at the start and only 2 pieces were below 100% at the end. 
---
Sure, if you server hop constantly and never do any exploring your stuff will break, but maintaining your gear isn't onerous at all and a normal part of the game.
---
Welcome friend. Join me on apex. Guns work there. :)
---
This IS my fav fallout game (from 2, 3, 4)! I love that you build your s.p.e.c.i.a.l. stats/character as you level, it's maybe the first time that I have gotten the intricacies of that aspect of the game.
---
Boy, just collecting the holotapes in Whitesprings completely evaporated my Stimpaks and RadAway I'd collected up until then! I've heard people say it's a great place to set up your CAMP but from what I can see, the place is constantly being nuked.
---
Possibly. It hasn't been released yet so I'll withhold judgement.
---
Indeed... to a point.
---
The majority of posts here are to negative for my tastes, but a lot of them have a point. Personally speaking, all I really need is more communication from the developers to see if I am going to make a long term investment of time into this game.
---
That said, I am not one of those players who are going to move on. At level 108, I can't help but feel I am just hitting my stride on this game. There are still sections of the wonderful map I have to explore. 
---
Well you know the old saying...  
---
If an SBQ falls in a nuke zone, did she really exist to begin with?
---
I CANT KILL ANYTHING NO MATTER HOW MUCH I SHOOT IT.
---
Seriously do people think that all the issues with the game are just people who don't understand the game.
---
Nothing is better about the server stability. Still getting disconnects and crashes after the latest hotfix. 
---
Regular armor here. I have a piece of Leather Armor that gives me 20% drop in weapon weight... was playing with the idea that they - somehow - applied weight perks to damage, but again, the math didn't really work out at all.
---
When it impacts you (for whatever reason) you can see it easily by fast traveling. You're weapon damage will bounce up and down as you do. It will also change seemingly randomly just staying in the same spot, but that may take a bit.
---
I've toyed with everything I can think of and aren't seeing any kind of meaning to it...
---
Relevant username.
---
It is but outside the game
---
Still lol 
---
TSE doesnt need to be reverted. What they need is to buff all the other guns and such. What does need to be reverted is the blanket Demo Expert nerf that gives a giant middle finger to explosives users in general.
---
btw: I find that they all get boring when your character becomes OP and you can 1 shot everything
---
If you walk the trail leading up to their bodies you can 'see' how the fight played out with broken gas containers etc.
---
Yes and no, sucks for us that the game isn't making them a profit where they can keep people working on it. Bethesda still needs to make money.
---
It's almost like most of the "constructive criticism" from this sub is comparable to the kicking and screaming of a schizophrenic 4 year old 
---
My friend and I was just talking about that last night.
---
Man, I do hope they get some boo's at the next convention. Really hope they get booed off the damn stage for this shit show of a game.
---
Holy shit gamer, this is just too big of an idea. This kinda thinking is gonna get you in trouble with the thought police
---
TL/DR
---
Lolz 
---
Upvoting if you‚Äôre glad the ingame KBAR is better then TSE. 
---
How much server time do you think you can rent for $60?
---
I recently got a steam controller which has made it so that I can at least play some things. But I can't turn my wrists to use my keyboard or mouse.
---
I've tried that. I've even gone away and explored some more and come back later. But around White Springs and the mine to the east of it I've only encountered level 40-62 enemies. I've gotten quite fond of the 'Help!' emote :)
---
Not really. The core group I play with are still playing the game almost daily. There have been a few of them who have moved on though and some that are playing the next new thing.
---
We‚Äôll also like in FONV they forced a team to try to build something on top of the dumpster fire that is creation engine.  Can‚Äôt blame them for struggling, the fate of 76 was sealed before they started
---
I wouldn't set up CAMP at the Whitespring unless you want it to be destroyed. Players seem to frown upon building in that area.
---
One of the earliest 3\* Legendaries I got was an Instigating Assault Rifle.  Instigating effect, +250 DR while reloading, some kind of VATS bonus.  But the damage output was terrible compared to the non-Legendary Handmade I had at the time.  The Instigating made it comparable, but only on the first shot.
---
I kept finding and scrapping Assault Rifles, hoping to find some kind of mod that would make it better.
---
It never got better.  Even with Hardened.  And it weighed a ton, so off to the vendor I went.
---
You sure this is your last post? Lolz
---
Cool blog post dude, really happy I took the time to read that and now respond to this epic Bethesda roast thread. A tip of my fallout fedora to you my fellow fallout warrior 
---
Same here, I'm even rockin some pipe guns jus for the looks!! Bit for real my ranged weapons kick ass and I have no complaints
---
go check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals. It's a much more positive atmosphere. 
---
Mind you, the price is going to be much more than what you sold it for. 
---
My last post bitching about the game, as I said. 
---
Where are the birds?   &lt;&lt; this. i like the wild life that isn't out to eat you.
---
There is something wrong with your setup.  The only time I've seen "server not responding" was when my internet connection was down and I was playing FO76 over my phone's 4G hotspot.
---
I honestly think players like that should legit be banned from using any kind of IP to spread their hateful abusive behavior.  No one and I mean literally no one who isn't a trash garbage human being wants to hear that kind of talk while they're trying to enjoy something, anything.
---
That's what gives the Canned Meat Stew its special flavor!
---
But seriously, don't stick anything into an industrial food processor that you want back.
---
Lost a shotgun that way yesterday.  Fortunately it was a regular drop and not something nice, so it was easily replaceable.  But I did occasionally see other gear pop up in the list to lose, so I was more careful after that.
---
And no, even though the quest items stay in the hopper, anything else you drop in there is just gone.  I checked.  Multiple times.
---
It's not consistent, sometimes gear show up in the list, sometimes it doesn't.  Nasty little bug.
---
it's been happening for ages - it also affects gun shots I'm sure. I've been sniping before and had my x-hair right on target and missed, then missed again, even though I'm on target. I put it down to some dispersion coded into the ballistic model but now I'm not so sure.
---
None of my RL friends played this game to begin with and the few people that were Xbox friends, all of them quit long before I did.
---
And a screw to hold the wood together. 
---
God I hope Community Managers don't get paid for their job. ‚òùÔ∏èThis person just did it for free!
---
Could be a suicide mission.  Four birds go up, only one gets down though! Tension! 
---
I've offset the boredom of a lvl 200 character by starting a new character. Running only with the weapons and armor I farmed. Doing it natural with no power armor. 
---
With my new player approaching lvl 50...I still get the occasional lvl 100 that thinks he can bully me around...it kinda gets annoying when I have to constantly switch out to my main and change their thinking process lol.
---
Which thing is that? I may not have been there or don't remember.
---
I thought it was only the explosive stacking that got removed?  
---
In a way even us that are the most dedicated find ourselves not sure what to do. I am hesitant to stop playing since if i do i know i won't come back i never really do with games. 
---
But i am considering lowering the amount of time i spend with the game per week. Gonna try and mix in Anthem and Apex into the mix. I think the last inside the vault did sting abit more than i expected. Had hoped they were finally releasing the road map they keep preaching on about.
---
It hurts abit since Fallout i place this franchise above even Warframe in my books. 
---
Since xmas been focused on helping others via the text chat mod. Doing our clan helping events and what not. But its growing old very fast and the community is not growing it feels like its dieing.
---
I don't think i know what else to say other than i am pretty sad. The game has only been out 3+ months and it should not feel like this. Its got a rough road ahead. I hope Bethesda had something major planned this year for the game.
---
The only two i still consider still helping us is Devann and u/LoneVaultWanderer our CMs. For the rest of the team around 76 i have zero faith left in them anymore.
---
Jokers ( a pretty sad 76 fan).
---
Fuck, Yes!!
---
This. No need to complain about what you don't or can't have to the world.
---
Wait for the legendary. 45 round, its magical lol
---
instead of seeing more Scorch Beast Queens. i would like new nuke zone bosses. like nuke the space station. get aliens and a giant alien robot/spaceship fight
---
also. birds do not exist after the great war.. because birds are actually government drones. since the world ended all the bird drones got fried from the nukes.
---
Wow I'm sorry that's a shitty bug to deal with
---
I started getting less interested around the 250 hour mark
---
20 hours is barely enough time to see a single section of the map 
---
Downloading it now. Gaming should be fun and not 90% consist of trying to tolerate the issues in the game..
---
This entire post speaks the truth.I will never get how they designed the main quest to basically play you thorugh 90% of the games quest. Why isnt it just one and then the factions are there own questlines?
---
I was going the wolf pack quest and didn't know there was a base there lol normally I leave it off outside nuke zones .
---
I haven‚Äôt been doing a lot of missions . I have no way of healing myself so I‚Äôve just been trying to scavenge and run away from enemies
---
I was hoping we would get a bunch of up votes so bethesda would see this and get it on the plan. This is why we can't have anything nice cause less important things gets up voted like crazy. not saying they are all less important but I think this would be an important add to camps.
---
The big mistake was nerfing the TSE too much. There were many ppl also in the Reddit here crying about it. But it is obvious if you take so much out of it and nerf it, litterly to the ground, people lose fun. 
---
The second wave was the disaster patch with many old and new bugs. 
---
And the third one is that there is no future for new content (expect a lousy made pvp concept), no vision and still no camp, caps or stash increase.
---
T60 I think 
---
My camp location has beautiful scenery, a running creek and a Super Mutant Behemoth spawn point.  That's all I'm gonna say about it cause as of today I only get the "your camp can't be placed" message about 1/10 times.  Sorry suckers, go find it yourself :P
---
T45 probably
---
That is all *really* want. I understand this game has issues, and while I get frustrated with them at times, they aren't deal breakers for me.
---
I just want to see what the future represents for FO76.
---
Good article. Funny how it started off so short and now it's loaded with truth.
---
Also, nice to see another Rift player. That was a game with a lot of neat ideas.
---
Naw if it was like eso I would have been fine. Tons of people tons of quests and stories.
---
I actually took it as 'Let's all just try to calm down and enjoy ourselves'.  Not a snide jab at their fans.
---
&gt; The real thing is, as a RP player, you would have been happy with whatever multiplayer was provided, even if there was no last boss, no workshops, no nukes... Because doing RP doesn't require anything.
---
exactly, this is the kind of player that would've been happy with No Man's Sky on Day 1. For the price they're asking, I want more than just a sandbox.
---
I do hate the scorched but ya I'll take more variety of them too
---
Honestly even scarier in fo76.
---
They poke right through your armor, poison you, and follow you for EVER. 
---
Solid advice. I ended up setting up in the mountains just to the west of White Springs. Mind you after playing for hundreds of hours with the amazing 'Sim Settlements' mods for FO4, it's somewhat underwhelming to build in 76. I don't mind the exploring to unlock CAMP plans, that's a reason to keep playing. But seriously, Sim Settlements ruined my expectations for building in 76. So, so good.
---
Says "GTFO" to ppl having concerns, proceeds to call others retarded for pointing his retardation out. Good job buddy. Good job! 
---
If you need a teammate I‚Äôm on PS4 üëçüèª
---
Jesus. Amen to this. You say what we are all thinking. 
---
it really is a bandwagon. Someone will make a post, and all the haters just start making their own posts claiming the same thing. It's so obvious and childish. 
---
They are swamping the reddit with bullshit. I just don't believe it. And when you try and pin them down, they get all evasive. I had a conversation yesterday with someone about the rate of disconnects.
---
I directly asked him if how long he would keep trying to play a game if it kept disconnecting him every 3-11 minutes. He just wouldn't answer. He just kept trying to start an insult fight.
---
We all need to start posting more positive things, to drown out and drive away these idiots. 
---
it happens to everyone. Im not sure its just diseases. but majority notice that they are related, including myself.
---
Yes a break. I‚Äôll be on The Division 2 but I‚Äôll be back. Add me on PSN: R-C-MAN 
---
always looking for people to play with
---
I'm a sneaky sniper. My damage out put is really high. I would say that only the broken ass blooded melee build would out damage me but my builds is alot more universal and I dont need to keep my health low or anything 
---
And why are they so heavy?
---
probably more on the mark yes :P
---
&gt;There's enough sucessful MMO's out there to show how it should have been done.
---
It makes you wonder how you can fuck up a game these days to tjhis magnitude given the knowledge out there - the easiest one being to pick a frikkin game and actually play it.
---
Yep.  And pacifist should stop you from initiating only, not stop you from retaliating.  Oh well.
---
I can name a bunch, but most of them are on older gen consoles when video games were a form of entertainment media and not 'a service'...
---
I would like that too, though I would prefer there to be a lore reason rather than just "nuke here get X".
---
Whitesprings should spawn a Kong-sized ghoul.
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool!
---
White Springs... lot of high lvl players camping there, likely what‚Äôs triggering those high level enemies.
---
Have you slotted in Gunsmith with a High enough rank to craft it? Sometimes I forget :)
---
I mean, you are just wrong. You have to be turning a blind eye. There is no way you aren't experiencing issues.
---
I try to love this game every day, but here is my play by play of my Fallout 76 session last night:
---

---
Get the perk that reduces repair cost and degradation rate and you wont really have to worry much. I repaired my t60 once since I got it and that was like 40 levels ago
---
Username checks out!
---
If you read the article it talks about the importance of communication and working together as a major reason for our evolutionary success. Are you a chimp or a human?   
---
I'm not going to suggest that war isn't a major aspect of every culture, but I am going to suggest that war is usually as a result of our failure to communicate effectively with one another. 
---
Oh yes the mountains are an excellent place to build, just outside of the blast zone and typically free from griefers. Can't complain about the view either!
---
We've been offering..
---
I would say anything post like 2000 (the dawn of steam) is guilty of it.
---
There is nothing wrong with my setup. I have friends I play with on PC, we are all on newer high end computers, with stable internet. We know what we are doing. We built our own computers. It's not our setups. You are wrong. 
---
I would love to have a 3 month league type server like Path of Exile does. Ladders and everything, heck create a hardcore server as well, where it has perma death. 
---
I agree, it's a challenge alright. One or two of these enemies are manageable but they seem to hunt in packs in White Springs. Also, IMO, stealth has never really been viable in Fallout games. I've got the looting OCD so it's not really an issue in the greater scheme of things. But more casual players just looking to get through the main quest might disagree.
---
T-60, by far
---
Some suggestions have been made... Hopefully we will see a fix soon
---
i've got 150+ hours in and still going strong. for $45 dollars i'm pretty satisfied with the cost/entertainment ratio. 
---
Its pretty disturbing how modders seem to do more stuff for free than paying employees. 
---
Definitely upvoting this one for awareness. I wonder how often they look at this sub or if they only look at things with lots of points.
---
Now I'm only waiting for the Power Armor edition to drop to $100...
---
I‚Äôve seen people say you can plant crops indoors if you carefully place them on top of campfires as the game counts the campfire as soil so this could maybe help protect your crops from thieves in future
---
Got yo money and ran.
---
I don't understand why the experiences vary for so many people. I can only imagine how frustrating that gets.
---
Like you I am on the PS4, and while I had one disconnect last night and a loading screen freeze this morning, that is usually all the trouble I have.
---
PvP Level scaling: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ysqky/bug_high_level_pvp_scaling_is_broken/
---
It's not the Fallout 4 engine because so much has changed under the hood in order to facilitate multiplayer. It's really the Fallout 76 engine.
---
Put simply, because you seem to need it: The comparison between Apex and Fallout 76 moot because Apex is simply a much less complex game.
---
I experience about 10% of the disconnects and bugs that everyone else is claiming, it is perfect no, but I can play for a while without anything happening. So if it is that bad for you why are you still playing?
---
"Same reason why I keep you around after all time" - Dead husband
---
T60. Plastic and steel to repair.
---
There really needs to be a hotkey to turn off pacifist mode and defend myself. Otherwise, this happens:  
---
"Wait, Mr. CAMP destroyer. Please stop destroying my stuff while I set up my character to defend my self. Let's see...exit to the map screen...click on menu...go to...um...settings, there it is down at the bottom. Another menu... ok. Hmm...click...on um, is it game? I think it's under game...yep! There it is, pacifist mode! OK, uncheck pacifist. THERE! Now, back to the game!"
---
"Hey! Where'd you go. Mr CAMP Destroyer? And why is my house a pile of rubble?"
---
Didn't mention deathclaws
---
Steel plastic aluminum. Gotta love it.
---
Crap... I think it's this time I'll uninstall the game. Don't wanna tangle with one of those, ever ü§£ü§£
---
atleast they've added it to the list of fixes in the next patch...let's just hope that works and doesn't bug into the other direction like "Well previously you could put used gear into the hopper.....now you can't even put the ingredients in any more! Happy Reclamation Day!"
---
No, it's exactly why you're being idiotic. 
---
Who would stop and take screen shots while being sonic blasted by 3 scorchbeats?
---
Who would at the beginning of a scorchbeast attack would anticipate that it is going to last 5 minutes and be only sonic attacks?
---
As a percentage of Fallout players, how many take screen shots in battle or even know how to take videos of theor play, or would even care to?
---
If something happens to me in real life, then yes, there's generally evidence. In games, unless you happen to podcast your play, there's roughly zero percent chance you're going to capture evidence of it. 
---
Your demand for proof is idiotic. Your assertion that it's reasonable is even more idiotic, if that's even possible. 
---
yeh..only problemis i have a biiig farm..my budget is fulll.i have 1 of each workbench a power armor station a junk collector and a large water purifier..then about 100 plant..mutfruit tato and corn lol..i like my soup...and the buffs they bring
---
The Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch should have been included by Bethesda into Fallout 4 and into 76 a long time ago. Not sure why it never was, it fixes so many things that were broken. https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4598
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest. It‚Äôs the name. It throws me off man.
---
System?
---
Oh I am well aware. It was way worse.
---
A while back I fired it up thinking it would be fun to play again. Still worse than FO76 on PS currently. Could't even go 10 minutes without crashing. consistently. 
---
i think molerate teeth scrap to bone, so glow miners which are at blackwater mine and all over ashheap
---
Why don't you start comparing it to Civ6 while you're at it.  
---
All these moot comparisons are pointless and just show a lack of insight.
---
Well until they gave everyone with beta access codes to give to their friends. 
---
Why? You like broken blow molded plastic toys and games , or you just a fan of pissing money away?
---
Why? Its what pays for continuing development of the game?
---
Maybe that‚Äôs just it, I was playing Conan before Fallout 76.
---
I must have a tolerance for game breaking bugs.
---
They are located in DC..... learning directly from.th masters.
---
Bingo. It's all about the view! I've laid the foundations for a sizeable cliff side country house and barn workshop. Looking forward to sitting on the overhanging balcony to watch my first nuke drop. Man, I hope I can do that remotely from my house....
---
A hotkey to turn pacifist on/off would be a godsend.
---
player who freshly enter server should never spawn in nuke zone.
---
and if someone going to say don't log out at frequently nuke zone, well sometimes it's because I CRASHED there.
---
I understand the logic if someone re-log after they manually log out and dies because of nuke zone. At least we can say that player is careless and get punished for it. But the game punish you because you FRICKING CRASH? heck no
---
my suggestion is the game should spawn you in front of vault 76 after you re-log from the crashed play session (because people can't nuke there)
---
I want to say that the assault rifle may have a better accuracy stat but I do not know. Its definitely easier to get if you lack the blueprints 
---
Misery loves company. I‚Äôm right there with ya
---
Well said, I loved RE 2 remake but after playing through on Leon and Claire 2nd run I am having trouble playing it the reverse. And well worth 60 I spent on 15 hours of gameplay so far. Fallout 76 for 60 gave me over 450 hours now and was well worth the 60. But as you said there are other games, I am actively playing FF XIV since the 2.0 launch so it‚Äôs my go to when waiting for the next hot game to drop. 
---
People are okay with the state of this game in the same manner that people are okay with the state of the world.
---
Id have just said country, but people would have attributed it to something to do with Trump, or politics in general.
---
Actually, i WILL list some of the bugs.. Quality of food, overdevelopment, the illusion of choice, islands of plastic in the ocean, the judicial system; just to name a few.
---
Its no wonder people are okay with the state of the game.
---
Here's an idea. Don't reuse every asset from Fallout 4.
---
Well done.  I wish I could upvoted more.  
---
Don't worry... people will flock to kill her! Just got to worry about doing the silos 
---
Fun and engaging.
---
I paid $60 and preordered.  NO IT IS NOT, it was a feeling like being hustled when it dropped to $30 2 weeks later, the beta was almost inaccessible for me because I had no clue when it was running so the preorder was a waste.
---
I still want either $30 back, $30 in atom points or 30k caps to compensate for their lying to me.  I wouldn't even pay $30 for this game honestly, progressing solo is hell, the grind is painful, I was lucky I had an irl friend to play the game with, we kept each other going basically.
---
I wouldn't buy this game until it's below $20 or gets a whole bunch more updates on stability, as it is right now you can't even take a workshop without a server disconnecting on you eventually 9 out of 10 times making you waste caps and junk resources building defenses just for it all to disappear when their servers inevitably fail for you.
---
I don't think this has to do with Fallout 76 currently. Perhaps they could change their methods for the worse, however in the current situation they are in I don't think they will. Who gives a fuck about the atom shop. The real complaint is the actual game state.
---
&gt;	Hey, my character is male too, but who cares in the post-apocalypse? ;-)
---
One word for ya: swimsuit. :)
---
Classic hehe
---
You accused him of copying and pasting from another post. It is reasonable for him to ask you to provide evidence of the original post (which shouldn't be difficult) since you made a baseless assertion about his integrity. 
---
Now you've dug yourself a hole and you keep digging it deeper. 
---
when you scrap it you get half a wood
---
Do you not fear the same for anthem? I played the demo last weekend and it performed terribly. I actually had more connection issues than I did on 76, which really is quite something lol add in the problems with andromeda and it being published by EA I've lost all faith that bioware can deliver on anthem 
---
You get downvoted but i asked the same thing. They all want something for nothing. 
---
I prefer this system to loot boxes. 60$ is you buying the base game. Either we have to pay for the dlc or there is a store. This isnt some charity for their fans.
---
Have you played new Vegas? I highly recommend it
---
Any event help take over a workshop is one event defend the workshop is another .
---
Easy 2 events out the way rinse and repeat 
---
I concur. 
---
Your wife is angry at you for being angry at the game.
---
When ANYTHING, game / hobby / job, becomes an obsession and it impacts how you treat the folks
---
Around you, it‚Äôs time to go,
---
Also on workshop defense events if the enemies run into a base on the way to the work shop they just stay there and wreck it lol
---
One mans waste is another mans outfit.
---
I believe console players are having a harder time than PC.
---
I‚Äôll read your write up.
---
Why mess with perfection?
---
And stairs that can be placed at the side of a block. And metal supports that snap into corners.
---
All that radiation does weird things to decay rates...  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø 
---
After 450 hours I have got my 60 bucks worth 5 times over. Besides A true Premium MMO or Fortnite who puts 450 hours into a game anymore. There was tons to do but never expect a game to hold your interest for 3-4 months. That‚Äôs unrealistic view. 
---
You're delusional dude.
---
They made an article of such a sorry inside the vault?
---
Did they add the plug for the Atom shop as well ?
---
yeah not a kid. Wish I was so I could hate the world like you and raise my fist to the all mighty dollar. 
---
Isn't Bethesda already known for letting the modders fix their games since previous titles? even for 76 somebody made a working complex chat mod weeks after release while the actual devs seem to be incapable of doing so
---
Idk could have said perfect as is or need lazers on there head or something lol
---
Not sure I'd use the word "fair", but I agree it muddies things.
---
I'd consider items like scrapping changes from FO4, missing legendaries, the 50 Cal Damage silliness, rifles weights, etc. to be recommendations, not bugs. Good recommendations, don't get me wrong, but they strike me as decisions - bad ones - rather than outright mistakes.
---
Maybe use a metric to classify items? Most industry tools use something like:
---
* Defect: An error (usually from a pre-defined test). Shit's broke!
---
* Issue: Something (like many of the above) that *may* be a defect, but could also have reasons (reasons that are clearly not explained well enough, usually). Shit's weird!
---
* Change Request: Something that's likely intentional, but bad enough to make a formal request to change. Shit's bad!
---
There are others, but those are the biggies. Simpler systems use the basic Low, Medium, High, Critical scale as well, but I've never liked that for Testing purposes (it's more appropriate for incident management).
---
Of course, I'm picking nits. It's good work. Sorry for the lecture. I've gotten to point in my life (old) where I can't refuse a soapbox.  ;\^)
---
Xbox One. Since the last patch I‚Äôve gotten infinite loading screen when fast traveling to my camp or a workshop I‚Äôve claimed. Have to go to the dashboard and quit the game then restart. Biggest problem is now I‚Äôm in a different server and I‚Äôve lost my workshops.
---
Dried Summersville Lake is common one.
---
I often come across places that look interesting to build, but where I am right now makes sense from a fast travel standpoint because I'm roughly equidistant from Watoga, Whitesprings, Harper's Ferry and R&amp;G Station.  For most anything else, I can travel to Vault 76 and go from there.  The only areas that are costly are the far northeast and southwest corners, but there are no vendors in either place.
---
Interesting content.
---
Bobble stacking has been patched, but even before it was there was a user tested slap damage and found that it was capped.
---
The bobble boosted a tse handmade to 240k dmg and still were unable to one shot another player that wasnt flagged. Ill add the link in an edit.
---
There are 3 ways ish that you could have unknowingly flagged for PvP.
---
A) workshops- if a person tries to take your workshop, and they dont have to fully cap it, just start the process. You and anyone on your team is flagged for pvp with them and anyone on their team. There is no inclusion radius, you can be on the oposite end of the map from your workshop and they can still pvp you. Even if you have pacifist enabled.
---
B) if a member of your team flags for pvp, it flags the entire team for pvp, there have been multiple accounts of where a friend denied flagging but after video review, they were found to be lying. Even if you have pacifist enabled, if a teammate flags it flags you too.
---
C) explosives and explosive weapons, if your not in pacifist, the aoe on explosions can and will flag you for pvp if it hits another player. Also causing something to explode and damaging another player or player structure can flag you for PvP
---
then they should have sold it at "mistake prices" and not tried ripping us all off with.... take a breath, chap....
---
The Christmas rip off in the ATOM shop
---
ATOM shop pricing
---
The canvas bag
---
The cheap ass rum
---
in the cheap ass bottle
---
Minimum effort in producing a game
---
the bugs
---
the lack of story
---
lack of NPC's (In an RPG.... I guess Bethesda never made any RPG's before so they have no experience, right? ;-) )
---
Lack of working guns or weapons
---
Guns or weapons that healed the monster you were attacking
---
The Nerfs to your favourite perks and gear
---
Server stability (i.e. Server disconnects)
---
That fucking awful DMV mission!
---
Duping
---
Cheating
---
glitching
---
Stash Size
---
Cap limits
---
Lack of Beta and QA
---
Day 1 patch at 50 GB!
---
Beta patch that wiped your install
---
The Beta that was only up for certain times (when you had to reload your game due to a bug which took all your Beta play time up so you could play)
---
Team member that crash reset the mission so you have to start again (that fucking DMV mission THREE fucking times!) LOL oh I can laugh now....
---
CAMP size limits
---
broken PVP system
---
Broken wanted system
---
Jeez I know there's more I can't think of right now...how can there be more than this already!
---
.
---
arrgghhhh
---
No refunds!
---
Agreed.
---
She thought she was using Brody, but actually Brody and his boss, were the ones in control.
---
Lololololol I applaud your delusion.
---
Politics and games don't mix unless it's Saints Row who wouldn't be President and kick ass
---
Bugs will be ironed out. This is a newer studio in Bethesda, but this is their project. I haven‚Äôt been able to get off of it, but I have more faith the game will improve if their community was less destructive.
---
I still play the game lolz
---
Yeah, you try building a house that would work even work IRL and you can't because one foundation clips 0.1 mm too far into something. And then you look around and see the floating base xXpussySlayer69Xx built in front of the golf club and you ask yourself "Why do I even bother?".
---
This needs to be a learning lesson for all of us. I was one of the folks who rushed down and pre ordered Tricentennial Edition the day it was available. I feel your pain. 
---
I will never pre order a game agin ever. 
---
T60
---
Make sure you're wearing this:
---
"Bowler"
---
and not this:
---
"Bowler Hat"
---
I've heard the second one is a similar or same looking variant, but doesn't trigger the quest completion.
---
There are two "Bowler" locations that I can confirm.  Across from the Flatwoods Church Merchant is the tavern.  Go to the second floor and there is a corpse playing cards with a teddy bear.  The teddy bear is wearing "bowler".
---
Whitesprings.  One of the buses near the main entrance.  There's a "bowler" sitting on one of the bus seats just behind the driver seat.
---
I have the "bowler" and "dirty tan suit" (got that from the whitesprings mall vendors) and it works.
---
I love attacking Honeypot bounty parties.  With no new endgame content, this is the kind of stuff that's still fun.
---
I don't agree with your suggestions. 
---
 I understand the mechanics of the game's pvp flagging.  Due to having a better understanding than others, this let's me leverage that knowledge to my advantage.
---
I like to teach new players the basics like pvp flagging so they can't misconstrue game mechanics with griefing.
---
There is a difference IMHO.
---
I just want to see Deathclaws back on the alpha menu. They were horrifying creatures back then, now they're just pushovers, just cripple it's leg and it's no longer a threat.  
---
Why are you bitching about it? Bethesda literally just said they‚Äôre fixing it on the 11th.
---
Ok put down your $60 Hello Kitty Island Adventure game you just bought and play Fo76.  You'll see what we are talking about.
---
Probably some Bethesda employee pretending to be just some guy for damage control. 
---
I don‚Äôt play that much anymore I got my money‚Äôs worth and then some out of it just like the other Fallout titles. There is no real long term replay value after putting 400-450 hours into any game. And first step is don‚Äôt get pissed off it‚Äôs not healthy.  
---
I'm on ps4 and this is a far to common occurrence for me. I was still having just enough fun to keep playing until two patches ago. That added the pip boy freeze bug and I was regularly getting D/C before my camp even loaded in. The ghouls at white spring have a ridiculous trigger area, but they shouldn't trigger before you've even loaded. 
---
Oh PC, sorry. Meant to include it but forgot to lol
---
Added in an edit.
---
Thought of doing a factory reset but didn't want to lose my saves games.
---
I may try this, but I believe it would only resolve the CE-34878 error, which occurs on any game (got it several times playing spider man)
---
Yeah I read some other comments and finally the lightbulb came on.  It happens when radworms wears off.
---
The whole idea of a spin off is to make the use of the assets. Fallout new Vegas was almost a carbon copy of fallout 3.
---
Fine, edited it :3
---
even more disturbing looking at how fast/easy it apparently was possible to do this by somebody alone(?) and yet the entire dev team is struggling to get a few patches correct and address issues that have been there since launch (or even years)
---
Only people who know is Bethesda. No matter where you post that, it will only be representative of a small portion of players. Besides it would be skewed by trolls anyway
---
They messed with the code to make it online friendly so bad they are not sure how to reverse it and not break 100 other things. Coding is not easy.
---
Yes very concerned. Server stability was atrocious and you are correct it was worse than 76. 
---
Truth is, BGS doesn‚Äôt know how to fix this mess either. Austin was brought in to tweak the engine for online play, which is why they‚Äôre the lead on this project. 
---
It's been like OP since beta for me. My friends didn't believe me as they had no issues. They've changed their tune recently now that they have these issues too
---
Imagine a deathclaw assaltron hybrid....
---
Its possibe to record how many players have played but not at a given time
---
every house is reduced to ragged rotten boards and sheet metal, corpses? They can sit in the exact position they were in for over a decade without rotting, unless they are a skeleton hugging, then they rot into a skeleton without moving position at all. 
---
The Anthem demo sent me back screaming to FO76, for what that‚Äôs worth. 
---
At launch I'd say yes.
---
Now unfortunately I'd have to say maybe, maybe not.
---
Was fun at launch, now getting extremely bored.  95% of my friends already wuit.
---
There's no new content.
---
I'm eventually going to get around to building a giant billboard there saying something along the lines of, "This billboard sponsored by the association for blocking turret spam a-holes. Thank you. Have a nice day."
---
Just gotta get together the half million caps required to buy the neon letters plans.  
---
Exactly, building an entire building on a single foundation supported only by one steel stairs seems perfectly normal...
---
What platform?
---
Probably, but they should try.
---
üëç
---
Tone it down MODUS.
---
I got a copy a few month ago and am going to give go at some point!
---
How is it? Registered yesterday but didn't get an invite yet.
---
&gt;I dont want to be melodramatic
---
Bulking junk reduces your junk capacity doesn‚Äôt make it heavier 
---
no worries. I play on PS4, unfortunately I wont be able to assist with tour journeys. 
---
My friends are bored.  There's no new content.
---
My friends list has a new bug where it says "offline, offline, offline" next to all the names.
---
It's not a bug though, my friends are all gone.
---
Agreed, but they won‚Äôt. They‚Äôre not gonna take devs away from Starfield and the new Elder Scrolls for this shit show. 
---
Ditto...I mean I am out to eat them...but still...
---
Except cats. Cats are sacred.
---
Whitesprings is a perfect example, and one of my best memories of this game being tough early on.  I was sub lvl 20 I think, first time there and checking out the cabins when I saw my first glowing one.  It ate my face.  Twice.  Having to sneak back, grab my lost junk, jump a railing and flee to the safety of the assaultrons and sentries was awesome IMO.  Now I stroll through there like I own the place.  
---
I can see your point though.  I guess if you're trying to blast through quests and finish the game it could be discouraging.  I couldnt handle the wendigo cave my first couple times through. If finishing the main quest was my main goal I might have given up.  
---
They need to mix up the scorched. They are all a hive mind from what I understand, throw in some scorched creatures like in the queen fight. Have some scorched humans and maybe a mirelurk or something with them that would give a bit of a different feel and a challenge. The part I like most about the queen fight is all these different scorched mobs showing up.
---
I‚Äôd like that, but I‚Äôd also like to play Starfield and TES:VI before I fucking die of old age, so I‚Äôm torn. 
---
Can confirm, have a mic but:
---
First off I *hhaaaate* my voice.
---
Secondly I play as a female character so kind of immersion breaking when I speak.
---
But most importantly, I get angry very easily at this game and my words are not suitable for rated M games, also get triggered easily when I hear others mistreating others, so to just avoid calling people trash, I just keep myself silent.
---
There's a saying, *if you have nothing good to say, then shut up*.  That saying comes courtesy of my parents.  I would rather say nothing than fight, especially with my voice.  I'm more of a text warrior...
---
I also really like this idea, and I want it with selling to vendors.  You'll buy these frags for 5 caps a pop?  What about *6* caps each hrmmmmm??
---
Some of us just really like the Fallout franchise, and aren't jumping onto the flavor of the moment, FO76 hate bandwagon. 
---
That was my first thought -- but nope!
---
Yeah I was surprised with the stability because EA have a lot of experience with online games. I was very hopeful for anthem as i believe it's the team from the original ME trilogy and the road map seems very well thought out. Here's hoping they can sort the stability because if the story is even half as good as the first 2 ME games were in for a wild ride
---
I dont have/have never had a TSE so the "nerf" doesnt affect me at all. I play 76 exactly like i played every other falout. I wander through every building, read every not, every terminal, listen to every holotape. I just killed my first SBQ this morning and am looking forward to leveling up so i can get perk cards to try a heavy gunner. I still have to launch a nuke. and i still have a good third of the map to explore. 
---
I don't play this every day. I play a couple hours here and there and a couple marathon sessions every other weekend. 
---
I havent experienced any "game-breaking bug". i dont get disconnected every five minutes. 
---
This game isnt what i would have chosen for the next fallout but i'm still enjoying it. 
---
Fallout 1 too when it becomes available!
---
A lot of mutfruit can be found on the mountain that has the Orchard, slightly SW of Flatwoods. They aren't grouped well but they mutfruit are heavily peppered around nearly the whole top of the mountain away from the orchard itself. 
---
Throw in a little rad scorp and cazador
---
I run ranged without issue.   Your experience doesn't sound normal even by the current state of the game.  Consider opening a support ticket. 
---
"we can apparantly track dupers items but cant track anyone elses because reasons, sorry you've had a shitty experience in our game, hope the next one goes better for you!"
---
They have no roadmap because they didn't have any future content planned at launch. Every single bit of information we're given is purposely vague and noncommittal while always being "upcoming content" and "in the future". If they had an actual roadmap they would've published it ages ago to try and give players something that shows there are actual things coming soon. They're asking for feedback! AGAIN! What's the point of more feedback when it's all ignored? I rarely complain this much about a game but this is just so bad I can't help it. The phrase "actions speak louder than words" is one that fits perfectly here. All talk, no action.
---
Livin' ain't easy in the wasteland. But that doesn't give anyone a pass for being homophobe, that guy was just a douche. Usually when times are tough with a game they flock to it, guess we should be prepared.
---
They may as well post a link to a star trek character saying 'Noted'.
---
Same here.
---
**BLASPHEMY!**
---
lol it's okay
---
I almost got it for PS4 but decided not to. Now everyone I know apparently doesn't do PC anymore and migrated to PS4....mistakes were made lol
---
Dunno. Just "doing my part". I work in an industry where internal complaints are common but our golden rule is to not complain without giving some form of constructive feedback. The amount of vitriol I see in posts here, posts with good ideas and suggestions, is maddening. 
---
I think people today have forgotten that spewing expletive riddled rants, no matter how correct, won't get the attention of the right people as well as something kept as clinical and professional as possible.
---
Yeah I'm saving my atoms for weapon skins for weapons I use and power armor skins.
---
I've tried to not care about floating and those other sorts of things in my own builds and I have failed miserably. I just do! It can't be helped. It's like a compulsion.
---
Bethesda fixing New Vegas? Where did you find this drivel? Obsidian fixed New Vegas because Bethesda's QA team for New Vegas was -Fucking- Terrible. Obisidian caught the flack opposed to Bethesda because Obsidians name was on the case.
---
I am so glad to see that I'm not the only person with this problem. I've tried server hopping and doing the Grafton mayor's quests. Does anyone know where this part of the questions leads to? Maybe I could just go there and skip this part?
---
I also had this problem about a month ago. I used to be a popular trader on Xbox and I had constant happy costumers. I trade with people to get a lot of items bulk and then re-sell to those who need it most. 
---
I got a large amount of nuka quantums from a friend (75000) and so I went ahead and started selling them 3 nuka for 1 cap because I wanted to get rid of them.
---
After many happy customers someone decided to try to flatten my base (even when I hopped servers he would join me) and so it got to the point that I had 2 squads of friends waiting to kill him the second he got a bounty but he still wouldn't leave us alone. After 3hours of this I finally got offline only to log on 2 days later to find out that I was banned for dupping and scamming.
---
I tried contacting Bethesda about this and I still am banned with no replies.
---
Same, as well as modding weapons. The game has a great selection, but a lot of them just feel boring to use.
---
I looked in the Atomic shop today for the first time out of curiosity.  I was really surprised by how few items they have.
---
Most of it looks like stuff I would have scrapped in FO4. Except maybe the CAMP assets. But then again, after using the various mods with FO4 that added hundreds of new settlement items that could be built without snapping restrictions, this whole CAMP building in 76 seems very underwhelming now. 
---
I'm a relatively new 76 player so maybe someone else would know but are the FO4 various workshop DLC assets in this CAMP system, maybe as unlocks?
---
The nerf affected me , but with the right card I still push over 300 on most of my war weapons , while I have the other non explosive pushing 45+ ( for a 38. Cal combat rifle ) and so on.
---
Just have to find the cards that work and swap 
---
Thanks.  Wish I tried that yesterday.  T.T
---
When the game functioned I had a great time. I attempted the stronghold well over fifty times and the servers were only stable enough for us to reach the boss three times. We downed her twice but both of those kills we were dropped from server or server crashed before we could get to loading/victory screen back to tarsis. I still managed to hit leg cap at 15 and gear my javelin to 130 but it seemed I spent just as much time walking through tarsis after crashes as I did exploring. 
---
Im not saying the game is horrible. I enjoy it. But I was responding specifically to your comment that it's "slowly getting better." It isn't. Which is not to say all hope is lost either, but Bethesda gets no credit for improving it thus far.
---
Thanks.  
---
Glowing Gulpers are just evil. I remember being level 30-40 and they were just out-healing my damage as soon I went to reload.
---
heh, yeah. It's taking ownership of an insult from the gaming elite. Most of the people over there are people with jobs/families/commitments that preclude them from playing all day/err day. 
---
But mostly it's for people who enjoy the game. it's a nice change from the constant hate train that runs through here.

I just put together a little album of my time in the first week.
---
That‚Äôs fine as long as I can get it back and it‚Äôs not ridiculously over priced liked the serum recipe. 
---
BTW: I passed on NV at the time because it had TERRIBLE reviews and (I was burned out on fo3, got lost in Anchorage and could not get out), but it seems that many people love it in retrospect. 
---
NV will be all new to me and I plan on enjoying it!
---
I paid $200 but I got the  t51b helmet and a plastic bag...
---
If it was as easy as playing HL2 with the portal gun I'd be like later 76 fuck y'all.
---
What trading really needs is an X for Y trade option. If I want to trade a weapon for an armor piece, currently the only way to do it is one person has to offer it up for free in good faith the other person will reciprocrate
---
My wife ask me the same , I told her what should I release my anger on?
---
Awesome!
---
I'm hoping the patch to fix the boredom will come soon. But get after it man shouldn't take long to install.
---
Also as a side note, does anyone know if an addiction timer exists in the game? I have somehow been addicted to booze more than once when never using an addictall.
---
Kinda makes a junkie build hard to maintain cuz I can't see my addictions and you can only be under one Chem at a time. In FO 4 addictions lasted forever and had a stat page that showed them and their timers
---
Meta is Meta.
---
Players are like water and will follow the path of least resistance.  
---
If they tune melee, players will move onto the next Meta. 
---
That player was trying to get you to attack back.  As another poster suggested and what I would have done in that scenario is fast travel back to the Golf Course.  Then I would have jump him when he wasn't expecting it since he attacked first the retaliatory has more tactical leverage by launching an alpha attack an catching that Raider off guard.
---
You just have to watch out if he had any buddies teamed up lying in wait to jump you if you flagged.
---
To me it sounds like a missed fun opportunity, but that's just my opinion.
---
dude, how many hours have you put in? if you've gotten/done everything it sounds to me like you've got your $80 worth already. 
---
I've got about 150 hours in and i feel like i've gotten $80 worth. 
---
It seems that a lot of people have a problem with others enjoying the game.
---
I'm getting 1 wood just thinking about it
---
We need Tunnelers in the mines!
---
Last night, at a nuke drop, a friend and I fought a 3 star legendary Yao guai. He got a plain old drool out of it. I got a legendary pool cue. At least mine was legendary I guess. 
---
I think having a larger pool of enemies in each base group would help. It's boring to be in a high level area and be fight a group of 10 supermutant warlords. The titles should mean something. Have a warlord leading a group of lesser mutants. Same with scorched. They can add more variations at the different levels that have different strengths be it melee focused or ranged or some that are tanks or glass cannons.
---
You make some great points. One thing that bothers me personally about the game is that they could have easily put human NPC's in. Just like Rose and the vendor bots. They aren't killable and they don't really go anywhere for missions. Why couldn't they be human?
---
Totally agree. It's really annoying, thirst seem to drop the whole time. Don't want to spend time or weight holding onto food and water. It's not a cooking game. 
---
So the token ain‚Äôt worth shit ?
---
Where do you exchange them ?
---
They have a weight on them unlike mr fuzzy ones or Halloween candy 
---
Flavor of the moment? Lol where you been since release? Get your nose out of Bethesda‚Äôs ass you wanker. Guess what? A lot of the haters on here LOVE 76 my self included. But we won‚Äôt stand for a broken game that is taking WAY to long to fix. 
---
It's the red lamp. They bugged it out and it is tagged as an atom shop item
---
Sure.
---
Hey man, loving Fallout and hating 76 are not mutually exclusive.  
---
Bummer, haven‚Äôt tried stacking them for a while. It takes so long to collect them legitimately I only stacked to kill people and I try to avoid that.
---
Yeah I always forget blocking annoying people is a possibility. Thank you sir/madam.
---
Only explosive were able to streak before
---
Now non do
---
I hear you! The second time I went back for the WhiteSprings holotapes I managed to kill about 10 of those glowing lvl 62 ass-masters by hopping from car to car with huge amounts of rad-x/radaway. When the coast was clear I came down from the cars to begin looting and that's when the game decided to crash. Facepalm.
---
Why is it taking so long to fix Stealth bug healing monsters.
---
Well over 1k hops... Still not one single calibrated shock. Seen every other mod though
---
Strawman Argument: I never said they have no bugs. I said they weren't as buggy, were considerably more polished, and had/have more end game content.
---
Oh and they all scored a lot higher and had more active communities, because they weren't as bad :)
---
i downloaded that beta but none of my friends got it so we played fo76. 
---
Hahahaha awesome idea !  
---
If you liked the first one, you will probably like the second too. It feels really familiar and still brand new.
---
That said, the beta has some serious server problems(our friends mike and delta are back) and the controls have not improved at all.
---
TD1 was my favorite game of this generation and I have good feeling about it's sequel. 
---
But I have only played about 2 hours.
---
Not only this, my bright lamp also made it into atom shop. 
---
Yeah man! That happened back when my buddy would take the food factory and have his base nearby. They ignored the factory and kept going for his crops. It was hilarious and so frustrating at the same time. The two of us used like 30 fertilizer b4 we just moved his base
---
Would totally play an Exploration Hardcore mode where dying makes you lose not just junk but ammo, apparel, and weapons, would make you *really think about* if you can take on those  3 mole miners with a melee weapon.  And would give incentive to keep secondary weapons and apparel and ammo in your stash.  Assuming they ever increase it again.
---
But I would want it to be like a Modded server where you bring in a fresh character or a dupe of your main character who can only access the Hardcore Mode so it can't circumvent hardcore rules somehow.  I just worry being able to make a duplicate of the main could be exploited somehow, unless you can only do it once and that's your character for those types of servers.
---
They did. Only those patches, updates, and hotfixes were larger and the games weren't released in nearly a bad state :) Hence not being universally hated.
---
If you're not using vats you're going to have a hard time with guns.
---
And lag will regen hp regardless of your build
---
I believe in my case, they were likely already triggered and lead out to the parking lot by another player.
---
However, I do not believe you should be able to even take damage until you have gained control of your character.
---
is emergency protocols that good? i've got the +2 str mod on currently since i'm primarily melee
---
My game starts acting like that at times too.  I usually close and restart my whole PS4.  Sometimes restarting the game won't fix my issues.  It takes a whole system restart.
---
-You get the rad worms again after a few seconds.
---
-Energy weapon dps is crap and they break within minutes.
---
-They said themselves SBQ loot is bugged and that they will at a "future date" address her shitty loot. 
---
Hahahaha!
---
It's as if this is one of the biggest AAA flops in the history of gaming (no really, it is).
---
Well, here's a better idea.  Reuse the asset, but recognize its shortcomings and think about how you can improve it in your game.
---
It took a little while, but they *did* fix the Lever Action Rifle, which is more than I can say about Bethesda Prime at this point.
---
What continuing development? 
---
i am still playing because I still find it enjoyable. Finally made it to level 30. still haven't been into the savage divide or the east side of the map. I am still exploring. I only play, maybe once or twice a week, sometimes not at all. Most people that are bored have been playing a ton.
---
I drop unneeded ammo and few bottles of purified water. I'd rather let the new players actually play the game and find their own plans/recipes.
---
I‚Äôm running the American Patriot paint on all my power Armor. 
---
Best I can do.
---
So it's a win win situation 
---
Might be all lamps bugged 
---
If you have the beta you get 3 friends in as well FYI. Go to the beta website and send them an invite
---
And the point of capturing usage is?
---
It's all good. The normal state of mind is "it's a high level player, I should block them and exit stage left" because people forget that there are low level griefers too.
---
Good luck!
---
There's more lakes down the hill
---
Spare me the tantrum, please.
---
Really? Because we're playing the exact game you are. The difference is, we don't have to cry about playing 300+ hours in a "broken" game. Explain to me how you can get hundreds of hours out of a game that doesn't work, or wasn't worth playing?
---
Get your whiny head out of your ass, wanker.
---
not with me, cats are SCARED.
---
No. I believe you are mistaken. Dry as a desert....

---
Did you have any time numbers for how long it took to drain your full meter with / without perks?
---
Yeah that's what I'm confused about.  Why haven't they?  I'm guessing it's some kind of legal reason.  
---
Show me on the doll where the cat touched you.
---
Sunday brothers cabin.
---
That and aaronholt are my goto for farming mats.
---
Its for vats accuracy
---
When they don't work for a publicly traded company.
---
Sometimes, anyway.
---
The best questline in the game, and well written. Really liked this.
---
Well... if you are there, they spawned for you :)
---
So... get to work.
---
it's Sunday Brothers Cabin- just West of Harpers. Little farm with all the crops available. Used to hit it all the time when the CAMP deletion bug was a thing and i was losing my crops all the time.
---
All these arguements you are using are very easily turned against you.
---
Who would at the beginning of reading a Reddit post bookmark it incase it is needed as proof?
---
As a percentage of Reddit users, how many take screenshots of things they read for later use?
---
If I read something in Real life then it is generally evidence.
---
I am not disputing what OP says is right or wrong. I am simply asking OP for proof as they asked me for proof. You thinking me asking for proof is completely subjective, as is your comment about me being idiotic.
---
Reported for duping wood. /s
---
You‚Äôre clueless. And EA and besthesda are  loving blind shit eaters like you. Keep eating your shit and loving it for the rest of us. Dumb fuck. 
---
They could add them to the Atom Shop.
---
It was fixes to their published game files. There's no legal reason Bethesda can't fix their own game files. 
---
Believe me, they're not. I've had it where I'm the only person in whitesprings and I spawn in unable to move, the door flys open and all of a sudden I'm dead. Happened to other people I play with too. You defo shouldn't be able to take damage until you can control your guy, burned just rather spend an extra 30 seconds in a loading screen than this crap. Worst thing g is the fixed it for me in one patch and then the next patch it was business as usual lol
---
Maybe they're too busy working on the fixes to write huge roadmaps for screeching children on Reddit ?
---
When the body vanishes it's turned into a meat pile. A red meat pile on the ground among many others in a darkened area with yellow / orange tinted everything and grass of the same colour. It may as well have vanished though.
---
How about dropping it in anything BLUE?
---
I try full restarts occasionally, especially after a CE-34878 error, but I have never noticed a difference.
---
[What in the...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZsfTWqqKKM)
---
This was her post a week ago:
---
"I'm not trying to ignore any questions on it. I'm still playing catch-up on my reddit mentions from overnight (Slept for 7 hours and have over 100 mentions to catch up on during that time. I can only type so fast :[ ) We are finalizing it, as for the exact date I don't have a solid answer just yet."
---
&gt;finalizing
---
They can release a Roadmap without setting specific dates. A roadmap is an indicator about the coming content, and would do way more for communication and transparency than your PR speak u/ladydevann 
---
At this point is there even a Roadmap being worked on? New content that isnt PVP or Weekly events? Fans deserve to know the truth about the future of this game. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm in the same boat, the one thing I found fun to do was become a player vendor but they added that weight limit in so my shop character has been rendered pretty useless. I remember they said they were gonna add player vending but I think they forgot about that tbh
---
didnt catch the sarcasm, lol. was gunna say i joined a scorched earth at like 5:30 this morning. My first! one of these days i'll give a silo a try
---
That‚Äôs true. Got that one backwards. Oops 
---
Any healthy online MMO display the online player count and usually the amount of players currently in the world, or in matches. This info is not displayed for obvious reasons with 76. 
---
its almost like the $60 you paid when you bought the game originally does that.
---
Second this. The mutants drop a lot of bones. Plus the trailer at the entrance has a couple bone traps you can disarm.
---
That‚Äôs a problem with guns more than a problem with melee. I‚Äôd like to see ballistic, explosive (weapons, not legendary effects), and energy buffs and leave melee where it is. 
---
I'd love to play FO4 co-op. better game, better systems, hang out with buddies. I feel that's what we all wanted, but we didn't get.
---
The only items that really save weight bulked are aluminum and lead. You would think that bulking would save space, but atm the only reason to outside of alumimum and lead is if you want to be able to vendor it. 
---
thats cool , thats why most people had said adding an puraly coop optional component in their games would be great but they strayed way too far from the core that made this game and all of their other ips great, that why I said a traditional fallout with plenty of quest and NPCs and  a 4 player coop, this game would have been a hit like that.
---
3* Legendary glowing Alpha, crowned lvl 50 wolf.
---
Raw wolf meat.....
---
I have to agree the numbers of people playing seems to be falling on my friends list also. I am currently debating on posting a looking for guild post and seeing if anyone will add me. T-T So fare my most enjoyable moment in the game has been when a team of 20+ took over a server and we killed THOT Queen. Good times. \^\_\^ 
---
Responder vendor bots. It's one of the low % ones for them to have at any given time.
---
We all do. The silence from Bethesda is worrisome. Hopefully they are pulling a Hello Games and working hard on the game but if the rumors are true its not looking good.
---
3000 upvotes asking for them to take PVP off? WTF is wrong with you why did you buy this game? Go play Anthem stop trying to ruin everything fun :(
---
Role players vs munchkins is a meme older than the internet. The munchkins won.
---
Jeff from the Overwatch team? Busiest dude in the industry 
---
Well, her robot form is armed with close quarters weaponry. That some of that carries over into her synth form is not all that surprising.
---
You're a munchkin.
---
That's good that its enjoyable when It works and the team do seem to know what they're doing. I'm just hoping for the best and also a little price drop lol you managed to do a lot more than me. I tried on the Friday and died halfway through the first mission, only for it to freeze while respawning. After that i couldn't start any mission. Tried again on the Saturday with a friend and managed to finish the first mission and we got d/c straight away. One thing I really hope they change in the full release is the ability to sprint around tarsis. It's such a drag walking so slow lol
---
Seriously. Check out the [patch notes ](https://m.blackdesertonline.com/news/view/2353) for BDO for example. These are just basic changes that happen Every Single Week and the game is years old. If Bethesda released a patch like this people would be shitting their pants about how huge and amazing the patch was.
---
Bro, for almost 20 runs straight i've gotten only legendary 1 star wood armor pieces - mostly left leg. Nothing else. 
---
I just learned where that word comes from, cool!
---
I didn't know you had to stimulate machines to make them produce radiation, I always assumed they were obedient things that worked at the touch of a button, or dial or knob lol :P
---
found it..thnx
---
ok..thnx bro
---
What about Calibrated Shocks? VATS helmet, Motion-Assist Servos? Tesla Bracers?
---
They are just decorations as far as I can tell.  They don't actually stop things from tearing up your farm.  I got molerats all the time north of the Overseer's Camp.  I have since moved to a less populated area and rarely seem monsters.
---
Better to just stay off the beaten path so that randoms walking by don't spawn creatures and leave them (cause they are just passing thru).  That way the only time things spawn is when you go back to your camp, and you can just clean them up.
---
No loot at all.  She despawned and there was no meat pile to be found.  I searched along with about 8 other people for 10 minutes after.  There were a lot of meat piles but they offered no loot either.  It was if the entire fight mobs and all just glitched out on all of us.
---
I don‚Äôt understand what this is for 
---
ZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
Sorry for the late response.
---
Yeah, I think they‚Äôre the same folk screaming fake news while trolling reputable news agencies.
---
The Mistress' of Mystery were put together after the Great War, and seemingly operated for several years. I don't recall any mention of Scorched during the questline though, so it's ambiguous just when those two died in between "right after the bombs fell" and "Vault 76 opened."
---
GHOULZILLAAAAA
---
The question shouldn't be "Devs, where are the birds?" It should be "I just stepped out of the vault and can see possums and frogs moving around, but WHERE ARE THE BIRDS!?"
---
Im well over 1k trips to that vendor, seen everything but calibrated shocks
---
So you believe the cripple chance is intended and not a typo? Just verifying.
---
I mean, it is possible, but I would really love to hear from a developer or a CM to verify if the values are truly intended or not, and their design philosophy behind these values.
---
lol well that's a slightly more detailed than, though equally useless as, the response I got when I had a piece of calibrated X01 armor disappear overnight.
---
Aw, damn. I came at them from the wrong direction (over the mountain) so I missed that detail. Will have to see it with another character.
---
My t60 only got the atom symbol emwhen I put a blue lamp on it
---
I honestly don't appreciate the "if you don't like it why do you play it" comment. The truth of the matter is that there's a lot of people who can afford only so many games and for which shelling out 60 bucks is not easy, and when they end realizing they paid that much for a piece of shit they still try to get some worth out of the investment.
---
Aww, are you frustrated widdle feller?
---
BTW: if you are getting lots of glitches it may be an unstable mem oc (if you are on PC)
---
They are from everything I've read about Fallout bugs.  So if that's the case, then embrace that.  I mean would that really hurt sales more than not fixing bugs?  I guess it might prevent people from buying Day 1 and letting modders fix the bugs before purchasing.  But release a beta to modders to fix it ahead of time.  I would praise that action, not look down on it.  I'm just one gamer out of millions though so who knows. 
---
See I just want a good sorry and I don't really care about getting max level etc., I may take a look at it again, thanks!
---
 I was responding to a previous post saying that if you were on a team, then you could get back into the server.  If the s server no longer exists, then that just proves my point. Not sure what your point is. 
---
Yes I'm sure that is exactly what they are doing. All the fixes they have put out over the last two months of development time is surely proof that they are working so hard on writing code that they can't put out meaningful updates once a week.
---
Yeah it was gone.  There were a lot of meat piles from the mobs but they were all lootless too.  About 8 of us scoured the place trying to find anything.  I got a pump shotgun and a snub .44 from the entire fight.  None of us got any completion loot either after killing her.  You know the stuff that pops up after the message on the screen saying the event is completed.
---
Lolz
---
These posts are killing me.
---
You just insulted F:NV. they're going to crucify you for that.
---
It would give the player base a better idea of the overall health of the game. 
---
Keep in mind the ONLY promise Bitchthesda made was to ‚ÄúProvide free DLC as long as people were still playing‚Äù. Although this is fairly ambiguous, it‚Äôs pretty evident that as the player count falls the effort Bitchthesda puts into it will fall as well. 
---
That's a good point. 
---
My  goal is not to bash Bethesda up and down, but come on, they shipped a game with ONE boss, didn't even scale levels geometrically like even some free-to-play Steam games know how to do like Paths of Exile. 
---
Nice attempt to try to spin that around. Go back to school little boy. 
---
Jeez you people will never be satisfied just leave the game man and uninstall I get you want everything now now now but stuff takes time 
---
Sunk cost fallacy can grab you even when you know about it. Just stop playing. Took me a long time to finally realize it but it is the best call right now. Only drastically fewer players is going to wake up Bethesda at this point. Come back when they fix it. 
---
After I was informed that WoW had a hard beginning and the fans kept it going. I am tring to do it also. At the moment I keep on playing to build up CAPs and do events I like and just meet people. 
---
The paper bags eventually disappear, taking the stuff you dropped with it. Leaving your stuff in a permanent receptacle (cash register, suitcase, etc.) is a more permanent option. I only use paper when I literally want to throw something away, like spoiled food (and yes, I know that spoiled food can make fertilizer).
---
You gotta work the Laser knob to stimulate it.
---
The girl in the pic is cute, too.
---
Well that's just the point, they all required a significant amount of work after release.
---
If you read the post you're replying to, it says I uninstalled. 
---
&gt;el 50. I recommend not doing that until after 50, because the reward is a nice weapon that you‚Äôll want to be level 50. I‚Äôm stuck with a level 40 because I didn‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre not supposed to actually play the game until you‚Äôre
---
I made the same mistake. Not that I was intending to go melee, but still would have been nice to not underlevel that reward.
---
So now I need to find his bloody body or his ‚Äúhouse‚Äù or his ‚Äúarea‚Äù where he hangs out
---
I‚Äôm not comparing new Vegas and 76. I‚Äôm saying that they both reuse assets in the same way. 
---
no. it's a worthless cash grab. took me too long to realize that.
---
It was $29.99 at Costco.....
---
Or not every player cares equally much about these things. There's different styles to that, I know people who hardcore a game once bought and wring every ounce of fun out of it and others play it for a week or two and then happily move off to the next one, only to return maybe with the next add-on. 
---
It also helps when you see the cycle over multiple games. 'X is dead, I'm playing Y now' has been plastered over Bulletin Boards since the beginning of online gaming. It also helps when you have been through the circles of hell as well and remember that one title that had even worse gamebreaking bugs or w/e.
---
So I guess folks react to bugs and shortcomings in games differently. 
---
Tl;dr: People can enjoy broken or unpolished games. It is not impossible.
---
Not forgetting the games bosons and leptons ;)
---
I might try to re-install when patch 6 is released.  It can't hurt.  I'd do a backup first just in case.  I'm thinking about doing that. 
---
That really blows :(
---
The joke translates perfectly from theoretical physics -&gt; theoretical degree to game development -&gt; developing degree and you think it would be better if it just repeated a word that doesn't make sense in the new context to sound more like the original? Memes have killed comedy. 
---
I just love the look. They are all pretty fun looking but I don't think they do anything like you described. Ive had molerats running around my garden on several occasions. 
---
The best thing for pests put down the scarecrow and put a missile turret next to him :)
---
Mark me, this is the new Zenimax modis operandi: release a minimum viable product online game, with no clear plan for longevity. Cash in. Run away. Repeat. 
---
they don't attack me, I've finished the "Mayor for a day" quest.
---
For a real dick punch, my halloween candy weighed .01 a couple nights ago.
---
No, a guy claimed to have everything in his STASH disappear, there is no evidence to prove this other than his word. Not to say I don't believe him as this happens, however, this clearly is not a widespread issue, there has been exactly 1 report of this happening that I could find. 
---
add it to the list OP. ghoulish doesn't work on any perk level for regeneration, you can't use regenerating armor because there is a bug that puts you in constant caution. nerfed my build pretty hard without even considering weapons 
---
Beat me to it. Great Idea. I wounder why scorch just wear the same clothing all the time. I think we only see one rare scorch and he is apart of a quest. Make the scorched and ghouls more deserved.   
---
A bad game is just bad. But a bad game with potential is one of the most frustrating experiences you can have. Sure, you'll have fun because the potential is there... but for every fun thing to do it tantalizes you with daydreams of what could be.
---
I don't mean 76 specifically here, but I know the feeling. I put 500+ hours into Supreme Ruler 2020.
---
Hmm...I wonder how many Moon Monkeys I can fit in an Overseer's cache?
---
How about fixing the game before they ruin it more.
---
I know! You know they planned this from the beginning. They would trick you all into buying full price, and then lower the price just to watch you have a snit fit!
---
Dam them!
---
I saw it marked down at my Gamestop from 59.99 to 39.99! They only had two copies. But it was clear they did it just to insult me. 
---
‚ÄúDanse disliked that.‚Äù
---
\*points to where soul should be\*  "It stole it......"
---
My corn, muts and tatos are a constant target for RatRats and MoleRats and I have many scarecrows of both the models I can use, they make no difference as a deterrent but are super cool.
---
&gt; The best thing for pests put down the scarecrow and put a missile turret next to him :)
---
Defenses have proven quite useless against most attackers in my experience.  Even worse with Molerats.  For Scorched, Robots, and Ghouls they seem to eventually start attacking.  For Molerats they just sit there moving back and forth as the Molerat does circles and attacks constantly.
---
I thought Grahm was lead dev....which is probably why I can't find him...
---
This character was so fucking amazing in Fallout. Such a goofball, i loved him.
---
I am with you u/Vanpocalypse 
---
Great quest line, was sad to see it end.
---
What happened to your hands? I've had pretty intricate thumb surgery so I know your pain about rehabilitation and gaming, haha.
---
So it bit your taint, got it.
---
I can, but I won't be home for 7 more hours =[
---
Don't let the assholes ruin the other 99% of encounters. I had a turd that wouldn't leave me alone last night too. I'm minding my own business trying out my new Prime Gatling Gun at WS Golf Club, and as I'm looting some goof just runs up and takes me down to a sliver of health with MELEE SLAP DMG (smh). So I (foolishly) opened fire on him, and almost get him down but then he  1 shots me with melee. Normally I would just go about my business, but I had just purchased some Violet stabilized flux from someone and the dbag of course grabbed it from my death doggy bag. Needless to say, I never got it back. After trying revenge 3x , it was obvious whatever build he was running he repeatedly would 1 shot melee kill me while I was in PA. Oh well, lesson learned. Always stash your valuables. After 350+ hours you'd think I'd know that, but wasn't expecting to be randomly jumped by some crazy kiddy.
---
Yeh it's a bowler hat,  could of sworn I bought that hat from a vendor tho since I saw on here that those were required a few weeks ago.. Thanks for the help and giving the location :) 
---
Ok
---
Are you a game developer?
---
seems pricey.
---
Always a meat pile, right where she died. Not where the body landed.
---
Yeah, that all makes sense. I'll go back and read it later though. 
---
You should stop playing. And maybe stop posting.
---
Maybe you can find a better way to get some of that attention you are so craving. Like helping people in real life.
---
I bet there's a lot of people out there that would really appreciate someone putting their free time to good use, over say, bitching about a video game online. 
---
Complete junk is all you will get.
---
I understand your frustration and have sent a note to the developers.
---
Please submit an official ticket request through Bethesda Support and post your suggestions on our official forum.  Actually, your feedback is really not *that* important to us, so we recommend tweeting your thoughts on future changes.
---
Thanks(ish)  
---
_Bethesduh_  
---
She turns into a meat pile right where she died. Not where her body landed.
---
At this point, youd have to be an idiot to buy another game made on this tech. A decade of spaghetti code weighing it down. Incompetence at the helmet. Dated animations, outdated graphics...all at $60 AAA prices. nope, no thanks.
---
Yup.  It‚Äôs wrong. It doesn‚Äôt match the wiki.  Thus my confusion.
---
I chalked it up to Bethesda pulling a Bethesda and trashed the gun.  We‚Äôll see what happens when I find another handmade, or maybe I‚Äôll make one now that plans are available.  
---
I think you forgot the decimal in that 15% surely you meant 1.5%
---
Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooootz....
---
Why you being messy?  \^\_\^ 
---
4 player  coop like borderlands. This way, we can (hopefully) has more stash space, be able to move and place objects like on FO4, and have less lag.
---
Why aren't you at home, work an out of doors are very much overrated.
---
I don't think budget increases with level.  Many people say they have tested it and built identically limited CAMPs on new characters the fed with plans and supplies.
---
Personally I thought it did, but I'm not sure any more.  I'm lvl 62 now, and just don't use Turrets.
---
I was a all around 9 trait crafter in eso, I had 6 max level fully geared characters, I quit a year and a half ago. Made me sad, I had invested so many hours into that game. But I got tired of feeling like I was being shit on, so I deleted all characters , uninstalled, and never looked back .
---
Great!  Thanks for the help.. Is there any cheap workshops? I have claimed some at 35 caps and some under that.. Maybe it's just a random cap claim
---
It was worth it for me because: 
---
* I didn't pay full price
---
* I didn't play at launch when the bugs were worse
---
* Lots of my friends play together, so we laugh at the clown show of bugs. 
---
If you pay little, have friends, and keep expectations low, it can be fun for quite awhile, especially if you like exploration. 
---
Tight! Expect an invite from the Pug Pawtrol. 
---
Haven't been on 76 much but I'm always down to have a cook off or something lol.
---
You got the story a bit wrong. The daughter wasn't in love with the Brody. She was using him as her in with the Raiders. The daughter was a self-entitled, spoiled brat who just didn't care all that much about her mother's beliefs. She wanted power and in the end had little issue murdering every one she grew up with and who cared about her to achieve it. It might be my favorite story from the entire game.
---
I lost my Misstress of Mysteries Gun and sword to that hopper.
---
Fun fact.  Can never get them back.
---
I think its intended. Cripple is stronger on other weapons but vats is only on pistols specifically.
---
Low ap cost, high accuracy.
---
Fo4 was too easy i can't even imagine what i'd do in co-op. For me content = freedom to role play and organize cool stuff not the grinding spoon feeding you want.
---
Are you on the PS4? I‚Äôll give you a lot.
---
I made a complete balance overhaul for FO4 (first iteration, mind) in a day. One day. Thanks, Template Creature Idea Guy.
---
Changing values on weapons is cake.
---
got a legendary single bottle cap from a three star ghoul in the Watoga Emergency Services building while farming 
---
I don't think that was the case. He most likely was trying to kill me and loot my goods or he was bored and simpky being a dick. Look, at launch I've come across griefers intentionally standing in front of your fire which you can easily avoid due to their inability to kill you. But I think people are entirely missing the point. Despite me being on passive, high level and geared up he was able to break the mechanic and simply melt my health meter via melee. What's keeping this dude and other assholes from griefing newer players. Either remove passive mode entirely, remove slap damage or reevaluate the strength of melee damage being it breaks the mechanic.
---
 The thing I find interesting is that a lot of melee players were bitching about the TSE up until it got nerfed. Now that us non-melee builds want to even the playing field they cry out "Stop nerfing everything". 
---
They should buff the firing speed way up on the assault rifle and keep the damage where it is and it would be a pretty cool alternative to the handmade/combat rifle.
---
I've read that you need to move your camp for the larger budget to be there. I've tried that, and it's seemed to work for me.
---
Bethesda has said they plan on starting to have articles about things like camp, and explaining better how things work, and clear up rumors. 
---
I get that but you said you‚Äôd leave if anyone even gets close. 
---
don't get me wrong, I would embrace more cooperation with the modders too and am not looking down on them.
---
I just wanted to express that if that's their "concern" then it's too late for everything in that regard anyway
---
Had ghoulish on last night, if you have high rad resistance it doesn't do much, get hit by a glowing one and you'll see your health jump up. Take of a rad suit in the nuke and it's like full health in a second or two(got to b me fast though or you rad your self to much just quick click off on) it works great when pared with radsponge.
---
Yeah, I had some, seem to be just decorations. Shame. 
---
Are you?
---
I'm not mistaken.
---
I've build on the brahim lake and it was aggro so i went SE more.
---
There's rivers and lakes in there.
---
Have you seen the one with the small cave and the little dock?
---
\&gt; a fucking spinning arrow until she despawned
---
I've done 8 SBQ kills since Sunday and only one of them was lootable. The others, as you have stated, were just spinners until the body disappeared. 
---
Call in Supply Drops at Flatwoods.  Wait for new characters to pick the lock then snipe them to clear their bounty.
---
Don't take their junk unless you wanna be a jerk.
---
No, but shouldn't we eventually be able to?
---
Run 2 SBQ yesterday (differente servers), both gave me 2stars combat leg, and repeated ultracite plans...
---
didnt worth the bullets spend....
---
I'm fully behind more ants and spiders.
---
I like how they don't see the fact that they're always making additions to the atom shop as adding insult to injury.
---
It's like having to bring your car in to get fixed every month and they're like "Want us to wash it for an additional five dollars?!" 
---
You can put the game down and come back to it later. 
---
Wait for some more patches and see what happens.  I haven't played the game in weeks.  But that's more due to my schedule than anything.
---
Gorge next to vault 76 should be no more then 20 caps , you could take over and build a nice base and literally just defend it enough times 
---
True, but the usual pattern is this:
---
Cash shop has no bearing on gameplay, but the game sucks. Therefore, the deva are pressured to make up for flagging profits by incentivizing the cash shop. This attracts whales and pushes casual or regular players away. The whales are disproportionately happy, and spend more money, while casual players leave and the non-whale fans question if they still like it. The whales start to get bored and move on, so the devs are pressured again to FURTHER push the cash shop. It spirals down into blatant pay-to-win at this point, even if it isn't TECHNICALLY P2W on paper. See: Black Desert Online.
---
She‚Äôs batshit crazy if you heard the holotapes. BIG methhead
---
That's not where I pictured my soul living somewhere else, but I guess you're the expert.  Does your soul itch regularly?
---
I feel your pain but. . . Ya gotta admit man. 75,000? Nuka Quantums? That's more than a large amount, lol. That screams "I'm a duper"! Even if you did not dupe them. They were obviously in your possession. This game at times struggles with the stuff that belongs in the game/world. 75000 quantums is nowhere near "normal".
---
X6 88 Liked that"
---
From what i understand, camp budget doesn't increase. However, the amount of budget a given item takes up when built, decreases with level (or maybe intelligents)? Not really 100% on that so anyone feel free to correct me.
---
Don't think he runs from them , i think he hunts them down , at least that is how it looks.
---
I usually clear out all the bot's in watoga before i visit Phoenix, he gives me discounts then, lol
---
I know it doesn't work because I was two shot by legendary glowing ones (+33 rad each) several times while farming a non-rad zone yesterday 
---
That's fair.
---
I said in another post that changing values on weapons is cake. And it is.
---
Making sure those values are the right ones, in conjunction with perks, mods, etc...is a pain in the ass of epic proportions. 
---
One good argument for ditching perks as progression trees - easier to balance the game if a dozen different factors don't alter the damage of a weapon.
---
Dunno about the team thing but theres plenty of people on here that would be happy to rumble with you lol. Im sure if you posted about a pvp match people would flock to you and you can just run and gun around some specific location and fight.
---
Suppose you could even make an arena in a workshop if you wanted to get fun with it
---
Before you even go inside west tek there is a trailer with bone charms hanging down you can gather for some bones. Also killing the super mutants there usually drop some so don't even need to go inside.
---
It's a early game weapon, easier to find off super mutants to learn mods 
---
Handmade is better because it's rare and mods for it are rarer.
---
Still a big **no**; it would be plagued with all the same problems it's plagued with now, except some of them wouldn't matter as much.
---
What you want this game to be was always in their plans, they just wanted to do their own servers with an unmodded game at first. They always planned on eventually opening up the game to private servers and mods, but that was for later down the road so they could increase the longevity of the game.
---
Honestly I don't know why everyone is up in arms about NPC's... the story they've crafted around exploring a dead world is by far this games best point. They hit that mark exceptionally, if you don't like it, that's your subjective taste, not poor game design.
---
Everything you're saying here is either subjective or wrong.
---
Again, I'm not saying I think Bethesda has made **any** correct moves here, but then again making it a 4 player coop/solo would be even worse. If this were a single player game, it would be in development for another 2 years anyway. The only reason this one was released so quickly after fo4 is because it reused a lot of resources and was much more sparse quest wise since content is much more player interaction based.
---
You don‚Äôt say !!!
---
I‚Äôve been hauling 500 or more of those everywhere 
---
A tip, take out the vertibots. Once they're dead the cargo will fly in big circles and not run around the map
---
Yes because you're not even trying to organize content or role play. 3000 upvotes asking to turn off PVP? I entirely blame you! Get creative!
---
It serves a very valid purpose. I choose to play with it off. If I mess up and get a bounty, I deserve and welcome all bounty hunters who come.
---
I'm looking forward to pvp servers, I'm just curious how they will do it, and if they will do it well.
---
What my friend and I did was disbanded the team and then he let me kill his character over and over. 
---
Im up for it, but I won't be on for at least a few hours or so. If you don't happen to find anyone my PSN is celeste_strange.
---
If I no work I can't play 76, it's a horrid vicious cycle.
---
Sony, and some of us can‚Äôt afford/have nowhere to put a gaming PC (I‚Äôm in college). You need to be more empathetic. 
---
Because we love Fallout consider how dead the game would be on arrival without that name.
---
Mind you that has limits i currently only play because of the clan. While i am cutting my hours back alot if the clan ever died i would put the game down for good.
---
I have zero faith left anymore i just want private servers and modding support so we can just do it ourselves.
---
Lol your hater fantasy 
---
That could be a solution, but I don't like killing new players :)
---
Your response was so logical that man's had to delete his comment, week played sir.
---
Y‚Äôall act like having stores and micro transactions are a necessity. That shit was not popping back in the day (I say back in the day but it wasn‚Äôt that long ago in my gaming heart in reality it was like maybe 7-9 years agoüò∞)
---
The developers of today have y‚Äôall brainwashed into thinking they need money on money, fist over fist (of cash lol) to fuckin make a good game or let alone keep one alive. They dont, like dude said I gave em 60$. A lot of ppl gave them waaaay more for power armor editions and got cheated out remember that, that wasn‚Äôt 60 that was waaaay more. Also this game went on sale immediately but I still had to pay 60 because I‚Äôm a fallout fanboy woohoo yay me! So in essence I already gave them more money.
---
Oh but that‚Äôs not all now y‚Äôall want me to be grateful for the atomic shop? Because it is the sole reason for more content? Without it no nada? 
---
Yeah right keep it real these dudes put BLACK SUNGLASSES in the atomic shop for 3$! Something as minute as sunglasses that were in every other fallout game now are closed behind a paywall.. because it helps future content. NO FUCK BETHESDA AND THEYRE SHADY SHIT! We want actual improvements to a game that was NOT finished at launch. 
---
Money after is something you earn it‚Äôs not their right! For them to say something like if there wasn‚Äôt an atomic shop how would we further fund the game. Uhhhh we already funded you‚Äôre game and it doesn‚Äôt work the way it should fix your game first then WE will decide if we want to give you more money. Pushing this agenda shows their priorities are out of order. Gamers love more content let me be the first to tell you I *LOVE* me some Bethesda! But you know what sells dlc a fully functioning Game that‚Äôs fun to play and we will gladdddddddly give you guys more money on more money on more money when the game is in working order! It wasn‚Äôt even finished at launch and it still isn‚Äôt to this day but you want me to be grateful the atomic shop stays up to date with more and more cool shit I don‚Äôt want to pay for instead of getting what I paid for? Noiceü§ôüèΩ.
---
TL;dr - gamers of today are brainwashed into this micro transaction trend where they think a Game HAS to have micro transactions to live. No they just want more money. Not saying it doesn‚Äôt contribute, but these developers are using that as their crutch, with future patches and updates in the future when all we‚Äôve ever wanted from the jump was a solid experience at launch. We want dlc but we want the base game to deliver for what it was 1st. üëàüèΩVery important. You have to earn money after launch not slow down progression, lock things behind paywalls and keep pushing your ‚Äústore‚Äù when your  base game, in and of itself is in a critical state and wasn‚Äôt what you initially set out for. This clearly isn‚Äôt the experience they wanted us to have at launch.
---
TL;really didn‚Äôt read: Priorities.
---
Think that only last for a short time, then they will be agro against you again...
---
Don‚Äôt remember.... the bodies are always disappearing now before I can take the loot üòí
---
A black bear will not run away farting if you challenge it lol. From personal experience I know they will try and swipe your head off, even through a glass window, don‚Äôt fuck with them.
---
It's not that they keep them out so much as they're the first things that get attacked. Put one or to in a kill zone for your defenses.
---
The wasteland can be unforgiving? This cutesy response is kind of annoying. I've lost entire stacks of nearly 1000 rounds of main gun ammo. The other day I notice I'm not wearing armor on my right arm. I thought maybe I was just an idiot and was dropping stuff on accident somehow, but now I seriously doubt it.
---
I've found him in the elevator across from his shop once hidding.
---
No because then it doesn‚Äôt make sense 
---
They wouldn‚Äôt ask him if he had a degree in theoretical game development.
---
&gt;celeste\_strange
---
Thanks, I will take you up on it. Still at work, so that would be great!
---
The art for the two are very different.

---
Your missing my point, the Atom shop team are Graphic Artists, they don't code so would be zero help to fix bugs and address issues in the game.
---
Do you know the specific per shot AP cost numbers?
---
In Fallout 3 and 4, it seemed like pistol per shot AP cost was significantly lower than the other weapons.
---
I literally cannot tell a difference between per shot AP cost between weapon types in FO76.
---
Perks should never have been allowed to become a progression tree in Skyrim. It's been a mess ever since.
---
Amen brother 
---
A lot of those 30 million sales involved play times so short that the players never had time to care or even see the bugs.
---
People think sales equates to play. It doesnt. For any game, the vast bulk purchaser barely play the game for more than a few hours before moving on.
---
The games industry is like the gym industry: they both rely on bulk sales disproportionate to the actual use rates.
---
The only roadmap you will get is from google....they dont even know what updates to come out with and truthfully they should consider repairing the game before adding shit that will add more bugs.
---
When I was younger and stupider, I used to think playing online with people I didn't know personally would be *great*.
---
But, I found the opposite to be the truth, or most of it. My online multiplayer experience goes back far, back to games at the very beginning of the modern Internet like Netrek, Galactic Bloodshed, and LambdaMOO. What was true then is still true today: a surprisingly large number of people, *especially young men*, will be assholes if you give them free roam to be assholes.
---
The basic anonymous nature of the internet and the inability of gaming communities to actually police themselves (like a real community would) leaves the door wide-open for a variety of these sociopathic behaviors to emerge and flourish.
---
I have, through persistence, had some amazing online gaming events. I have, through persistence, made life-long friends online. But these good events are small when stacked against the number of assholes and asshole-like-behaviors I have encountered in these decades.
---
I love cooperative online games. I love playing with friends. Some of my very best gaming experiences have been in large and small groups playing Planetside (1&amp;2), WoW, DAOC, AO, AC, UO, Borderlands (2), Diablo (2, 3-ish), etc. But my worst experiences occurred in that same litany of games.
---
I finally gave up this year. I have been scratching my gaming itches with fantastically crafted single-player games (with one notable exception: I am on the ED Distant Worlds 2 expedition but in a private group).
---
I will, probably, never again play an online multi-player game where I cannot exert a great deal of control over who steps into the play-space with me.
---
For all my bashing, I do it out of care.  Deep angry care for taking one of my favorite series' and making it look so bad.  I figure if we focus on the bad now, we'll be burnt out by the time the game is good and we'll all forget about just how bad the game was at launch, maybe.
---
Do you really believe the patches we have got so far have provided an acceptable level of fixes/changes/content? Have you ever played literally any other online game? 
---
There are some decent mods for assault rifle. 
---
But yeah I‚Äôm running handmade as well.
---
I heard 5% per shot and caps at 30%.
---
Would be a good idea to introduce a shooting range with damage calculator, could make it timed too to give DPS.
---
Some people will set up a CAMP in the same spot, with wall of turrets facing the building.
---
They will then pull all the ghouls out, tag them, then let the wall of turrets clean up.
---
The wall in this video is effectively a big middle finger to those people, since it blocks their CAMP from spawning here.
---
lmao naming and shaming PR representatives on reddit?
---
God "Gamers" online are the biggest manchildren.
---
You know what's a good way of advertising a product? Fixing the game first
---
Jesus so toxic just leave the game already 
---
It's probably because you have something in the way that blocks the turrets line of sight. Put them in an elevated position and see if that helps.
---
So guard their drops, and leave them a few stim packs or other goodies to make up for it.  Half a dozen stims, some food and a few random junk items for their time should be enough to take the edge off.
---
Platform: PC
---
Bug : FO4 stuck in Terminal bug. 
---
Considering this was apparently patched by Bethesda in FO4 I'm surprised to see it in 76. There was a small mod that also fixed this on PC. Apparently, this bug was tied to high framerates but I also understand that Bethesda patched the existing animation/framerate bug in 76 so what gives?
---
CAMP feedback : A huge omission that was available in FO4 settlement building is the ability to select an entire building after construction to make small adjustments to it's placement. You can select an entire building to Blueprint it and place it anywhere but you must scrap everything individually each time to make small adjustments to the building's placement.  Am I missing something? 
---
My gunslinger is under powered and he has more raw damage perks. My advice is to scratch mutations, no power armor, make him more of a junkie class.
---
You want firecracker berry juice and psycho and whatever else can boost your crits. Drugs are the one advantage we have over muties.
---
It's really fun spamming crits but wasn't effective last time i was in PVP.
---
I'm right there with you. I will try and give people I want to fight with chems/ ammo just so I don't upset/ drive them off. The most fun I have had in this game is in a factory trying to steal it off of a full team.
---
I like to RP a parenoid Chem fiend who is always after the next big score (whether it's chems or people's hard earned caps).
---
what do you expect them to say
---
No. It shows that most people do not play the games they buy enough to care.
---
I feel bad when ever I see a low level walking around wanted.  But I figure if I kill them right now and don't take their junk, it'll be better than someone else doing it maliciously.  I figure I'm doing them a favor by clearing their bounty, while not interesting in pursuing it further.
---
Of course... setting a trap for them?  Maybe a little malicious.  But at least they'll learn supply drops are dangerous.
---
Why bother to read something you don't care about?
---
They made there money, they want more they will release it as free to play or some dlc that most of you will buy anyway
---
Well.. you can get a f076 copy for free when you buy a used controller. It was in a german shop if i can remember it.
---
A plastic helmet in a plastic bag...
---
Why do they have to be human?
---
Great idea, thanks!
---
Literally never did I say the game didn't need fixing.
---
that's just going to come down to opinion, this s hit isn't any different than what you would see out of  blizzard.  Point at the doll where TH hurt you.
---
Sounds good! I will warn you my PSN messages aren't working properly so if you could shoot me a direct when you're ready that would be awesome.
---
How do you call specific supply drops? 
---
Look forward to it!
---
CE error doesnt go away with a Factory Reset.
---
DONT reset the Console, rebuild your Database. No Data will be Lost.
---
When your Playstation is completely shut down, press the Power Button for 7 seconds till the second beep, you will enter Safemode. From there choose option 5, i think. It is called "Rebuild Database"
---
Amen. Lol
---
also on top of Watoga High school. When i was looking for T60 pieces i would skip the top of the med center since you have to run through an instance to get to it but the other three are all accessible from outside. I would start at the high school, run through the middle, by the crashed vertibird, then take the fire escape to the top of the municipal center, hop servers then do it all in reverse. 
---
I asked myself this before the last patch and the answer was that I had become addicted to selling junk and collecting caps.
---
I put down the game and started an eBay account and now I am selling real junk and collecting cash.
---
They have stated on several occasions that they stick with this engine because it allows them to make quick and easy changes. Your estimate is probably pretty close.
---
"We're  listening..." ^^
---
This, then aim for the motors on the cargobot, as you disable them it will slow and stop moving.
---
Before I figured out to kill the vertibots it seemed impossible.
---
Also shoot the little jets it has. When 2 or more are smoking it will will stop and stay still.
---
Chickens
---
Elevated, clear paths, spotlights, etc.  They just decide to work when they want to.  Which is rarely.
---
I now have a single low level machine gun turret on the back of my house roof overlooking the farm just as an alarm system.  Anything with ranged attacks that show up tend to target it first, outside the turret's range.  But it rarely if ever kills anything.
---
I had almost 400. I was not impressed.
---
So much this.
---
Player freedom. Environmental storytelling. Love both here.
---
But the frustration of constant Scorchbeast stallings, bullet sponge+durability+repair cost issues and bugs is finally getting to me, too. 
---
Beware that spawn rate. You'll get overwhelmed if you're not watching the ground too.
---
Sorry, but considering this post, you really lack the maturity to handle being told anything to important. You'd just have a hissy fit and waste your life being angry at a video game.
---
I mean this post isn't any different than all the other game haters that spend their life with their fake rage posts.
---
You're sad. You've wasted your life. What a shame. 
---
Awesome, thanks for the instructions. Definitely going to try this ASAP.
---
On my medic I'm running that on my X01 closest I can get to a medic theme. On my demo I'm running Black Bird on X01. I wish they would put the paints on the Ultracite set I like the look of that armor more.
---
US government supply requisition holotape. Load it into your nearest relay tower and it‚Äôll drop a supply drop within a few hundred feet.
---
I feel like 75k might be possible over time.
---
I did test this, after 1 week of looking for bobbleheads I did find about 500
---
I am loving 76 and honestly don't see why people are so upset but that may be from playing MMO's since 1999 and on dial up. This is what I was expecting based off of 20 years of MMO launch experience. MMO'S usually start off with a "good" story but falls flat on the endgame for the first 6 months to a year. I see anthem talked about and how great it is going  to be but has everyone already forgotten their first MMO? SWTOR sucked after the story was over and it took them over a year to get anything new out. 
---
Well, the tower just west of Flatwoods always drops supplies around that area.  Sometimes over toward the hunter lodge by Mothman world, but usually around Overseer's Camp, Flatwoods, and the Ag Center.
---
Seems like another great inconsistency in this game. Mine seem to do a great job attacking everything in site ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
My first couple of camps one was on point, the others not so much. I scrapped a few to make room for other things and these two i have now are my employees of the month for January. 
---
Found the Frenchie ;)
---
You don't need a mode just post your contact info / schedule!
---
I try to organize workshop PVP sundays PS4, from role play subreddit. PSNid Enterres
---
Where did these idiots come from complaining about lack of content who won't post that?
---
If I ever see a bgs game I really want you can bet I will buy it used on Craigslist.this company will never see another dime from me.rob me once shame on you Rob me on a daily basis and string me along with promises of dlc while selling me hobo Santa suits for 20 bucks gtfo, this company went from cultural icon to a company that sells garbage and lies.
---
Having dense on your chest armor will alleviate this problem. 
---
I know the place of which you speak, and had the same problem. I moved entirely later but if you build off to the left or right of the spawn on the lower cliffs you get alot less people taking your spot and its just far enough that the people who build on the lake and rivers dont bump you out
---
Thanks for the explanation, I‚Äôve never seen that before
---
For me, it's not the pre-orders that bring disappointment, but the special editions and season passes, (looking at you 10 pound titanfall artwork book).
---
So I had this issue pop up yesterday. Purchased a 3* grognaks axe as a backup to my main melee weapon. Needed to be repaired as condition was about 25%. Applied my weapon artisan perk to repair at 200%. It disappears from the menu. Thankfully it showed up when I exit to my pip boy screen. But only at 100%. Tried twice with the same results. So there is a glitch here. Emailed Bethesda but got the same canned response on missing items. 
---
I lost a calibrated Excavator power armor leg to this bug, which meant that my carry weight decreased tremendously. I couldn't fast travel to fix it but the really shitty part was that calibrated shocks for the Excavator PA are extremely hard to find. Took two weeks of grinding to find one.
---
same! love smashing those orcs to death 
---
I stopped reading after "deuce in our mouths"
---
T-60, as others have said. To be honest, it has been a long time since I‚Äôve had to repair my X-01 and I‚Äôve been smacked around a lot at the clubhouse and all over Appalachia. I did repair my T-60 legs, but that was before I had Fix It Good 3.  I used to be low on screws and springs, but now I‚Äôm swimming in them if I‚Äôm not crafting weapons to scrap. Maybe I‚Äôve just been lucky, but I‚Äôm glad I skipped the T-60. 
---
That does not work anymore since patch 5 along with weapon repair. But the T-60 was the cheapest to repair. 
---
*shrug* works fine for me and my friend.
---
ARs exist because super mutants don‚Äôt have handmade plans.  
---
Im looking forward to PvP servers, too. If they get rid of the bounty system there, I will play with pacifist mode off aswell. It just feels undeserved right now when I accidently hit a camp I didnt see from 300 meters away with a stray shotgun bullet and get a bounty. Thats not fun.
---
Thanks for your feedback, we'll pass it on to the developers. In the meantime, check out the Atom Shop to see our new black sunglasses and red rocket bed! 
---
Yeah, I played around with the mutation for a while but went back to my chameleon armor pretty quickly.
---
Shhhhhhhh! That's **my** spot, don't need more squatters!
---
;p
---
It obviously works: a post shitting all over Scorchbeasts is the top of the sub and gilded, less than a week later we have news of a patch incoming to fix it. 
---
They have been talking about a roadmap for weeks now, asking for an update shouldnt be any issue. 
---
Skyrim was released before consoles got mods. 
---
Now they advertise mods on console as a selling point - and SELL MODS.
---
Made by the modding community.

10/10 would debunk again

Since you are on PC install the text chat mod. https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151
---
Go online, ask around for anyone doing event xyz with you and I'm sure you'll find some. It's not only players on your server, and usually there are some dozen people on. So far I haven't met an unfriendly one there. 
---
I won't be on today anymore, but I'll find you tomorrow maybe.
---
Since you asked... end game bosses rarely give loot. Why bother? Game is over. In Monster Hunter the Xeno armor is the ugliest of them all; bright neon raver boy trash.
---
My character is male and I wear the tattered dress since I got it.  Who cares what you're wearing when a Scorch Beast starts screeching. Also, he looks amazing in it, the guy has good legs. 
---
battle royale mode
---
It's very therapeutic. 
---
The interns they have working on the updates are not very efficient programmers.  Give it time.  Like 2-4 years.
---
Exactly this. Cash in. Run away. That's always been the plan.
---
Zenimax discovered with TES Online that servers and GaaS cost money.
---
Starting with their Hearthstone clone (clone shit, get shit) they began releasing online games, while clearly having no plan to sustain them. In the hopes of a quick cash in followed by lights out.
---
Last Bethesda/Zenimax game I will buy.
---
There where 17 minutes on the timer when it flew away, so it seem to be DPS counter and if there is not enough incoming damage in a set period it will fly off and end the fight. I'm guessing here obviously.
---
Have you tried Anthem? I played the Division extensively but forgot to look into the beta for the 2nd and so if you played Anthem I was wondering what you thought regarding the two? I really only have time for one game now a days and was debating between these two but this one kind of slipped off my radar. 
---
I have had a dense chest for a while and was still dieing before the nerf. Before last night I was not dieing while using my shotgun. 
---
I didnt think camp buget increased and thought it was just one of those new game rumors that tend to stick around and misinform players.
---
I'm sorry, but your title lacks one more question mark, so your request can't be processed...
---
Thank you for adding Harper's Ferry to the game, but I think you missed something really cool. So, you have a perk Called Thru-hiker, which is amazing for a name, but that's the only appalachian trail mention in the game. Harpers Ferry is the "spiritual mid point" of the appalachian trail, the best known trial in the US. AND Harper's hosts the Appalachian trail conservancy, which is an amazing building. You could see it, but Google maps cuts out about a half mile before you get there on street view. You rerouted the town so that it can't be where it actually is, but it would be cool if you could find the conservancy somewhere, it's a really cool place! Also, it would be wild if there were "white blazes", verticle stripes used to mark the trees, on some of the trees going from Harper's and leading north. If you want to add some horror, have the blazes lead to the skeleton place (you know the one I'm talking about). A couple mentions of the AT would be really cool! 
---
Power patcher still works fine for me 
---
 I don't mostly. My point is this: 
---
 Knocki9ng down somebodies house is easy and kinda stupid. Its no challenge and just as asshole thing to do.
---
 I hunt Scorchbesats for sport. I fuck up the little town of Scroched near me on a regular basis and call out the bitch. I find fissures and own them. 
---
 This is fun and somewhat challenging.
---
Exactly 
---

---
in all honesty tho it was working perfect, I built around regenerating perks and effects to negate having to carry meds, but have since had to shuffle and take on 3 ranks of traveling pharmacy instead of 1/3 of ghoulish 
---
It is still currently being worked on. Our art team and development team are working together on it. There is PVE content coming that will be addressed on the roadmap. I'm sorry I don't have more detailed information than that yet, I don't have a specific date right at this moment.
---
That is months old, doesn‚Äôt work like that anymore
---
Idiot Savant activated on that quest for me. Gained about 4 levels. I couldn't stop laughing. 
---
Who hurt you
---
I have frustrations with the game, but the idea that they aren't listening to feedback at all is  simply not correct.  One of my biggest gripes in this game was how certain vendor items were RNG based.     You could only get T60 jetpack plans by showing up at the right time- having zero ability to even know what 'the right time' was. 
---
Honestly, I think the problem of loot acquisition in general is a very serious problem.   Wanting calibrated shocks plans for ultracite power armor, and having the queen drop explosive vents 30 times is infuriating and horrendous game design. 
---
Loot drops from the queen is a very big problem, one of the biggest in the game right now.  
---
They acknowledged this problem in their latest "Inside the Vault." 
---
***Note: DO NOT say "Nerfing TSE made fighting the queen pointless."*** 
---
That is complete nonsense.  I have killed 3 queens since the nerf within 10 minutes.   
---
Lol 
---
Just take it as immersion. He's a raider. Haha
---
You're ugly face. 
---
Woosh!
---
As sad that story was between the mother and daughter it's only minor to the tragedy of the entire sisterhood being wiped out. Reading some of the journals you can tell that those women were completely OP to the point the raiders never stood a chance. The daughter, Olivia, alone killed hundreds of raiders and kept them from expanding their area of influence. The first sister, Alison, to be killed by an attempted raider ambush didn't even kill her. Olivia knew they wouldn't stand a chance against Alison even if they got the drop on her and she was right. Olivia was the one to kill the first sister to get in good with the raiders.
---
The sisterhood had so much pull in the shadows that they were in the works of getting the BoS and responders to team up. Olivia didn't like being in the background and wanted to rule out in the open. Evening playing as a male character, I would have happily join the order if only to be their janitor.
---
Give real details about what they know, why the roadmap is held up, a timeline when to expect it, etc.
---
Being extremely vague and using words like "finalizing" arent helpful IMO
---
It hurts to see this many people still forcing it...just stop guys, seriously. There are so many other games worthy of your time right now than this. This may or may not get better, but don't stick around hoping things will change today or tomorrow. Your wasting your valuable time that Bethesda has not earned from you.

This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:
---
This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
If I knew the meaning behind that I could say I agree. 
---
Weird. I have a pair of heavy turrets on single platforms on mine and they fire as they should so I can't say it's a glitch on your end. Maybe it's the direction you have them facing when you installed them? I make sure to find out which direction/area they spawn from and aim them in that general area. So far the only thing they've failed to shoot at is the scorchbeast and that's because he spawned behind the house in the air.
---
That reminds me of this idea me and my friend had involving Skyrim.
---
Imagine if they shipped out a single copy, randomly, that let you play as the Dragonborne.. And every other copy in existence just had you doing mundane village things as a peasant.
---
The hopper and lighthouse for the Mothman quest are both being addressed in a future update.
---
Camp budget doesn't increase with level.
---
Anthem was fucking terrible. Thematically it ticked ALL my boxes. I know; user name checks out.
---
But after 1000 hours of Warframe and 100 of Dedtiny 2, I played Anthem and it was just, "Oh, this again."
---
It's just EA, doing what they do: copying formulas, and showing up years late to the party, bragging about their bling and failing to realize how stupid they look. Again.
---
The image of a [lazy gamer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrIf0oYTtaI) that popped in my head from your description.
---
Show us on the doll where Bethesda touched you.
---
Oh that's probably smarter- I'll do that tonight when I'm back home! Thanks for the suggestion.
---
My personal favorite is when they are right in front of you, you swing or shoot and they suddenly appear behind you. Or you hit them, hit them, hit them, their health bars don't move, then their bars drop and die.
---
Civ VI is about to drop their new expansion which will add a ton of new mechanics and civs, including World Congress. 
---
100% agree. This is the best quest.
---
Legit lol seeing that face after reading post title. So perfect op.
---
Legendary 3 star albino death claw and got nothing. 
---
So I guess even a rolling pin ( that you could sell for 2 caps if you‚Äôre lucky enough to have the caps replenished on your vendors )
---
I guess our black bears are a bit more cowardly.
---
You know you messed when even r/fo76 starts making fun of Bethesda
---
People expecting this game to be like titanfall2 (for example) should quit, it is never going to be that polished. 
---
Yet the game engine/mechanics allow for a much broader set of playstyles and thus stays interesting (you can always build a new character, swap perk cards), at least for me.   
---
Because I enjoy the world they developed and have a lot of fun playing it.
---
Thanks for the clarification. Still a great story!! Need more story telling like that
---
I'm on the good servers
---
I found the Strength Perk to reduce armor weight saves more carry space than maxed-out Packrat but if you want to carry tons of junk then you already have a good thing going. i also have Luck at 3, i personally don‚Äôt need a bunch of crit to get by but it would probably be good for PvP or SBQ.
---
i‚Äôd also suggest 4 Charisma for maxed Lone Wanderer perk.
---
Same here. Poorly balanced, uninspired crap. Its likely just copied the worst of Destiny and the worst of Warframe and shoved them wholesale into a Far Cry game.
---
Absolutely worst coop shooter experience I have ever seen.
---
Am I the only person that was disappointed that this wasn't a video of someone going to check out someone's siren trap camp?  
---
I mean I'm glad that it was blocking turret campers from the back door of the golf club, but was really hoping I'd see someone walk into a trap.
---
I think even that's too much work for some. 
---
Glowing meat.
---
Doesn't seem to be working for me on XB1, only thing that appears to be working is the Power User perk.
---
Many plans are always there now.  But there are some that are still RNG server hop fodder.
---
Heavy and Sturdy Combat armor plans are not always available at Watoga Station.  I've never seen more than 1 Heavy and 1 Sturdy listed at any given time.  Sometimes I've seen none of either.
---
BOS Vendor Phoenix also had some random CAMP plans.  The three Television plans I had not seen listed simultaneously.  Always one at a time.  And the Artillery plan seemed to be missing more often than not.
---
Many armor mod plans are just plain MIA from vendors now.  Ones that were common like the BOS Combat armor mod plans that were frequently at Grafton or sometimes Welch.  Pocketed and Deep Pocketed mod plans also AWOL.
---
Attempts have been made to document permanent vs rng availability, but nothing complete as far as I'm aware.
---
That‚Äôs weird, you don‚Äôt matter enough for me to look forward to.
---
I also never had any issues until the last week or two.  I've had a couple people approach my base and start destroying stuff.  Each time they did it when I was there which means they simply look at the map and if a dot doesn't move, they go there.  They do this for 2 reasons, 1 it's easy to identify possible bases, 2 they are childish, social rejects who only get pleasure by ensuring they have an audience for their misbehaviour.  I simply block them and then server hop when this happens.  You are going to find this segment of retards no matter what you play, so just ignore them.
---
Excellent feedback for them, good luck having them read it.    
---
    
---
I believe that most of the feedback in this forum goes nowhere, we get a stock patronizing message saying it has been passed on or some such and all that gets done is catering to whiners over dying to easily to higher level characters in the game that shouldn't be PvP to start with.    
---
Best of luck with this well thought out post.
---
I'm the only person I know that bought it, it was quite fun at times but it's the same *this should be better and I know it* gut feeling that most of us are getting with 76. I mean sure I still love fallout but they should have definitely released some major content by now and not just shitty things in the atom store that no one really cares about
---
I havent seen the bos plans at the vender since the patch
---
I don't actually. I do know the pipe bolt action pistol coverted to a rifle keeps its pistol ap cost.
---
My combat rifle goes thru my ap way faster but its rof is obviously way higher.
---
I think some mods can bring it down too
---
&gt;It asked for feedback, 
---
"Guys they're listening to us! The developers are listening! This means they're listening so stop complaining!!" ~ People who say they see nothing wrong with this game.
---
Thanks for the update. I was not a fan of the first, unfortunately. I‚Äôll still give this a shot if I get an invite though.
---
Did you read what it said when you turned on pacifist mode? All it does is stop you from doing damage to other players. But that you can still be killed. 
---
LOL! Priceless.
---
Yeah i just noticed the winky face being a wink...
---
Lol me too :)
---
yes, and I have some photos of it. And it's creepy. 
---
Lmfao the vault boys
---
I'm on ps4 and it is still cheaper to repair with the perk then without 
---
Thank you! I thought I was going crazy. What a wacky new system we live in.
---
This is about a 25 hour game, the shortest and least quests and content of any besthedia game. People have played hundreds of hours then realized that. 
---
Cool story bro (continues to enjoy game) 
---
I don't think it should. I would rather see a hotkey or something you can add to the favorite wheel to quick switch. 
---
I could see someone attacking you or your camp and you don't want to pvp but they jump in front of you while you're just trying to fight a molerat attacking your tato plant and you accidentally hit them now they can full on pvp you no slap damage. 
---
I think bases should have slap damage as well if your not engaged in Pvp and slap damage should he limited to 1 hp per hit no matter how strong you are.
---
Pretty crazy right. The filthy casuals sub is the new "blind eye" sub.
---
&gt;FO76 is the first time they have zero help from the mod community, and it is showing.
---
many of their 'bug fixes' have actually come from copying modders
---
people still mod fo76, and the dev team still takes their work
---
I thank you for the update Devann. While i no longer have faith in the team remaining on the game. You and Lone do wonderful jobs. I hope the future is bright for you two around here.
---
Both of these issues should of heen correct in patch 1 but knowing they are been corrected soon is good enough for now.
---
Thanks Devann.
---
exactly right! 
---
Nope. It's permanent. Once in a while there's a flaky bot that will attack, but that's an outlier.
---
The target market for FO76 is people who DON‚ÄôT need to go to the bathroom.   That‚Äôs why there is no ‚Äúpause‚Äù function.
---
Same. I grabbed em all before the patch, but it sucks if they are just no longer available for the general population. That's uncool.
---
Thanks for being active and engaging with us here. Could they at least address this in a future ItV? It would be nice if the community managers weren't the ones having to constantly apologize.
---
U.S Army survivors that are in full survival mode shooting first and asking questions later.
---
 Yeah they would treat me like gold if this was true. They don't. ;)
---
Hi5.  The lighthouse one is easy to avoid cuz you can stall all the firefly juice in at once, but I don't feed the people anymore in case I accidentally feed them my dress.
---
Yeah those people are not helping. I mean I get it, they enjoy the game as it is, they're fine with the bugs, the problems, the content, I'm not trying to minimalize or invalidate their enjoyment.
---
But when they make post after post demanding that people stop complaining, yeah they're part of the problem.
---
That is the biggest issue IMO, people that just bitch and moan but don't present a considered opinion or readable feedback.    
---
PLEASE FIX YOUR GRAMMAR AND SPELLING.    
---
not you OP.
---
You are so lucky. I ran my first ever whitesprings nuke yesterday, first two legendary ghouls I killed were empty, the third disappeared into a bush. 
---
Does that count as negative legendary drops? Am I in legendary debt now?
---
Is there a lfg for this game?
---
Hello fellow commie 
---
That is good to know!!  (I don't PVP)
---
I don't mind this as much as when Phoenix gets stuck in the geometry - usually in the western wall of the Super Duper Mart.
---
Agree w/ most of these points.  I really wish we had enemies that used cover/tactics better instead of just waves of enemies running into your face forcing melee 95% of the time.  That gets really old and boring quick.  
---
Definitely starting to look like a successful robbery facilitated by broken promises.
---
Heh its more about internet connections
---
Yup.
---
The community will become one of those toxic in denial subs that scares new users off. Sadly I can only think of political examples and have no interest in starting that kind of shit here.
---
You mean you actually got something from a legendary mob?  Lucky bastard!  3\* with zero dropped items and wait for minutes and nothing loads into their corpse the whole time....  happened a number of times (also with lesser leggendary mobs, but it sucks the worst with the 3 stars.
---
I think camps should have the slap mechanic as well, and slap damage should be limited to 1 hp no matter how strong you are.
---
I didn't read much but the headline.
---
You are right. there is no point. Stop playing, And stop posting about a game you hate and aren't enjoying. 
---
It's never going to be what you want. Whatever that is. I don't think you even know, because next week, you'll probably have something else you are mad about.
---
There's lots of other games. Sure maybe you are in love with the past games of \[Insert Game Francise Name\]. But you just have to accept. It's now officially dead and ruined for all time!
---
**FOR ALL TIME!** Please, just attend the funeral and move on. Perhaps you could take up your old hobby of making hand crafted didlos? There's a market for them on etsy.   
---

They asked me how well I understood game theory. I said I had a theoretical degree in gaming. 
---
I got a Bloodied Grognak Axe and 2 Shot Gauss Rifle from some random 3 star legendaries in the wild yesterday. I think I'm doing something right.
---
Welcome to.. 
---
THE END GAME.. 
---
 Play a different game until some DLC comes out?  Go outside and get some sunshine and exercise?
---
Yeah I took some too üëçüèº
---
do you have any idea how PR works
---
No no. It's all about Bethesda favoring some people over others. They are watching.
---
Always watching. 
---
ME2 sequesl is the exact moment.
---
Ditching all the RPG systems in favor of cloning Gears of War was the EXACT moment.
---
The same change happened with DA2 right after.
---
Easy solution: quintuple their leg hp and, give them marsuapial and speed demon.
---
I only recently discovered how great that perk is! It‚Äôs great when you get that massive boost out of something! As if an extra reward for a job well done.
---
Nope try again 
---
Well done! See saying nice things works!
---
if you are getting lots and lots of glitches it may be an unstable mem OC
---
Wanamingoes would be one of the few monsters that aren't used by Bethesda. Let's get those in 3D.
---
I know im only missing the chest plans, guess ill wait til the queen drops it
---
Ok thanks didn‚Äôt remember holt will check after work üëç
---
Yeah, I [directly asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al3xwg/comment/efcdqhb?st=JRWA92QH&amp;sh=aece5dce) one of the community managers about transparency with the roadmap and they gave me a vague useless answer. 
---
Either the community managers have nothing to do with Bethesda or Bethesda just doesn‚Äôt give a shit. We‚Äôve posted this stuff a million times...
---
Mirelurk Queens are stupidly OP.
---
Its probably a single, stressed-out guy left behind in a basement and ordered by the management to "fix Fo76 by himself".
---
Probably as a disciplinary action...
---
T-60, at least as far as springs go, T-60 legs don't require springs for repair. Excavator and X-01 use springs to repair legs. As far as the other mats I'm sure T-60 is less.
---
EA heard Warframe was good.
---
They copy pasted and deleted all the complex systems that could be intimidating to lowest common denominator players.
---
Don't get to bent about the downvotes.  Some malcontents have bots that auto downvote in an effort to trigger folks and sow anger.  Ignore it.  +1 from me to offset.
---
I have hope to OP don't worry you're not alone. What pains me the most is that if this was ANY OTHER COMPANY the game would already be declared dead and people would move on. The fact it's Bethesda and so many people are clinging onto that last breath of hope kills me when I see posts like this. I really hope for the lifelong fans it turns into something great. Stay strong OP you are not alone. 
---
Neither work for me. I've also never heard another person speak. I just assumed that shit was broke for everyone. 
---
thanks - I hadn't considered that, and it seems like I remember reading something to that effect a while ago now...and I may have a perk card that reduces camp/workshop resource requirements (?) I'll have to check...wonder if that would help? 
---
Look me up (GT is my name here).   
---
As is that dad of the Corps, or dad of THE Corps? If the latter, SFMF!
---
been at least 2 months without them attacking me and 600 hours of game time, they aren't supposed to go back to aggro on the player after that quest.
---
I feel your pain Brother. I am so close to uninstalling and calling it done. Going to go back to FO4, Maybe New Vegas with the "New California" game mod. As for the TSE weapons I finally scored two in one day, 4 days later they were worthless.
---
Lol i thought they fixed scorchbeasts. Guess not.
---
Everything gets downvoted on this page.
---
Just watch...
---
I had a two shot explosive black powder pistol disappear from my inventory but not my entire stash. That‚Äôs a huge bummer. 
---
Update: I'm now at the point where I'm selling X01 Shocks for profit.
---
Got 1 mod for sale now. :)
---
Look into Anthem. It's got the same amount of end game content FO76/Destiny2 had on release. Not sharing an opinion on how I feel about the game, but it the beta Anthem had allowed players to complete 25% of the games full content (as far as raids/dungeons go). Just a tid bit for thought if you're into that! 
---
The completionist behind me wants a level 50 mirv lol plus exploding ones self is an art form.
---
Tag them and let him kill them enjoy free xp
---
Dude I‚Äôve been on this sub and game for so long- defending it, suggesting ideas, and giving it nearly all of my gaming/free time...
---
I asked myself that same question
---
With each update the game only becomes, more tedious nothing outside of Atom content is added, and Bethesda devs continue to ignore much of the feedback and even when they do address an issue they approach it completely from the wrong perspective e.g. nerfing Explosive rounds by nerfing Explosive perk..
---
I am so so defeated on this subject, hope you‚Äôre having fun elsewhere OP
---
Edgy.
---
I hate to admit it but that's probably spot on.
---
Cause I enjoy it for what it is and not get sucked up into pointless whine and drama I‚Äôll enjoy it for as long as it‚Äôs online and Bethesda supports it to each there own don‚Äôt like it don‚Äôt play it have a good one 
---
Well Bethesda made one thing. I will never preorder their games ever. And will buy some only after super close look of trusted reviewer.
---
Bethesda, please, please tell us why the servers are so laggy and can't handle me making 10 boiled waters pushing the buttons fairly slowly! PLEASE do something. We can't do anything without severe server lag and I know it's not dupers. There are not people duping on every server 24/7
---
BOS mod plans still spawn in. The wild.  
---
Our blood sacrifices to Todd are paying off I see! Carry on, fellow paid Bethesda shill! üòÖ
---
We need to find you another open world game to play.
---
When I get in the game I will test a few weapons and see if I can approximate numbers.
---
Actual "role playing" roleplayers are very rare among video gamers. Maybe they are more common among Fallout gamers, though; I don't know. (Personally, I find LARPers and cosplayers and roleplayers difficult to interact with. A fantasy character being acted out makes me uncomfortable. Not saying its bad; just being honest.)
---
Personally, when I sit down to play a game for an hour or two before bed, I am tired. My creativity has been spent doing my job and playing with kids. I just want to have a little fun and consume entertainment rather than produce entertainment. Producing entertainment is what I pay the game creators to do.
---
Does FO76 require me to entertain myself? To basically do their job for them? Okay, I guess, but I can do that sitting on my couch with the game off. If the game is not contributing...what have I even paid for?
---
Get this on the forums for Bethesda!!! 
---
Tremendous quest line, and yet a huge missed opportunity. Imagine actually having the ability to revitalize old factions and then battle each other. Responders vs Raiders vs Solo vs BoS vs Mistress of Mysteries. You could have groups with beneficial perks (Responders), damage perks (Raiders), Looting perks (Solo), Power Armor perks (BoS) and Sneaking perks (MoM). With balanced factions, it would give people a reason to PvP. I just picture the MoM folks being ninjas and jumping into battles between the other factions to diminish them both. You could contribute to the headquarters and revitalize the network, allowing for special items to be created through the machinery in the basement.
---
Ugh...so much potential...
---
4 separate Legendary ghouls dropped me a loading symbol 
---
Rp will be great when they have custom servers with mods.
---
Would also be interesting to see if a rp community like Garry‚Äôs mod/arma  comes up.
---
You didnt address anything i said. Of course i know how it works but the time for nice words and pacification is over. IMO When you have a dumpster fire the best move is to go for full transparency and do what you say you are going to, ASAP. 
---
In 3 of my last 7 battles, her health meter stuck with about 25 percent health left. She got down there in about 10 minutes. It was predominantly high level players, so it wasn‚Äôt the low level buff she gets (which I don‚Äôt understand either). It‚Äôs exceedingly frustrating. Broken weapons, massive ammo dump and chem use. The cost-benefit just screams don‚Äôt go. Especially for that one star tire iron. 
---
Yea it doesnt increase
---
My girlfriend also mentioned this to me, but I think my wife was the angry one. Woops.
---
I blame texting shorthand and the post 90s online gaming generation growing up able to badmouth things behind a screen name with no consequence.
---
I have personally witnessed younger employees learn the harsh lesson that freedom of speech is not freedom of civil or social consequence of said speech.
---
I paid $40 for Diablo 2 LoD and probably got 2000 hours out of it.
---
I think the maybe 120 hours of content, maximum, that FO76 offers is covered by that $60. 
---
Thanks. I just thought it was funny.
---
Ditched the game after the weapon nerf and haven't looked back since. 
---
Jesus fucking Christ, no. Not every game needs to have a goddamn battle royale.
---
Centaurs are already kind of in the game.  If you look at concept art for Fallout 4 centaurs, and then look at a snallygaster, you'll see that they actually look quite similar.  And snallygasters pretty much attack the same way too.  Spit acid at a distance, whip you with their tongues up close.
---
I wish you had reported him for abusive chat / abusive and obnoxious behavior.  If you remember his username you can still report him manually through support.
---
That or we can make some orbital strikes...
---
And if you've taken a small gander at the percentile of achievements completed, you get a good idea of how far the average person plays the game.   I would imagine that those who finish the game just happen to rank up very high with those who have the patch.
---
We're listening to your concerns and have passed them along to the game devs. Hey, while you‚Äôre here, take a moment to head to the Atomic Shop, because we‚Äôve added a variety of new items you can pick up using the Atoms you‚Äôve earned by completing challenges, like Black Sunglasses, the VTU Track Suit, the Red Rocket Bed, and more.
---
I think the above comment is mostly correct with the exception that you have to disassemble everything to get the benefit. 
---
You don‚Äôt have to scrap everything. I‚Äôve definitely gotten much more mileage out of my budget when I fully rebuild from stored material, not blueprints. 
---
I went from a dinky wood cabin to a now massive brick Camp with all sorts of goodies. 
---
Same situation for me, and I didn't quit because of that(other than the disconnects from server that is), I stopped playing FO76 because I got tired of it after 200+ hours of gameplay and one level 156 character... this happens with every fallout game I have ever played though, so it literally doesn't bother me at all. 
---
I loved the game when I was playing it, and it gave me about the same amount of fun as Fallout 3, Fallout NV, and Fallout 4. I would say that at times the gameplay stream definitely felt a little more like a chore than those games at times, but I still loved the universe and the exploration and storyline.
---
I will come back with the release of DLC, and by that point, the game should feel refreshed to me, it is exactly what happened in FO3 and FO4 for me. In fallout 3 I came back after the broken steel release and beat all the DLCs, along with the whole game again, which was awesome... and I did the same with Fallout 4 after the release of Nuka World. 
---
Actually I don‚Äôt think we have zoos here.
---
Are you on PC? I have the neon letters &amp; will help you build this
---
Yep. Probably a skeleton crew assigned to Fallout 76. It's also intern/co-op season right now.
---
Will do
---
camden park
---
It would be nice if you could decorate ANYTHING wouldn't it?
---
Level 151 on my main character that I've been playing since B.E.T.A.
---
I guess I'm still playing because I'm an idiot that actually enjoys the exploring a large map full of varying environments and locations. That and I've yet to experience any game-breaking bugs. 
---
The only reason I've been playing less now is due to the negativity surrounding the game whenever I go online to talk to anyone about it. Really bumming me out. Well, that and I've completed a lot of the side quests and am waiting to complete the final quest of the main story line. 
---
But it's up to you to stop if you find yourself not having fun. Just like how I finally gave up Overwatch (been playing since Season 1) because it's finally reached a point where I'm finding myself ending a night of games frustrated instead of content. Personally, I've loved playing FO76, and all the negativity feels blown out of proportion (not saying that it is, just that it feels that way to me). But if you genuinely aren't enjoying it then stop playing. Like people say all the time, vote with your wallet. Stop supporting BGS if you think their quality has declined beyond an acceptable point. 
---
I had some of my table-top D&amp;D players complain that my encounters annoyed them because things they fought rarely did so to the death. I pointed out to them fighting mercenaries, bandits, etc, is not the same as fighting an animal with no situational awareness. People can get scared and run away.
---
 And the quantum fields producing all the particles, including the quarks.
---
Hey great tip, thank you! I have yet to try that but as I‚Äôm leveling my new build I should definitely do that. Thanks again! 
---
Seems like Diablo 3. Tons of people on release and becoming more of a ghost town every day after.
---
Deathclaws have a ton of potential in a game set so close to the war. What if they had different kind of prototypes running about? It could end with the Jackson chameleon based one coming out on top. 
---
That would take focus on weapon balance across the board...something they clearly haven't been able to do for 3 months because they are too busy thumbing themselves.
---
Just a note if you run low or out again. You can make healing salve for 1 boiled water, 1 soot flower and 1 bloodleaf at a chem station (located behind the robot in the flatwoods church). All if these ingredients can be found around Flatwoods (the starting town).
---
Super mutants and mole miners take so long to kill but don't dish out much damage unless they melee or use explosives. I wish that was different. 
---
every person i know stop playing 3 weeks in. 2 lasted about a month on off. i have paused myself as well
---
scrap mole miners gauntlets/teeth
---
Then they could use the same logic they did for Sloths. Someone's exotic pet's that got loose. (You can find sloth enclosures in one of the mansions in the ash heap).
---
Some items have similar names, or names that are unclear as to what they are.  Really bad with CAMP items.  A plan will unlock one item, and you think it unlocks another, or a set of others, but those are a different plan.
---
What plans specifically did you buy?
---
Diablo 3 was a complete and utter mess at launch. It took them a couple years but they managed to turn the game around.
---
**IF** bethesda is going to turn 76 around they're going to have to wow us. The thing is though, Bethesda has wow'd us in the past with storytelling, and compelling characters. Something which 76 isn't even equipped to receive yet, much less already in possession of.
---
Rose and Modus are arguably the only characters in the entire game and neither are compelling.
---
Tables, planters and plots for growing food.
---
Don't forget Hunger games mode
---
I use them... even though I went carnivore and gave up my farm.  I put them circling my camp and they are usually the first thing attacked... probably 90% of the time.  Cheap to repair and not affected by the 3X cost "repair all structures" bug like crops are.
---

That went over my head. I meant it as in the The Corps with the green weenie

Thank you

&gt; Where are the birds?
---
The cats ate them. After the bombs dropped, all the housecats were forced into the wild and wiped out the bird population.
---
Got ya so for me being a maintenance electrician/troubleshooter it's like remember capacitance can still bite you and often times harder than the supplying voltage. 
---
Agreed then. 
---
For the same reason I'm married to you?
---
That'd be cool to see, a Glowing Deathclaw snatching a Scorchbeast from the sky, ripping it to shreds within seconds then looking at you with the "You're next, bitch" look
---
I‚Äôm a roleplayer, too, but this game is nearly the worst of the Fallout franchise when it comes to the roleplaying aspect.  I shouldn‚Äôt have to spend half my time scavenging for screws and springs, only to have the gun/armor/whatever I *just* repaired break again in the first or second hostile encounter.  I shouldn‚Äôt have to served hop because the little hideaway with a scrap heap I put my camp on belongs to someone else in the blink of an eye between when I log off IRL and come back at a later time.  I shouldn‚Äôt have to go through the same quest over and over again, only for the game to crash at practically the same point every time.
---
Things that break the immersion annoy me, and F76 is *just* above Fallout ~~Shelter~~ FarmVille in terms of keeping me invested in the world.  Hell, even Fallout: ~~Brotherhood of Steel~~ Contra Edition does a comparable job, and that‚Äôs just...sad.
---
All I can remember is that Beth came to help Obsidian with a patch, that fixed a shitload of bugs, and some of those bugs even corrupted the save files. This info can also be found in FONV wiki.
---
But this info came from Beth, so I don't know if it's true.
---
If you're on pc, pm me here. IGN:brodonalds
---
They probably used radiation to preserve it
---
Another note - CAMP items from the Atom Shop should cost 0 budget. It's like they don't want people buying things from their store. 
---
Please no
---
I used to see Patrol duty pop up all the time and now never see it.  I lived right near the prison for a long time and it seemed to just stop happening.
---
Please provide a source because the only thing I've seen is that "in a future update" meaning it will eventually get done but maybe not for months at this rate.  Meanwhile that f-ing bullshit event ate the best piece of chameleon armor I've found weeks ago and it still isn't fixed.  If I recall correctly, after doing some reading about this one, it has been an issue since Beta.  That is 3+ months of people losing crap to that stupid hopper and still no fix.
---
The fact that it can take legendary items from you and you have no way of getting them back is garbage.  
---
I paid $80 as well but it's a waste of time worrying what others paid. Did you play this game much? did you have fun with it? I did and I'm sure I'll go back to it at some point if they haven't completely fucked it up. While I think they deserve plenty of criticism at the state of release and their poor handling of it since then, I think I got my money's worth.
---
Always fast travel there first.  Works about 90% of the time for me
---
They could definitely add raiders to outlying areas. I miss hearing them talk shit before you blast them. 
---
Anytime my friend. I feel it better to teach a man/woman to fish. I hope this knowledge helps you in your future travels.
---
Rumors?
---
I feel ‚Äúworth it‚Äù is too open ended.  If you are hurting for money it‚Äôs not worth it.  If 50 bucks is not gonna hurt you, it‚Äôs worth it. 
---
not too many.  last few times i have played i have been the only or almost the only player on the server.
---
With Anthem and The Division 2 coming out within the next 2 months, both games in the same genre as Fallout 76, bethesda is going to have to really pull out all the stops on fixes and content to retain a playerbase.
---
Given how they've handled fallout 76 up to this point though, I'm not optimistic.
---
It's all about aesthetics bruh
---
I need more stash space. I haven't sprinted except in my fully modded Excavator in forever. And sometimes even that requires Party Girl and a Bottle of Whisky with Radicool and over 50% rads. I want to collect armor sets. I want a set of Mutant Slayer and Troubleshooter and Sentinel and Zealots, etc. I want an arsenal of weapons to play with in different situations when the mood takes me. I have to constantly be switching carry weight perks in and out and jumping in and out of Excavator to fast travel etc. It's not fun.
---
It was brotherhood/ tactics new Vegas looks similar to three and is in the Mojave dessert
---
Yeah!!
---
I mean, in still subscribed to this forum, but I've been enjoying the hard drive space and Apex Legends. Just saying. 
---
Honestly, half the reason I play now is because the game is online only, and I figure it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Bethesda realizes how badly they shit the bed on this game and pull the plug on the servers.  
---
I pride myself on owning a copy of every Fallout game published, but this is the only one I‚Äôll never get to play again when people move on.
---
The whole game is lazy, longer this goes on less hope I have
---
to me that's THE Corps.   
---
Again, look me up when you're online - I have plenty of stimpacks / diluted stimpacks for you.
---

---
It's not even designed well for co-op though. Having all plot unfold through recorded dialogue is a terrible idea for groups of players. Everyone has to be quiet and coordinate listening to holos which is just dumb. Dialogue should come from the world or not at all.
---
Almost every challenge I have for discovering locations is bugged. I have discovered multiple locations that the game says I haven't, and as a result am missing out on hundreds of Atoms. 
---
I'm pretty sure it's a display error. The handmade rifle had a fire rate or 24 vs the assault rifle at 40 a couple weeks ago. The math gave the assault rifle a considerable DPS advantage. In my unspecced hands the handmade is 124.8dps and the assault rifle is 152dps.

Getting absolutely nothing from a legendary corpse and in some cases a multi-star legendary is the worst I've gotten, repeatedly.    Yes, I do wait for the contents to load.  I've tried waiting their for minutes staring at the corpse inventory.  I've tried hanging out in the area for minutes and checked.... still nothing.    
---
Thankfully it doesn't happen all the time, but when it happens to a 3\* legendary several times over the last few weeks, it sucks.
---
There also is a third version, but we aren't aloud to talk about it...
---
&gt;I just enjoy grinding and leveling up
---
You've been painted with the "minmaxer brush"

If this story is fake, then he did a pretty good job making it sound real and relatable. I believe that a concerned wife would ask a husband why he was doing something that is so annoying and frustrating to him, and then the husband realizing that he just really couldn't figure out why he didn't enjoy the game is something that I literally did myself during the B.E.T.A.... I couldn't figure out why I had played for 9 hours straight when I wasn't having fun after 5.
---
Yeah, had a SBQ do that. Had some other legendaries just flat f-ing disappear too.  Very annoying!
---
Thank you for real feedback and not petulant pissing and moaning. 
---
I've forgotten what it's like to fast travel

I just want corner stairs that won't have me dedicate 2 slots for stairs...

I got the bathtub plan and steel scrap

You all deserve it for pre ordering. Just wait in a queue for fuck sake.
---
Did you consider that maybe the servers aren't going to be stable after an increase in the stash size limit and they just have't said that testing failed? I have had no issue with the stash limit. I had to stop collecting like I did in the other fallout games but it hasn't impacted my game play in any way, I see no reason to collect unique but useless items in 76 and happily give away weapons/armour that I can't use, even 3* versions.
---
Lvl 1 nocturnal wood left leg. 
---
Even that‚Äôs too much.
---
people aren't really leaving the game. They are having hissy fits for attention and getting upvoted. 
---
I want more stash space. But then, I'm pretty smart, and I can figure out what I need to keep and what I don't. I also don't hoard weapons, with the idea that will one day be useful.
---
This really isn't a game for people without much ability to think.
---
That sub was created by Vault-Tec wasn't it?
---
Really? You think it‚Äôs better than X: Yes B: No Y: Maybe A: Leave? 
---
Psh.
---
I have leveled up and seen my camp budget increase.   I've also seen my camp budget sit stagnant for many levels but when I move my camp or better yet break my camp down and rebuild it, now it uses less budget.   So the budget doesn't always get recalculated the way it should until you move the camp (and place it block by block)  or if that doesn't work until you break it down and rebuild it.
---
The big publishers will always target the widest audience. Those of us looking for more unique and nuanced games have to look to Digital Extremes, Grinding Gear, Obsidian, Larian, and other small to midsized studios who are happy to make money and not comparing every release to FIFA.
---
Luckily, I think the days of the big publishers are coming to a close they have their place for franchises that require exorbitant license fees; Sports Titles, Disney, etc but these dinosaurs are dying. The days of needing a publisher for distribution and reaching your audience are ending. 
---
I bought the game after playing the BETA because I actually enjoyed it. I was one of the people who actually enjoyed the game at release. BUUUUUUT their idiotic updates and "balance changes" have actually made my game experience worse. Never had a game to that before lol! What a waste of a great game world.
---
I think that they should really make sure to be careful about what creatures they bring in. Spore Carriers iirc are an invention of the Big MT, so if they get added, there should be some lore like a secret research facility was working with the Big MT about the virus. 
---
Same thing with Cazadores. 
---
Just from my experiences here, I‚Äôd say the fandom really hates it when the lore gets broken, so, in order to avoid controversy, Bethesda should add it in, in a very lore-friendly way.
---
That sounds pretty anazing, honestly
---
Agreed... same experience here. This game is easy mode. Only time I ever get my ass handed to me is when I'm not paying attention and do something really stupid. Use the tools that are given to you, you don't \*need\* legendary weapons. 
---
U never encountered a wendigo?
---
Sounds like their code is a mess then 
---
My questions are: If they are done with it, will they let us know? I mean, what if they AREN'T going to release new content after all, will they at least tell us? No, probably not huh.  
---
and, CAN it be opened to modders? We heard about how maybe one day there'd be private servers and modders. CAN this actually happen if Beth washes their hands of it?
---
I'm pretty sure there coming back in a couple of months to see how the game is.
---
I feel sad for you and the OP then. 
---
Imagine. not being smart enough to put down a game you aren't enjoying. 
---
I mean, wow, you needed someone else to tell you what to do when you were feeling this way.
---
it's kind of like the several other posts I saw of this nature. 
---
Sad that you can't even think for yourselves about your own feelings. 
---
No wonder a game is causing you so much emotional anxiety and frustration. It's you, not the game it seems. 
---
Honestly the Mirelurks except for the queen are done right in my opinion. The Normal ones, have a sweet spot to hit, which makes them at least some-what more fun than the general bullet sponges you encounter. 
---
The King is fun, sure it spams, but it doesn't bother me anywhere near what the SB's do, and since it's on the ground at least you can fight back and hope to hit it. 
---
The Queen - Good lord give me a spot that does more damage on that thing or turn down it's health/armor. It's just a big blob that absorbs bullets at this point. 
---
The sexy servers! Ooops. 
---
You're doing it wrong.
---
No love for sloths D: but i agree, most need some kind of scaling on their damage output badly. 
---
Its the leeching that is resented, not "joining in" on the fun. 
---
It's months old at this point your anger isn't exactly justified
---
Same issue they had with Skyrim dragons 
---
I'm just gonna buy all my Bethesda titles used, from now on. If I go to a third-party store like Gamestop (but not Gamestop, because fuckem) and buy used, Bethesda doesn't get the money from my purchase, and I still get to play their game. 
---
Welcome to the club. People who say we are haters, can suck it because I'm not getting back that 400 to 500 hours. What a waste when you can't even build on top of patches and leveling actually hurts you more the higher level you are. What a broken scale. Not even worth posting on the forum anymore.
---
I find it funny we still have people bitching about their preorders of video games not being worth it after literal decades of older gamers saying not to do it.
---
If you're upset for paying full price for a game and it going on sale later on, you're just an idiot.
---
Most games go on sale for around half off or more within 6 months of release (either winter or summer sales).
---
The antipreorder movement is so widely know r/gamingcirclejerk formed to shit talk people trying to get everybody to buy smarter not harder.
---
I bet you unironically use the word "cuck" as well. 
---
In a way, its more organized than F4s code. However for certain tasks it's not straightforward. 
---
Game just acts wierd sometimes..like when u have flora in front of u and it doesn't let u pick it up
---
That was a fantastic quest line.
---
New Vegas has a mod that fixes a ton of bugs also.
---
Bethesda cancelled the pot-luck and decided to have this event catered, and the caterers suck. Now they are too far invested into this event and the guests are leaving after having been fed this unpalatable mess. Honestly, Bethesda really screwed up here. This game should still be in a closed Alpha / Beta with members of the community / modders (specifically) climbing through this game and "HELPING" with fixing it, not doing it for them like they are accustom to. This is what happens when you take a game that has been single player ("open ended") basically for the last decade + and try to do it all yourself with a studio that has almost no experience with this game or this field. The game is broken, there is no other way to put it. This game is literally Fallout 4 (stripped down) with the Fallout 3 "incomplete multi-player mod" that was being worked on slapped into it and "refined". The largest resource Bethesda had was the modding community and they couldn't even be bothered enough to "ask" for input. This game was a cash grab, plain and simple. They didn't even phone this in, someone decided to drop a sticky note on someones desk. Let me say this just so I am clear on this, I "did" get my "enjoyment" out of this game up til the last patch even with all the bugs in the game, and I do still have hopes for this game as long as they reach out to people who understand the game and can actually contribute to making it better. 
---
But MH is actually good while F76 is horrific.
---
If my Atom shop payments solidify the future of this game I am happy. I hope Bethesda doesn't go down the path of BDO or the other P2W games. 
---
&gt; Honeybeast: Another good original monster, but stupidly rare. More spawns would be nice and are well balanced on the risk/reward scale.
---
Middle Mountain Cabins spawns these very often, along with Yao Guai and Radscorpions. Irrational Fear event always spawns them as well. 
---
Really liked your ideas about unique Cryptid recipes and loot! 
---
Apex Legends will save your sanity, from a married couple to the next.
---
I might get some hate for this but Anthem was giving me some bad fallout 76 vibes. Beautiful game and could be fun but overall lots of things just done poorly. I‚Äôm pulling a wait and see but I expect most people to stop playing after a month. One of the things the game offers is a combo damage system that you need to use in order to progress the higher difficulty but the match making offers you no way to change your load out to work with your current team. Also there are only 3 strongholds aka dungeons so it will get old fast. No text chat, with devs not even saying anything towards the request which has lead to speculation that it is do to the CVAA by the community. Even though this would make them not complaint for people hard of hearing. They also just announced the mic will be set to open by default (sound familiar) I‚Äôm not trying to bring the game down and it really can be a fun game just like fallout 76. I just see a lot of the same mistakes happening so I‚Äôm going to hold off. My suggestion would be to watch a stream of it and decide from there. 
---
None of my friends play it anymore so I‚Äôll probably end up quitting too. 
---
Yeah but now we have pvp servers!!!!
---
They didn't require as much as work as FO76 required. That's just a lie. I played all of those games, they weren't nearly as broken and void of content as FO76 lol. Which is why FO76 is doing much worse than them.
---
Sumnersville for super mutants
---
&gt; Uhhhh we already funded you‚Äôre game
---
What part of recurring costs don't you get?
---
It would be nice if they could make the milk machine or ice machine work like separate storage containers for this purpose.
---
Oh sorry, I was just stating a fact. Sorry if facts trigger you  
---
As much fun as hoarding is, maybe try to get rid of some stuff? 
---
I got used/sold/dropped hundreds of lbs of chems and food and now I can run around without traveling pharmacy and through-hiker and can use different perk cards and it is awesome!
---
Now I'm trying to get rid of the 400lbs of junk that I had stashed (why do I have 25 lbs each of nuclear material, antiseptic, gold, silver and black titanium... that I don't use for anything)
---
I wish they'd stop wasting space on reddit with their sob stories about quiting then.. lol
---
Sweet! I'll add you when I hop on tonight :)
---
I've heard the AP regen on Lone Wander, and Action Boy don't stack? You may want to consider taking bandolier 2 and not taking max ranked pack rat and pharmacy perks in STR. Carrying the thousands of rounds affects me more than junk and med weights.
---
For VATS use, even 1 rank in Adrenaline and Gun Fu (AGI) makes a huge difference in QoL. Swap them with ammosmith when not crafting. The stacking damage and long timer with Adr really adds up, and not having to break vats with Gun Fu makes killing ghoul hordes much easier.
---
You know that you will never see those servers again.
---
The first rule of the sexy servers is, there are no sexy servers.
---
I would but I‚Äôm on XBox :/
---
The faces and animations that many complained about were not really noticeable to me. I mean, seeing a side-by-side yeah I can tell, but I played through most of the game before they began "fixing" them.
---
I am generally fine with most things as is from a creature standpoint, though I like most of your comments. 
---
I think the single biggest thing FO76 can do from a creature/encounter standpoint is take on the very common and very good suggestion of making unique nuke zone bosses for different areas. Why is a jacked up Super Mutant Behemoth not a nuked boss? Why isn't a a massive festering Mirelurk Queen not a nuke boss?
---
Enhance the nuke mechanic by giving each nuke-able area a boss. and don't give us like, two more. give us like TEN. 
---
It is coming time for more content. This change shouldn't substitute more quests, unless you give us multiple new quests that end with nuking a new area to discover a new end boss. 
---
Well i stay at 20% for nerd rage and bloody, they are really help full. 50% less dmg is crazy.
---
Yeah anything more is shaping the dialogue to fit the joke, which is completely backwards
---
Pretty much my exact feelings. I enjoy it enough but damn they make it tough. I'm finally leveled high enough not to constantly worry about dying all the time. But I'm left with pretty much no content. 
---
She's right. I put it down until (if) the bugs are fixed. I'll gladly pick it back up once (if) it's working properly.
---
But there's no point in playing right now, so I don't. I keep up with this sub so I know when (if) the game is working again.
---
Kudos to those who can still find enjoyment playing through all the bugs. I'm just not one of them
---
There are chickens. -\_-
---
First time I saw the blood bugs I had a heart attack lol
---
Can confirm. I‚Äôve had no big issues and have been enjoying the experiences since Beta. Obviously the Mothman has blessed me.
---
Well not really while you're leveling up, since some cards won't unlock until a certain level and you may not even think they exist. Game took me by surprise a lot of times when I was like "well, I guess I can get that perk now, seems useful..." only to level up and get access to a perk I really need to unlock and level up as quick as I can in another special.
---
Great list.  You forgot the Wendigos, which I think are great.  I just wish I could Cannabalize them.  As Wendigos are said to eat people, it would make a fun payback.
---
It was a trap for you. You just mentioned them. 
---
I have no idea what you mean by sexy servers. 
---
&gt; Stopped working after the diseases wore off.
---
Yeah, that's the bug.
---
How? Did we read the same thing?
---
True
---
Same. If I dont have room I give it to my friends or some random player I find.
---
I stopped playing around December because after I finished the main quest line at lvl 30 i had all this gear that i needed to be lvl 50+ to use and I wasn‚Äôt going to waste my time xp farming in a game with little to no content after the main quests. Occasionally ill play it but I almost immediately get off and play something else when I remember how dreadfully slow leveling up is
---
I have never had a problem getting rad worms back to back after curing it while under a mutation.  I've not used a lot of energy weapons but every time they have done very good because of how low energy resistance is in most mobs.  So they are addressing her bad loot. How ever the complaints about being able to loot her seems tied to the legendary issue. One I've not had. I just killed to legendary guys as we speak around white springs and got 2 legendary weapons. I mean they aren't very good for me so they will be sold but I got them. 
---
I was where you are geographically wise when I was level 40, got fed up I couldn‚Äôt go anywhere unless my friend was on(who sucked) so I bought a tse shotty(prepatch) and literally pumped my way from roses tower thru bos and to the enclave in a week, and kinda wish I didn‚Äôt. Stay where you are, the game is pretty balanced play when you are low level finding things, sticking to the left side of map and it‚Äôs super interesting, just take your time and enjoy why you play the game man
---
That's the first step in getting onto the secret servers. If you can get the mothman to bless you. People wonder why there's no quests around the mothman. 
---
There are. On the secret servers. 
---
I was giving the probable reason your whole team got kicked as one.  Yes, it proves your point.  You seem a bit stressed.
---
I don't attack other people's camp. However there are only three cases where I can see it justified. 
---
1.) In White Springs with turrets.
---
2.) Outside the damn Charleston train station. When people camp there it breaks the spawn for the Roaming Responder Vendor. Typically it's even high level people who do this, and I've seen their camps get attacked and wonder why. That's why. 
---
3.) You just blocked off a road and filled the surrounding area with traps that cause damage to people who are just passing through. Especially if it's in low level areas. 
---
I would like to know more. Have you seen them spawn as drops from an enemy? In a particular safe?
---
Are you diluting the Stimpaks you get? Also any meat, vegetables, and some fruits? (I might be wrong about the fruit) you get you can use.. raw or cook them at the cooking station. I use food most of the time because it‚Äôs everywhere. Stimpaks I always dilute at the chem station.. I end up with so many I sell them most of the time just to free up some weight. Also do more quests maybe.. overseer caches always have them. 
---
I think the worst are the ones when you actually get a 3* legendary but the perks are useless. Like my 3* Stalkers fire axe.
---
Or 
---
When you're a level 125 and you finally get that instigating lever rifle to drop but it drops at level 35.
---
I wonder if you were submerged underwater completely with aquaboy could you survive a nuke being dropped?
---
At least players on PC have cool mods that help with inventory management. I've got rid of a lot of stuff I didn't want to like Bolstering stuff, and lost a bunch of Anti-Armor weapons trying to transfer them to another character. Some people are using mules, while those who don't suffer not being able to sprint or fast travel. I'm gonna start using mules soon too if I can figure out an effective and safe way to do it.

---
It‚Äôs a creepy decoration that I placed in a dark corner and forgotten about. I‚Äôve scared myself with it a few times.
---
I wouldn't really go that far. Mechanically, Id say yes the game was better than the original games, but story wise, even with the ABC ending of ME3, the original games still win out in my book.
---
Being a paid shill is the best! I love this bed of Fallout Merchandise I get to sleep on every night. 
---
If you really cared, you could make a second character to do the questline over again. As a bonus you may read something you missed the first time.
---
you are doing it wrong: try to make them agro and health regen before you kill them and they will drop a legendary.
---
Any location with one or more kitchens will have pots and pans, usually the large stew pots.  I like Morgantown High School; it has a kitchen plus a biology lab with surgical trays, scalpels, and the like.
---
I'm frequently in Artisan Corner and Watoga Train Station, and I'm always amazed by the generosity of my fellow players, dropping legendary gear, plans, recipes, ammo, junk, and even spoiled food. 
---
I've started doing the same, because I want to be the kind of player I want to encounter. So, thank you very much for everyone who is doing the same as well! It's appreciated!
---
Echoing what others have said, thank you for being here. Having been in position of having to talk to angry people virtually and in person on behalf of a company, I don't envy you.
---
/sigh. Speaking of, time to go make nice with a customer over a pretty big mistake...
---
To be fair, Bethesda had a very good track record for release games. Even if they were buggy, the foundation of the games were solid. 
---
Damn, well, those servers really aren't that sexy anyway. All the player characters just have Todd Howards smiling face.
---
Wow a post not crying or whineing or claiming they want to quit or how Bethesda is dead and needs to shut down etc impressive here is a upvote 
---
That's why I said a new variant based on a strangler vine taking over a host, it doesn't have to be a spore carrier just something that closely resembles it, that way it doesn't break any lore.
---
Say call it a strangler carrier and  have the host be orange/red with vines across them but look a bit like a spore carrier. Tie it to a specific place ie vault 94 and once the quest is done they appear in the mire and cranberry bog as encounters
---
Path of Exile is a fucking masterpiece.
---
Been thinking of going back to it while I wait for 76 to shit or get off the pot. Just tired of sitting at my workstation instead of lounging on the couch.
---
Shame they went with XBOX exclusivity.
---
admit it. You really haven't ever been on the third server...
---
Otherwise. You would know...
---
True but I use all the mutations except herb/cause I'm a meat eater. Can off set all the negatives when alone except 1point str. And a plus one armor fixes that and that's solo. Big plus all the way when teamed up.
---
K. bye.
---
They only agro if you attack them
---
Get the bobblehead perk card, you will be surprised where they show up, they all over, under chairs, on counters, on the door, in wash basins etc.
---
One spawns in the lighthouse on the 3rd floor in the window, they guaranteed spots, meaning they will always be there, but if someone has taken it, you need to find a new session.
---
When I find one, I add it to a spreadsheet, so I know where to go it next time or if I am trying to do the daily. challenge, same with magazines. 
---
Face and the acid spitters are her weak spots.
---
It was the first one. 
---
Unfortunately not. PS4
---
All of my friends stopped playing 6-8 weeks ago 
---
I haven't played in over 3 months.  I still visit the sub regularly to see if they've improved the game.
---
It's good, but given the recent update which means they're no longer random at all, surely we should be able to come up with a completely 100% guaranteed list?
---
My wife said the exact same thing to me. 
---
Generally speaking, birds are extremely susceptible to airborne toxins.  - canary in a coal mine, and all that. The pre-war birds all immediately died.
---
The game engine is outdated and the game is broken. 
---
Ditto, I don't think Olivia actually loved Brody - sounded like she was using him, at most would have kept him as a useful tool, but they were playing her all along. Anyways, definitely my favorite quest so far.
---
I've heard rumors that custom lights for the PA are about to become ATOM shop items instead of vendor bought. 
---
$10 on less than reputable websites for a key, Free if you buy a used controller, I've seen it as low as $25 on legitimate sites
---
The effect makes food replenish more ho, not drain slower. It works for me and cram refills like 50%
---
Don't feed this troll
---
Ok, ok, but I have been in the fourth servers. Those are excellent. Those are called The Division 2's beta servers.
---
Thanks a lot man!
---
Agree. They‚Äôre far from perfection. The AI is so broken and they‚Äôre ridiculously easy to kill. Just stand behind them if you‚Äôre a melee build, it takes them so long to turn around that you can just keep staying behind them and wailing on them and they‚Äôll die before they even touch you. It makes me sad how weak they are in this game.
---
I did the same.. Let's hope it gets fixed 
---
Even if there was people to play with what is there to do that hasn't been done to death?
---
These corpses looked remarkably fresh, unlike most you see in the game, which have a mottled, greenish look to them. I don‚Äôt remember the exact dates on the terminal entries, but it was years before vault 76 opened, so they (and probably most other corpses) should have been skeletal.
---
I jave a friend that on a daily basis says "I'm not playing again until Bethesda either fixes some bugs or adds some content." I then send him a video on the latest base building craze (latest being how to stack foundations) nexr thing I know we're nuking Fissure Prime for a third time.
---
Looks solid, a few comments:
---
5 INT points is more than you need for a pistol build. You only need 2 for making them and for most of the mods.  The .44 guns don't need repair very often; just check them occasionally.  The extra 3 points are only QOL for repairs, and could be used elsewhere, e.g. Glow Sight for nuke zones or more carry capacity.
---
If it's a new build, wait till level 45 to get the Somerset.  Get Voice of Set at level 25 since it can be upgraded; it works well for robots.  
---
Love the gold paint for the .44, but the Western Revolver is 5 levels higher and more powerful. Buy the plan for it (called Plan:Revolver) and learn the mods.  At level 50 it beats the Somerset.  Lots of fun.
---
Enjoy the build!
---
I thought dromedary only increased the amount of regeneration for the water gauge. So like it takes 2 waters to fill the gauge completely as opposed to say 4 kr something like that.
---
Game sucks
---
Mine is wrong 93.7 percent of the time.  I've done the math.  If she says something the safe bet is go the other way.  Hahahah.
---
It's time for a single player, offline version with mod support 
---
&gt; quintuple their legs
---
PS4 version this year. I don't think it has an official date yet but I would bet league after the next.
---
*"Bethesda promised an inventory increase over 600 once they could confirm the stability of the servers"* 
---
Do you believe the servers are stable? Do you believe they can confirm server stability?  They are doing more things (Like the 1500 Max Cap) to assist to make sure server stability is able to be achieved.  They need time to prove that is happening (which it is better, but not "stable").
---
I‚Äôd say $60 but I honestly think that‚Äôs too much, after all is said and done. There are plenty of huge good games that have survived for less. And considering all the side stuff they‚Äôve tried selling us as well which some are way more than $60, I think they are fine.
---
yes.
---
Oh man, I've been fighting that thing wrong the entire time! Thanks!
---
So true. Inventory management is killed the game for me it's just too much, every damn hour i need to manage it for 10+  minutes. Fuck. This.
---
Without the creation engine NV probably wouldn't have happened at all. 
---
The problem is that even if you are not hording the limit can suck. When some weapons weigh 20 lbs or more it makes it really hard to keep even a few extra as backup.
---
Yep... killed like 20+ in a nuke zone, turn around to go get everything and as I got close 1 by 1 I watched them vanish
---
I've lost all my friends and in the last week gained 5 new ones.  
---
This morning I got a bloodied combat rifle one star
---
They‚Äôre so easy in this game it‚Äôs sad. I remember in NV how hard and scary and time-consuming it was so take out that Deatclaw family north of Sloan. THAT was a great enemy fight. In literally killed an albino Deathclaw matriarch with two shots from a shotgun when I had zero shotgun perks equipped. It‚Äôs just sad.
---
Oh man, this one made me giggle. That would be AMAZING. LOL
---
Agreed, it is part of the tragedy to me that it could have been just incredible if it was a regular game with these NPC factions alive. The groups are more believable in 76 than the extremes in NV like the Kings and Legion. Even the Raiders in 76, you see more how it ended up that way, why people joined in and who was most prone to.
---
This along with making sure Abbie and her family didn't die for nothing made the game worth it for me.
---
yeah, i agree with everyone else. The first time i came across one i was so afraid of getting in close with him i dumped half of my .44 into him before he died. The next time i came across one i hacked him to pieces with just a few swings of my ski sword. 
---
Dunno, i am kind of interested in how they will hold their own in the long term. 
---
Turrets take up much more budget than other items
---
I don't want single player. I have Fallout 4 for that. I play Fallout 4 now and I Miss my team terribly. I want Fallout 76 with mods and  my buddies too
---
I‚Äôm still waiting to play but from what I‚Äôve seen of the atomic shop the only thing I want is the Kings outfit that I have dozens in FONV. 
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd even spend free atoms on a $5 wave emote. 
---
I've pulled regular drills from 3\* legendaries enough times for it to be noticeable as a trend.
---
Its a good improvement.  I see nothing wrong with it.  Considering we will likely get another ITY next week, I can wait for more news on the next patch.
---
Oh definitely. Get to work, lol. 
---
Armor station 
---
gotcha. I'm not at the point where i'm ready to try a bloody build. 
---
hater? I have more fun laughing at bethesda now than actualy playing their games, the company still have an entertainment purpose I guess.
---
Imagine how successful that guy must be at real life.
---
People get so emotional when you mention modders here but the plain fact of the matter is that modders have fixed more issues in two weeks after Fallout 4s release than paid devs have come close to fixing in THREE MONTHS for 76. It's absurd really.
---
I do like the cannibal perk in this game. I just wish they had a sound effect similar to Cookie Monster for it.
---
Get the perk which makes food drink spoil 90% less
---
Because Bethesda and really gaming in general have to coddle that kind of behaviour or else that little piece of shit might not buy atoms.
---
Idk about that, it is much improved over fo4. I get glitches and bugs some time, but I can play 1440p at 60-120 fps!
---
I would say that the game engine is sensitive to bad mem OC's, but then again every bullet fired has a ton of modifiers applied to each damage calcination (perks, chems, condition....), So unless you want to give up some of the best aspects of the game I don't know what you do... 
---
Maybe go play Titanfall?
---
You are correct. All night long reduces drain of food and water but only at night. I think OP might be confused on how the perk works.
---
I would like a change to the way the stash works. Instead of a set weight that it can store have it be able to store a set amount of non junk items.  And for junk you can have a set number of it depending on the item. Like steel can have a stack of 500 and 10 bulk. Depending on the rarities and uses of the scrap the number might vary but it wont be limited by weight.  For weapons and armor have like a 50 to 100 item limit.  Not sure what would be considered responsible but right now it sucks not being able to hold onto some of the good legendary items I find that may not fit my current build.
---
&gt; But this info came from Beth, so I don't know if it's true.
---
It's an attempt to save face. 
---
Or just a wall mounted terminal like you can find anywhere else in game.
---
Dude.. they have enough money to give us the experience they initially wanted us to have. Like I said there are far older games that still are up with little to no micro transactions. 
---
Do you not remember gaming before this epidemic? This is not an intrinsic value in gaming it is a new trend.
---
They can cover recurring cost by giving us a full experience which in turn will excite gamers enough to fork over cash because we just want MOARR.
---
They‚Äôre doing it wrong and this is not how it HAS to be if that‚Äôs hard for you to understand, with a pretty limited imagination you can imagine anything just imagine in this case a world where games came out that are fully functioning and you think it‚Äôs awesome, it‚Äôs not hard to imagine ppl wanting more content, so much so that they will pay more money for it. THAT is how it is supposed to work. 
---
Gamers will gladly fork over more cash for more content that‚Äôs a given, use this cash for ‚Äúrecurring costs.‚Äù
---
By the way I‚Äôm not saying you have a limited imagination I just want you to explore the *idea* that there are far more effective ways to cover ‚Äúrecurring costs‚Äù if that‚Äôs the issue.
---
Bgs=bullshit game studio 
---
Still a hard fight, don't try to eyeball it, use vats.
---
Not "how much".  "how".
---
An online game has recurring costs.  How do you want to pay those?
---
People are starting to get bored
---
That, and that they can't stop time everywhere *except* where you are.
---
I assume we'll have to reply on the modders for that feature.
---
*edits post*
---
Yep. I'm in a brotherhood of steel community that was created around the game. I think there are around 300 members. Active 76 players? Ten top. Probably around 5. Nobody wants to play anymore. Each inside the vault demoralizes people more. There is no faith in Bethesda anymore. The passion for the game by players is starting to reflect the passion that bethesda is showing, non-existant. They seem incapable of doing anything right. Unless Bethesda change their ways and attitude, i fear that it is done for. I'm still clinging onto some hope, because i like 76 conceptually. The execution is just so bad. Sigh. It became a rant. Sorry.

The game has literally never crashed for me.

Why not a Kong-sized Deathclaw.  Clawzilla if you will.  I miss Super Mutant Behemoths.

&gt; It was a trap for you

That's the 4th version.  You don't *want* to talk about that one...

I'm sure someone can mod that.

OK, now I'm aroused.

Yh

I‚Äôve added. My friends heard terrible reviews during beta launch and wouldn‚Äôt even try out my free keys. Then a friend bought the game a month later and he also really enjoyed it. Within a month there are five of us that play daily. 
---
And it really helps to have friends to play with. Some guidance and help on quests and someone will find a nuked server and we will jump over. When the game was crashing a bunch, at least your group kept ownership of the workshops. 
---
We have fun together. Game seems fine. No major bugs to complain about. Scorchbeast Queen takes about 3k worth of rounds and we just get that together first before we run it. Only one of us had a TSE before the rebalance nerf so we don‚Äôt have that same sense off loss that others do I guess? 
---
But hey, I don‚Äôt play many games more than a month. So maybe some of this is normal. 
---
Maybe, but it was also Obsidians face.
---
Ahhh...
---
I read earlier that it only lasted a short while, sorry :)
---
maybe it's time i do that quest then, only at lv125, lol :D
---
I kinda like that they all attack me :D
---
As one of the 'min/maxers', I don't really think the majority of the sub fit that group. I'm 192 and my team clears the silo and kills the queen in under 20 minutes total, so 90% of comments I read are pretty misinformed (in my eyes) about a lot of mechanics/enemies/weapons, which doesn't exactly scream min/max to me. 
---
One example is the White Knight nerf. Many people yelled that the perk was dead, when it only went down from 90% durability loss reduction to 60%, and the repair cost with the perk went from 1 ballistic fiber to 2 - yet people acted as if the perk was deleted entirely. Instead of repairing every 3 weeks, I'm repairing every 2. While I don't agree with *every* nerf in recent patches, I think that this nerf was OK, whereas I think many people would disagree with me (which is totally fine). 
---
It's my daily "unwind after work" activity. I hit all 7 vendors and do the dailies, hit a few treasure maps, then fuck with my camp. On saturdays I'll do the weekly challenges and otherwise just wander the map
---
lol :D
---
Yeah... I keep the melee weight perk cad and lug around 20 or so... Bear arm max makes heavy guns weigh 2lbs!
---
You just have to choose your poison.
---
Sucks that the is none for rifles... But how many do you need? 
---
Why do you care ? 
---
why? if he enjoys it leave him be.
---
Bruh I agreed with deathclaws..we need more..the only enemies that actually give me trouble are the scorchbeast wendigos and the mirelurk king..I don't know what's more annoying the scorchbeast s sonic rings or the mirelurk king screaming the entire time..wendigos were designed well..they are creepy as f***
---
I am a stealth sniper. So I gmdont have any perks they drop weapon weight 
---
Uh bethesda isn't a singular entity
---
I‚Äôm not really sure how much this applies to 76. 
---
Did there track record influence my decision to pre-order 76? Yes absolutely!  
---
Does Bethesda‚Äôs track record excuse the state of the game at release as well as its current state? Absolutely Not!
---
Does Bethesda‚Äôs track record excuse the lack of communication and poor choices in updates/rollbacks? Absolutely Not! If anything the prior success should indicate that the company knows how to do these things correctly.
---
Does a solid foundation excuse the unstable state of the game currently?  Again it‚Äôs absolutely not.  There is no logical excuse for the state the game is in. 
---
I can keep going but I hope the point has been made. I‚Äôll even go one step further and say that your mentality on this, is a huge detriment to the community. 
---
I am not singling you out by any means as you are only expressing an opinion that is shared by a percentage of the gamers. It‚Äôs not a large percentage, and I believe that simple player and active server counts would prove that.
---
Accepting this flaming garbage pile,  that has been wrapped in trash and thrown into a huge tire fire, is a disservice to yourself and the gaming community. This will help lower the bar for all future titles. 
---
No need to feel sad for me, I have already put the game down and I do not regret playing it nor do I regret getting frustrated at some of the stupid stuff that I ran into(constant SB screech attacks, DC from server, not working perk cards, ect.)
---
I enjoyed this game and played the hell out of it, but admittedly after a 9 hour long play session during the B.E.T.A.(During that 10 hour session they had), and after working two jobs that same day, the game did get a little old and I had to put it down just to cool down my mind. As I said, no need to feel sorry for anyone other than yourself for not having anything better to do than trolling this sub looking to try to make other people feel small :/
---
Don't feel sorry for me, because I realized that I was done with the game several weeks ago, and I have put it away until the release of DLC, and no need to feel sorry for OP, because he seems pretty well off if being asked why he plays a game that he gets frustrated with from his wife is something that made him realize he really didn't know why he was playing it. At least he has a wife :)
---
P.S.
---
&gt; Sad that **you** can't even think for yourselves about your own feelings.
---
When did I say that someone else had to tell me to stop playing, or ask me why I was playing. I figured out I wasn't having fun on my own, so I put the game down for that night, try again Mr. Troll :3
---
In general they need to look at Damage and Resistance balances.
---
I would love to play again knowing that I'll get to kill more Unique enemies rather than spawn camping and hopping.
---
The rewards for killing cool and interesting enemies are stupid and I remember how disappointing It felt killing after 10-15 min a Legendary Gaster double my level just to get no legendary and trash.
---
Why not make it so you have kill locked rewards?
---
Like kill 20 gasters and get plan for outfit.
---
It's like they're scared to just give the players fun.
---
Behemoths are in the game. One regularly is in the pack of mutants that attack the Whitesprings entrance near the Enclave service entrance. Another is in one of the souther lakes.
---
Vampires Tato

fallout76
---
Eh, whatever, necky.
---
The posts are by a minority overall. The impact in game is way more noticeable
---
xD I like the sky germs. Anything negative is good. It keeps the pressure on timmy whining. Feed the people giving cans of food to the whole server was kind of cool though.
---
I feel you, I guess then repairing to 200% is the only option then
---
Elder scrolls.
---
Yes, recently tested and confirmed no stacking for LW/AB.
---
Yeah so I can pvp with myself since the wasteland is empty
---
What? How do you place all those bobbleheads?
---
Pc no life gamer. Add me if you sneed a playmate. Mic. Is a must. Pm me for my ign. 
---
No no. I didn‚Äôt read that but clearly you need someone to help you with your feelings.
---
It depends, like most things, on many factors. Not going into that here, but just to agree with the OP - \_if\_ said black bear is not a mama with cubs or for some reason really hungry (habitat destruction, lack of game, older bear having a hard time hunting anymore etc...) it's going to retreat faced with an aggressive adult human. 
---
Very few, in my experience, wild game (not zoo animals, they are all kinds of fucked up) are out looking for a fight. Except fukin boars. F'n hell been nearly killed multiple times by them. Once that pink assed, mud digging farm animal gets loose for awhile it turns into a fuzzy, tusk wielding rage monster. Radboars. Horrifying. Bethesda you missed a chance there. Right part of the country too. Make this happen. You won't see me fighting them. Likely I'll be the one up in treetop crying for his mama...
---
The problem isn't with my current gear its if I find a nice 3 star supersledge it weighs 20lbs which eats up to much space.  Same if I find a good .50 cal. Stuff I may use later . Its one thing for non legendary items because I can craft most of them but with the way rng works I may never find that item again if I have to trash it
---
I missed those, sorry. Good to know.
---
I believe items dropped with skins on them are destroyed
---
LAND BIRDS DO NOT COUNT EXCEPT AS SUCCULENT MEAT IN MY GUT.
---
Magazine*
---
What makes me a "troll"? I'm being serious.  I really enjoy the game and will gladly take all of the quitters stuff of their hands.
---
Honestly that's not impossible.
---
If you drop one item with an atomic shop skin on it, it will be destroyed. 
---
How recent?
---
2 months ago they didn't stack but it was retested a month ago and they do
---
They're small statues or something IIRC; not actually bobbleheads.
---
Seems reasonable - that way the player who wants a fight ends up getting one, sparing the person who's passive from being harrassed. Win-win.
---
Oh crap really. What about AP regen from rejuvenated and action boy or rejuvenated and lone wanderer do you know if those stack?
---
Yeah.... ummm... those perks don't increase the time until your thirst/hunger return, they increase the satisfaction from eating/drinking.  So you have to consume less food to fill the bar, not consume food less often...  Dromedary works fine for me.
---
Wendigos are probably my favorite thing to fight. Even when I can kill them with no problems they are still somewhat unsettling.  
---
I attack them all the time - especially when I find a legendary protectron.  They'll just sit there happily staring at  me while I smack them with my super sledge.  They never attack back.
---
Keep your science out of my science fantasy! I want Rad Canaries carrying humans in cages deep in to their mines! 
---
Thanks! Answers my question. No handing out vault tec skinned combat armour for me. Shame 
---
Except that to add birds they'd probably copy/paste from f04 and those birds are just WRONG (their necks are really weird, they just don't look right)
---
" I have 20 quests in my Pip-Boy but can't be bothered because I am not invested in the story. I don't know where to go or what to do from here. "  
---
I mean, not trying to be a jerk here, but maybe you're not invested in the story because you haven't experienced much of it? And you don't know where to go or what to do, but you have 20 quests just sitting there? Err, maybe doing some of those would give you things to do and places to go. Honest suggestion.
---
I bought mine on amazon prime day for $35 during pre order. I feel like i've gotten my moneys worth even if its a less then perfect fallout.
---
Darn right. Catmeat steaks are really good
---
Vault Boy gnomes, 400 atoms I think.
---
There needs to be a random encounter like the Mr. Veterinarian or the Pied Piper Eyebot except it's a ghoul in a white tux being followed by a gaggle of chickens.
---
Oh yeah... I have a set of Unyielding Armor that takes my carry weight to 300+ when I need it (excavator armor too), but I usually just fill it up with junk!
---
A lot of times, especially decorative items, take up very little of your budget. You might have to delete more before you have enough.
---
Unrelated but in Fallout 4 I like to use console commands to change the size of the chickens to huge. Rad chickens should be the size of a brahmin heh heh
---
If it makes you feel any better, if the game was any good-- it wouldn't be that cheap..... But since it sucks, just wait.. It will be free before long.
---
We welcome your feedback and will send this along to the dev team 
---
I have calibrated shocks on my excavator but power armor makes half my build useless lol
---
Same i cycle a few games at a time so nothing gets too stale
---
Hey, thanks for the response! I'll get you added next time I'm in game.  
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 you might fun into my creepy clown house that has a siren as well. I‚Äôm quite proud of my house. 
---
They look at all the subs and read them daily. There's a couple of Bethesda folk that comment even. They just can't do anything about the suggestions because Bethesda has a bottom line and they are probably just abandoning this game
---
Nope. Not under any of the tabs, you'd think headgear would be the one.
---
Sometimes there‚Äôs less to report than other times. 
---
What‚Äôs sad are all the people that are to stupid and immature to understand things.
---
But then again, you let children play your games you end up changing diapers.
---
That is precisely what it is. The group failed to provide enough dps.
---
&gt;Challenging one of these...is generally going to result in the bear running away farting. 
---
This had me giggling too much picturing it happening. Thanks for this!
---
This is related...been meaning to mention...
---
It appears that my weapons especially my melee dmg stats change randomly w/o any perk/mutation/desease changes.  
---
Yup, for the most part they don't defend themselves.
---
Oh, I most likely was not clear in my original comment. I was referring to previous Bethesda games and using that as a baseline.  If someone told me that the people who made the Elderscrolls and Fallout games were going to make a game that was not only released in an unplayable state, but as it was patched got worse, I would not have believed it.  I had always been a big fan of Bethesda which it why I got the game on release, but going forward they will be in the same camp of so many other video game companies until they can earn the trust back. 
---
No, I won't, but being great doesn't make FO76's problems disappear. 
---
And I do like the game, but it has some serious issues and Bethesda Austin clearly doesn't know how to handle it.
---
RE: Zoos in WV that got nuked, pretty sure that's why there's Megasloths. One of the mansions has sloth cages where they had them as pets.
---
One thing to add about Molerats: If they're on the ground, and I go up to a structure and climb a few levels, to get away and heal or something, those shitbags should NOT be able to follow me by burrowing out of the third floor. That's NOT ok.
---
He's saying that with Bethesda's track record-- FO76 should have been a safe bet. Unfortunately, it wasn't and even having bought it at 39.99--- I still feel like the game is a rip off. 1 end game boss? Your gear takes a ton of mats to repair, and breaks constantly in the middle of fights? So you have to take multiple weapons, and then guess what--- you're carrying too much and are forced to move like a sloth. It's pretty unforgivably bad. 
---
Ghouls sucks 
---
If you wooosh, youre doooouche, simple as that!
---
I haven't done any research myself, but my gf works in Biology research and it's a common bar topic with her friends. Apparently "outdoor" house cats are eating all the birds already. I'd imagine the downfall of human society wouldn't help.
---
You'd think they'd make a rare receipt work. Like I got it front a random event spawn and hadn't seen that dead Confederate actor again. 
---
If you want guns to be comparable to 2h melee then go all in on luck.
---
Drop conc fire to 1. Drop end to 4 for lead belly and good doggo (even dump lead belly for fireproof 3 late game because rad away is so plentiful).
---
Trim up weight reduction perks and push luck to 15. I'll post my vats rifle build. I kill things in 1-3 shots, 1 once adrenaline gets rolling and gun fu triggers.
---
Wendigos cease to be scary once you get past like level 50 since they are like what, level 48. I don't see why they don't level up with you like some of the scorched and the ghouls

Ghoul Behemoth!
---
There is lore in the game for why the **Yaoguai/Bears**  are the way they are. It is in a medical research facility around the middle of the map where I found it. There are terminal entries about it and you can also see some rooms with experiments for them.
---
So many cans of dog-food....But no Dogmeat...
---
No mothman?? 
---
I mean, it's pretty obvious isnt it? Birds aren't real. After the fall of the US government, there was no one around to repair and manufacture more "bird" drones. The only people with this technology are the institute a couple hundred miles away. 
---
I love posts like this especially in contrast to the more popular hate and insult the developers posts that get thousands of up-votes (toxicity kills even when it tastes good) Thanks for being constructive and not a turd.
---
I went to do quests and the enemies I encountered that were my level were hard but I could defeat them. I killed a bunch of Mirelurks and Anglers and felt like after the fight I earned the stuff and enjoyed fighting them. But more often than not the enemies o fight are twenty or thirty levels above me and are no fun to fight, and the others are so low they drop nothing but are still hard to fight. I miss the old games and the scaling system they had. It just sucks going into a zone that‚Äôs supposed to be my level, and seeing things higher than me. 
---
For the record, my fuse was only 1-star.  Had the ‚ÄúFrugal ‚Äù effect, where your Stash Box capacity is reduced by 90%. My Stash Box now contains just this fuse and my 43-pound Bunker Buster.
---
What level were you? I believe due to the new updates no server hopping is required.
---
Crippling the legs was always an option, that's why in FO3 you should always have the dart gun on you if you're going to their territory.
---
It‚Äôs cause you like to pick on an easy target
---
yeah - I'm a bit more careful about sloshing paint around....
---
Same.
---
Wrong or not, she‚Äôs always right because it‚Äôs not worth arguing about. 
---
I'll take all their shit if they dont want to play anymore. I'm tired of scrolling through the top 20 reddit posts titled "my little bitch ass story about why I'm quitting". Bruh.. nobody cares.. at least do something useful and hook somebody up with your gear Haha. 
---
then I am doing my part, the only bird my cat, Commander Merr, eats comes in a tin.
---
Yeah, they're absolutely creepy and the quest with the audiotapes was amazing! I wish there was more Wendigo content too, maybe an additional form as well :)
---
two now. I lost 3 different items in 3 different occasions. one just yesterday. and I'm not the only one.
---
regardless, even 1 report is way too much. in a loot-centric game, this is unthinkable. it simply should not happen. it's a joke that you're trying to pass it off as "no biggie"
---
I hope Bethesda know they have set a precedent with the Cryptids. I expect to see new ones in future games, exploring the local areas folklore. Dear Mothman i want more Cryptids
---
Update: got the blueprints: got hella Black Titanium! 
---
FO76 is fun again! Loving this community. Thanks! 
---
Okay we know fallout 76 isn't as great as we thought. There is time for more development in the future like other games are doing. I understand they blundered financially and pr is a mess. How about the other titles they are responsible for? Does one game define a company as a whole?
---
I like this quote from a very honest man working in the video game business, "it works".
---
I like to hunt them.  There real life lore is awesome too
---
Rad rats are such a pain in the ass. They're so hard to hit and have way more HP than they should. 
---
The loot from the cryptids needs to be better with more unique items. Your idea of special weapons or armor from them makes total since and im surprised they didn't add something like that. Seems lazy. Fighting the Flatwoods monster only for it to drop a few screws and gears is disappointing and lame. 
---
I agree with everything. 
---
I absolutely would LOVE to see a wendigo claw added!
---
I'd like to see a claw for a fog crawler as well.
---
Something i've been wanting to see for awhile are armor &amp; a weapon (a claw lol) made from scorch beasts. A helmet that looks like a scorchbeasts head that makes you take less damage from the screech would be very unique &amp; badass. 
---
It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make sense that there aren‚Äôt any ‚Äúscorched raiders‚Äù considering there are plenty of raider corpses all over the map. 
---
There should be more variation of the look and types of basic scorched, kinda how they did with the feral ghouls with their new outfits. Really gives a sense of ‚Äúthese were everyday people that are now irradiated zombies‚Äù 
---
no game should ever be released in this condition. there's no justification for items that we spent months farming for to just disappear.
---
we're not beta testers.
---
Its a joke you think that code is flawless in every way
---
At what point is it challenging and not a bullet sponge? I mean I liked Deathclaws with my TSE shotgun, maybe 4 hit before the patch. But I expected that. Now it would be 3 times as much. 
---
1. More monster density and variety on the map / farming westek or white springs over and over gets boring
---
2. Buff top tier monsters (super mutant warlord) , damage out put! Sgt gutsy are super fun because  a group of them can kill me! 
---
3. Buff damage not just hit points also Vary types of damage! More fire more poison.....
---
4. Let scorch use grenades... like
---
Super mutants 
---
5. Make wolves attack like a pack instead of one at a time
---
6. More end game bosses running same one gets old
---
its been weeks for me. Im beginning to forget my username and password in beth launcher
---
We dont want to change your mind. 
---
I don‚Äôt know if this is just me but ever since fallout 4, deathclaws have lost their threat factor for me. In 3 and NV whenever I saw one at low levels I avoided the hell out of it and was scared to attract its attention. At high levels I knew even with my power armor and good weapons it was still going to be a tough fight. Now in 4 and 76 I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúoh a deathclaw no worries‚Äù. 
---
Yeah, they were a fun fight the first time I saw them in the Whitesprings locker room at like level 20.  They have great potential to be a fun fight if they leveled them up.
---
So does toilet paper when there‚Äôs no alternative 
---
Ya I agree.  The skins are questionable garbage
---
Wild boars taught me to climb a tree. True story.

Mines all in on damage. So far I havent had any issues 1-2 shotting things with a TSE Lever Action / Instigating Handmade. I havent tested the Action Boy / Lone Wanderer AP Regen stacking issue other people are reporting, but it is noticeable when I am missing Lone Wanderer.
---
You can‚Äòt get something from people who don‚Äòt have Fallout 76 ...
---
They need to fine tune cave cricket stats, they're made for end game nuka world and were literally just copy pasted in here. Also rad rats 
---
there's bugs and then there's your whole stash disappearing. or the final boss being prone to crashes. or the development team disabling drops because they can't fix the weapons properly.
---
that's definitely a joke. Todd himself acknowledged this. but we're way past just another bug-y release by Bethesda, Fo76 is a whole another level.
---
As a player who doesn't use PA, I have to say no to the radiation, but area with strong enemies, yes. Like a real endgame area.
---
Or make endgame world tier, where the whole map is full of 50+ enemies(and maybe a restart as a new game+). 
---

#Another one!

Those poor wires are not yet ready to deal with the loss.

The best quest I've played in any Fallout game. Fight me.

Ok, Thank you for judging me :) I needed that today!

‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs dick is that long, not even Long Dick Johnson, and he had a fucking long dick. Hence the name.‚Äù
---
Grammy worthy writing, Todd.
---
why-i-am-leaving post #2342 for the week.  there should be a template for these that people can just copy/paste to save time.
---
I like the kill lock rewards idea. Very reminiscent of the kill rewards from NV but with better payoff.
---
Hell maybe add the plans for trophy heads as a rare spawn on Crowned variants of monsters.
---
I ment that I won't change your mind, because I think they are great.
---
You didnt lose your whole stash though, you said youve lost a total of 3 items on 3 occations
---
Ooo, Zetan saucer as a world boss. Can abduct players during the fight (beamed up for experimentaion with random results, ie recieve a mutation, shrunk, enlarged, turned invisible, turned into a centaur, and returned to the battlefield) 
---
Because you're an entitled twat.
---
I agree on most counts, but I would especially like to second the bit about enemies spawning inside a camp.  Turrets take an enormous chunk of budget, so at least give us a chance to place them strategically.  And maybe make enemies that spawn outside the camp prioritize them as targets instead of running past them to chew on a random wall or generator.
---
Pre-nerf I killed an albino Deathclaw matriarch with two shots from a TSE shotgun while I had zero shotgun or explosive perks equipped. If it takes six now, that's a challenge, not a bullet sponge.
---
Possible or everyone else has a mutation and it‚Äôs a hidden mechanic regarding mutations. 
---
What pisses you off about it?
---
OoooooOOoo Time to go lore hunting!
---
I have an extra physical hat if u are ps4
---
Yes. It's why I ONLY use my shotgun on them.
---
It's stagger or get rekt
---
I was being sarcarstic thinking about all the crap about this game and this good ol' pal Todd howard and his lies. toilet paper and him might be related actualy.
---
Saying about unique scorched just made me want to see the vault dlc add vault dweller scorched in the vaults or non hostile vender scorched with special ultracite weapons.
---
Grouped under cryptids.
---
I have fought exactly one in 400 hours of play and it was a glowing one. 
---
Platform and ign please
---
I think this mutation is actually terrible. A small QOL that works only outside of battle, at a terrible cost. 
---
Ruinning all chems is not worth it.
---
Oh I was sincere, it was quite amusing =D
---
I‚Äôm not so sure that as consumers we should ever trust game companies enough to pre order again. I think Bethesda just fell in Suit with the current meta for game companies. They took ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù from previous titles and used it to push a bull crap B.E.T.A and a ridiculously overpriced Tricentennial Edition.  Bethesda is no different from any other company in that above all else profit is the motivating factor. 
---
Happens in every game.. people buys games, play for a bit and quit or buy a new game. It's the nature of the beast
---
yeah...sometimes it takes the server a minute or two to select the most absurdly useless piece of armor on the loot table.  hmmm.....1\* Furious Tire Iron or 1\* Nocturnal Wooden Right Arm.   
---
But due to international copywrite law, it is not.
---
Who is Austin?
---
I will play until I am the last player that plays the game. I'm board to death, over encumbered and have no real interest in leaving my small corner of the forest anymore but, I enjoy it when random people stop by for water or food and use the garage, sometimes they even buy some of my junk or services. It's just a dumb game that happens to fit my OCD and love of wondering around aimlessly. 
---
 My only real complaint is not being able to use the tent plan as a temporary second CAMP when I'm out wandering around. It would be nice to be able to use just the tent a sleeping bag and one crafting station as a traveling kit of sorts. 
---
In what way is it 'broken' for you?  Chances are there is a workaround.....did you check the fo76 wiki page for that particular quest?
---
I had one section bug on me (where you are supposed to accept one of the promotions) but it wouldn't seem to do it in the terminal.  Turned out you just needed to hit 'space' quickly to get the page to switch to the next one before it would recognize it.  I found that on the wiki page for the mission.
---
Oh okay, fair enough, I messed where it said mothman. Saw my first one yesterday! Didn't even shoot at it because I was so excited to see one finally.
---
Cryolater attachement to your stash even.

What kind of sweaty idiot says shit like "booty tickled"? Lol get off my comment.
---
Got that about two weeks ago.
---
I don‚Äôt care about titanfall I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre getting that from lol but you‚Äôre entertaining me trying to defend this terrible game. Subjective enjoyment doesn‚Äôt eliminate the glaring issues this game has had since launch

I was a total turd in my 20s. Ask my ex-wife. I am trying to be a better person. For some of us it is a struggle. Current wife helps keep me in line with her vast well of patience. Also psychiatric meds.

I'd love to see vault dweller scorched! It's actually probably possible in the game right now likewise because of the vault dweller corpses you find occasionally. I'd like armored scorched, power armor scorched, firebreather scorched, and more unique feeling ones across the board.
---
I would love a glowing sea like area.
---
Praise Mothman! 
---
May he eat your pants last!
---
But I mean. For him to keep following me when I server hop just so he can attempt to flatten my camp. 
---
It's just unreasonable
---
I have a RP group if your interested in that kind of thing. 
---
Drop your ign and we will approach you. Just make sure you go along with our requests...
---
Something something Bobby pins.
---
I like the idea of bounties, but they don't really fit. It's like: OK crime committed, the only victim is now deceased, who is gonna pay this bounty?
---
Those camps block those camps.
---
Good question, wondered this myself.
---
I suspect because it was originally chambered for 7.62 rounds when introduced in Fo4 dlc. Yet they decided late not to put it in 7.62 rounds so it got set to 5.56.
---
As if the assault rifle wasn't ridiculous enough in Fo4, now its obsolete too.
---
You would think the Assault rifle would be heavier and be balanced by higher magazine size or base damage or accuracy, but no, it's just worse in every way.
---
&gt; what happened to make bears bigger and aggressive
---
A nuclear blast happened that turned bats into Scorchbeasts and geckos into Deathclaws. I think that explains bears well enough. 
---
Couldn't agree more with everything else though. :p
---
Every single one said that, it just means that if your issue with the bag is resolved by them shipping out the new one, bethesda outsources customer service so the person who writes the email just closes it once youve ordered correctly
---
Bethesda Austin made Fallout 76, not the Bethesda that made Fallout 3 and 4, and ES games. It's a former Battlecry studio, that doesn't have a great history with games.
---
We need those good good pointy testicle bois
---
Good point, her question.
---
I ask same to myself.
---
I guess many of us feel this game would be great if fixed ( ironed bugs, pvp out, tedious features modified)‚Ä¶ but our hopes of this happening are vanishing...
---
Wow. That is some quality research. You sure had my interest. 
---
Lots of lore in this game is also covered in the environment. In the medical research center there is more than just entries to read. There is also how the rooms are setup, where people died, how they died, stuff connected to the room etc. I think the facility does a good job of telling the story of what happened.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say a single game defines them as a whole but this particular game is an indicator of what they are willing to sell and defend. 
---
They've been fixing known issues since release and addressing feedback. They may not be doing a great job of it overall, but I'm not going to join your exaggeration and pretend nothing is happening. 
---
You do you, I'm gonna be the guy having fun and not stressing. xD
---
Or scorched brotherhood in power armor.
---
The rule around here (also East Coast) is the lighter the bear color, the more likely it is to run away farting.
---
Usually those numbers are given out after the game has been out for some time. Even WoW didn't start advertising how many players they had immediately
---
Based on how Olivia reacts to the betrayal at the end, and a couple of the diary entries, it seems clear (to me, anyway) that she DID have feelings for Brody.  But she wasn't going to let that stop her ambitions.  And she certainly thought he had feelings for her (which he didn't.)
---
And I wouldn't characterize Olivia as a 'spoiled brat', but more the Rebellious Daughter, always feeling she cannot live up to her mothers expectations or success.   A classic line from Dante's Inferno sums up her feelings quite well in my opinion:  "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven..."
---
The good thing about having a mind of my own, I don't experience what you experience. So I will enjoy exploring a cool world and building fun camps, cause that's what I do... I don't grind and I don't stress over content. ;)
---
I had this happen once and logged out and back in and they let me learn them (again) which was successful the second time. 
---
Exactly! Because they sound and look terrifying 
---
I would love to find the cooler plan. Can‚Äôt find any info on it. It‚Äôs a little thing, but it would make my camp so much more lived in. 
---
*should have had* a test server. They should've done all this feedback shit a year ago. Had proper out of house play testers.
---
Wasn't that Pulowski?
---
That tip is wrong. Combat Armor with BoS mod has DR/ER.
---
I can tell you're not a very rational person. Buh-bye. xD
---
I've been saying for a while add different bosses to the game for nuking different locations, each having their own specific loot and a full scale of difficulty between them. Examples-
---
Car-henge- A Sawn esque behemoth but with cars instead of boats.
---
Spaceship- An alien of sort is awoken, like a huge brute like version of the Flatwoods monster.
---
Some mine in the Ash Heaps- A big ass mutated mole(man?) or similar.
---
Deathclaw island- hell upon earth.
---
Great Divide- A queen Radscorpion.
---
The Mire- A special Fogcrawler queen 
---
The Water Park- A Special Mirelurk Queen
---
I have not tried this but given that the revive trophy doesn't require each pick-up to be a unique player I'm going to go with yes.
---
He was actually alive when you went to find him?
---
I don‚Äôt know how Howard is really involved. Yes he‚Äôs the face of Bethesda but it‚Äôs not a small company. Many things they‚Äôve made I love. This will be better. I know they need to address performance and DLC. That will come and there will be more to do. They basically ported the Fallout 4 engine to multi-player so it wasn‚Äôt made from the ground up. They will deliver, just go play something else until they fix things.
---
I still like the game, but for the third question, many of these requests have been going on since the game launched, so almost 4 months later asking what suggestions we have without any actual content being added gets boring/frustrating for many. I dont think that they hate the game 
---
I guess the more correct term is ‚Äúdesign flaw‚Äù then 
---
Birds aren‚Äôt real.
---
I've been complaining about this for weeks now. Why would you play a game like this and just want to PVP all the time? Go play call of duty or another shooter PVP game if you want to do this. This is an RPG, not PVP.
---
‚ÄúI am not invested in the story that I have not even invested any time into investigating‚Äù
---
Thanks! I'm not able to play daily, so it may be a few days before I'm online again. I'll add you as soon as I can.
---
I like this idea.  Mainly for the reason that it would introduce enemies that have lootable armor in the game.  It's already a pain to get an armor mod recipe or even armor plans.  
---
I'd say the interesting thing about ghouls is that their difficulty ramps with their numbers. One or two at a time is cake, but a horde of em can rip you apart.
---
If you don't get any return for your time investment, not even enjoyment, why do you even play at all?
---
If it's to come here and show off your "perspective" to feel superior I'd argue that's a form of return on your investment as well.
---
What‚Äôs your definition of ‚Äúgreat‚Äù and what do you use as a basis for comparison?
---
I think bases shouldn‚Äôt take damage at all, plenty of buildings around the map in worse conditions than my base and I can‚Äôt break em or destroy em.
---
**NO** one should lose **ANY** items in a loot-centric game. 1 lost steel scrap is one too many and should be completely unacceptable.
---
+1 from me as well
---
The main reason its so funny is because the guys voice. He sounds so stupid and lazy 
---
Until level 50‚Ä¶ and then leveling up is boring as fuck and you end up with 10 ‚ÄòLevel Up‚Äô banked. 
---
train car west of watoga station I believe has a spawn for BOS plans and the wetsuit. 
---
Fuck, this is like voting for Trump 
---
I would love to have it if you're giving it away, but perhaps you could recover at least a small amount of cost by selling it on ebay or offerup?
---
Youre seeing the tricentennial paint most likely
---
I actually changed my character to a female during the arc, simply so the Tattered Dress (which is a costume that gives +1 Perception) would look right.  Since we can change our characters appearance at any time (just go into the menu) it's easy.
---
I just wish the bonuses from they Eye of Ra could be used with the Tattered Dress as well (and not just the Garb of Mysteries) and that the bonuses from the Garb and the Eye were listed on them.
---
On the topic of suiciders why the hell are they blowing themselves up when most of the times it's shown that supermutants are kidnapping people in order to make more super mutants. I mean it would make more sense for them to toss the bomb like a football than lumber out to you beeping.
---
Also where are the iradiated snakes or lizards? Telling me we got giant salamanders but not even one unique snake? Man can you imagine running through the mire and all of a sudden that log on the ground isn't a log but a giant copper head? Or walking next to river or lake and an irradiated snapping turtle tries to bite your leg off? We need some more danger in this game.
---
"On sale" Valentines outfits.
---
I've been unable to find Deep Pocketed, BOS, or Dense armor mod plans since the patch, and like others noted I've seen discrepancies in some CAMP plans as well. I hope that /u/ladydevann sees this thread and has the devs look into why some plans seem completely missing from vendors inexplicably since patch.
---
Not ignoring the issues present in this game, but to say anthems launch went with nearly ZERO issues is a lie. If you look at their subreddit you‚Äôll see a pretty large bug thread.
---
And as someone who played the free beta recently, I can tell you I encountered several bugs. I posted them all in that thread along with other players. 
---
I counted 4 different bugs that affected my play through (enemies randomly disappearing, being locked out of resurrecting team mates mid fight, 2 different cut scenes / npcdialog cutting out / freezing) 
---
And not to be this guy, but technically speaking, when I played fallout 76‚Äôs beta, I only encountered 2 bugs. The turn in for that Bureau of tourism and with scorched T posing on me.
---
So technically speaking, I encountered 2 more bugs in Anthem‚Äôs beta than I did in fo76‚Äôs beta. Anthem beta was relatively buggier for me (from a physical bug count perspective) than fo76‚Äôs.... 
---
The creepy mannequins that you sometimes find in strange locations, usually in a circle around a dead creature etc..  are supposedly linked to this other worldly daemon/creature
---
They'll patch it, and break snapping for everything else.
---
Nope, it would be awesome if we could like in ESO though. Would make crafting particularly lucrative
---
You need to learn to chill, theyre fixing it, if its really that upsetting for you take a break
---
I'm just looking for those darn combat dense torso plans!!
---
I did not gave up on the game yet, so I can‚Äôt answer question 1 and 2. In regards to question 3, I think what angers most people is the fact, that they had more than enpugh time to collect our feedback. Yet, after three months, it seems they haven‚Äôt listened at all during that time, when asking us for that feedback in the new ITV. If they listened in the last months, they already had the answers to the questions they asked. It just seems more than lazy. On top of that, the stuff they adress of course is a topic we have to talk and think about but by far isn‚Äôt the biggest problem as of now. 
---
Honestly I think BOS is better than FO3, New Vegas, FO4, and FO76
---
This was a problem back in FO4 as well. Once you hit a certain level or had an easy ability to cripple they became pushovers. The issue is also in Bethesda giving them unique ticks in how they move and act. Said ticks are awesome, but also make them easier to fight. One thing I think they could is maybe make the crippling less pathetic. Maybe have them still move at a decent though slowed pace clawing forward after you. Could even throw in a little blood rage for extra damage. They could also make them occasionally hut in packs 3-5.
---
This makes me think too much of a tarrasque.  That would be rather Hellish.
---
Not a reversion, but there was once a patch for Skyrim PS3 that for a time, caused a 100% crash every time you jumped in water.
---
I wish I was making this up.
---
What color(s) is this paint job?
---
I'm assuming RP means role-playing, right? 
---
I have to admit, those series of dots makes me somewhat skeptical...
---
The other thing which really got me was the survivor‚Äôs stories you find near the beginning of the quest. Some of them were optimistic, even in a post-nuke world, and you‚Äôre walking around their tomb knowing how it all turned out. 
---
Scortchbeast nests. I want there to be more to it but I really believe they are just little environmental details with no real story behind it. It would be fun if there was more to it, I just don't feel that is likely.
---
Oh, I thought they dropped via SBQ. That just must be the Ultracite plans?
---
Coincidentally my wife asked me the same question last week.   
---
I didn‚Äôt have an answer, so I uninstalled.
---
The only other vendor with the longcoat - and you killed him!
---
To each their own. I continued to play the game on patch day and didn't notice a single thing that had any real impact on my play experience. 
---
If people want to dwell on 'faith' and the dev team, that's their choice. I find it a waste of time and detraction from the point of gaming, which is largely to have light-hearted fun.
---
I wouldn't rely on getting specific weapon plans from events, it's just easier and less stressful to buy the plans.
---
You clearly did. So many problems you have.
---
Please implement persistent servers where anyone in my clan can build on our fort no matter who‚Äôs on.. like Ark, Rust, etc. I‚Äôd buy 3 copies for me and a couple buds immediately.
---
I Don't think you have your legendary effects right but Explosive is a 2\* effect and Instigating is a 1\* effect so it doesn't really matter as the best would be a 2\* Instigating Explosive.
---
pretty sure your thinking of Anti-Armour and not Instigating
---
Yeah and the marine mask:) great place to farm diff plans :)
---
Their caps reset every 20 hours or so but there is definitely a bug where it shows zero even though they really have the full 200. Sometimes exiting trade mode and then going back in again will reveal that or just selling something will then show the total left. 
---
great idea, i hope for this !
---
Sure, what is your IGN?
---
Q
---
Oh man, I can just see them going straight for everybody's camps to smash them to pieces.  That slow plodding would be awesome pressure to get people to put it down before it demolishes them.
---
 Certainly forums are part of any game I play. I have quite a few reddit subs for various games.
---
 I play because its fun. Its fun building my char over time. its fun fighting in general and its my play. 
---
 My toy if you will.  Now I'm not my kitten batting his toys around the place, but its down the same road. ;)
---
"they're fixing it", says who? because the last inside the vault only mentions a 10 second timer on SBs that any modder could to in 5 minutes or less.
---
regardless, this is not something anyone should chill about. it's absurd that you're trying to downplay such a serious issue, what's wrong with you?
---
How many hours have you put into it? You‚Äôve paid for it probably by now. Stop comparing the price you paid to others. That thing you bought yesterday at the grocery store‚Ä¶ someone else paid less for it somewhere else. Don‚Äôt let it beat you up. 
---
You haven't found the secret inside lucky hole mine have you?
---
Its weird how they went from being the first creature to scare the shit out of me in Fallout to being such a normal kill once I gained the ability to cripple and access to things like gatling guns and plasma throwers.
---
I considered that. But in the cluster at ground level, there's actual scorchbeast nests you can search and all. The asset is very different. I don't think the alcoves are related to the nests.
---
Well against other games the studio produced. You cant deny the elder scrolls series were good games. Even fallout 3 and 4 were good. The studio overall is good they just produced a lazy game which has amazing qualities.
---
what the fawkes ;)
---
Thanks for that irrelevant insight. I'm sure writing a 3000 word article is equivalent effort and complexity to the development, maintainance, and upgrading of a major game project. 
---
Let me know when you have evidence to support your conjecture/exaggeration that this game has had no testing. ;)
---
You can have an Instigating explosive so why not both
---
Yes, I guess so! I HOPE so! =]]]
---
 Instigating just doubles damage on full health mobs. Its actually very strong.
---
Vampire's Exploding Reduced weight Harpoon gun was the worst lost to date on my end.
---
Too bad npcs werent actually implemented. Wasted opportunity so far.
---
Theres is literally only one thing i want and thats NPCs. 
---
The world feels so empty. Cities like Diamond City and Goodneighbour were so atmospheric and fun to explore. Maybe over time, settlers came and started rebuilding Smaller towns like Flatwoods. There could also be quests involved around helping settlers to set up these towns or even events. Add raiders to that and you have a good balance of good/evil. And im sure a lot of people, content creators or modders would help out with voiceacting. Kinda like a community project. 
---
They go to level 68 and three of them are terrifying.  Even with a .50 cal I do a run into fort defiance and 3 wendigo and about 6 ghouls usually I'm a little scared. 
---
On the raider point... I was under the impression that anything human in the area was turned into scorched by the SB/SBQ.  Part of our quest line is to inoculate ourselves against it.  I thinking raiders wouldn't have the capacity to do this, and as a result, avoid the area.
---
However, since the SBQ is pretty much on farm status, I'd like to think we could start introducing them soon.  As someone mentioned in another post, have them start coming in from the edges of the map, attempting to take territory.
---
Plants King appears after nuking of any farm. Vulnerable only to chainsaw and fire. Drops.. yep, wood armor
---
Great work! It also seems to lend a whole other possibility to the source of the Cultist Blades. Perhaps they are degenerate versions or imitations of Kremvh's Tooth from FO4.
---
You had it right when you wrote 'this isn't that kind of prediction'. So I don't know why you followed that correct statement with an incorrect suggestion that I threw stats under the bus. :P
---
Thank you! Hopefully will have answers someday! =]] 
---
If you really need attention please do something worth getting attention for. 
---
Like helping people in need. 
---
I have had the same issue where I go for a swing and it doesn't register that I hit anything.
---
Any ideas why?
---
I want the molemen to get a higher level cap... at least 68 like the super mutants.  Lvl 40 max mole miners is annoying
---
I have it on Ps4 and Xb1, so yeah
---
Op will be back. Shameless karma farm is shameless. 
---
I was going to post about this because I was amazed when I found it. One of the funniest things I've encountered in the game. I will for sure be going back soon. 
---
I had a situation the other day at Whitespring.. I killed a ton of ghouls, and 3 scorchbeasts came out of nowhere. I took them all down. One died over a hill, the other behind the building, and the third one landed right on top of all of the dead ghouls/meat piles.. It's body covered them up completely, and I tried for 15 mins to loot them, without any success.. there were at least 3 legendary creatures in there. 
---
Not just in fo76 but they occurred quite alot in fo4 too
---
Its not very specific but under challenges you can see things like how many robots(not specific type) you kill with what type of weapon.
---
I guess it depends on what type of stats you are looking for.
---
Riddled with bugs and the development team caused a regression in a static property value. They either don't test it or their tests are hilariously below standard.
---
It's just becoming worse since last week's patch. Tilters and whiners are having a field day haha.
---
Youtube is likely not much better but if you're doing specific searches you should be fine. There are also two other FO discords that have next to no negativity-- Filthy Casuals and Fallout 76 Settlements. Worth a look. 
---
No man its a game it is definately something you should chill about, if you have ever played a bethesda game youd know there are bugs and quite frankly theres bigger things in this world to worry about than a game having a bug.  
---
Bethesda is working on bug reports, its literally what an entire studio is being payed to do right now.  
---
I am not downplaying bugs i just have patience, theyre annoying but theyll get fixed sooner or later
---
Except it doesn't, it pays for the base game. I got a good 90 levels out of base game and so now waiting patiently for my free dlc.
---
**Nobody is asking or forcing you to spend money**
---
The atoms can be earned easily and most of the stuff there is or will be in game at some point.
---
People though pa skins were shop only until the first person found out how to get 1.
---
Your complaint is impatient and childish.
---
I feel ya.
---
My build was not finalized at lvl 50 and I had a lot of fun exploring different perks, sorry if you did not.
---
Lvl 158 now ( still have 5-10 level ups banked)
---
 Well there is the Prototype paint. Its what you get when you build your set. Yellow accents, I guess. ;)
---
Is that since the last patch? I would love to get my hands on the mask.
---
I like the way you party
---
The next few years of free dlc they have confirmed for the umpteenth time. Did you honestly not know about that. They arent hiding anything.
---
If you don't like it, don't play.
---
Problem solved.
---
Or something like that 
---
Phoenix is a bad ass and is not running from them, but charging into the fray.  That vendor bot will be surrounded by three of four Watoga bots and trash them all. Granted, since he's a vendor I don't think he can actually be destroyed.  But he's much better than other vendors who just sit idly by while Super Mutants swarm in the train station, hellbent on killing potential customers.
---
Oh, ok. They go higher level elsewhere but not in the clubhouse
---
1. I want this game to be good and I enjoyed some of my time with it. So I check in on it. 
---
2. I post frustrations because I want this game to be good and I think feedback on frustrating things in game can be useful. 
---
3. There has been hundreds of feedback posts on Reddit and their forums. It‚Äôs there for them to find. So asking for our feedback three months into the game feels like their just filling out the blog post. 
---
Lol, of you think the frustration is bad here, try ark. You will never get upset at another bug in this game again. Ark has been released for a couple years now and there's still a glitch that can cause you to loose your character and thousands of hours. Their CS won't do anything for you, nor fix the problem that should have never made it out of early access..
---
aside from some of the annoying bugs, my main gripe is really around player choice. i miss being able to finish a quest in different ways and because of the way i solved it my perk reward is different. 
---
I have seen it consistently in a vendor inventory sounds the patch. When I see it again, I'll comment on where.
---
It's not a jab at her. It's the truth of her.
---
I am not seeing them in the Atom Store yet.  But I am anxiously awaiting hot pink power armor at any price.   
---
Thanks for your understanding, it's always nice to see that on the net. xD
---
Just to add my two cents: it is known that Neo Nazi and other hate groups were actively trying to recruit members from the online communities that formed out of the Gamergate controversy. Some people just really really hate things, and are addicted to the attention and emotional highs that come hand in hand with actively fighting against something, real or imagined. For some people just having a common enemy with a bunch of anonymous names online is enough food to keep their fragile egos limping along. It's pretty sad, and they have my sympathy, if not my respect.
---
Probably the same reason you can shoot an enemy point blank in the chest and miss.
---
I‚Äôve hit a lvl 1 scorched with my lvl 50 combat knife 6 times before any damage was dealt 
---
 If I see it I'll grab it and trade you for the equally hard to get Jet Pack. I need that, I can manage my weight. ;)
---
You know why wood armor is AWESOME? A bunch of bark literally cannot stop a bullet, but it sure can make someone walk slow and line them up in my sights perfectly.
---
Todd Howard if he shows up at E3 this year must appear on stage in full body wood armor as part of his groveling apology.
---
&gt; and it has been shown that prediction (even among experts) is wholly unreliable.
---
I have 4200+ atoms from free play.  Would spend a bunch on Excavator PA paints, but I'm NEVER going to buy any.
---
Scorched animations are also just...atrocious. They always have their gun trained on you, and just walk or sprint backwards. As a melee character, sometimes I really just have to sprint after then to keep up and hit them, and it looks so dumb...
---
There were some videos on Youtube, where a guy recorded himself building an identical camp at different character level intervals as he played the game. The budget never changed, but that was before a bunch of patches as well... so who knows
---
My soul lives in my gut, and it's been rampaging for years. 
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous how you continue to defend a company that keeps exploiting you. 
---
yep, X-01 is enclave only so you cant get the parts or mods from anywhere else. ultracite is the only power armor plans that drop from the queen as far as i know
---
Bethesda is a great *idea* studio.
---
Nope. But I read somewhere there's a modding group that is creating FO3 as a mod in FO4 engine. Would really love to play that. Btw, I love FO76 and feel there's still lots to discover there for me...
---
Brought up Titanfall as something to compare too, to make your criticisms meaningful. sorry if that was lost on you. 
---
Sure, they‚Äôve had really bad bugs. I‚Äôm talking about a failure of configuration management, where they merge changes into an old version of the code branch. 
---
Well when you hit a tire the objective icon disappears and to finish the daily you have to throw the last 2 dross rocks, because usually if you miss the objective icons don't disappear; giving you 2 spare chances.
---
Thanks for the heads-up. I'm only about 25% through my list.
---
OMG I just realised their initials would be MoM... Mom's unite!!!
---
Super Mutant Behemoth...it's a pretty cool creature as is, to be honest.  Needs to be a tad less rare.
---
Easy fix. Add the 7.62 ammo back
---
I don't count myself in the hater group. I really enjoy the game when it lets me. However some things rub me really wrong.  Asking for feedback on the most basic of things like the enemy design seems disingenuous. Products that are intended for market typically follow a series of design reviews, internal testing, surveys and often times focus groups.  When it's software you will have pilot launches, sometimes A/B testing and a series of quality assurance stages prior to reaching the client.  The feedback questions involving basic gameplay should be reserved for free-to-play, beta or "early access" titles ONLY. full stop.  This, however was marketed, released and sold/costed as a major AAA title from a (previously) fairly trusted development studio.  
---
Trust was given, by all of the people now providing their negative feedback.  It will be a long time before it can be re-earned.  So I don't feel annoyed or bad or defensive for any of the negative posts that show up on this and other subreddits, forums, twitter replies etc.  I don't have to read them, but they sure paid their money for an unfinished title and reserve the right to feel dissatisfied.
---
Interesting. So, just judging from the response you two have given, it seems like their lack of communication about choices (and the why of those choices) is a serious problem.
---
For instance, maybe they really did consider 90% of the serious suggestions, but without any explanation of the direction they took, or why many things weren't implemented (or not yet, anyway), the impression would logically be that they didn't give it any consideration at all. I can totally understand that.
---
So, what if they tried to address that in some way, like perhaps posted a table of suggestions/feedback that they were given, along with whether or not it was implemented, and why or why not? That might at least clarify they and wherefores of the direction they are going with the property.
---
Yeah, it was good for a few levels to stack the crafting perk cards and other quick-swap necessities but now that I am dialed in to my SPECIAL, I just find myself letting them stack. And I‚Äôm only lvl 90. 
---
This is one of the most important posts on this sub imo. Beth, I really hope you read this one with serious consideration.
---
I want giant man eating chickens. 
---
Is this answer some kind of out of season april fools day joke?
---
When WoW did it it was still a new idea. At this point in online gaming/gaming services player counts and active server counts are pretty much standard. 
---
But the SBQ is not done to where it takes two different people to pull two different switched at a time. Therefore it can retain the "Can be done solo" comment. It's just not recommended.
---
If glowing-anything meant it had a random mutation or two, it would make for a fun mechanic to play with.
---
Glowing mole rats with damage reflections, glowing mutt/wolf packs with speed demon, Yao Guai with herbivore (for some reason). The possibilities are endless.

if he's the lower level phoenix (14?), he runs away. If he's the higher level version phoenix, he "runs" in and attacks like a peg legged ninja
---
I saw that one at Watoga Phoenix, thought it was memorable as I hadn't seen it before.
---
Im always looking for nuke buddies.  I will add you.

If Bethesda doesn't support this game to make it decent/great like how Ubisoft did with Rainbow Six Siege, and Division, Hello Games with No Man's Sky then faith in buying anything Bethesda would just end up waiting to see if its good, get it on sale, or ignore. But, who knows maybe they already gave up on the game and are just maintaining it like how Blizzard is with Heroes of the Storm with a skeleton crew; hence all the nerfing and readding bugs then fixing/adding new content.
---
Sell it on eBay. I‚Äôm seeing opened helmets go for $100 by themselves. You‚Äôd get way more for unopened with the other stuff. 
---
It just seems like a missed opportunity to get people excited for finding kill enemies. 
---
ty lol i was like üòï
---
Actually today I was about to start a workshop pvp with level 160 and as I was about to claim the worshop the guy spoke to me and he was very nice and he even offered me fusion cores for free so I just said I was sorry and left.
---
I‚Äôve never even seen a megasloth outside sb queen fight and I got a lvl 80 and lvl 137 characters 
---
Mules were staples because of simplicity. 
---
I had a mule in Diablo 2 because I could create a server, password lock it, drop everything I didn't want, and manually join that server on a second account. Anyone could do it and it was really easy. 
---
I had a mule in Vanilla WoW and BC because I could mail myself items. 
---
FO76 requires other players to mule, or requires you to buy multiple games. Third is not something the average gamer is doing. 
---
Downvoted, just to prove you right.  Look what you made me do.
---
what are you talking about?  I fight gunners, and raiders, brotherhood and enclave, Junkies and even responders.  They just all *look* like scorched.  
---
no for real though it feels as though the more interesting enemies are far too rare.  whenever I see a "horde" entry come up for anything other than mutants or scorched I jump on it.
---
The idea of having enemies spawn outside the circle of your camp would be great. While I have mine in a fairly out of the way area. Enemies just spawn next to it. Why do wolves and rad rats attack buildings? It makes no sense. At least if you were inside the structure....
---
They really should include at least a ball pit in game world
---
I'm more curious why 76 is like the only game that doesn't show stats there. It's nice to see play time without having to start the game. It's a very minor issue, but I'm curious why this game isn't supported there like every other game. I mean, we'll.. Bethesda.. But still. 
---
YES. This, exactly. Skeleton crew. I get the bone-chilling, eerie feeling there's only a skeleton crew behind these tiny little updates that somehow take forever to put out.
---
"they're annoying", that's downplaying. I don't remember the last time an online game ate items and the developer basically gave players the middle finger for it. Tibia got it right. this is not just a bug, it undermines one of the foundations of the game.
---
you're completely off about the scope here. no recent AAA game messed up this bad. indie games have better QA. these are bugs that shouldn't get past the beta stages.
---
Love these posts! We need an FO76 archeological society to try to piece together these inside stories.
---
Cannibals prefer fresh meat over people jerky.
---
Not that I know of. I alway swap in the perk before looting and get caps from both methods (normal and search). 
---
I'm not the one with a Reddit account dedicated to complaining about a game
---
**Chicken:** Killing one should put you into permanent PVP mode with a bounty equal to your total caps.
---
Giant ant looking thing with tentacles that move inferring it‚Äôs still alive
---
Peace be with you.
---
The quantity might be randomized... the whole thing sounded like a lot of work for little reward. Same for the u-mine-it quests and the tokens from the monster mash. Maybe getting the Nuka-Cola PA plans and ensemble would be easier and more rewarding to you - no tokens, just a lot of Easter egg hunting, that videos on YouTube walk you through.
---
Broken hit boxes?
---
I'm going to go over a few of these and why they would (or wouldn't) work in Appalachia.
---
NukaLurks/NukaScorched - These aren't a bad idea, but would be pretty limited in location.
---
Spore Carriers - These would be fine.....though not sure how they'd implement the 'control people' since there aren't any people except players....
---
GatorClaws - Unfortunately, Lore-wise, these are engineered in Nuka-World, several hundred miles north, and wouldn't really be able to get to Appalachia in that time period.
---
Spiders/GiantSpiders - These would be fine.  We've already got Giant Ticks, these would be similar.....so a little redundant.
---
Raiders - Here is where the lore says no.  The whole reason there aren't any living humans in Appalachia at the time of fo76 is because the ones who didn't become feral ghouls became scorched, or killed before that could happen to them by scorched/ghouls/etc.  And anyone who came in was quickly infected.  This is why one of the early quests in fo76 is getting 'immunized' against the scorched plague.  Which means every player is immune to becoming scorched infected very early on (by design).  But the other humans who might have come here hadn't worked that out, got infected, became scorched,  so it very quickly became a no-go zone for the raiders, humans, ghouls and such.
---
Centaurs - Same basic problem as Raiders.  There is a WIDE berth given to Appalachia by the living human/ghoul communities still living at the time of fo76.  Because of the scorched plague.
---
Monsters - No problems here.  If West-Tek was doing experiments to make Super Mutants, then I'm sure lots of other corporations/military/MadGeniusIndependents were doing equally unethical things.  But you can't have too many, or it becomes "...oh, here's another twisted abomination of science, \*shrug\*, \*kill\*, \*loot\*, ..."  They need proper backstory and lead-up.  That's part of the problem with most of the cryptids.  There isn't really any good sequential and directed lead-up to their encounters.
---
Ant queens/Ant variants - This would be fine.  Giant Ants from nuclear fallout is a staple of the genre.
---
New Boss level Creatures - Absolutely.  Nuking areas should in many cases produce some 'boss' for the area....it shouldn't be limited to the prime fissure.  Imagine a giant, 30 foot tall glowing deathclaw king wrecking havoc on a nuke zone.....
---
However, the devs need to focus on FIXING problems right now.  Let them get the game stable and relatively balanced, THEN we can ask for new content......
---
Keyword: WERE
---
I am hoping that the time between large updates is being used to actually test the content.  I would rather wait a while for new stuff then it be added and brake the game more then it is already 
---
Despite hating them in 3, I've been wanting to see centaurs brought back again.  With updated models and graphics they could be truly terrifying. instead of weird and annoying.
---
I had about one good day where I was getting around 50-100 caps per stash but after that one day, cap stashes haven‚Äôt had any caps and my perk isn‚Äôt letting me search them ever. 
---
That's what I like too. I just like to have some mindless fun, and if I can have that with friends why not.
---
Yea it‚Äôs actually given me quite a lot of entertainment, however to the keen eye there is some good info in all the shit, sold one item immediately and made a decent contact for future trading, I don‚Äôt see it being the best source to sell on but it seems to beat the luck of running up to people offering trade hoping they realize your selling and not looking to buy..... like the kid who offered spoiled meat for 5000 caps to me
---
Her surprise at Brody's betrayal didn't really come across to me as her having feelings for him. She seemed to look down at the orphans her mother was taking in so spoiled brat rang true for me. She also seemed far more interested in power than living up to her mother's expectations. She was highly arrogant. She already thought she was the best. Its why she thought she could so easily take control of the raiders and didn't see the betrayal coming.
---
You should go to Lucky Hole mine. He awaits you.
---
Jesus Christ, the community is now expected to do balancing redesigns and the more shocking part is, they are actually doing it.  For free, and without being able to use it on a resume 
---
No, you're the one wildly speculating to try and desperately defend a corporate entity on the internet.
---
This just meet my day. I might even rebuild just to follow suit. Yesterday I ran into one of these turrents douche bags. Level 135 to make it even worse, he knows better. So I kept closing the doors. He would open then. I would close them. When the doors are closed they get nada. This went on for a good 15 minutes until he finally left the server. I felt as though I had a minor win that day. 
---
Maybe we should start a site devoted to publicly displaying the turrents camps and their owners so we can poke fun at them. 
---
I‚Äôd buy the helmet for $50 and pay for the shipping!  But you can probably get more for it.  
---
Alright, I will try to clarify, because you're ignoring the context of the post. I was responding to someone looking to get opinions from people who have no reliable empirical data, and I was letting them know that even when experts do this, their predictions have been shown to be wholly unreliable. Therefore, speculating here is pretty much useless. Obviously if they had empirical data it would be a different situation.
---
Is that better? :P
---
I always store the decon shower unless I'm using it for this reason. Everything else is relatively cheap to rebuild.
---
Well, i used to post stuff like this MONTHS ago, and the downvotes were real. Too easy now, "community", you did the WORST thing FO saga needed, an accomplish fanbase.
---
Could be on xbox's end or something I don't know the requirements for xbox to have the that stat on the dashboard. seems like something they would track on their own (ie how long you had the game open).
---
or it could be some sort of conflict since bethesda tracks it in game to give you a reward. no idea.
---
LOL. I am a Fallout player and have played all the 3D games. What is this 'quest' you speak of?
---
That would be the Faschnacht man mask
---
The one everyone has
---
I noticed the same exact thing. I actually removed Cap Collector from my active perks because it seems broken now. While it *was* active, I came across several Cap Stash containers with 1-5 caps in them and no search option. I'm not sure it's working as intended.
---
Yes, yes, I did, that's my point! ahhaha There's an entity growing in Appalachia. I think those weird clusters in Watoga have something to do with it! =]]]]]
---
We definitely need more giant sized jobs roaming the countryside.  I've only seen a behemoth once in my entire playthrough.
---
You talk about these things like they don't happen in many other major games over the years.
---
Maybe their tests ~are~ below standards, or maybe they don't test at all. But you know who doesn't know the answer to that, because they don't work for the company or have the slightest idea how the company operates?
---
You. :P
---
Yeah I thought so people always wear them I didn't realise there was so many of them though. How do you know they are all in the game?
---
Great post! Very refreshing from the stuff that has been coming out on this sub. 
---
I will humbly add my +1 on all points. Especially the one with having more high end bosses other than the SBQ. I also found it weird how there are hardly any enemies that drop what they have. 
---
I hope the team sees this and heeds your advice. Thanks for posting. 
---
Huh. Nice work. I wonder if Lorenzo Cabot's artifact in FO4 is connected to this.
---
none of these exist yet cept for in  the developer room
---
Yes, I know! I wonder if those clusters are connected to the "thing"! =]]]
---
 Well the Megasloths and Hermit Crabs are mostly Mire creatures and only us Mire dwellers have much to do with them. I won't kill either of em', they are my neighbors.
---
they're all dev items. probably future atom shop.
---
Yes! There's a lot of stuff left in the world for us to find! 
---
I‚Äôm just trying to find anything better than 1 star weapons/armor and get caps I can‚Äôt break $4,000 caps for the life of me due to fast travel and buying plans for building things.  
---
what is the difference between an audio log and an npc that just sits there?
---
3.5k up votes and no official reply? Sad. 
---
I don't see griefing here. I see a raider and I like it. 
---
The enclave tamed/controlled deathclaws in fo3, experimented with captured specimens of creatures in WV to create serums, it wouldn't take a bit of imagination by the enclave to experiment/improve current species like the deathclaw and splice different genetics from other deadly  creatures like gators to them.
---
If a scientist at nuka world can do it I'm sure the enclave would have thought about it too or even funded his research 
---
Glad to hear it! :) Happy to help
---
Unfortunately, lore-wise, those would be premature in fo76.  The Institute is still very much remaining totally hidden and isolated post-war, and would still be developing the Type-I Synths.  And would certainly NOT be sending them out long distances.
---
May consider it for the right armor
---
I saw the owl mask my self but it is unacceptable
---
And there are pages for each one on the fallout wiki
---
Yes. Roleplaying. 
---
We grant our members complete freedom to design their own quests and we help by taking part as NPCs.  Each day we will be testing /running someones quest line. 
---
Your experience may vary  based on whose quest you get and who is running it that day. 
---
Some of us are older, we try to design interactive experiences that have choice, risk and reward. 
---
Some of our younger members are just happy to play a part. They can get a bit silly. But ive had player1's who do our quests and say it was the most fun they have ever had in this game. People usually are pretty happy with the experience... Even if they make the wrong choices and fail or die... (You can always retry) 
---
You can point a horse to water... You know?
---
The wall is useless though, if someone uses the turrets at that location it wouldn‚Äôt spawn their camp regardless since this guy has his there already 
---
They (or rather, the other guys) ALMOST did this in FO-NV...  
---

---
You mean that particular male face? I'm trying to compile all places where that one appears... =]]]
---
Oh I'll have to have a look in the wiki, thanks.
---
Far as I know, spoiled meat if just fertilizer that you haven‚Äôt crafted yet
---
Yes, I wondered that too!
---
Nope. I'm mainly a solo player 
---
I run with this perk and things still spoil very fast.  There is something wrong with the time scale in the game since last patch.
---
I hate the missions of free states.  I hate with all my heart to have to do missions for a recorded voice that supposed I was doing things 
---
Who knows!  
---
I also found two mysterious crater near the monorail elevator. As far as I know no nukes hit Appalachia. One crater looks like it was previously a military facility, much of the ruins being under ground. Giving me the feeling some underground facility exploded from the inside. But doesn't explain the second smaller crater. Gonna nuke em just incase.
---
Then it should switch titles to raw fertilizer or something?
---
I wrote this up last week. It should be an absolute breeze at your level and you should get at minimum 24 first aid kits and something like 20 coolers for food. I've found a couple more since I wrote this guide up.

---
Just a 15 minute run from 76 to flatwoods. 
---
Oh, I thought you meant rolling out new bugs and breaking patches again.
---
My mistake, learning to expect a company to keep doing 'more of the same'! 
---
That figure includes consoles too though.
---
I've never played a vanilla Fallout or Elder scrolls title on PC. 
---
The pages are empty with no info
---
&gt;Is it out of hope that they will see your feedback and change?
---
Yes, because if TES:VI and Starfield follow the Fallout 76 philosophy then that's three franchises down the toilet.
---
&gt; To discourage others from purchasing the game?
---
Yes, because making money off Fallout 76 influences the above point.
---
&gt;If you consider the time spent responding to multiple posts, day after day, week after week, following Inside The Vault, and so forth, it seems to me that you spend as much, if not more time, than genuine fans of the game, in order to provide running commentary about how much you dislike it. So what do you get out of it that encourages you to keep doing so, if the game itself does not do so?
---
Sorry but why are you implying that only people who like the game are 'genuine fans'?
---
&gt;What could Bethesda do now to change your opinion or at least improve it?
---
Do a FF14/Metroid play. 'Sorry guys we fucked up, we're not happy with how the game is right now. We're going back to the drawing board and we'll see you in 6 months.'
---
&gt; Yet when I read ITV, what I saw was a request for more feedback in order to make the game more enjoyable.
---
Then pray tell, what has been the point of the last 2 months of community managers being on Reddit posting 'Thanks for the feedback, I'll pass it on'?
---
&gt;Players (even those who enjoy FO76, like myself) have wanted Bethesda to listen to the fans of the franchise since the game was first announced, and now that they are offering to do so, they are receiving hate for that as well.
---
So if you think this they by extension everything the Bethesda team has been posting up to this point has been an absolute lie. Just fake responses and false interest. They were given 8 weeks worth of feedback and now they say 'Hey, got any feedback?'. Pull the other one.
---
I‚Äôm also a fan of centuars returning, and I voiced my opinion in their forum thread.
---
Here you go bethesda. Comprehensive feedback that's pretty fair.
---
Now time to do your job.
---
It‚Äôs like ore. It‚Äôs not fertilizer until you take it to a chemistry workbench
---
That's one thing this game needs, more queens and matriarchs
---
Great now all your post has done is get me as curious as you lol
---
Then why is the owl mask on a ritual station and inaccessible?
---
I used to dump everything into the cash register as artisan. I don't any more because someone says not a lot of people will look in there.
---
Unless s\he was wrong. 
---
when something doesn't make sense just assume it's a bug
---
which it is, spoiled vegetables count for herbivore
---
&gt;  For some people just having a common enemy with a bunch of anonymous names online is enough food to keep their fragile egos limping along.
---
DAE hate Juicehead?
---
That is true, nothings perfect and big games like this are hard to build. It was really the promises Bethesda made, and how it reminded me of Fable and Peters sweet buttery promises...
---
Damn you, Peter.
---
I think it was totally the TSE nerf and white knight.  They went way overboard on the TSE nerf.   The amount of nuking and activity went WAY down after the TSE nerf.    If they want less people playing the game, great way to accomplish it.   So 5% complain about a weapon strength, you then get rid of that and 50% leave, seems like your adjusting things based on the wrong parties desires..  
---
I killed and ate the raw cat meat early on with no hesitation.
---
I still feel bad.
---
Ding ding ding
---
You feel like you're being snubbed cause you're a big baby who can't take a week without detailed updates for a video game.  xD
---
Definately agree with more nuking/boss options
---
We all play the game differently is all I'm trying to say, and it's important to not dismiss someone else's play-style outright. 
---
Yes, it's on my mind too! There's a strange metal face in Whitepring that sort of resembles that. https://i.imgur.com/djEEi0U.png
---
You ate spoiled meat and your upset you got a disease from it. 
---
because it's just a mesh? you can't pick up lots of "items" in the game.
---
they're all in the dev room. there was a video showcasing them. can't get them in game, though.
---
This is how I feel too. I really do believe there are devs that really carw about this game but they're not being given the help and resources that they need and it shows 
---
I'd love to see this along with some of the abominations from Fallout 3. Imagine wandering around and having a mob of those attack you. I feel like they already set this up well with the crashed spaceship. There's even a door towards the back portion of it that hasn't been opened yet. 
---
Don't forget when you vats even in stealth they take no damage and it even says stealth hit 2.00x damage and then you leave vats and hit them few times till their dead and you wasted all that ap in vats.
---
Assault Rifles exist because I'm pretty sure Handmades don't. They're a myth more elusive than the Mothman or Flatwoods Monster. Sure hope I find one someday.
---
I don't have to know their inner workings to make a call on how badly they are doing things for the same reason I don't need to observe the kitchen and chef if my soup tastes like piss. I can tell that they did something wrong.
---
&gt;You talk about these things like they don't happen in many other major games over the years.
---
Actually no, they don't. Not to this degree. For a AAA studio this is the worst release I can remember since Final Fantasy 14.`
---
It's dangerous to go alone. It's dangerous to go in groups. It's just dangerous out there.
---
Add gangs among super mutants and opportunity to make friends with one of them.
---
 Excellent piece!
---
Necky? I'm not a giraffe. 
---
If you need some attention there‚Äôs plenty of places where you live that I get would love for you to spend some time volunteering at. 
---
And after they will give you lots of good attention ruin and praise.
---
You are probably thinking of tactics, BOS was the shitty console knockoff of dark alliance.
---
Yeah you're right, I'm just being pedantic. 
---
Don‚Äôt think so. I still play as often as I can. Would like to see the this game succeed.  Would like fixes to main game issues not asking me which monsters I‚Äôd like to fight more or less. Don‚Äôt be a such problem creator.
---
That's not how QA works. QA is an entirely different division that has zero devs working on it. They merely test the game, and send any bugs to the devs. I know, I've been a tester. In this case Beth tested and it was up to Obsidian to fix it 
---
I have noticed my Excavator and X01 don't seem to be degrading much, I only wear the X01 for nuke zones and the Excavator is my pickup truck for scrap runs, so they don't get a ton of use, but I have not noticed any degradation in weeks.
---
slow clap.....
---
I'm doing the tokens for the mascot set its why its pain when the game disconnects me during the daily quest so I lose it for that day or this weirdness happens. If they just gave us the option to do all 3 camden dailies it wouldn't feel like such a grind. I stopped doing the monster mash since the grand prize is just a 1 star lvl 50 item not worth the effort and it is a pvp event so someone can kill you and take your junk without penalty.
---
low energy troll
---
It‚Äôs you.
---
Cool, I'll look for it!
---
Because you are being snubbed. Now get back to playing and don't forget to buy more BethesdaBux.
---
Thank you!!! =]]
---
It would be more efficient and really not hard to just nuke it yourself
---
Good head lore.
---
Legendary bottle cap! 
---
I have no freakin clue What the F*** ü§¨ that‚Äôs legendary..
---
Jokes on you I'm not still playing. I uninstalled at the end of November. I only come here every once in a while to see if there are any significant enough updates to warrant reinstalling it. There have not been.
---
Yeah I bought this when it was 30 dollars. And i always buy Bethesda games when they are on sale. After how buggy Morrowind was. Always wait for miss to release and the game to go on sale. 
---
Also, community updates take time to be finished. And they are the only bug fixes we get in the single player games. 
---
I once observed possibly one of the coolest fights near tangara, there was a diseased scorchbeast fighting a chameleon deathclaw. The scorchbeast tore him to shreads, but not before i got a shot in on him and picked up his sweet loot ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). Then the same scorchbeast found me and chased me into the one cave where you get the enclave id card, completely on accident.
---
 I lost a low level Machine Gun Turret to ... I dunno. Its gone. ;)
---
They need to work on the actual game
---
I always imagine Jenny Slate (esp her Parks and Rec character) when I hear her voice, lol
---
Go to the top of the monorail elevator, you can't miss em. We should keep in touch, if I find anything interesting I'll hit you up.
---
We‚Äôre in the endgame now!
---
The rodents or griefers/raiders attack scarecrow?
---
I know it‚Äôs a grind - maybe you could work out a trade: farm for legendaries then trade them for Camden park tokens.
---
I mean its also possible that they are working on the vault content since those aren't complete and they don't want to mention since hype did get the game all this hate anyways. They really need to add more content, especially end game. My whole day is just doing camden daily, selling to vendors, and atom challenges. Its really sad thing to do for a game. But yeah, since this game got tanked by the hate bandwagon it would make sense for Bethesda to do a skeleton crew to save money then keep burning it on this dead game.
---
Seems pretty rude, for no reason? :\
---
I‚Äôve seen legendary rolling pins.. lolz
---
 I have found quite a few of em', but this is real detective work. ;)
---
I agree for the most part, except for the "boring enemies" bit. Of course mutts and wolves, or fodder enemies, like that exist and are boring because that's what they are. You can't just have every enemy be super interesting and cool and there's a memorable tale to tell about the fight you had with them. 
---
Same thing goes for the Scorched. I think that's kind of their thing... There's a ton of them and they're all basically a weird, carbon copy, hive-minded, encroaching horde of nasty, ashy death. If they can do anything about the animations, that would be killer. I like the idea of them being stuck in certain poses like the petrified corpses, but if their activation range could be tweaked to be a little shorter, that would be cooler. 
---
Think how much less fun Skyrim would be if it went as follows:
---
* The dragons have already roasted everything
---
* No one survived
---
* Everything is handled through burnt notes and wall scratchings
---
Squirrel horde: The forest
---
I wish they would implement some more factions of Raiders that we can fight/join
---
Uhh i must disagree with you. What lvl are you? I've encountered many many players that put massive time and work into there builds just for pvp. I have many great encounters with pvp all the time. I bought the game because of the promise of pvp. I do enjoy pve but for me i would of lost interest in the game before i reached lvl 100 if there was no pvp. There will always be players that dupe items regardless if it is a pve or pvp game. They economy would still be destroyed by dupers even if it was strictly pve. Let's say you found a awesome rare shotgun but you play a sniper build. You could of sold that item for alot of caps. Unfortunately the dupers decreased the value of it so your rare shotgun isn't anything special after all. You want to feel accomplishment and reward in any game you play. Part of that is finding rare gear. The real problem with fallout76 is. (1) duping. (2) there is no balance between builds. Some weapons mixed with good builds way over powered and some over nurfed. (3) glitches.............. Lol.  I do believe eventually Bethesda will get it all worked out. It obviously will take some time. In a year or 2 it will surely be a smooth as silk. Fingers crossed. 
---
They improved the hunt vs hunted we can actually find matches now. I do think pvp over workshops should be improved. Workshops was put in the game to encourage pvp it is not ment for pve play. Pvp that is instigated by attacking houses can actually end up being alot of fun. I personally dont go looking for other players houses to blow up, but i sure love it when they attack my house because most of the time i wreck them after. Although some times i run into some of those melee builds that do insane damage with crazy defense. 1 hit kills is a bit ridiculous. When a max damage sniper cant kill him with a full clip. I still love the game regardless of all its faults and im super excited about survival mode.
---
If your playing the game for the pve aspect only the occasional asshole that is trying to instigate pvp with you is not really a big deal because you can simply server jump and he is out of your hair. Accept the fact that this is not fallout4 or Farmville and decided to love or hate it.
---
Just make it laernian and I'm there haha
---
Sounds too American to me... DEPORTED 
---
Why didn't you just whoop his ass? 
---
Np just notifying everyone in the thread 
---
It would be cool if u could do quests for other players 
---
Oh no, first the reviewers were out to get us. Then /r/Fallout was out to get us. Then /r/fo76 turned and now the MODS are against us too?
---
This insidious conspiracy to smear Fallout 76 goes all the way to the top!
---
 I eat the spoiled vegetables and fruit when I have to,  I'm afraid of the meat. ;)

For sure. I, too, am resigned to doing the extraordinarily fun "vendor runs". Who'd have thunk that the latest gaming craze would be travelling to 7 locations to sell 200 caps worth of crap, daily :(
---
It's less an issue of it being online, as it was being able to handle the mob stats for creatures that were designed to require multiple people to take them down.
---
Because of how DR works, such big monsters become huge bullet sponges and require very large damage values (NOT DPS, like from automatic weapons) to do much of anything to them.  And of course, since Energy weapons get no armor piercing (bug), they become next to useless.
---
It's less an issue of the weapon stats, and more of how armor/DR works.  For a single-player game, it's not bad, since even higher level mobs don't get insane amounts of health and protection.  But the bosses/legendary/crowned mobs in fo76 DO.  This makes for tedious bullet-sponges unless you have just the right build and weapon and buffs to do insanely high damage per hit.
---
Check out the Fallout 4 calculations and you'll see how complicated it gets:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance#Fallout\_4](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance#Fallout_4)
---
And they need to fix how explosive applies to shotguns, rather than the nerf to Two-Shot and Explosive.  (It applies the full bonus explosive damage to EACH PELLET, rather than being divided among them.)
---
I‚Äôve done that too. Not worth the caps to fast travel to vendor.
---
True, but they could just save themselves money if they did test servers; so people could report what bugs reappeared or new ones, what got broken from the update, and if the update made people really sour like the explosives and perk card nerf update. Only negatives I could see with test server is more cost for Bethesda to upkeep them, showing their incompetence with more bugs/broken content, and giving dupers/glitchers head start on what ways to cheat are getting fixed or new methods to be created (but if Bethesda monitors players' actions they could learn the new methods and get fix on them maybe).
---
Giant Gecko would be sweet! His passive debuff would be dehydrating you the closer you get, almost lethal for melee cheesers. He should live in the desert part up in the far north fogot the name.
---
I totally agree to the TSE nerfs, but non legendary ranged weapons are still crap though. That's where a buff is needed 
---
Because they have given the most rewards for the time it takes to kill them.
---
reminds me of the three cat bowls in the upstairs of the cat lady house near Morgantown high that are permanently affixed to the floor and dressers and I forget are "decorative" every time I go there
---
I think anthem is going to appeal to a certain audience and maybe not so much to people outside that audience.
---
I love loot games, and I have been playing D3 on and off since it released and D2 is my favourite game of all time.  Anthem gives me that same feeling of chasing the loot that I get from diablo but it‚Äôs in a pretty well executed shooter form instead of a top down ARPG.  If they incorporate a system that‚Äôs similar to greater rifts I will be absolutely hooked on this game. It‚Äôs the same type of game loop Monster Hunter provides, but wildly different mechanics again. If that gameplay loop is not your jam, I don‚Äôt think anthem will offer much to you beyond maybe playing through the story. 
---
The only other shooter that I‚Äôve played that delivered that type of experience was The Division, and I played that a fair amount but the shooting mechanics themselves are... kinda bad IMO.  I‚Äôm interested to see if Division 2 has tightened up the game mechanics!
---
I kinda just wrote off birds as having the same fate as the moth man cultists that all went to high ground to avoid one catastrophe just to be hit with a nuke.  Theres still chickens that roam around Appalachia (wonderful chicken soup) and them being a flightless bird they may have had the advantage of cover to avoid the worst of the hit ensuring a breeding population to carry on, where their flight capable cousins took to the air for immediate bird rotisserie to envelop them.   But then again logic is sometimes boring and it would be super fun to have a radhawk or any other native west Virginia bird to contend with
---
Gosh, you're lucky, then! Didn't take long to drop, did it?
---
I bet its in my camps budget.  Cant build shit...
---
if thats was how it was marketed then I wouldnt expect something completely different.
---
you act like "no npcs" was something you completely did not expect until you played the game.
---
You may not be aware, but Beth didn't pay bonuses to Obsidian after a late entry by some rag of a review site lowered their Metacritic score from 85 -&gt; 84.  An issue that has rumors of Beth being involved in getting that score lowered to avoid the bonuses.
---
I'd be very wary of anything you hear about NV and what happened.  Here is the final outcome that is really the only known factor regardless what version you want to believe.
---
Obsidian and Bethesda will likely never work together again.
---
Not talking specifically Whitesprings or prime site. To include random encounters w/legendary bosses..
---
I TOTALLY forgot about the giant mutated radioactive ants, great call! It would be like MST3k, THEY LIVE! Kind of! 
---
Agree, there should be more balance changes to come. This is just the start of it.
---
if they are mutated monster squirrels with killer fangs... i'm in.
---
$50 for return gross, yeah feel like buying from Bethesda store is a rip off nowadays, I remember having issues with their bluetooth pipboy 3 times, while if I bought it from a different retailer probably wouldn't have had a hassle. You could try selling it on Craigslist all the stuff. Also, whats wrong with just keeping the helmet its a cool display piece.
---
I never said what I expected. I'm just explaining the difference between an NPC and an audio log, like you asked.
---
It's a legal reason, what if a modder demands a cut of the game they'd actually have a case to sue Bethesda.
---
&gt; the foundation of the games were solid 
---
What foundation? PVP didn't work, Endgame was totally missing, economy was non existing, cheaters were on rampart, combat was boring and shallow.
---
Well said and probably quite accurate.
---
I think the scorched act more like the synths from fallout 4 moreso than raiders. Excellent points made all around.
---
From what I understand 1 piece of Life Saving armor and Max Mysterious Savior causes a 90% chance to self resurrect, along with a 50% damage buff ones rezzed. I wonder how this would synergize with your low health/Adrenal Reaction setup?
---
I think one of their problems is all the posturing they do now. In 3 and NV they just charged you and never stopped. Now you can just step out of the way while they do their gorilla impression.
---
If you read her journal, that‚Äôs one cold blooded bitch. Ice for blood sending folks out to their deaths, or killing her roommates up close and personal.
---
Ah yes, happened to me last night. Carnivore literally says "Meat has no chance of disease". "Delicious!" I thought, as I downed 9 spoiled meat (meat is IN THE NAME).
---
20 minutes later, it was Oregon Trail, all over again.
---
"Carol Ann has died of dysentery."
---
Man, you're right about the "beehive." It means those clusters came out of the ground! The topmost part of them are surrounded by tubes and vents, that is, things build on the underground, I guess.  Good catch!
---
"Don't be such a problem creator"
---
This. It's great that you still play, sassing you aside I'm not trying to interfere with your enjoyment of the game. But it's so funny to see you type 'don't be a problem creator' when I think that's ~exactly~ what you're doing for yourself. Creating problems. 
---
Game devs do not have weekly detailed updates for the playerbase. This pretty much never happens. I don't know why people are frothing at the mouth for Bethesda to do this, but it's not going to go down how they want. That's not how things work.
---
Anyway, if you're still having fun, please continue to do so. Don't get too caught up in reddit lol.
---
I‚Äôm going to edit my original comment to clear up any confusion. I was referring to Bethesda games released prior to 76. 
---
I wouldn't have it any other way.
---
what's the problem with bashing? are negative opinions not welcome? because we also have useless and stupid circlejerking such as "let's take a moment to appreciate the CMs for passing along our feedback into a trash bin that nobody reads" and "thank you Bethesda for making the game remotely less broken but still unplayable"
---
and rumors make up at least 50% of any given news outlet.
---
What level? Seriously still better then Bobby pins
---
Latency, more like.
---
Well you'd be the expert eh?
---
Yes!! Thank you!
---
Go pray to the Wise Mothman for forgiveness and present an offering of your pants for him to eat.
---
Yeah but most tokens for sale would probably be duped, if only we could trade between characters like a bank system and just make ton characters to do the daily lol. Still don't get how grinding 3 tokens a day = fun to the devs.
---
I've experience this many times, however it usually fixes itself once I log out and then back in. Maybe try moving your camp? 
---
The scorched should have varying stages of scorchification. There should be ones who look almost human, but super feverish and sick looking, with a few ultracite shards, others who are almost more crystal than flesh. The fresher ones could wear actual armor, maybe even have more clear dialogue. 
---
It would be cool to stumble upon what you think is a survivor, but as you get closer you hear them muttering and gibbering, arguing with the Hivemind. They could also use less stupid AI and fight smarter, with snipers in entrenched positions, ambushers with stealth boys or at least try to sneak up and flank you. Have them set traps, better use doors and just generally function more like people and less like feral ghouls with guns.
---
Hell half the ghouls in the game wear more armor than Scorched. 
---
Also, expand on whatever society it seems they have. You have Scorched Zealots and Conquerors, so they appear to have some kind of hierarchy. What are they zealots of? The Scorchbeast Queen? Does that mean she is intelligent? Do are they lead by the Interloper or whatever it is?
---
I feel the tse nerf was needed. I use to be able to snipe with a pump shotgun which was kind of broken. Now tse weapons are only really good if you run the perks with them. In my experience anyways.
---
Lolz you can‚Äôt scrap legendary drills like you do normal ones.
---
I thought they would survive a giant meteorite impact that killed the land dinos and all the dust that would create.
---
It does suck that the updates are so far and few between with little to no real additions other than bug fixes. This is one of those games that people will probably shelf for a while and come back to later. 
---
Eh, it's understandable. It does seem like I'm suggesting all predictions are worthless so I don't mind making the clarification. It's always good to be detailed when making a claim as big as I did. xD
---
I will continue to play and help others in game. 
---
So you have shares in Bethesda or are just willfully ignorant? 
---
No, it wasn't.  It was gamer knowledge.  Even then you had to be a fan of Fallout under Beth, and for some; NV was the game that sold them on Beth having the IP rights.  I don't believe you are wrong, because NV was a mess on release; however the real culprit is the same thing that is crippling 76.  A shitty engine being supported by studios that had no hand in creating it.
---
^_^ Erh... found what? The faces? The clusters? =]]]
---
Yup. As rude as the game haters are.
---
I think that was like the black friday sale, since it hasn't been cheap since then, maybe console is still dirt cheap.
---
Ok, No Bark. You go get those "Neo-Nazis" even though the gaming community has been cynical way before gamergate but the narrritive of everyone who doesn't think the way I do is a neo-nazi is a good way to really bring the community together.
---
Vampiric tato? 
---
How are you supposed to use it? 
---
So far that‚Äôs best submission yet. Lolz
---
I can't run out of people to play with because I never had any to begin with!
---
I saw that yesterday! 
---
That's onebof those games that, even though there's nothing left for man to do, I can still go back and enjoy for hours. It's just so well done. 
---
Of course not. Giraffes don't have beards.
---
Hunted to extinction by Scorch Beasts like insects?
---
Given the level of knowledge on this subreddit I would say anyone with a first year level of CompSci would pass as an expert.
---
This has nothing to do with your question, but I love your Reddit handle. XD
---
Upset? The game has a mechanic that isn‚Äôt functioning as written/intended. If we‚Äôre just going to exchange baseless and pointless jabs, I‚Äôll start out with you‚Äôre * and mention using the wrong form automatically drops your perceived IQ. Moving on.
---
Yeah, like it would be nice to try to get those rare outfits, but who wants to waste more time grinding dailies and events for less then 1% to get the outfit. Also, server hopping for that vendor bot only to see it after maybe 20+ times to not have the long coat is just dumb.
---
The thing is, their older games actually DO get patches, but they still don‚Äôt bother to fix things that have been fixed by community mods. Skyrim got like 4 patches in 2018 and basically none of them included bug fixes, even ones that have been available for years.
---
I know white knight does not 
---
I have yet to find plans for the Pump Action Shotgun. :( 
---
Thank you. I just keep checking every vendor, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll see it soon enough. 
---
Excellent, good to know!
---
White Knight: No
---
Marathoner: Yes?
---
Power patcher is for power armor what white knight us for regular armor

My wife asked me the same thing dead-faced, like in December, and I was like, ya know what, Eph this.

I quit then and haven't gone back to fo76 since.

Got another 30 hours into FO4 instead and am mopping up final achievements taking the other paths/strings.

No idea why you are getting downvoted

I liked reading this 7months ago and think the inclusion of more unique creatures would be awesome https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/8tnckc/cryptids_of_west_virginia_part_2/
---
How do you roleplay in this game exactly? You can't change the world in anyway, and player interaction is severely limited. Do you just walk around in a firebreather outfit and say "Hello, I am a firebreather, when I shoot the ghouls I shoot them as a firebreather, which is different then if I shoot them wearing my enclave shirt."
---
It all comes down to this: Fallout games are a precious commodity, that people, myself included, generally love to play. They take many, many years to come out with long spans between these years.
---
If you start to look at that "amount of time to release a new Fallout" vs. "the number of years you have left to play games", unless you're very young or plan to play at 80, you may only have 4-7 Fallout games left in your gaming lifetime.
---
That means each one of these counts. They MEAN something, to people.
---
So when one misses as hard as FO76 has, it's something we want to salvage. And nothing has ever been salvaged by rolling over and playing dead.
---
Bots, Bots never change
---
aim wasnt really the problem it was in range (close enough to hit with a 204 range rifle) about once every minute to minute and a half.. when it got close enough id hit it and then it would fly off out of range again.
---
Oh yes. Those meds help make it possible for me to have a wife that keeps me in line.
---
People don't live on Reddit. People have lives. People understand Reddit as a forum for certain things (in this case Fallout 76). Goes to the Reddit for Fallout 76 in order to vent his frustrations towards the game to an audience that might understand what is going on or at least somewhat care.
---
What are you getting at? That he is a Russian bot spreading anti-Fallout 76 propaganda in order to form a New World Order?
---
$35.99 on Xbox today ;)
---
He basically told you what some are starting to see and what I realised recently but he did it in a way that didn't say it bluntly. There is no more information because they are doing nothing.
---
Name me one other game that has regular content updates without any single shred or hint of what that content will be or when it will likely be available. I can't think of any because even the bad games can have good content released that will bring in new features, new content and even fix up a lot of the broken things. They can't talk about any new content because it does not exist. The fact they have to ask for feedback on what we'd like to see is a desperate and poorly veiled attempt to get ideas on what they should do next.
---
They would love to push out new content. The simple emerging fact to me is that there is no new content and the tiny team they have working on things are apparently playing a game of guess the new inventory limit in a sort of  disorganised Jenga way while a few others are trying to fix bugs in an engine they have very little experience using.
---
Hey Bethesda, if you say I'm wrong and that there is content coming how about you prove me wrong and SHOW SOMETHING? You can't.
---
rightclick on the continue button and click open in new tab.
---
I know but nerfing two shot was just dumb, two shot by itself wasn't even that overpowered and now with the nerf those weapons aren't even worth it. Nerfing the perk cards seemed unnecessary since explosive heavy weapons do way less damage when they should be high levels of damage. I found the nerf to the repair perk card weird since power armor has a similar perk card and most people run around in power armor. But, that update readded so many old bugs they fixed when they could have easily avoided that by testing their own update or a test server.
---
not really.
---
your first point can apply regardless of npcs.
---
your second point applys to why there are no npcs. (and as a survivor you would want to know why so you can avoid the same fate)
---
your 3rd point is really the only one with a "difference" since skyrim (which I assmue you are stuck on since you use dragons) has note, books, wall scartchings (yeah I am stretching the snake whale and bird), ect. the only difference between an audio log and an npcs is what/who conveys the information you want/need. gameplay wise they are the same.
---
ESO
---
The random spawns. Every rat, dog/wolf, molerat and toad I've had has gone for my scare crow first before coming for me or my stuff. I've even had ghouls go after it
---
Then you have a short memory or you have missed many floundering ships lol. I'm not saying it's ~common~, but every year there are big games that are released in a mediocre state and fail.
---
That aside, let me clarify something. If you go to a restaurant, you can say the soup tastes like piss if it tastes like piss. What you can't do-- what you tried to do here-- is say WHY it tastes like piss. Especially when you haven't seen the kitchen, especially when you don't know the cook, especially when you don't even cook yourself (assumption there, if you are a triple-A developer with experience making online games just let me know). Maybe the cooks working on this new dish are newbies, maybe there's one cook who really sucks dragging the rest down, maybe someone actually did piss in your soup, or maybe there was no quality control. All possibilities, and there are, I'm sure far more variables involved in a big studio making a big online game than there are in a kitchen. Which leads me to write again: you don't know what the problem is.  
---
Don't confuse your reasonable ability to assess a product with your unreasonable desire to create conjectures explaining why the product is the way you feel it is. xD
---
Kinda like Communism
---
Interesting theory, Going to put this into my gameplay thoughts and strategy now.
---
Better solution: Quintuple their legs!
---
Pretty much yeah.
---
Shhhh don't feed the obvious troll.
---
There's usually another behemoth wandering around Pylon V13 (or whatever it's called) near Bog Town.
---
If this was another country they'd have been taken out back and executed. 
---
Sorry I'm not a hater nor lover.   
---
But think we can all agree the most frustrating part of Fallout 76 is their approach to community interaction. While reddit is a "interesting" place it can also be overwhelming for developers. HOWEVER, look at other games like Battlefront (which also had a shaky launch) and things like Rust. They are very transparent with whats going on behind the scenes. Every week we get little teases and blogs. The community managers interact with people. While Inside The Vaults are good (The first batch were great! What happened?) we do need more transparency. They promised a batch of new content "soon"  and we're over 2 months since release. Why haven't we heard anything yet? What's going on with the new mode? What was the result of the event feedback?  
---
It's frustrating as someone invested in this game not knowing where it's headed.  
---
I wouldn't get on a plane not knowing where it's going.
---
I laughed more than this deserved.  Take your upvote.
---
Deathclaws were a let down imo. They‚Äôre super easy to kill. They need to be faster and do more damage. I miss when they were scary. Fo4 had the same issue. You can kill one in the first quest. So dumb.
---
 I have good pictures of the Lucky Hole cluster and the Tangara Town one. I have seen some of the other ones.
---
Was I rude in my post? I thought I was pretty respectful, and not all fired up? No?
---
That lots of the dev team have been quitting
---
Source - job postings @ BGS austin

They didnt nerf any weapons.
---
I get what your saying. I just want them to fix two shot in vats. 95% hit and still miss almost all shots 
---
Show me on your knee where the bullet hit you.

I game share with a mate and they got it free with a One X purchase. So for me.. Defo üòÖ

---
Dang, I've never seen a Behemoth at Whitesprings.
---
Not really. 
---
The first point poses the question to the player 'Why even bother doing any of this?'.
---
The second point destroys any notion of 'Maybe there is a group of survivors at the end of this breadcrumb trail' and reinforces the feeling of 'Why bother?'.
---
The third point is that being told to collect fifty bear asses by a tape makes you a tool of the story, not an actor in it. With an NPC you get dioalogue options, discourse, choice (or at the minimum an illusion of it). The difference between doing something just because you are told to by some faceless entity, or because you agree to as a favour to some other inworld actor.

if you mean the neon letters they are from the plan called signs and letters which costs something like 11,000 caps from a vendor with no perks/buffs. (last time I saw it was sutton trains station)

This isn't a bug.  Slow Metabolizer and Dromedary occur at the time you eat or drink.  They do not slow their rate of decay - they just make all food and water fill their respective meters more than they usually would.

Made them able to cripple you. And who hit first..
---
Fo76 defender right here. Your why nobody can enjoy this game
---
It's not a conspiracy. I didn't say the mods are 'against us'. What I \~asked\~ is why there's so much trash is floating to the top of the sub, including rumours and BS that have no business in any reasonably moderated environment.
---
Nice strawman though. You're pretty much doing exactly what I wrote about: creating a trash reply that exaggerates with zero substance. xD
---
I found the plans for them either beside the office for the hotel in Flatwoods, between the office and one of the yellow cars, or from claiming a workshop. 
---
Thanks for the info.  I did a search in r/fo76 but didn't see anything current.
---
BEHOLD, THE UNDERMINER
---
Agreed! 
---
I'm sick of the complainers and the constant quitting threats, I always think "great, go away, we don't want you".
---
But you go and make it an encouraging story about starting a business.  Take your upvote and gtfo and never come back.
---
Seems a very nice change to me, could be very fun indeed
---
Is it just me or did they recently take out the belch when your character finishes eating?
---
You could just use the quick-boy. The colours are pretty damn close. 
---
Just finish the brotherhood missions in cranberry bog and you‚Äôll get a full suit. 
---
You paid for release content, basically pay to play which typically isn't even server based.  Anything new would require and additional revenue stream because that sales money paid was a different bucket, namely to payback investors for the creation of the product. 
---
Im guessing you didn't play console release of fo:nv, fo3, or me:a if you consider fo76 is that bad.  Heck ive used professional software that makes this look good (I'm looking at you Oracle).
---
You can buy them off a dupper for about 2k
---
Eventually if NPCs are added...I‚Äôd love to fight a raider in raider power armor.
---
&gt;What you can't do-- what you tried to do here-- is say WHY it tastes like piss.
---
But you can say 'Well clearly the kitchen is shit'.
---
&gt;assumption there, if you are a triple-A developer with experience making online games just let me know
---
I don't do games development but I do commercial release and development. The writing was on the wall as to how they operate as soon as those bobby pin weights changed. They are either incompetent or reckless and the fact that their QA processes didn't pick up on the problem is testament to a testing/verification framework that is not fit for purpose. People would be fired or at the very least reassigned for that sort of mistake.
---
To be honest I have to learn more about the proper builds. Being new to fallout I think I'm all over the place. I know I'm not doing the best I could be right now. I'll get my info when in home tonight and post, would love any advice on how to relevel.

I found a dense combat *mod* post patch, at Grafton station. Obviously not as good as plans, but something.

Jumping ship to EA is like going from a sinking ship to the kraken's mouth

These things, even if the roadmap isn't finished, should be put into the ITV. This week's one where it just talked about patching a glitch that's been around since beta and ending on an ad for the atomic shop isn't what ITV is meant to be.

As to whooping his ass, I tried to, but didn't understand the limitations of pacifist mode, I guess. And I didn't know if I could disable it at will, or if it required me to log off and back on... basically, I got about 5 seconds into thinking about it and decided that this jerk wasn't worth any more thought than that and just bounced to a different server instead.
---
Why is there so much trash floating to the top? Perhaps because the trash is what is resonating most with people now? Why does it have no business being there? If it breaks the rules then report it.
---
I have one modded up ,including calibrated shocks.
---
Negative opinion is not the same as bashing. Stating "this game has too many bugs, it's frustrating and I don't think it's worth the money I paid" is not "lol Bugthesda is shit, there's one developer working on this game, 76 is bound to fail".
---
And if you think thanking someone in a \~customer service position\~ for doing their job and putting up with all the shit that goes with it is a 'circle jerk', you are not a person worth my time. Many CSR jobs are a pain in the butt, working for Bethesda or otherwise, and being shown appreciation is about politeness and respect-- whereas bashing and shitposting is about being a juvenile.
---
I'm not gonna touch your implied condoning of rumours, because it's too silly for me to bother. Blocked.
---
I found a dense combat torso mod (so still RNG dependent) at Grafton Station, post patch. Not as good as a plan, but is something.
---
None of their games prior to F76 had any foundation to online game and you can see exactly that from F76- SBQ has 0 teamwork needed, because it's a dragon taken from Skyrim, what was single player game. All they did is they switched its model, ramp up its HP and called a day, instead of actually design fight mechanics to big as f#cking monster that needs to be taken down with group. They had no idea how PVP should work or even weapons. They took weapons from F4 and now they realize:"Ohh yeah TSE is too OP". OP weapons were fine in Fallout 4 because no one gave a shit about weapons being OP in single player game.
---
Right! I want more interesting fights with more technique, less bullet sponges and less trading shots with enemies 
---
From my experience (40 hours farming the enclave) i found 1 calibrated shock and 3 jetpacks, so to me the jetpack is 3 time less hard to get.
---
But i m just being silly here both ARE A FUCKING PAIN IN THE ASS TO GET.
---
This need to be fixed ffs and not at a crazy price as we‚Äôve spent so much time farming it
---
Sacredly delicious.
---
"The hunting rifle exist, lever action is far superior." Its simple, for weapon diversity and choice. The assault rifle is far more common than the handmade, its far easier to mod and get mods for. Besides both weapons have been in fallout as far back as fallout 3 so there's no reason not to have them in the game.
---
*Pittsburgh 
---
It's $20 in places.
---
I'm happy with it though, got 80 hours in and will probably hit 100.  I've paid $60 for much less.  
---
Man, there is so much untapped potential in this game. Wouldn't it be awesome if they actually acted on your research?!?!
---
Yeah you need a mic. Otherwise its just weird. 
---
Thanks for the heads up.. I may have to at least get one of those until I can find that darn plan
---
That‚Äôs only if you start physical therapy! Start it yesterday! 
---
I‚Äôm almost a year in for PT for thoracic outlet syndrome. I do it at home now, but it‚Äôs still hours a day. 
---
Im actually recording a chart of how many star items I get - to how many star enemies I kill - to is it in a nuked zone or not - to did I let the health bar recharge or not.
---
Does anybody know already: do you get better loot or maybe better than 1 star more often (on a 3 star enemy) if you let the healthbar recharge or is it going to be the same even if I just shot it?
---
What, you want them to make new enemies that actually make sense in WV, instead of just reusing the enemies from MA/ME?
---
Nope
---
Darn...whomp whomp
---
My guess is the paint you're actually referring to is the Blackbird paint from the atom shop. It was only available for a limited time.
---
I think it's safe to say this particular "sewage" won't be floating to the top.
---
Depending on how they handled it, it could be awesome.
---
Thanks for doubling down on your previous assumptions.
---
Bye. xD
---
You make all these accusations about them not being fully staffed and question if they are dedicated to the game.
---
Why? Because the Inside the Vault was skimpy this week. You‚Äôre literally coming up with all these conspiracies about how the game has been abandoned by Bethesda because of a skimpy weekly update.
---
And when questioned you don‚Äôt like the idea of being accused or called something?
---
Pot meat the kettle. 
---
H
---
Some crap you cant build unless you have the perk card for it. I bought the auto grenade launcher plans (1500 caps) then found out I didn't have the right explosives perk card and had maxed out my Intel so I can't get the card now...no grenade launcher for me  @#$@%$%#$
---
I down voted just because of the edit. Why are you so concerned with internet points?
---
Had people like me been allowed to support the game with mods from the start - instead of getting a (temporary) ban for it and flamed into oblivion for pointing out what was wrong - the game would be balanced, fixed and more feature complete by now, server instability notwithstanding which needs managing at their end.
---
Instead, I'm porting all it's cut content into Fallout 4 (since it has all the assets I need) and have just started on the Appalachia map as well. My aim is a mod for Fallout 4 set in Appalachia and based 175 years after the events of Fallout 76, meaning the land has become devastated by all the nukes the Vault Dwellers launched (and a convenient explanation for not porting FO76 assets into FO4). Also, it will have human NPCs lol
---
I got upset with the lack of making me want to play again I ended up going back to fallout 4. It's a little weird always having to use the pipboy for the map and I was confused as to why I can't scrap my junk but I'm loving my endless stash box
---
I'm looking into this currently! I was tagged in a couple posts on this yesterday and haven't found an answer just yet but I will update you with what I find out.
---
I still haven't found a single fucking mod for X-01 CS legs.
---
  Yes!. I have always dislike the dropped Legendary nonsense. I like to make all my own stuff and sell nearly all Legendaries to the nearest bot. I quit ESO because you had to do this crap for certain mats etc. Force me into stuff I don't want to do. bye.
---
I agree. If they are going to make it so that players are the only humans in the game, and if BGS is telling us we "make our own story in the wasteland," it would only make sense for players to be part of the story and be actual members of factions. Even if it's just PvE and PvP is an option. It would be cool to see consistent faction quests where you work with or against other players. Players could wear the faction attire according to their factions, or something.
---
Who said anything about russia? Trolls or just bored people can and do make multiple accounts post a few things then leave it alone. Then they go though and post on what ever topic the user is against. Often agreeing with another account posted also owned by same person.
---
The entire point is to make it seem like more people agree with them and agree with the point. Done with enough accounts it can actually make it seem like a larger group then it actually is. 
---
2 year old reddit account. Until a little while ago they haven't posted.  Suddenly they are here posting only negative things about FO76.  Says they uninstalled reddit a year ago. Why come back when Bethesda has an official forums to talk on? Taking the words at face value reddit wasn't entertaining to them so why ever come back when you have another source?
---
They aren't assumptions. They are industry standards. If my soup came out cold and I said 'This hasn't been cooked' you wouldn't jump around saying 'Well you haven't seen the kitchen so how do you know they didn't cook it?'
---
Happy cake day!
---
I agree. I‚Äôd much rather have this. 
---
I don't have a mic but don't usually talk much anyhow...if you don't mind a "silent protagonist" we're about the same level and I don't mind letting you lead the quests and such.
---
Pot meat? Sounds gross. Is that a recipe in-game?
---
Sorry for the delayed response I was hoping to have an answer faster than this. I'm currently looking into this, I'll let you know what I find out!
---
Yeah, I've found 5 Jetpacks at this point. I've given away 3 jetpacks to people, and I have one for myself and one hopefully to trade for the Shocks. It seems that it really depends on the player, I've got a guy I play with who hasn't seen a single Jetpack while hunting for one nearly as long as I've been looking for the shocks. 
---
/r/woosh
---
I just found the phenomenon interesting. Your voting preferences/actions are fine with me; I just want you to be happy.
---
This stupid rng is fucked
---
It is hard for people to accept that there are flaws in something that they are emotionally and financially invested in.  Rather than looking at it for what it is it‚Äôs easier to silently downvote and somehow feel vindicated. 
---
It‚Äôs not my favorite thought that I spent $80 on a game that has been one disappointment after another. Not only did the game force me to realize that my beloved series had fallen into the hands of the Raiders lurking behind the scenes , but it actually shattered my trust in Bethesda. 
---
Canvas Bag ........
---
Nuka Dark..........
---
This was hands down the worst $80 I have ever invested in a game. 
---
The most tiresome thing in the combat system is how much enemies tend to invade your hotbox and generally grovel and target your legs.
---
It's a nightmare to find and target all the critters crawling under your hatbox.
---
I'm repairing my PA legs at least twice as often as the rest of it as a testimony to this broken mechanic.
---
I feel like there should be a melee perimeter about 1m (3 feet for you barbarians) that mob cannot enter, but still be in range for trading blows.
---
are you sure you didn't pick up the actual legendary item and are just showing that last item available?
---
I think they should get a whole new engine and start over with Fallout 1&amp;2 in mind for inspiration. 
---
It does go to the top. All the way to Todd Howard!
---
That does sound like a lot of fun. I don't think that I have the creativity to design my own quests, though. However, I would be willing to take part in ones that have been created by others. 
---
My biggest problem at the moment is that my character is only level 12, so I can't leave the forest region without running into enemies that kill me in two hits. I can't even continue with the Overseer's quest yet. For now I'm just running around scavenging to build up on supplies.
---
It sounds like you all have put a lot of effort into creating these quests for people, so I'll take it seriously if I partake in any of them. I think I should probably level up a bit more first, though. That way I won't be restricted to quests that are in just one region. 
---
I'm 25 so I guess I'm not really young, or old. I fall somewhere in the middle I suppose. 
---
Hey responding on a phone has it‚Äôs down fall.
---
Notice how you use something like that to avoid the truth.
---
You took something as simple as a skimpy Inside the Vault and spewed put all these accusations and nut job conspiracies. 
---
Which is rude and insulting.  
---
I really hope we see more of the "entity" on Lucky Hole Mine!!!
---
Rule #3: No meme content as posts.
---
Rule #7: No rumours or leaks without evidence
---
Rule number 3 is open to interpretation, I see a shitpost as being just as useless as a meme. Not sure how the mods see it.
---
Rule number 7 has been consistently broken the last few weeks, including in threads that get 1-2k upvotes, which means they're highly visible. This rule is seriously lacking enforcement. The Fallout sub had a thread with like 10k upvotes last week that was ~entirely based on a rumour with zero evidence to back it up~.
---
I have reported posts, nothing is being done. Hence why I looked into the mods here, and why I made this thread. I could easily argue that you should never say a bad thing to Bethesda because hey, you can just report it, but clearly that's not how it works on a discussion forum.
---
That dastardly devil. This was all a ploy to get us to buy Skyrim again instead of playing Fallout 76.
---
Votes go in, post goes up.
---
This isn't new to reddit. This happens on the internet everywhere.
---
For me it just doesn‚Äôt make sense that there were humans in the area recently that all somehow managed to get totally wiped out. That‚Äôs not even taking into account that there‚Äôs no sentient ghouls around at all despite only being 25 years after the war. If anything wouldn‚Äôt there be a ton more sentient ghouls compared to Gerald?
---
Agreed was scratching my head at those labels, too.
---
again the first point can apply regardless of npc's existing or not so doesnt matter in the argument.
---
second point you've shifted goalpost have shifted as lore wise your vault dweller has no reason to believe there are survivors. that is why they went into the vault. what with the nuclear war and all. what you are following is the breadcrumbs of information for the problem mentioned in the first point.
---
3rd point is getting told to get 50 bear asses to fix something for an npc that is just sitting there doing nothing. and the optional dialog of "are you done yet" which to your first point "Why even bother doing any of this?" At least with npcs it makes more since. hell it seems bethesda actually tried to make it plausible for certain areas. like in flatwoods the automated registration because they were already stretched thin due to raider attacks.
---
Drat it, riomaki is correct.  My tesla shows as energy damage now.  Amusigly enough the gauss is still a ballistic damage energy gun though.
---
I agree with many of the (legitimate) complaints people have about this game. I'm talking specifically about the rabid and irrational hatred that is constantly posted on this sub by 2 day old accounts with the intention of making it seem like there is a much bigger controversy than there actually is. That's why I said "some people." That's not honest community feedback, it's a targeted hatred campaign. And while this type of campaign might not have started with Gamergate, it certainly coalesced the forces behind these type of attacks. If you think the barrage of hysterical posts from 2 day old accounts are a legitimate representation of this community, I don't know what else to say. That's why OP posted this thread. Because the second any of the people screeching about Bethesda being evil get scrutinized, they delete their accounts. We are trying to get a rational response out of a group of irrational people.
---
The game doesn't use the critters it has effectively, why would being in more make good content?
---
The neon Signs &amp; Letters plan, right?  Not the Small Letters?
---
You summarized what we were all feeling pretty well. Thanks. My fav enemies right now are Death claws and Super Mutants. Ghouls are pretty decent too.
---
&gt; **Radscorpions**: These things are the devil and here to do the devil's work. 
---
That line right there made me spit my coffee on my keyboard ahahaha!   
---
Thank you for all the detailed feedback on enemies, I really appreciate you taking the time to write this all out. Some really great input on here. 
---
Thank you! At least they're good places to visit!
---
Right. And these are really what makes a game an RPG: having a **R**ole to **P**lay in the **G**ame. BGS has said that "players make their own story," but this isn't true at all. Our choices have no consequences, or actions add nothing to the story. The story is basically just what we find in notes and terminals around the game - it's predefined. All we're doing in 90% of the quests is finding out more about the past (the backstory).   
---
And that's really what Fo76 is, an RPG. It's labelled "survival" but in my opinion, the only survival elements are there superficially. It's no challenge to collect food or shelter or really even stay alive.
---
Usually I see something peculiar, and think that's probably just a cool decoration. Then I read shit like this, and immediately regret not looking closer. Looks like I've got some places to visit tonight.
---
Thank you for dispensing sweet internet point justice to...educate me?
---
Also side note on "Where are the Zetans!?" I'm just gonna [plop this link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlVZ_u_LtgY) and see if anyone notices anything about this....... 
---
I love/hate this game 
---
Cool story bro.
---
The last time I hit a cap stash, I stopped before I clicked on it.  I removed Cap Collector.  Backed out of the Pipboy, then went back in, equipped Cap Collector, THEN clicked on the cap stash.  And there was a search option!    Not sure if you have to do it each time or not (didn't find anymore before I got disconnected) but might want to try it on the next one you find.
---
When you come out of the vault and head south you pass a truck with a couch on the back. Bellow is a camp fire and  a randomly generated low level running meat bag. Cat's were what spawned for me. I noticed they had a health bar and i thought to myself..no the rarity of cat meat in 4 was like a unicorn and you couldn't cook it. Man i was oddly excited to find out  after bashing 2 of the three cats to death that not only were they edible they turned them into a steak cut of meat with a +2 agility modifier. I say excited mostly because i like a game that pushes you out of your comfort zone a little. If i was in survival mode id imagine everything can be a sandwich.  I was even more surprised how a dude in my discord really disliked even the idea of me doing this. Yet he had no problem cooking dog meat.  Even here in fallout you don't get anyone complaining about mongrel murder,foxes,deer,cow,beaver or even awesome opossum. Kill a cat virtually and you go unforgiven. 
---
Scorched Gulpers have more health than their health bar displays. If you do enough damage, it will start going down.
---
They are also immune to cripple, and regenerate health.
---
Source: I live on the Aluminum node next to Dyer Chemical. I have to kill two scorched or glowing gulpers every login, and every hour.
---
I found the BOS officer suit plans and marine wetsuit plans at either Mac's Farm or Bootlegger's Shack, up by the General's Steakhouse. This was maybe two or three days ago. 
---
What's your view on the one clear wandering monster-who's-not, Grahm? 
---
I could probably find a source but... 
---
Pretty sure birds are also more susceptible to radiation vs mammals?
---
Yeah I‚Äôll give that a shot 
---
Minnesota represent! Google the quest. It'll be a more complete walkthrough than I think anyone here can give. 
---
Deleted:/
---
There is no woosh here. This is something someone would legitimately think. And is literally a counter argument I've had used against me when I noticed a 3 day old account was using literally copy past reasoning of another one with them constantly agreeing with each other.  When the I guess main account was banned the sub account started complaining which is how people learned what was happening with confirmation.
---
Looks like I found me something to do tonight! Thanks! :)
---
I'm okay with scorched in place of raiders. Raiders became uninteresting long ago. 
---
Yes! That's quite intriguing... =]
---
&gt; Thank you for your hard work and for continuing to put up with all of this, 
---
I'd say you don't represent the majority of this subreddit's thoughts.
---
Are you feeling alright? What hard work has been done in 3 months since release? We've had a grand total of 5 patches, 5.5 if you count the hotfix for the mess that was patch 5 and that still hasn't addressed all the bugs they managed to (re)introduce. That's less than 2 a month for a game that needed rapid fire fixes, updates and changes immediately not to mention some sort of stated roadmap that lets players see you're actually planning it and not ignoring all of the feedback then asking for feedback.
---
"Continuing to put up with all of this"
---
The much deserved criticism over the lack of updates, lack of communication, totally missing roadmap, copy paste (rep)lies of "passing that on", mysterious future incoming content at some point between now and the heat death of the universe?? I'm not justifying any personal attacks but the criticism of the game is warranted, needed and is the only thing that has any chance of getting them to put the desperately needed resources towards fixing this mess.
---
You enjoy the game because you're a roleplayer? That's great. I didn't realise roleplayers ignored clear issues and problems. TIL I guess.
---
Didn't WoW have servers wide announcement when it kept beating every million milestone at the beginning? I remember seeing video where streamer told something like:"When 8 million players announcement came, I was there. When 10 million players announcement came, I was there"
---
You are incorrect.
---
They are bugged and immune to cripple.
---
Or maybe it is intended because they are salamanders, not sure.
---
Sometimes I ask myself a similar question, why do I keep coming back and retrying to see if it's enjoyable... So after the latest patch I actually farmed 1600 freaking caps to buy schematics for a Handmade rifle, crafted one and scrapped a few to tune it up, it does literally nothing. Melee is okay, gun play is completely uninteresting, super mutants are annoying to fight, honestly I have more fun aimlessly wandering around in Fallout 4 when I completed most of the quests just triggering special encounters and using guns which actually do damage, not these pathetic 40 damage junk. If I want to try another Fallout 76 game I'll install Skyrim again with the new co-op mod which breaks everything and play that. Exactly the same result.
---
On that note I think I'm also done with this for now. Oh, and Nuka World has that sexy raider underarmor! Another plus. /endrant
---
Something about using the video/audio data to help.
---
That entire romance is tragic start to finish.
---
I have a feeling around March 5 we‚Äôll get the answer...
---
Lol then yes they are running a skeleton crew.
---
Oh my gosh,. I did it. I actually did it. I bought it for like the 5th time today.
---
Ohhh, I thought he meant the smaller letters. No, I haven‚Äôt just found those plans either. But considering how pricy the small ones are, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs safe to assume that the neon can be found too. 
---
Me too. It's like, they know they need voices that acknowledge what we're doing, but at the same time, those people are dead. So they came up with a solution that doesn't make any sense: NPCs giving us "quests" and instructions based on holotapes and recordings they left before they died, all assuming people would pick up their recordings and just do everything they tell them to. Probably the best example of this is the Abbie's Bunker questline. In each of the tapes, it's like, in her voice, she somehow knows you're accomplishing these things. But she's dead.
---
Pacifist mode is there to protect you from flagging for pvp or a bounty by not letting you damage a player or their camp.
---
Pacifist mode does not protect you from a player attack, but what it does do is what we call "Slap Damage".  It can eventually kill you if you let it, but you won't flag for full pvp to that other player unless you turn off Pacifist mode.
---
That player sounded like a vulgar dbag, but he was playing within the game dynamics.
---
Stay away from workshops if you don't want to get killed btw.  Taking one flags you for pvp, and by taking one you're flagging yourself for consensual  pvp even with Pacifist mode on.
---
Hope you have better interactions with players in the future.
---
the woosh was the russian comment. my old reddit account was inactive for years before i made posts (before you accuse me of whatever you might think of, i deleted it to start a fresh account). dont take these posts so seriously. just move on.
---
I bought the game on PS4 so I could play with my dad and my brother. Now my dad just plays Fallout 4 and my brother hasn't opened 76 in over a month. :/
---
This is not true. You are modifying or expanding on something that has been provided to you. There is no grounds to be able to take "legal action" against Bethesda if for any reason they decided to use any "mod" that is produced for this game. Only way this would work is if Bethesda took "your" work and used it without "your" permission (EX: Personal Texture). Bethesda has given us the tools, and the ability to use "their" game to create these "mods". No matter how you look at it, technically speaking, you don't own your "mod" Bethesda does. Would it be a "douche" move to just take someones work and put it into your game just cause it "fixes" a problem with the game or expands on it to make it better, for sure. Could they do it without saying a word to you, of course.
---
Creation Club is proof of this. Bethesda acknowledged the work of the modding community by giving "us" the ability to get paid for our work using the tools they gave us (The Game) \[Getting their cut of course\]. They did not have to do this, we could of still been on other "websites" offering "mods" and asking for support.
---
I'm not sure that that matters, but idk...  
---
I do know that if I one-shot legendary enemies, or they run away from me (which happens often enough), they will not drop legendary loot. Sometimes I can get them to agro if I equip a less powerful weapon.  
---
I know that it is frustrating when they don't drop good loot, but there are ways to make more likely that they do. 
---
I live for these conspiracy and lore exploring threads you make! Really interesting reads and cool finds. 
---
Likely you need Armorsmith.
---
However, based on your headline I thought it was the bug I was experiencing:
---
I have scrapped and learned countless heavy combat armor mods.
---
They do not even show on my list of mods, which currently contain two mods that I had learned before the last patch:
---
Reinforced and Strengthened
---
Problem is it removes any end game content. Once you can build it there is no need to do that content anymore.  With everyone and their dog able to make legendary weapons mods the value of them is removed. Not as bad as what dupers have done but very similar and would just be stacking problems. 
---
What really bugs me is how the weight limit compounds the problem. I've got a nigh useless bloody Minigun and a bloody Laser Gatling taking up 70 lbs of valuable space because I'm afraid to get rid of them. I'm waiting for Bethesda to "address" these heavy gun/energy classes and hopefully make these two pieces of gear worthwhile but holding on to what might be a future bad ass weapon is stressful with this goofy weight limit.
---
On top of that is the uncertainty of what else to keep/trash because who knows if something like Bloodied is gonna get the nerf hammer like TSE or if my now useless TSE's are gonna somehow get rebuffed later on. Great, more trash clogging up the works of my pitiful stash. 
---
Cmon Bethesda, I've been with you since the first beta. You gotta give me SOMETHIN
---
The only reason I bulk is to sell to venders. Thy won't buy a pile of glass shards but if you put them in a box $$$
---
Yes 
---
You got a tinfoil hat on, I'd bet.
---
Vats overall is broken mess, felt like it did way better in FO4. Explain to me why melee sometimes works in vats, in that your in the face of the enemy swinging your weapon and getting no damage, I even did it in stealth and got the stealth popup saying I did 2x damage no damage or when your shooting an enemy and get the critical hit popup but the healthbar on like scorchbeast looks like you did little to no damage lol. Also, they need to fix melee vats on the scorchbeast queen since you can't target her.
---
Crappy product I got them both and didn‚Äôt realize I could had only spent 20 bucks for this 
---
It goes way deeper than that, actually. It turns out the true mastermind behind the hate for this game is none other than a secret injustice syndicate consisting of Pete Hines, Jeff Kaplan, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Gary Gottfried, J. Jonah Jameson, Preston Garvey, Arthur Morgan and Todd "The Godd" Howard himself
---
&gt;again the first point can apply regardless of npc's existing or not so doesnt matter in the argument.
---
No, the first point is intrinsically tied to the idea of a game world having some sort of worth. Some redeeming quality that motivates the player to save it. The standard one is 'If you don't then all these people will die'. What is the motivator for a campaign without this? What is Fallout 76's 'reason' for you to do anything. For want of a better way to put it, 'How would the story of Fallout 76 be different if the player character simply didn't exist?'
---
&gt;second point you've shifted goalpost have shifted as lore wise your vault dweller has no reason to believe there are survivors. that is why they went into the vault. what with the nuclear war and all. what you are following is the breadcrumbs of information for the problem mentioned in the first point.
---
Literally the entire game is chasing ghosts. If Todd Howard hadn't stood on stage and said 'There are no NPCs' then there is no reason to expect corpses at every location. The Overseer is the most offensive example of this, as everything about that storyline gives the impression that the Overseer is just stalking you and hiding behind a tree when you turn around, all the way up to and following dropping a nuclear bomb. But the game makes damn sure you never find anyone.
---
&gt;3rd point is getting told to get 50 bear asses to fix something for an npc that is just sitting there doing nothing. and the optional dialog of "are you done yet" which to your first point "Why even bother doing any of this?" At least with npcs it makes more since. hell it seems bethesda actually tried to make it plausible for certain areas. like in flatwoods the automated registration because they were already stretched thin due to raider attacks.
---
An NPC provides opportunity for a dialogue tree. A human NPC also throws the whole 'I'm sorry my responses are limited, you must ask the right questions' trope. Human NPCs feed immersion in a way that 'Note Added: Do this thing' or 'Mr Gutsy told me to shoot 25 Scorched' does not. Sure the game could try and make me care about MODUS and Rose, but it would be so much less of a chore if they were actual people. Relatable, flawed, mortal.
---
Hell, more than a few are just basic ESM value changes. I know FO4 *still* has the typo with the Enraged Fog Crawler having 4k ballistic defense when its obviously meant to be 400.
---
Now this is something I can get behind
---
I‚Äôm going to answer directly to each question 
---
1. I can spend my time in multiple threads at once, it‚Äôs not difficult. It‚Äôs clear our feedback is meaningless to Bethesda this far after release and their patches.  I highly discourage anyone from buying this game but you do what you want with your money. It‚Äôs easy to make every post seem like a ‚Äúvent‚Äù session, but these posts should be turning away people who are thinking of buying the game, and rightfully so.
---
2. Yes. Because there are Bethesda shill accounts posting in here trying to make this game seem like it‚Äôs something it really isn‚Äôt (I have screen shots of accounts), and there are some really delusional people defending this game nonsensically. It‚Äôs one thing to say you enjoy the game, but that doesn‚Äôt eliminate the glaring issues this game has had since launch.
---
3. The damage is beyond repair. They‚Äôve been falsely advertising on everything about this game since launch. There‚Äôs no roadmap, and each update has alienated the fan base more and more each time.
---
Below the nest you can find clusters of scorchbeast dung.
---
I think it was intended that Scorchbeasts would actually live in the nests, but, like so much other material intended for this game, it wasn't implemented.
---
I love this idea!
---
just some tough love. This is free as well.
---
Did you get your atoms they promised? I been harping on them on principle since I never got mine so it kinda leaves the ticket on limbo when they don't respond to it fast enough.
---
I love how all the responds don't actually try to address the issues brought up. They create strawman arguments and attack that.
---
 **"Additionally, we are also looking into ways we can make her loot list more ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù in the future."** 
---
Perhaps edit her loot table? I don't know if that's possible though. It seems like a very hard fix so I understand why they don't implement that. It isn't like it's a table with % chance of items and a random selector to pick what you get. Not at all. It's something so grand in scale that it requires "looking into ways" before they can consider the next step - "discussing the possibilities" and eventually "planned for a future update".
---
I'm sorry I really have nothing left for this 'game' than sarcasm. They have given us nothing to suggest they are doing anything.
---
Still not cheap enough...
---
Oh, I have no doubt they COULD.  But given that alligators and crocodiles are not NATIVE to WV.....it seems a bit unlikely.  The only reason the scientist at Nuka-World did it was that was what they had to work with in the reptile house in the 'zoo' portion of the park.
---
Is there a Zoo anywhere on the map?  It seems a stretch for them in WV.  Some OTHER hybrid, that is more native to the area?  Sure.
---
&gt;...are just hoping the Atomic Shop will eventually pull in enough meager income to break even.
---
Haven't they sold like 5 million copies?  I don't think they have to worry about "breaking even" at this point...
---
It would be nice if weightless armor pieces could be worn with hazmat suit for radiated areas.
---
Most of them are wild exaggerations or flat out lies. 
---
Try and have a conversation to get more information about the problems they claim and they get all evasive and try and turn it into an insult war.
---
There‚Äôs a thing called constructive criticism. It‚Äôs were to talk about things that aren‚Äôt working, why they aren‚Äôt, and how it might be corrected.
---
Claiming you got disconnected 43 times in a 6 hour session is lying to cause trouble. 
---
The community people are here often. The question is how much they are listened to by the devs.
---
The best way I have heard it put so far is that Fallout 76 is like reading a Choose-Your-Own Adventure book that someone else has circled a bunch of choices in for you.
---
They're still there, the living ones are now all victims of the scorched virus. It's the whole point of the "scorch vaccine" quest.
---
How much?
---
I've sold them for 4-5c in the past.  I totally agree with you that trading needs to be less time consuming.  You dont want to spend a bunch of playtime trading for 20 screws. 
---
I wish
---
Oh this would be fantastic, they could even put it in the ATOM store! They seem opposed to making money though. Hence the lack of QOL items in the store and passive companions/pets etc that you know people would buy.
---
I bet they thought they could be mods simple so they can keep the bashing posts around.
---
All those mods need to be removed. 
---
Can't beat that price!
---
Hey I've got a question maybe you can answer. Does any vendor sell the shielded lining plan for underarmors? I've a protective BOS officer suit but I cant find the plans to make it shielded. Is that only from turning in technical data?
---
Hahahahaha ^^^^ let the butthurt flow through you 
---
Yes please, we need something like this
---
Or can we just do away with him getting attacked?  It's cute the first time, and a real annoyance anytime after.
---
The paid shill mods need to be removed. And the paid shill accounts posting here.
---
Haha, morris wrecked my sh*t the first time I found him.
---
I like the idea, but for real. Even just less enemies that spawn around him or something
---
xD xD!!
---
You have to do the mayor for a day quest to have them stop attacking you.
---
Is she single?
---
I was about to say "I think I have a clip on my XBox" and realized you solved that problem for me already.
---
https://xboxclips.com/Ruleryak/d2dd428b-d85a-460b-b681-5eb490ba534a

Found it on that site, didn't know that was a thing!  I got outside the map by hitting a thing.

Rifle Gaming needs to nuke the lake by Thunder Mountain
---
Oh please. 
---
You're a breath of fresh air, my friend :D
---
I have had the melee bug where I do no damage but with rifles I never have problems unless it's a two shot weapon. 
---
Thanks Ladydevann! You're awesome! I said that already, right? Well, you are!!! =]
---
Because if I'm in pacifist mode and build structures around your AFK character then you can't do anything about it.
---
But that's my favorite mini game, find Phoenix. Oh where oh where is Phoenix at today, in the corner or behind his shop? Walking to the coffee shop? Oh where oh where is Phoenix at today, oh there he is in the fucking wall. -_-
---
Yeah I completely forgot about west Virginia's native sloth population
---
Crossbow has the same issue as the .50 cal, no standard receiver to un-prime.
---
It subsequently, I could really use some help with that cargo-bot and with the silo. Then I will nuke Whitesprings myself.
---
I don't propose to know, literally, anything. I quietly stated my observations, and the logical suppositions that followed. Not sure what your problem is. Can we stop?
---
Not really unreasonable.  You kind of admitted to receiving duped goods, and dupers not only screwed with the servers, economy, but people's enjoyment of the game.  
---
It's actually a rational thought process to vent on someone perpetuating an issue like this.
---
And what happened to your old reddit account? Because this one is only a couple months old and if it is an alternate account you use. Your own post kind of supports my statement.  And given how petty people can be I really do not doubt people have an army of bots accounts that do nothing but down vote comments they don't like. Because it seems like any post no matter how stupid against FO76 gets several upvotes even when you are like 40 replies into a conversation. And any post for FO76 or Bethesda gets several down votes. Even just asking for proof of a bug gets down voted to hell in a hand basket.  Particularly after that big flare up of bullshit ban complaints that got up voted to hell. And any time you asked for any proof of unfair bans you get down voted and those people saying it happening declaring they don't have to show proof. 
---
BOS is not the horrible game everyone seems to make it out to be. The game marks the clear design transition from turn-based over-head views to where they went in Fallout 3. I will not deny they made some weird/poor designs choices in the game though.
---
The Church Of Murgle can forgive you your transgressions.
---
If you are PC are your settings to low? On my laptop I have to run minimum settings and nothing looks good just smudges.
---
Thank you.
---
Yes, go see the "alcoves" and tell us what you think! I mean, it could be nothing, but it sure looks like something, at least to me. =]]]
---
I've not had any issue getting caps from stashes.  I don't have any of the stash perks. 
---
The 3 star glowing legendary mirelurk queen in the Heart of the swamp quest...nope.
---
It's supposedly a level 50 enemy...but they should slap a level 100 tag on it cuz that shit is like an endgame fight. Used about 15 stimpacks and then she regained all health...I ran away. Not even worth it. 
---
Strange 
---
Regretfully, this was indeed the only loot on this ghoul. It was the first time I‚Äôve ever experienced a Legendary enemy not dropping a legendary item.
---
I agree on the super mutants,but I don't find the mole miners to be too bulletspongy. My level 20ish alt can take a glowing miner with 4 well placed shotgun blasts to the face.
---
My favorite time was when I found him on that tall walkway all the way over by the freaking High School

I paid $29.99 + a Costco membership for tricenntial edition.
---
She did look down on the orphans her mother took in.  And they were jealous of her and felt she got all the best stuff because she was Shannon's daughter.
---
I think she BECAME more interested in power BECAUSE of that 'living in mom's shadow' rebellion.  She was arrogant, but in many ways, she had the right to be....she WAS very skilled, and had demonstrated it before she started handing info to the Raiders.
---
And she DID see betrayal by the Raiders coming.....she expected it from the Boss, not Brody, and even said so in one of her journal entries, and that if it happened, she'd just have to eliminate him and take over that way.  Which is one of the reasons I think she had feelings for Brody.  He was the 'boy next door' after all.  Now, I'm not saying she was 'in love', but she definitely had feelings, or she would have expected Brody to be the tool to take her out, since he was usually the one they sent to work with her.

Hunting camps always have a ton of bones
---
&gt; Yesterday's lackluster "Inside the Vault" is what really got me thinking about this.
---
* Players demand more transparency. 
---
* Bethsedsa gives more transparency. 
---
* Players complain it isn't enough and therefore they don't care. 
---
And the circle is complete. 
---
Make a screen Shot pls 
---
If you are experiencing a lot of bugs/glitches you may have an unstable mem OC (if on pc)... or the server may be getting unstable...   
---
I'm pretty sure that I have kneecapped them in the past, but not sure... take me to your server and we can test it out!
---
Heh, you're probably right. Though I think the reason for microtransactions, DLC sales and other stuff, is to help offset the continuing budgetary needs that accompany an online-only game. You know, servers and stability, continued development, new content.
---
Wait, I think we came full-circle, and I just answered the original question on why they have literally none of that in-game, as we speak. 
---
They made the budget back on the 5m copies sold. They're not putting any more "unnecessary" expenditures into the game. Therefore, we're not getting stability, continued development or new content. Huh.
---
German Gamestop btw ;)
---
LOL. You'll get used to it. I go find him and help him, he'll deal with you anywhere.
---
One time I found him fighting a feral ghoul near that river... he is a real bad ass. He should recruit again for the brotherhood and lead his new army in every upcoming battle! 
---
The Cranberry Bog workshop seems to always have either a behemoth or a wendingo guarding it. I've killed 6-7 epic behemoths in the past couple days.
---
I was just joking..
---
there should only be 1 warlord per group or area. Name the rest brutes, grunts etc.  High Level names should be reserved for Legendary mobs. To me a WAR-LORD should make me say oh fuck there's a boss level mob.
---
I killed a Lvl 6? Mythical DeathClaw once and it had level 5 stuff on it, noting special about it but the name which was horribly misused.
---
I have that one as well. No idea where I picked it up. I was wondering if it was part of the Clown Costume I needed to wear to get the Wendingo achievement.
---
Bro I've got 500+ hours into this game, I ain't getting used to it lol
---
I 100% agree
---
It could be that, yes. But I don't know. Those "alcoves" seem quite suspicious to me. But, yes, it could definitely be cut content (or stuff for future content, hopefully).
---
The radium riffle has definetly seen some sort of nerf
---
B4 patch a maxed out rad riffle bullet damage was alway 1-2 below a maxed out combat riffle
---
B4 patch I was getting 71 bullet damage 15 rad damage n 72 damage on combat riffle
---
Now I'm getting 34 bullet damage n 15 rad damage 
---
N my combat riffle is still the same
---
So in theory the rad riffle has sufferd a total of 50%Nerf to bullet damage
---
B4 u ask the weopons I used to check this are non legendary weopons and at their max lvl with all riffleman perks on
---
At mo my quad rad riffle now gathers dust in my stash as
---
Bethesda have made it completely USELESS
---
Well if you ever played SC, the Overmind was a hive mind. Yet he created the cerebrates to take some of the load off and control parts of the swarm to accomplish goals. Once infested you lose yourself to the cause. It could easily be seen that the leaders are like these cerebrates.
---
&gt; They copy pasted and deleted all the complex systems that could be intimidating to lowest common denominator players.
---
So just the unintuitive mod card system with a bit of a learning curve to it then? 'Cause the actual game is as piss easy as this one but doesn't require you to be melee or have a very specific build to be strong.
---
I mean, for real,right? This guy skips work more than I do!
---
Ill friend you regardless.
---
Yeah, me and my squad are looking forward to Anthem. Even if it flops aswell atleast the combat was an absolute blast in the demo. 
---
 You are shooting at trash. ;) Feel free but its dumb.
---
So your not saying that it was aliens...but it was aliens...is what I am taking away here :)
---
No the clown comes with a hat
---
Dude Im on PC, but feel your pain. 
---
I usually server hop til I get one
---
&gt; I remember having to spend all my ammo and chems trying to kill a the Deathclaw family in NV.
---
I think simply having them travel in small packs would be enough of a game changer, especially if they adjusted the AI a bit. Imagine if they hunted like velociraptors. Instead of all of them just face tanking you, the alpha of the pack would come at you head on while the other 2-3 would try to flank you.
---
Yeah ignore it. There's some salty twats that don't want you playing the game or having fun.
---
It‚Äôs all over but the crying, and EVERYONE is crying with me
---
Ask ur mom.....lol nah but seriously tho go for molerats and beavers for their teeth
---
Bro, if this is full transparency, the literal only thing they're working on this week is reducing the number of sonic booms the SB's squirt out - since that's all they talked about in-depth. And if that's the case, it just proves my thoughts exactly. You think it takes an entire, avid team to tone down the sonic blast frequency?
---
Yeah alot of things have misleading names
---
Brilliant. 
---
Genius.
---
Sorry I can't right now but you can go see it for yourself around Relay Tower EL-B1-02
---
Fallout 1 and 2 also have their fair share of bugs. Stuff that just doesn't work or allow quests to be completed. Less than the modern games, sure, but they're also not nearly as complex as the modern games. They aren't perfect.
---
I hopped for 2 hours last night and only fissure prime was nuked and zero whitesprings nukes. FeelsBadMan.
---
That's absolutely a possibility.  However, I think that with the right drop rates and tweaks to the affixes themselves, plus the addition of new ones periodically, what you'll see more of is situational weapons.  It should designed such that it's very hard to make a weapon that is OP for every situation; the value of these weapons would be found in the synergy of the mods and the situations they're used for.
---
I also don't think that getting 'the ultimate weapon' is the endgame for the overwhelming majority of players.  It's desirable, of course, but the real endgame should come *after* acquiring top tier gear. That's when we'll need more boss fights, more things to do in nuke zones, etc.
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.  You can buy nuke cards for caps from other players.
---
Nuke silo runs give good XP too.  And if you get lost, or just feel like exploring the place, the robots respawn every minute or two for even more XP.
---
The carnivore mutation is supposed to allow you to eat spoiled meat without disease risk, much in the same way the herbivore mutation allows you to eat spoiled fruit or vegetables. 
---
Doubt marathoner works considering theres a perk for sprinting/less fusion core drain in the strength tree
---
The scorched with guns will use cover if it's available.
---
ok.  Fair enough.  With that logic, thats like saying (and Ill admit I am taking low hanging fruit on this) 
---
Hitler was great, he united a nation, boosted his economy but it was just that one instance where he started killing jews. 
---
Fuck Wendigos. That's my contribution.
---
Very. My experiences with bugs and issues have been almost non existent compared to what seems to be the majority experience. Honestly I would have preferred to win the actual lotto but I guess a game play lotto is good enough. 
---
I went to that tree and there was an explosives crate, a corpse, and a safe.  There was a little bit of water surrounding the tree but no hatch underneath the water.
---
Get one!!
---
This is a weird bug. I'd try it out with my TS Tesla rifle, except it used 2,300 fusion cores with one blast, and then was somehow deleted during the week I didn't play after rage-quitting.
---
You haven‚Äôt o served anything though.
---
Your just repeating what other people have said before you.
---
You have literally zero observations about what‚Äôs going on at Bethesda and the team
---
Looks like shitty rushed asset creation designed to be looked at from distances then exposed up close.
---
The funny part is I don't even think you're joking even if you don't realize it
---
Interesting.  Sounds like maybe someone was confusing the Russian 7.62x39, which is an intermediate powered round like 5.56, with American 7.62x51, a high powered battle rifle round.  
---
It sti drains AP, though, right?
---
How about Stash Blueprints? 
---
I don‚Äôt know the technical details but I assume a person‚Äôs stash is like a tiny text file list. It is backed up on Bethesda‚Äôs servers. Maybe also the character data and equipment. Perhaps saved hourly and on exiting and entering the game. Simple protection just in case. 
---
It could also be done by the player, just as we now save a blueprint. It can only be loaded if the stash is zero. Obviously it would have to be set up so people can‚Äôt use it for things like duping. But these stash collections are the results of carefully curated items spanning weeks and months of work, or even hundreds of hours. We need a better guarantee than just the shoulder shrug I got via email. 
---
Please Bethesda, make this a high priority fix!
---
Prettty sure they pass around feedback like a shitty 3rd world brothel passes around gonorrhea at this point.
---
Challey is best moo-moo.
---
It would be great to see a more obvious UI based feedback for enemy weaknesses and success in attacking them. VATS doesn't seem to have an option that says "hit the robot in the legs" and yet my experience is that shooting a high level (50+) robot in the legs is MUCH more efficient than shooting it in the "head."
---
I suspect that these monsters have intentional weaknesses as a design feature that makes them easier to kill, but the only guidance the game gives us is that hitting limbs can cripple.
---
With the difficulty in securing ammunition, it would be great if I could learn some in-game passive ability to help players see (literally see) that enemies have specific weaknesses and guide us to exploit them. The game just doesn't have the kind of communication infrastructure it needs for that information to reach players via word of mouth.
---
If player retention was that low Skyrim wouldnt be seen as one of the best games ever made.
---
yup you guys did miss the joke
---
Happy to help! If you do, please let me know what you think. Even if you en up not liking it, I'd be really glad to hear your opinion about it. 
---
Maybe I missed some terminal entries but the orphans didn't come of as jealous. They seemed to sense Olivia didn't care for them too much or at least didn't appreciate her arrogance and cavalier attitude. And Olivia probably didn't see Brody's betrayal because she thought so little of him. 
---
Thanks! Maybe plant that lil bug as best you can lol really though it‚Äôs cool seeing you Bethesda people on here and paying attention. I just wanna say thank you cuz I see a lot of responses coming from you guys, its gotta get old sorting through all the complaints to find some constructive criticism 
---
Skyrim was released before consoles had mods. And was still immensely popular and selling like crazy.
---
This reminds me of a time where I heard random screaming/wailing.. I think I was somewhere in the forest, not sure where exactly. 
---
I couldn't pin point it, and never discovered the source but it sounded like a woman screaming.  Has anyone had a similar experience?  So strange..
---
I've been hoarding my atoms as is... not buying anything with them till they start fixing the game.
---
because you can like a game and still be annoyed its not living up to its potential 
---
You can decline an offer and it let's you use a statement saying "to much" or "I dont want it". Theres a few others but I dont remember. 
---
There is some variation in looks at least. The ones up by Top of the World are often dressed in skiing outfits for example.
---
One shotting legendaries seems to make them drop less also.
---
ah, that might explain a lot. Thank you
---
I think the instigating effect is broken. I have a instigating war drum with my damage at 220. The first shot takes a small portion of their health off instead of a one shot kill. 
---
honestly 90% of the first people I played with are gone but the next 90% are almost all there which has been my thoughts / experience on most mmo games
---
I am getting a new card, but I‚Äôve seen the camo suit outfit and that as ugly as it is to me, most definitely camo.   I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my settings but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking here.  :) 
---
Well you could both set matching prices to minimize losses. That way you both break even or one person just takes the item and you still get the caps.
---
Bethesda really missed out on the implementation of Hillbilly moonshiner horror villain / berserker type enemies.
---
Got that too. Just never put them on.
---
Now, the Skull mask I got at the Fright Store, that I wear a lot.
---
Bruh I came in here expecting a great reason for u quitting..I am disappoint 
---
Also please make sure you note that some players about level 50 can look at a vendor and see plans other players cannot. Prime example would be when my friend and I wanted the Electric Chair plan we had to have a third party buy it for us since neither of us could see it on the vendor.
---
How about making scorched more like the group it took over.  There are already scorched responders.  That would fit your adding humans note.
---
Quality post here.
---
&gt; Buff damage not just hit points also Vary types of damage! More fire, poison, explosive
---
Along that same line, give them more weaknesses in order to encourage strategy. Right now the answer to everything is "throw more bullets at it", when they could tweak things a bit. For example, drastically increase the ballistic DR for deathclaws, but make them extremely weak to fire or energy damage. They'd have to buff those weapons to make them viable in the first place, but it would be a nice change of pace.
---
No birds lore would be an easy creepy solution.
---
so was i ;)
---
In VATS, I can fire a full 25-round clip from an automatic assault rifle before I run out of AP. However, I run out of AP after only about 6 rounds from a 10mm submachine gun. I'm not sure if this is intentional, but it doesn't seem right.
---
Do you actually know how these work? These updates are not just what they are working on this week. It is a continual release of information that informs you of their ideas and plans on what they are working on and plan to work on to improve the game. 
---
A non exhaustive list of things they are working on are:
---
eliminating any remaining dupping exploits, bug fixes, server stability upgrades, heavy weapon/explosive weapon damage and ammo weight. Looking into addressing repair costs for non power armor to make it more viable. Looking at durability costs of energy weapons.  Over hauling events to make them more enticing for people to participate in. Building and balancing a PvP focused game mode. Testing the abiltiy to increase stash size when server stability increases. Over hauling SBQ loot to make her better, altering the scream to make it less spammy.
---
These are all things they are working on for the next or future updates to improve the game based on player feed back.  Each inside the vault is simply adding to the over all information they are giving out.
---
And that's not even mentioning, what I assume will be a damage buff for the SB's weapon, to make up for the less frequency of the attacks - that they did *not* mention. 
---
Granted, that's not fair of me to assume, but in the current state, I have trouble giving them the benefit of the doubt.
---
Except server-hop. Or fast travel.
---
somewhere, there's a player looking at his buddy and saying, "hold my beer"
---
Because you are both below Lvl 50, correct?
---
:( So often the problem with distance buying product photo are usually exagerated or down right lies. Why we all use amazon for the *no questions asked* within reason return and refund policy.
---
I love this sub..it never ceases to amaze me 
---
I had this happen, I had to remove all structures that were near the turrets or under them, after scrapping 1/4 of my camp they finally appeared 
---
They could've had an area that was like the dark zone in Division. Only better implemented. Say like a ground zero or glowing sea like fallout 4 had where players accept to go in, get loot but could run into other players that can freely kill them and take their junk. &gt;_&gt; Or just have private servers already. &lt;_&lt;
---
I'm sorry I don't understand your point
---
Player retention is that low relatively for all games. Skyrim is exceptional with 100 and 50 avg and median play times.
---
https://steamspy.com/app/72850
---
20 mil copies on steam and only 90,000 all time peak concurrence. Typical avg players are more like 15K.
---
People just dont play their games.
---
People do give constructive criticism. Every post talking about people leaving give tons of info on why they're leaving
---
Serendipity. It appears to be a little bugged seeing how other people triggering it would appear on nearby players screen. And sometimes it doesn‚Äôt go away either, very annoying.
---
When will the census violence end?
---
I think this should be a standard feature. At this point I'm not willing to part with anything for caps and would be pissed if someone bought a weapon of mine for caps and didn't reciprocate sale on the item I was trying to trade for. 
---
Serendpity: a luck peek that means you dodged a few bullets
---
&gt;"lol Bugthesda is shit, there's one developer working on this game, 76 is bound to fail"
---
&gt;And if you think thanking someone in a ~customer service position~ for doing their job and putting up with all the shit that goes with it is a 'circle jerk'
---
it is. both are just as useful, which is to say not at all.
---
&gt;I'm not gonna touch your implied condoning of rumours, because it's too silly for me to bother. 
---
"condoning rumors" is something everyone does. forums, media outlets. it's kind of a non-issue you're complaining about. Fo76 was born in it, when Kotaku I think leaked a BR Fallout, which was nothing but a rumor at that point.
---
Tip I heard was try to collect, walk away 50 tft or so then come back and you can search and the caps come back
---
It's worked for me so far.
---
How much of this is down to pressure from ZenMax?
---
I want Opossum sized hermit crabs (which again make no sense in West Virginia)
---
Absolute best moo-moo.
---
1) then the motivator is "If you don't, you will die." You are cut off from the vault there is no going back, either stop the scorched or you (and by extension everyone else in the vault) are waiting for death. The other motivaor is to stop this plague before it spreads which leads into
---
2) If you are follow the question you are chasing ghost in so far as you are looking for a way to stop the scorched and those ghosts have the information to do so or at least far more than you have. which leads into
---
3) Doing a course run for a mister gutsy to get what you need to launch a nuke to end the scorched. if you really want to nitpick difference you could argue that a lack of NPCs makes you take on the role of npc yourself. you dont have to go chase down 10 wolves to convince generic leader #3 to allow you access. you have to gather and setup the stuff to gain access yourself. (think mistress of mysteries questline)
---
though I do think we are arguing past each other. my argument isnt that npcs are bad or no npcs is good, but that no npcs isnt bad and the npcs isnt automatically better.
---
I remember going to Keri aboard the Nexus the first time and being confused because I thought she was the doctor. Then I noticed every Asari had the same face. Sometimes the color change helped hide it more, but I really didn't understand why they did that.
---
Maybe it's just me, but after hearing everyone talk up the handmades, I finally built one after getting the plans, and my only thought was "this is it?" I honestly don't get what the big deal is. It seems like a pretty weak weapon, to be honest. I'm not trying to hate on it or anything; maybe I was just missing the plans for some really killer mods or something. But as it was, it just didn't seem very special to me.
---
I deleted my old account...because I wanted a fresh new one. You seem to be one of the petty ones that assumes any negative criticism of a game is from a sus army of fake news rather than a disgruntled owner of a shitty game.
---
I personally haven't played the game since launch, however I browse this subreddit occasionally to enjoy the shit show. I have no doubt there are still bugs, I just read a polygon article saying that patch 5 reopened a dupe bug that was previously patched. Can I confirm that bug? No, but I believe it COULD have happened. Regardless, common criticisms of lackluster clarity, little to no content being released, and no game plan is valid. More valid than any bug claim, in my opinion. 
---
Instead of viewing all FO76 criticism as fake, maybe realize that people are genuinely disappointed with the state of the game, and maybe they are experiencing bugs that you haven't. Bugs impact people sporadically, and not everyone has recorded proof of it. Enjoy the game if you enjoy it, but listen to other people too. Or at least ignore them without calling out stupid bullshit,
---
Okay, I think I've got it. From everything I'm reading in here so far, the primary cause of the outrage is Bethesda's apparent lack of attention to gamer feedback. I totally get that. I also think I can explain it.

---
I made a separate post out of it, because it's a very long dissertation and technically is a separate subject from this thread, but I think it's entirely possible that Bethesda only realized their error in December/January, and may be genuinely trying to make up for it now by getting feedback (in a structured fashion), not just paying lip service.
---
You know what I see here? Little Hitlers who want to control what other people think and say.
---
I understand and applaud those who take their time to leave genuine feedback. However, a lot of it seems hyperbolic. Like the latest f2p accusation and p2w nonsense. It just seems like there are so many people willing to troll the game.
---
I often got disconnected 6 times in a spam of 20 minutes. then the game crashed. I also have personal experience with vanishing items.
---
so what if there are shitposts? the game is so bad it probably happened to *someone*.
---
It is en masse, not "in mass"
---
I'm sorry how the fuck does that relate? 
---
The dross toss doesn't give mr fuzzy tokens anymore. I know it's not hugely important just figure I should add it.
---
Yeah, like I can make an X-01 suit from scratch, but I can‚Äôt make a derelict fridge run. Sure. 
---
To be perfectly honest i keep playing because i like the pve. the end game is garbage and with them adding a pvp mode i could care less. i guess i just don't really have a good reason anymore. not saying i am quitting but even if they add vaults i am a lone player and so i probably won't be able to do them.
---
Fuck me, that'd be a terrifying addition to Scorched Earth.
---
Agree to disagree, then. And here I thought the purpose of Inside the Vault, was to give us a transparent glimpse into the goings-on and exciting new additions and happenings coming up in the Wasteland! 
---
I stated this last one was lackluster, because instead of *any* of that, instead of detailing *any* awesome stuff coming up, they said, "We are nerfing the SB Sonic Attack." and then pushed the Atomic Store. Is that inaccurate, in your opinion? Because in mine, that would seem to be pretty lackluster.
---
Both of those are present, the half wall is a variant and the half stairs are the regular wood ones. 
---
I appreciate it! 
---
It's not an analogy. It's what's happening right now. To your original point, it's an apples to apples comparison. Maybe it's a Fuji Apple compared to a Washington Apple, but they're still apples.
---
The Mistress of Mysteries is hands down my favorite part of the game. From the &gt;!Hidden Door in the Bookcase and the Survival Pod elevators!&lt; to the actual quests. And after getting their outfit I immediately regretted rolling my Male Fallout character instead of my Female. 
---
Your front page seems to be outdated 
---
Flash Sale on Playstation Store for the same price. 
---
F2P already got debunked, and one of the events was P2W. People aren't trolling, they're giving criticism and calling out Bethesda. Also this isn't a PSA
---
There's actually a quest line that shows/tells  what happened to the sentient ghouls in the F76.
---
Negative. I was at the time level 130something and he was almost 200.

You can choose to do you own thing. the story is one of those choices. or do you consider things like FFXIV and WoW not to be rpgs because their stories are set and you cant change it?
---
I have seen posts of people on this reddit acting as anything from raiders to raid bosses to brotherhood of steel members. you seem to think that because you cant make a new canon storyline you cant do anything.
---
My camp is on the west side of vault 76 and there is a screamer in my woods.

You still totally failed to see the irony and took my daft comment seriously, so still...

I'd love to see the geckos from NV make a return. The way they ran always made me giggle, and they had some interesting variety based on their level and where they spawned. Give us a different gecko type for each region.
---
Forest: regular geckos
---
Toxic Valley: some sort of toxic gecko that spits acid or has a plague walker type poison aura that causes DoT if they get too close. 
---
Savage Divide: I don't know, maybe some sort of geckos with tougher skin. Basically mini deathclaws that attack in packs.
---
Ash Heap: Fire geckos that spit toxic flame goo at you similar to anglers.
---
Mire: Geckos with chameleon powers that stay cloaked when they're not moving, and don't show up on your radar as threats until the uncloack and attack you.
---
Cranberry Bog: Geckos that spit something sticky at you and causes you to be stuck in place for 10 seconds.
---
I've been told that black bears don't act like Grizzlies when it comes to the mommas and their cubs.
---
I wouldn't want to test this though. 
---
I do fight Scorched to much, but I don't get SM nearly enough... nor anything else... so I really really should be the one asking for an improvement.
---
Power Cores should be harder to get. 
---
OK I am gonna teach you a trick. I don't like mentioning it because Beth may see and patch it. But there is a way to prevent some plants from spoiling. Plant them at your camp. let them produce a harvest. harvest them. then go into workshop mode and scrap your plants. plant the ones you harvest. scrapped plants don't spoil and stay in your stash. essentially you can build an unlimited supply of plants that don't spoil. Herbivore's wet dream. Enjoy!
---
That's basically how Power Armor is for me though, and I don't have too many armor perks.  Mostly Lv 50 Vanguard Combat Armor.  I don't use PA outside of nuke zones, overencumbrance, or leaping from high places.
---
Yeah get to see all the crazy people come out!
---
&gt; 1) then the motivator is "If you don't, you will die."
---
Which doesn't fit very well with the 'If I wasn't here what difference would it make?'. Personal survival as the centrepiece for a story doesn't work.
---
Which leads into
---
&gt;The other motivaor is to stop this plague before it spreads
---
Spreads where? Who are we saving by stopping it spreading?
---
And:
---
&gt;If you are follow the question you are chasing ghost in so far as you are looking for a way to stop the scorched and those ghosts have the information to do so or at least far more than you have. which leads into
---
Stop them from doing what? Killing you?
---
&gt; Doing a course run for a mister gutsy to get what you need to launch a nuke to end the scorched. if you really want to nitpick difference you could argue that a lack of NPCs makes you take on the role of npc yourself. you dont have to go chase down 10 wolves to convince generic leader #3 to allow you access. you have to gather and setup the stuff to gain access yourself. (think mistress of mysteries questline)
---
And it all comes back to the same thing. We need to do these things to stop the Scorched...because...there is some other person somewhere beyond Appalachia that we have no interaction with and may (like everyone else locally) be dead?
---
Stop the Scorched to save...who...from...what? Save dead people from being infected? Save imaginary people from dying?
---
I wouldn't change a thing.
---
Power doesn't come with Legendary effects you can easily be a beast with the right combo of armor sadly its still RNG so it takes awhile to get everything
---
Very entertaining! 
---
It's madness I know!
---
You stole my comment, profligate!
---
 The trash that attacks you and bites your legs is hard to hit with a bullet. Not surprising they are small and fast.
---
 Hit them with something, anything and they go down easily.
---
I am not even playing the game anymore. Occasionally I take a look of how things are going but obviously they aren‚Äôt going well.
---
Talk to me when I don‚Äôt ha e to waste 1/3 of each gaming session gathering mats and slow walking location to location only to die and lose everything over and over again.
---
Single most horrid game design I‚Äôve ever seen and the one about to make me walk away.
---
Fucking wasting my time and giving me zero enjoyment. 
---
Oh well, saw the nuke and just one yellow dot, thought I'd help the guy out, lesson learned. There is really no point tackling the SBQ unless there is a decent sized team of higher level players.
---
Stop crying about downvotes
---
While I think your right and this is the answer, it could still be related, the SB's picked the spots with the faces for some reason.  In his pictures of the clusters it does seem like the SB's went out of their way to make sure the faces were still exposed.  They come from underground, and so do the faces, so maybe they are attracted to them, either just simply because its like their old home underground, or because they are connected to the faces at a deeper level.
---
I suppose at a certain point most players wouldn't care much about caps, so I do understand your dilemma. There should definitely be more integrated features for p2p trading. I honestly dont really trade with others much unless I'm looking for ammo but even then I haven't had to do that in a long time.
---
Love this post :)
---
Mutts &amp; Rad Roaches: why don't they show up to eat corpses and kill AFK players whom linger behind or don't heal up after the fight? I'm not sure how random events work. Currently they are just a free source of food that shows up along the road with no player earning their keep.  
---
Wolves: these work well to keep lower level players from sneaking into higher level areas without a fight.
---
Fantastic info, thanks.
---
Will submit, post and credit 
---
Is that a creature in the game?
---
*lack
---
sorry your own (and your fellow vault dwellers) survival is not as grand a rpg goal as saving the world.
---
That's gold, but I don't think it beats 
---
[Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crN1LnSNMr8)*, if it ain't my old friend from Goodsprings!*
---
&gt; Pocketed and Deep Pocketed mod plans also AWOL.
---
Holy shit, I thought I was just missing a vendor. I can't find deep pocketed leather or metal plans anywhere, and I swear I've hit every vendor in the game.
---
When we stop counting. :(
---
It is, I got the mask plan today.
---
You can drop a spare power armor frame when he's behind his counter to block him from wandering all over creation.  There's almost always a spare frame in the downstairs of the transit hub behind the masterlocked door.  You'll still have to clear the 4-5 protectrons you spawned when you entered the area, but at least no one will have to go searching all over the place for him.
---
So now it's not tasting like piss, it's just cold. You can't even sustain a consistent analogy. And it was a bad analogy in the first place because you're comparing two things that are not at all similar in terms of product or production. 
---
But hey, maybe you were given the wrong soup, and the cold one had been sitting around after the order was cancelled. I'm sure you don't really care to think about alternative explanations for your bad examples, but that was an easy one.
---
Btw, nice job post tracking me and making a worthless strawman 
---
argument in my other thread. You definitely left me with the impression that you're very bad at argumentation and very good at misrepresentation. A sign of weakness.
---
Now I'm gonna block yer. Have fun with your assumptions. ;)
---
They are seriously missing a goldmine with the CAMP system. All they need to do is start pumping out free base versions of things such as half walls/roofs/stairs, and then add fancy premium versions to the Atom shop. And also cut their prices by like half.
---
Shorten the 4x camp boundary exception limit, so we can place our camps closer to others.
---
After level 50, the CAMP system became the most fun for me, and I have considered buying premium items more than once. The high prices deter me from buying atoms, and instead just grinding them out.
---
If $10 bought me a pack that included like 20 things, I would totally buy that, instead. 
---
even with ammo there's glaring features missing. You should be able to buy ammo for less than 1 cap per round. I'm not buying 5 mm for a cap per. Seriously, just go back to fallout 1/2's trade menu format but add a cap feature. This way you can trade multiple items for multiple items and either party can throw caps on top
---
He does, just the 10,000 caps cost 
---
&gt; And here I thought the purpose of Inside the Vault, was to give us a transparent glimpse into the goings-on and exciting new additions and happenings coming up in the Wasteland! 
---
Because that is what they are doing. 
---
&gt; I stated this last one was lackluster, because instead of any of that, instead of detailing any awesome stuff coming up, 
---
Because they announced they were working on it already. If it won't be ready for the next patch they aren't going to tell people yet.  When they know what will be ready for the next patch they will announce it. Until they telling people it will be there and not being able to deliver on it in time will only further annoy people.
---
&gt; Agree to disagree,
---
Just because you conveniently forgot how news updates work doesn't mean you can pull that card out.  This isn't I think Batman is the best super hero while you are over there supporting Iron man. 
---
Thank you. Probably not the only one, I'm a horrible typer (typist?).
---
I'd like to assume that, but I'm not sure of heard of anyone finding that particular plan in the wild.  I did find Small Letters in the wild, though, in one of the substations.
---
If you want them back. it's fairly easy. start a new character. do the quests. get them back and use a friend to pass them to your main character
---
I don‚Äôt give them credit for that, I think it‚Äôs pretty pathetic they had to use an outdated engine and showtie a mediocre multiplayer netcode to it and this is the best they got. 
---
Bless this post. 
---
Yes, this is actually a thing. 
---
&gt; In the United States alone, there are 60 million to 100 million free-ranging, unowned cats. These are non-native predators that, even using conservative estimates, kill 1.3‚Äì4 billion birds and 6.3‚Äì22.3 billion mammals each year in the U.S. alone (Loss et al. 2013, Nature Communications).

---
I believe their problem might be that you trespassed and mutilated someone's belongings that were not quite fit enough to make for a decent meal. I'd be rather pissed too if my team mate had his head literally in the gutter under a bridge while I fought off rabid dogs.
---
Oh shit that's steep
---
You mean like how people express they like the game, only to get attacked by game badgers?
---
And now that they are getting some if their own medicine back they can‚Äôt handle it. 
---
That‚Äôs all that‚Äôs happening. 
---
Also Hitler? Really? You‚Äôre that lame?
---
Why? Why play that way?
---
First off that is meant to be a pvp aspect if the game. If you hold it then you have to expect some company. When someone showed up you let them grief you. Even if your shite at pvp you could have fought back, but you didn‚Äôt. You could also just go do something else.
---
You also carry a bunch if junk in you for some reason. Junk that you are unwilling to lose. I would suggest that you store your more valuable junk and only keep junk you are willing to lose on your player. 
---
It is not the game‚Äôs fault that you were killed. Ultimately it was your fault and your decision making. The bugs suck. But in my opinion and other player‚Äôs opinion the bugs are not that bad.
---
I almost finished the DMV with a character last night and was disconnected right before a checkpoint. It was about an hour of playtime that I lost. It is annoying but I knew that was a possibility. That doesn‚Äôt make the game unplayable, because 99% of my playing experience is fine and bug free.
---
There's something a little familiar about one of the characters in it...
---
You were probably close to Alpine River Cabins.  They are "haunted", and it's pretty freaky to experience, at first.
---
So it is too late for some plans after 50? That's a bummer.
---
Someone make one of these except for the whiteknights that blindly defend the "feelings" of megacorporations that scam people. 
---
Even a setting of medium on textures (which I have to use; gtx970) can really effect how some of that kind of stuff looks. For instance I got a drop of the advertising posters so I put a few up. Most look okay but the Nuka Cola ones look horrible and jaggy, and I'm fairly certain it's due to my card/settings.
---
&gt;Btw, nice job post tracking me
---
Check this guy out he thinks making posts means people who read them must be tracking him.
---
I actually saw you there with some other guy, small world.
---
Both of those perks affect the yield you get from consuming food and drink, not the rate at which your hunger and thirst depletes.  All Night Long and Happy Camper affect hunger/thirst deterioration.
---
Hmm, the post said there " should" be an unmarked lake to the north of there, but not sure how far. I haven't gotten a chance to run down there at all 
---
Yes! I remember there was like a weird shaking and things moving around in the cabins. Is the screaming connected to the haunting? 
---
XD Especially if you move little by little. Bizz. Buzz. Bizz. Buzz.
---
Yay! 
---
I never have that problem. I do a lot of killing in vats with fast moving targets and I hit them a lot.  Not all the time with fast moving guys but ghouls and scorched. All the time. 
---
That would be fine. I just mentioned the mic because it seems like it would make the game more realistic and I wouldn't have to rely on emotes to communicate. It doesn't matter who takes the lead, I'm just tired of the crippling loneliness that comes with playing solo. 
---
Besides, all of my quests at the moment are outside of the forest region. Since I'm only level 12 I can't go into other regions without it being insanely difficult to survive. 
---
I've had my chameleon armor break. The effect still works with out the protection.
---
The way they worded it was there were 5 trees surrounding the body of water, and a tree in the middle of the body of water, then directly north of the tree is the hatch under the water.
---
 Me too. My present char was built to be a plan whore. He is level 53 now and retired from plan hunting. 
---
 He knows Phoenix very well and we have been dealing with him across two chars now. I roll into Watoga, this one ain't the Major like my first, but its just fun to get him to deal. Getting to him before they do, allows me to at least see what he's got, so a sneaky approach can save some work. But finding him and helping him with his problem is just fun. Did you know there are random Legendary Prtectrons and you can get one of them sometimes.
---
 Now at level 13 when he first arrived it was a bit more difficult but still quite possible. ;)
---
Underrated comment.
---
You forgot Cave Crickets.  One of the more difficult to kill insects in the game.
---
most griefers have marsupial  .....     I built myself one and realized it wasnt impenetrable...   scorchbeats can still spawn thier acid through the concrete foundations as a side note
---
Healing Factor mutation.  I barely use stimpaks anymore.
---
Well in that case given my 2:1 honours degree in applied computer science I feel more than qualified to say maybe this week they're too busy working on the fixes to get all the developers to write out what balance changes and bug fixes they are currently working on so that their weekly letter is fleshed out enough to appease a screeching minority of the fan base?
---
&gt; I know but nerfing two shot was just dumb, two shot by itself wasn't even that overpowered and now with the nerf those weapons aren't even worth it.
---
Two shot before perks basically doubled the weapons' damage. What other perk without buffs doubled the weapon's damage at all times?
---
Because I know there are perks that do increased damage at full health and when they are low on health. But it is only a narrow window for those effects to kick in. While 2 shot is always at max power. 
---
Go to Solomon's Pond. I think you'll find Swann's 4xGreat grandfather. 
---
I had a two shot hunting rifle and it missed 9 out of 10 or only one bullet would hit. All with the 95% 
---
As someones whos base sits on top of a deathclaw spawn... Plz no
---
&gt;So, given that it is only Feb 8th, 2019 as of this writing, it stands to reason that Bethesda honestly screwed up, and would like to start getting feedback to make the game better.
---
If Bethesda wanted this they should not have deployed the community managers in November armed with the line 'We hear you and are sending it on to the dev team'. they clearly knew some sort of feedback system was required so either :
---
* They decided to deceive the playerbase by claiming to take feedback when actually they weren't.
---
* They have always been taking feedback so this 8th Feb announcement amounts to literally nothing new.
---
I remember seeing this and finding dung near it. You ruined the conspiracy for me but it sounds more reasonable than this well thought out concept he had. 
---
Both SWTOR and ESO do that exact thing. There's regions that are PVP. Once you walk in you get a warning message and a count down till you're flagged. No idea why 76 didn't just go this route. 
---
How about the Ghoulorilla?
---
You don't get attacked unsolicited. You bitch and moan at people and usually attack them in your posts here. 
---
&gt;Bethsedsa gives more transparency
---
I'm getting you a dictionary for Christmas.
---
A 20 quest backlog and you can‚Äôt find anything to do? I‚Äôm confused.
---
Dont forget that cultist clothes can be found in Garrahan mansion, further supporting the connection.
---
Something that stood out to me when going through whitesprings bunker, was one of the terminal entries. I wish I could remember the details, but essentially it is an Enclave member suspecting a different government organization of working against the Enclave. That the Enclave was saving America from this other agency. I mostly chalk it up to paranoid delusions and self-justification, but it still struck me as odd that *any* organization in the U.S. government could oppose the Enclave, since up to now, we have been lead to believe that they were the real power behind the throne and pulled all the strings.
---
I mention this because if there really was an organization opposed to the Enclave within the government, that wasnt eradicated or bought out completely, they must have had some serious influence. Makes me wonder if this other group was an equally shadowy group, but instead made up of people who made use of ancient forgotten secrets to gain power. Imagine if there were more crowns like Lorenzo's, wielded by people with more of an agenda what if Obediah Blackhall's family had been part of them, and they had discovered the buried faces, the lost alien civilization, the sleeping monsters. They formed an occult cabal, grew in power and influence, and adopted the bronze faces as their symbol. They have their tendrils everywhere, deeper than the Enclave even, they have eyes and ears in all the major corporations, government bodies and wealthy exclusive clubs. So they work their symbol into everything they touch. 
---
Picture a shadow war between the Illuminati and the Freemasons.
---
Knowing this game, it was something... just not anything that spawned properly. &gt;_&gt;
---
Good info, I'll peak, usually the AP cost is supposed to be balanced based on DMG etc, but it sounds like it's a bit off
---
The ones in Watoga look like nests if you look at the back of those heads. I couldn't tell if those things were manmade or something else.
---
Every claim of disconnects I hear, I cut the amount by 80% and triple the time it happened in. 
---
You know how like people say Bethesda lies about everything. I‚Äôve taken that stance with you game haters.
---
You‚Äôre so messed up over a game you have to be lying. So I‚Äôve been giving you a taste of who you act. 
---
Had this happen to me was a little Irratated after spending the time and resources to launch the nuke myself then only collect 54 1* items that I left in a bag after selling to the vendors. I even made a video of killing three of them and not only did I not get any ledgendary loot out of any of them one didn't have anything even after checking for a few minutes to see if it was just delayed. 
---
My wife says the same. I keep playing because it makes her think I enjoy doing things that frustrate me. You gotta keep a little mystery to keep a relationship fresh. I like that she might believe I'm a lizardperson. 
---
And with my industry experience in product development and service delivery I can say that if I went to a client and said 'We can't give you an update because we are too busy doing work' I would be told to make time or onboard someone to do the task.
---
Stop giving away my base location.... You should erase this!
---
Mmmmmmm free range cat.
---
I think you can find one in a partially opened safe, I want to say its in the  room with all the safes at the  New Appalachian Central Trainyard, but i could be mistaken. I remember there being multiple safes with one ajar (you don't have to lockpick) and its in a safe with a few other misc items. 
---
Also there \*might\* be one in a shed in Helvetia (not the church, the little shed near the post office).Sorry its not definite, been a while since i stopped there, but worth checking out. 
---
Maybe I didn't say it right, it wasn't that the orphans WERE jealous (maybe so, maybe not) but Olivia FELT they were.
---
And Olivia didn't see Brody as a threat, as she felt he was mostly incompetent (from his failures in several of the attacks.)  However, this was probably him just being manipulative and forcing her to act.  But if she didn't like him, she probably would have just let him get killed and cleaned up afterward.  Instead she protected him.  That might have been to keep the communications with the Boss open, but I doubt that.....she'd have just gotten a new 'negotiator' from them if necessary.
---
Seriously though, I've been here since beta, come check out what I've done with the place.... My psn is mgamble0804
---
Kind of like 'where in the world is Carmen Sandiego' fun 
---
Just, no.
---
Yea 1 cap per round can be quite outrageous when your trying to buy or sell a large quantity. That would be a very nice feature, honestly they should revamp their trading system for longevity purposes. Mostly trading tends to be more hassle than it's worth in its current state. Makes you wonder how they are going to present the player vending whenever they decide to roll it out.
---
Congrats, you're the fourth person to post this exact complain. We had three yesterday.
---
Would be nice. It‚Äôs my favorite melee weapon and I still rock it as backup. 
---
He's done the samething with me as well. I'm starting to think he's having some issues at home. We need to have an intervention or some kind to figure out what's going on. Maybe take him to a bar or something so he's more comfortable
---
My only answer to all three of those, from an inbetweener, is I just think people should be able to voice thier opinions. Good ones or bad ones. The ones that bash with fists and gnaw their words, 'i ain't got no time for that'. Lol i will read em, an pat them on the back, since sometimes that's all these rock bashers want. But the well thought out, and deep thoughted opposition, is rare is deserves a conversation.
---
This reminds me of Rust...
---
Because of the looney water-cooled barrel jacket thing.  It should be called Light Machine Gun.  It's WAY too heavy and bulky to be used as an assault rifle.
---
When walking up to the front door of Fort Defiance, you have to jump over the first step. It seems odd, since it's one small step. 
---
Is this a bug? Or what was the intent behind this, if it's not a bug.
---
Anyways, if it's not supposed to be the case, it's been this way since I started playing the game in November. Not sure if Bethesda doesn't know, doesn't care, or people don't care, or if people care but are just not saying anything.....
---
Anyhoo.
---
i have like 20 people i have played with in some capacity. None are left. I had about 20 more that used each other for travel. None of those are left.  I quit a month ago but stay in here hoping something changes and check the game bi weekly for updates and to see if atom store every gets reasonable. No luck yet. Spent 10 bucks on elder scrolls online to fill the gaming void. I really was counting on this to be my jam.
---
You need a hug.
---
 LOL. I have a suit of X0-1 in my pocket. I only take it out for Nuke Zones as my BOS Heavy Combat Armor with a Dense Chest and Strengthened Limbs is just better. ;)
---
Wasnt there an eye in the Dunwich Borers Mine, deep down where you find the sacrifial blade? This place was spooky. 
---
One of my fallout friends last night was telling me that "Good With Salt" makes his food last a week or longer. 
---
I in no way feel exploited. Have everything in the game i want, including skins and have still only spent initial purchase cost. I never crash anymore and habent seen a bug in weeks. The game is less than 3 months old so i definitely dont expect dlc yet.
---
I think you don't know what true exploitation is. You use a very serious world very casually.
---
Okay, you've got me there.  I'll admit their presence makes no sense in WV, nor Appalachia as a whole.  Mutant mountain lions, mutant hawks, etc., those would make sense.  But sloths???
---
Also haven‚Äôt been able to locate the Plans or mods for Ultra-light Combat Armor chest, legs, or arms
---
I feel you bro. I‚Äôm never preordering and maybe even buying anything Bethesda again :/
---
Shielded BoS lining will only drop from technical data.
---
I have 4 people on my friends list. Two of them I see online almost every night when I login, one of them I see every few days.
---
Also, all the servers I join are usually full of people. Go out and make new friends, man.

One quest remaining
---
"Kill Wendigo in clown suit"
---
He wont put it on!
---
I found someone playing as a raider last night. I snuck up to him while he was on a workbench at one of the train stations and must have scared him because he spun around and started punching me in my fucking face. So I shot him in his... Many times as he kept seeking revenge.
---
And I only kept his steel and acid as my prize.
---
Did all of the non legendary enemies drop a ton of crap legendaries too or is that just me?
---
You‚Äôre so messed up over a game you have to be lying. So I‚Äôve been giving you a taste of how you act. 
---
bethesda does not care about anything, we already paid the game if they really cared what we said, they would have solved it in the first or second patch 
---
now he just wants money from ugly skins and fallout objects 4

I've been seeing a lot of honey beasts around whitesprings lately.  A lot more snallygasters, too.
---
You do it. 
---
I know this post is about armour plan mods but Ive been trying to complete my collection of CAMP plans and have been unable to find these items, some of them used to be at vendors and now are no longer spawning there (eg the ashtray)
---
These are only the ones I dont have, theres probably more.  
---
track lighting 
---
metal box
---
dumpster
---
park bench
---
short rustic bench
---
stone benches
---
ashtray
---
windmill
---
starburst clock
---
domestic kitchen tables
---
wood tables
---
metal picnic table
---
metal shelves
---
bookcase
---
resort couches?
---
Maybe cause it affects posting of it gets too low?
---
It seems strange that the paint splash skin looks great on my rig and the suit both in-game and the store( on another vault dweller, I don‚Äôt own) .  The vault-trek leather looks same store/game, which I also own.  However  the camo skin does not look like the store image in-game to me.  Hoping someone, on any platform can tell me.   I‚Äôll have to pull out my Nuka-Cola outfit PA and take a look myself. 
---
Ok. I CAN confirm that you can find them at the Flooded Trainyard. On my first try, I found the Torso Plans, which spawned on the shelf of a Cabinet, inside one of the Train Cars, where there's a Drawer Cabinet. 
---
I've only gotten the Torso, and I've been trying to server hop to find the other plans, but have come up empy. 
---
Will update.
---
Irradiated+irritated=irridiated
---
The is bro
---
I haven't had my base griefed yet but my plan good or not is to just quickly relocate my base, and use all the blueprints to replace it once they are gone. The small price of caps is the downside.
---
Yeah after the patch :)
---
Just wanna know where it is on the map, so someone can hold my beer.
---
Yup. This week I‚Äôve been doing exactly what you and a the game bashers do. 
---
Sorry you can‚Äôt handle having what you do done to yourself.
---
Go change your diapers.
---
Yes, this!!! That's my understanding too. There's a group of very powerful people who deal in the occult, and they might be secretly pulling all the strings, infiltrated everywhere. In the wiki page about Ug-Qualtoth, they mention a theory about the cult being responsible for the nuclear war itself. Seems plausible to me. 
---
Yup, I mentioned this in the post :)
---
&gt;So I‚Äôve been giving you a taste of who you act.
---
you think I care? you can do whatever you want, the game is still a mess. you can't wish facts away.
---
and most people aren't as stubborn as I am, they've all quit specifically because of how broken everything is. yes, I've been dc/d that often and yes, the queen does crash that often.
---
You still take the ballistic damage from the nuke blast.  You just die instantly no matter what.
---
If it's that simple and fast to fix why haven't you done it yet?
---
The 415 is correct.  The 515 is the bug.  It happens while wearing the PA on load in.  As soon as you exit the PA it resets to the correct carry weight.
---
Whats your carry weight without pa
---
&gt;The game is mostly stable and has some real potential and an amazing following that actually cares and contributes suggestion and adequate feedback.
---
It's 3 months down the line and we are still talking about 'potential' rather than 'actual'. Says a lot really.
---
And all those suggestions and feedback? Joke's on you, turns out the devs weren't actually listening to feedback before this week since they've just turned around and asked for the exact feedback they've been getting for the last 8 weeks. Sorry to everyone that wasted their time trying to help.
---
That's right fam, every criticism of the game is a personal attack on you and your interests. Go change your worldview. 
---
Should be a heavy weapon lol
---
I don't think I've ever seen a less necessary post with so much irrelevant information. 
---
Bravo.
---
Do not support cat murder. Avoid this house. Damn that dude.
---
&gt;I think that they should really make sure to be careful about what creatures they bring in.
---
I agree, but I don't think they give a shit about maintaining canon with this game. The bullshit about West Tek poisoning the water was a weak ass excuse to retcon the super mutants into the game.
---
Hell, fog crawlers are giant crustaceans created by radiation and/or exposure to the toxic fog surrounding Far Harbor. There's absolutely no reason for them to exist in WV, but there they are.
---
I still play with a group of people but it's getting harder and harder for them to log in, they all rushed to the end of the game and now complain there is nothing to do, meanwhile I'm taking my sweet time reading/doing everything because I know there's no endgame
---
Why rush to the end of a game if you know there's no endgame? :\
---
I have most of those from taking workshops or buying from vendors (pre-patch, unfortunately). Mostly from workshops though. There is hope!
---
I read somewhere that domestic kitchen tables isn't an actual thing, even though the plan exists. Same for stone benches, I think. Make of that what you will. Hopefully someone has better/newer info.
---
I'm starting to think this may be intentional so people in PVP don't wonder why their bullets aren't doing any damage.
---
I definitely hope we get more Zetan presence in Appalachia eventually. If you ask me, a REALLY good idea would be to tie the presence of Zetans together with ANOTHER West Virginian cryptid by the name of Indrid Cold. (I know he‚Äôs often associated with the Mothman but the legend does state he‚Äôs supposedly an alien, and the Mothmen in 76 don‚Äôt SEEM to be aliens...)
---
Yea once you get a workshop, you have to be ready and willing to be able to defend it no matter what/who comes. Munitions factort is wanted by alot of players and will pvp you over it. Some just want to grief the workshop owners. Either way doesnt matter. However, i dont see how youre able to play this game without any bugs/glitches. They're everywhere. Lol 
---
My question is WHO PUT DRAGONS IN A FALLOUT GAME 
---
good advice, thanks
---
Spoilers obviously.
---
&gt;!I stumbled into.this quest the other day with a friend. We weren't expecting to hear a slaughter over a holotape. Just listening and both of us going "OH....oh...oh.....that's not how I expected this to go."
---
76 is pretty decent at the desolate thing, I'll give it that !&lt;
---
I guess they could be nests, but I don't know. That's an odd position for nests, like, they're vertical. If there was a hole in the "heads" and the vines were the "door"... I don't know, it seems weird to me.
---
Different industries. If it bothers you this much stop spending all day on Reddit whining about it and go do something productive about it. Start a lawsuit or something if the product isn't what was advertised. 
---
Most of the sales are on the console. Steamspy isnt a reliable metric
---
Crows exist though. Except for the Synth crows.
---
I might be able to help w/ this.  I've never lauched a nuke but Im at that part in the main quest, and I've picked up a couple of the nuclear keycards along the way.  I probly wont be home from work until around 7:30 est though.  You want me to hit you up when I get in?
---
That (finally) dropped from the Big Game Hunter daily at Black Bear lodge for me.
---
You won't be disappointed.  Now that it's patched up, NV (and its DLC) is one of my favorite Fallout experiences to this day.
---
Fallout has always had a problem with their mobs falling off late game though.  They always just turn in to idiot bullet sponges.
---
  Maybe make higher level ghouls able to grapple.  Make them carry more diseases too with higher chance to disease with grapples.  No more than 3 ghouls can grapple at a time.  You have to use melee, weapon bash, or out right kill them to get them off you.  Have them cause bleeding effects from biting and rending.  
---
They have the disease effect in game.  Why not use it more against us.  
---
Have Scorched and Super Mutants that use offensive Syringers that drop said offensive syringer ammo.  
---
Have spotter enemies (long range snipers etc) that make it harder and more challenging to "sneak".  
---
Have humanoid mobs use grenade weapons more often.  
---
Have enemies who use stealth too.   I'm not talking about just the Chameleon Deathclaws.  Actual stealth, non-stealthboy style.  Add a "Spotter" perk card that helps you spot stealthed beings in a certain radius.  Stealthboys, chameleon deathclaws and chameleon armor being immune to the perk card.  Would be cool to get ambushed every now and then.  Fight your way out of it.
---
 Use said "Spotter"perk to find unseen enemies in a building instead of just having the red dot show up on your compass.  Don't have enemies show up on your compass until you've actually got line of sight, or close enough to hear them.  Making you more cautious makes it more fun and challenging instead of knowing where everything is at immediately.  You lose sight of them they pop off your compass.  
---
What I think most people want are more challenging fights not longer, bullet spongy type fights or monsters that just over spam certain moves over and over.  
---
Instead of having the scorch beasts land every now and then give us a hook shot gun we can build to pull them down or pull us to them that can be tied off to something yo keep them from moving around as much. Make fights more strategic.  People in heavy power armor use multiple hook shots to bring them down.  Meleers destroy the wings so they can't fly again.  Ranged users shooting at the face and back weak spots to kill it faster.   Lol Monster Hunter Fallout style.  
---
The hook shot could be used to climb things too, as well as tie things down.  It's usable on team mates and those who give consent to pvp.  You can choose to tie the hookshot to yourself (which is it's default) or to an object which allows you to switch to another weapon without falling.  Melee edged weapons can cut it.  Lasers and plasma weapons can cut it.  It uses ammo you can find or create.  The ammo is not light so you don't want to carry a lot.
---
far easier to farm them when their passive, then you just need to hunt the legendary ones.
---
&gt;Different industries
---
Ah yes, of course. Video games should be held to lower standards because...reasons.
---
u/grynder7 This is what I've been working on when I have the time to work on it.  
---
 [Fallout Vendor Plan List - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18D-yEJvowtiMz7TK2g1Uy9zGCZ_hULMq-oe1ifubv_o/edit#gid=600685016)  
---
I had made a reddit post about a week or two back asking similar. No-one ever really answered so I started working on it. 
---
Sure
---
I have been reading your posting history and it is entertaining that the only thing that you seem to have to say is:
---
1) you don't like the game 
---
2) you don't like that other people enjoy the game
---
3) you claim to be a duper... 
---
You are free to play the game as you like (as long as you do not get banned), but if you don't enjoy it its pretty much your own fault  
---
You are entitled to your opinion, but I'm with your wife: you should really knock it off and let people enjoy it for themselves, you are just as bad as a greifer.
---
Anthem is on my radar..I'm just worried that I'm gonna buy it..play it for a day and then never played it again 
---
can you even read? that's what carnivore is (supposedly) for
---
I mean the front looks like a sculpture and built into the building, but when I looked at the back of the head in Watoga (you can get on the roof to check them out yourself) it looks much more organic. Were they always there, or were they constructed after the bombs dropped?
---
This is like one of those game of thrones or west world theory threads. The pieces that people put together always end up being more interesting that what actually happens. 
---
In the past day there have been 4 posts making the same complaint about yesterdays "Inside the Vault".
---
The mods clearly don't care about keeping this subreddit clean of shitposting.
---
I added you
---
Link is invalid
---
cool.  I'll add you on the app now and just try to jump in when I get home.
---
&gt; You‚Äôre so messed up over a game you have to be lying. So I‚Äôve been giving you a taste of who you act.
---
I actually want to play the game as it's my younger brothers favorite franchise. I haven't a dog in the fight, and if I did, it would be to see the game succeed. 
---
I think you may have fallen into the polar opposite of the camp you hate,  there is plenty to criticize without resorting to making up "wild exaggerations and flat out lies" 
---
I'd expect some engine developers to focus on new projects.
---
Content developers would prefer to work on DLC. We won't see the benefit until they're almost done.
---
Atom shop is just a team of artists.
---
That leaves just a handful to work on bugs, balance, and non-DLC improvements.
---
The bobby pins were a merge conflict.
---
190
---
??
---
&gt;  Bethesda promised an inventory increase over 600 once they could confirm the stability of the servers 
---
They said they will only raise it above 600 if the servers are stable. 
---
So essentially they are saying that they are never going to increase it. 
---
Okay; that makes a lot more sense!
---
Another complaint about complaints.  Good work.
---
Not to be an ackshully guy but BGS just had a lunar New year bundle in the CC. Shi weapon and armor paint along with a Chinese pip boy skin. 
---
I drop plans in Flatwoods at the church and weapons/armour I'll leave in a level appropriate zones vendor. Would love to see the face of a new player finding ultracite/rare plans in the Flatwoods overseer's stash.
---
Its not 215?
---
I agree and disagree with much of this. My main concern is comparing a non updated game from 2007 (my gaming era as well) to a mmo today with plans for free dlc. Even cod had payable dlc, im not sure how you forgot that. Either we pay for dlc or there is another way to pay for it.
---
 This imo is the least aggressive form that exists. **We all **get dlc **no matter if we never spend another dime** on this game so its actually better money value than cod.
---
I do find that sometimes when the server is lagging, I can just endlessly swing at an enemy and they take no damage.  Luckily I can still move and kite a mob around and the hits eventually all register.
---
It helps considerably if you have a 40mbs connection or better.  One of my friends doesn't and she's always lagging out not because of the game, but because she's playing at like 10mbs because she lives in a rural area that doesn't have high speed internet available.
---
As someone both terrified of snakes, but fascinated by them I both love this suggestion, and hate you for making it. 
---
Yes, and that's part of my theory. The eye belongs to the same metal face that appears in the Interloper cave. They're all the same, as you can see here: https://i.imgur.com/lsjYkGb.png
---
I have seen him run from the attackers, very rare but it does happen.
---
In D3, the seasons bring people back though. Maybe not for very long in most cases, but the game stays alive because of it, and the devs do put in some basic cosmetic rewards for us.
---
FO76 doesn't have this safety net :/
---
I love this idea, and I‚Äôd go so far as to push it a little farther and say what if there was something left of their personality in Scorched form? Like a particularly violent Raider boss became Scorched and all it really did was add to their bloodlust so they‚Äôre just gleefully screaming in that awful hoarse voice about how much they can‚Äôt wait to watch you bleed.
---
Also consider: Scorched enemies in power armor.
---
Can you not learn how to make them by scrapping them? I think that's how I've learned a few plans.
---
Finally! A use for my Plague Walker mutation!
---
I have been reading your posting history and it is entertaining that the only things that you seem to have to say are:
---
1. you don't like the game

2. you don't like that other people enjoy the game
---
3. you claim to be a duper...
---
You are free to play the game as you like (as long as you do not get banned), but if you don't enjoy it its pretty much your own fault at this point
---
Ahh, yup, you're right, I was thinking of tactics
---
Just passing by to say thank you, awesome work!
---
I think you are remembering our prime of gaming wrong. Wow, dlc packs and preorder bonuses all existed back then. It has definitely gotten much worse though. I think fo76 store strat is incredibly generous considering you never need to spend a dime ever for the game (after purchase) and you can have everything in the game with work and no rng.
---
Welp...know what I am doing tonight.
---
Haha, nice one ;)
---
Better than your complete absense of data. Provide data or basically.
---
It's clear to me from the amount of data we have that most people play their games very little.
---
Yes, that's definitely a possibility! =]]
---
Trust me bud I knew it wasnt serious, nor was my reply
---
I should work on my delivery
---
Sorry I fixed it now
---
&gt;if they really cared what we said, they would have solved it in the first or second patch
---
You are the king of armchair developers.
---
Correct, it is definitely not energy.  But might not be explosive either.  And AOE is 100% hit.   In NV I only saw 1 at a time, but here there r generally 3 with the queen, who is already silly.  I have seen queen take down scorchbeasts, which makes her the queen of cheese.
---
Never played it but that seems understandable if that‚Äôs what fits with the lore and how the players interact with the overmind. With the scorched, I suppose I‚Äôm left to ask: even if the scorched hivemind delineates and/or distributes it responsibilities, how would we know what those duties/titles are, to whom are they granted, and in what way does this knowledge affect our interactions.
---
Would‚Äôve been nice to see different levels of scorched-ness, and names that reflected our outward understanding of the disease‚Äôs progression.
---
This is all just a minuscule quibble, mind you.
---
Hello to everyone who sorts by new, what's up lol
---
I meant thanks bro
---
I never thought about that until this thread. This would be a very awesome keybind to have.
---
I read this week's inside the vault and the questions that the developer had about monsters gave me very dim hopes for the future of this game.
---
Going by those questions the developers are asking the community, it seems apparent that there wasn't much of a plan after release. Additional content should have been worked on behind the scenes, testing, then releasing and tweaking for balancing. 
---
Straight up asking us what we want them to make likely means they are winging it.
---
They are truly better served giving this Trainwreck over to the mod Community where they can do some real good.
---
Well then you're not trying hard enough, LaBlaugrana.
---
Seriously, though, the reason for the post is because I've seen a ton of complaints about Bethesda not taking user inputs until recently. This explains why that is. Seems to fill a needed info niche to me, I apologize if you felt otherwise.
---
Or Bethesda could do what the hell they liked and then get criticised by the community because it's not what they wanted.
---
Asking the people that play the game means they can get more points of view from (let's be honest) the people who's opinion, on the direction the game should be going, matters the most. 
---
You're right. I saw these heads but i didnt make the connection. The metal piles akways seemed odd to me. They have something unsettling and unnatural. 
---
That's basically where I'm at. Level 13 and all my friends irl play on PS4 so I'm lonely lol
---
Even if there's not alot of chatting there's just something about the company of others that adds more fun!
---
That's the big question! =\]\]\]
---
You are absolutely able to fully damage the limb through flat damage or cripple, but it has no crippling effect.
---
Thanks for the heads up.  I just tested it again. Compared to my test about a month ago the relative stacking is similar, but the performance of each of them appears degraded.  Server/UI update lag makes conclusive testing difficult.
---
In both tests I found the combination of both to be about 10% better than Action Boy only, and about 20% better than Lone Wanderer only.  The most efficient AP perk is therefore Action Boy, but since Lone Wanderer has DR also and many perks are competing in the Agility tree it may be better for some builds.
---
The disturbing possibility is that both of them are worse now individually than a month ago, when my testing confirmed the 30% for LW and the 45% for level 3 AB.  When I tested just now, Lone Wanderer was only about 22% improvement and Action Boy was about 31%.  Nurf? Side effect?
---
My testing is completely suspect, especially with inconsistent lag on the HUD refresh.  I'm averaging stopwatch readings, not using timecode from video or whatever.  What test are you referring to, please?  Didn't find anything with a quick search.  
---
My conclusion:  Lone Wanderer and Action Boy only partially stack, and may have degraded.
---
Yeah. It impressed the hell out of me. Even the way the corpses were set up fit the holotapes perfectly. Pretty F'd up situation. 
---
A well-rounded, well-explained, logical response. Thank you for that.
---
Props to u/FnordBear for posting theirs and reminding me to post mine.
---
In 4 it doesn't help that you fight one in the first hour of the game. That really ruined the feeling compared to 3 or NV where you hear how terrible they are, but may not see one until your 20 hours in.
---
1. Clearly I don‚Äôt like the game
---
2. I don‚Äôt care if other people enjoy the game. That‚Äôs not my issue. My issue is that people comment ‚ÄúI enjoy the game‚Äù as if that negates all of the issues this game has. 
---
3. Yup I‚Äôve duped and I haven‚Äôt been banned. That doesn‚Äôt mean I haven‚Äôt played through the game normally before duping.
---
I don‚Äôt know what progress has been made from our comments and my entertaining comment history
---
Thank you!!! =]]]
---
The same; gergoe
---
Good question, will try to test later.
---
And yet you don't actually show how I'm wrong. 
---
IF they tied the dwemer in with this cult then that would make for some good story potential.
---
I know I can buy them. Just don't want to spend all those caps haha 
---
Is that boy supposed to be Fred Wilks?  I can hear the Zetan chatter, don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre referring to them or Fred being familiar characters.
---
Yea power armor would be a good addition too I think. It could also be cool to have teamwork of some sort from the scorched. I mean, considering they‚Äôre all controlled by one hive mind, it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard for the hive to send an enemy or two around to flank you while you are distracted shooting someone else, or a sniper spawns a bit farther back and tries to provide cover fire for its teammates when they get low on health. 
---
Didn't know that till I saw it on Twitter this morning 
---
What I can‚Äôt believe is how I‚Äôve literally said how I‚Äôm doing this on purpose and that I‚Äôm baiting people. 
---
And you all keep taking the bait.
---
Exactly! I think it's a great example of a supernatural "thing" in Fallout.
---
That is odd. My experience is the polar opposite with 90% of my shot hitting my target.  10mm Pistol, .44 Magnum, Hunting Rifle, Pump/Combat shotgun and combat rifle. Never had a problem with the majority of them missing. 
---
AND MY AXE!
---
And obligatory tag for u/LoneVaultWanderer and u/Ladydevann and u/kindofsquishy
---
What‚Äôs hilarious. I literally say I‚Äôm doing this on purpose and baiting game haters. 
---
And you all keep taking the bait. 
---
I mean really? 
---
I have an ultracite set I‚Äôve been contemplating dumping. If you‚Äôre interested let me know. 
---
Exactly! I don't know how the community would react, but I would love it!
---
Wow, -4 for answering a question. No good deed goes unpunished eh?
---
Or, alternately, they had no idea how to take feedback in a structured fashion and started asking for it before they realized it needed to be more compartmentalized to be useful.
---
It's the difference between having the announcer ask a stadium of people to shout their suggestions at once, then trying to isolate what's useful from the roaring crowd, versus having specific suggestion boxes at strategic locations asking specific questions that can be easily read and categorized and passed onward.
---
Replying means you care. It‚Äôs as simple as that, 
---
You cared to tell me that you don‚Äôt care.
---
More so I tell you I‚Äôm baiting you I purpose. And you keep taking the bait. 
---
Oh wait, I tracked down the terminal entry I was thinking of. It's an email to Eckhart written by a crazed scientist who suspects that they are all trapped in a virtual simulation by the Virtiual Simulation Systems agency or something, VSS. That actually sounds more like a tongue in cheek 4th wall breaking reference than a hint at an even more shadowy cabal.
---
Still, everything else I posted could still have merit.
---
Glad to see someone stole my post from last night and improved it.
---

---
Great post!
---
Awww shucks. I'm just a silly old bear with too much time to think.
---
They could even have a unique, freaky techno-organic Scorched infected power armor variant, maybe one that has some sort of effect (like, sores that sometimes spew that green Scorch dust that Scorchbeasts trail)
---
And yeah I agree, a hivemind should definitely make them more tactical and coordinated than the Raider esque cannon fodder strategy they employ now.
---
I actually leveled up pretty easy by that window you can draw the mob to. And ran along the cabins. Where can I find a key? 
---
 I missed The Order Of Mystery tag. Where is your fucking sword? Its a seriously good weapon I use to kill Scorchbeasts, and all the trash.

After some 30+ server hops and each vendor faction checked, I can confirm that Deep Pocketed Marine Limbs, and Heavy Combat Plans are available --albeit *rarely*. 
---
No sight of BoS yet.
---
Oh yea now we‚Äôre talking. 
---
Hey you reminded me to finish mine, I stalled out around the Mire creatures and had to go run around to get some more data for my list :)
---
They managed to shoehorn in Super Mutants and Brotherhood of Steel into every game so far, if Beth wanted synths they would find a way to justify it.
---
Nice work
---
I don't know if they have a skeleton crew fixing this game or not, but they have to have someone tell us what's going on. Have someone in a social media marketing department tell us what's planned and have an ear to the ground. We need updates.
---
Whoa, sweet.
---
I guess it really depends on your gaming style..personally..I love sandbox games..I like how u can start this game from the beginning and immediately fight SBQ..I like wrecking havoc at the golf club..I also like seeing other wastelanders and giving them aid items/legendaries/etc..I think this game is packed with great content..plans/mutations ..I also really liked how they implemented the nuke/blast zone feature..conceptually this game is great..it just seems their execution is lacking..after the TSE nerf I was beyond salty..I took a break for a few days..but then out of nowhere I'm back to gathering ingredients in the Forest to craft my soup and healing salves..I find this game to be very relaxing..I honestly don't see myself stopping for a very long time..I'm also starting to build up new alts with completely different builds to see which I like the most..my stomping ground now are the golf club and harpers..and with the market subs u can focus on having more fun in the game without having to grind for hours and days to get particular items..the fallout series is easily my favorite..and I only started playing their games a few years ago 
---
Definitely interested 
---
I don't care whether you "cut the amount by 80% and triple the time it happened in", facts are still facts.
---
I do care that you're wrong, which is why I replied. that much is obvious.
---
That us weird.  I would literally watch the bullets spit up in flight and both miss lol
---
I have roughly 300 hours actively scrapping everything, and all I've ever learned is mods. I would love for scrapping to give actual plans but I've never seen it work that way. 
---
There's a dog in a rock???
---
If you can get hard numbers it would be great.   
---
That said, I did non-perked, standing in camp food/water tests this past week and the consumption rate changed when I server hopped to repeat the tests.  
---
On one server I was having to eat and drink every 5 minutes, on the next closer to 20, same activity level, same "location" etc
---
Keep up the good work!
---
Not surprising. They patched the fun out of the game.
---
Sure seems like asset reuse and set dressing making dumb little scenes more than any sort of deep important lore. 
---
That's a nice list
---
Ah, yes, that one. It's definitely intriguing. There's an awesome theory that F76 is all a simulation like Tranquility Lane in F3. r/fo76/comments/acgcly/ingame_evidence_points_toward_a_simulation/?st=JRUB2V78&amp;sh=70aaf4c0
---
why they prefer to continue with garbage from the atom store 
---
&gt;Shielded BoS lining will only drop from technical data.
---
I am very interested in this. How old is this info (pre/post patch)?
---
On a rock. He's up high in the Mire, being a good boy waiting for his owners to stop being dead right next to him. You can't tame him for your base and it makes me sad.
---
I must have had some chem or food mods going when I looked 
---
Hopping servers changes my damage plus or minus 50ish.
---
I'd like it to be fire and physical (change to fire would mean it would bypass most DR) and have the fire portion scale to INT as the physical does to STR 
---
Strange, i just nuked whitesprings on xbox and found at least 10 3* enemies over the two hours. Nevertheless they still all dropped 1* wood right legs.
---
I've found them a bunch on super mutants, and I think Phoenix has plans for them.
---
Haven't seen that yet! Oh boy! 
---
i explicitly speaking of melee 
---
Good shit man
---
Most of my time was spent in formatting tbh lol
---
That and running around the Mire to find more Fog Crawlers and Hermit Crabs to fight since I don't spend a lot of time there.
---
Two points of concession
---
1. Agreed - RNG is horrible. I was pulling the 15% out of my ass. I'veo nly found a few good items in a couple hundred hours.
---
2. I will ensure that I use 7 question marks next time. Hopefully this meets the requirement.
---
No way keep it up, I love the free xp :)
---
I've not done any testing, but I farm plans and have only ever gotten it from technical data (I've gotten 3).  You can't buy them, if you can, please show me where, and I've not heard anyone getting them anywhere else.
---
The perks increase the amount recovered. Having the decay rate change with the perk card system and its swapping nature would be a poor choice.
---
Thanks, doin my best for the community :)
---
Fallout Haiku:
---
I die every time, I try to make wendigo, Wear this darn clown suit!
---
I just got it from doing the Patrol Quest
---
You made him re-coil with your comment. 
---
You end game? Because I had no perks and my vanguard combat set was as strong/stronger than excavator PA. I pull out my P.A. now only when I'm overencumbered and even then sometimes it hurts more because I don't get my legendary weight effects with it. 
---
What's hilarious is you are an incompetent loser.
---
I have over 50 and even a few who are IRL friends and none play anymore. Of the 3 dozen or so on my list I see 2-3 online for an hour or so and they are just there to kill off a daily or two and log out.
---
Maybe that's why he wears the trench coat in previous Fallouts. He was actually a flasher the whole time, but lacked true exhibitionist confidence until recently.
---
Really? I assumed wrong I guess
---
I bought after the beta for full price (before the black friday sale). Still happy though. It's definitely a 60 dollar game to me. I know someone who's waiting for it to be free. Yeah he heard that rumor and is holding out.
---
Don't do this advice for robots, they explode 
---
I like that you fight scorched like 90% of the time but they didn't even bother to give them an identity as an enemy enough to even distinguish from feral ghouls. 
---
Same. Camp is near Hermit Crabs, MQueens, Fog Crawlers, Gulpers, Anglers and an occasional scorchbeast.
---
I usually leave em alone but the Queen has a hard on for my wood...walls.
---
Always annoying  to hear her spawn when i load into my camp
---
Morrowind was a Bethesda game.  And Fallout 3, for all its flaws, was pretty well loved at the time.
---
Thanks for your reply! Is there a way to store more than 1 technical data in your inventory at a time? I pick up more than 1 and it only shows one
---
 Oh sorry. I find it easy and stuff dies, sometimes without even touching me, but i have been doing this since the game came out.
---
 I enjoy doing the 2 or 4 Molerats that will jump you and its a game for me to kill them with no damage. They are quite predictable.
---
 You are not using VATS or anything like that I hope. I never do.
---
Nice post.  One thing that has bothered me about monsters that I haven't seen mentioned (could have missed it), is why the F can animals without thumbs open doors?
---
They're the Necromongers, from the Underverse. 
---
I nuked whitesprings about 2 hours ago on xbox, shame i didn‚Äôt see this earlier
---
Rad rats are bloody annoying but they are tough little blighters. I‚Äôd quite happily set a pack on a downed SBQ and get the popcorn out. 
---
I don't remember my total AP off the top of my head, but I have 17 Agility (15 +2 from armor). Assault rifle is auto and damage is ~41. The 10mm sub damage is 46. I also have a 20-round automatic combat rifle that I can fire the whole clip, and the damage for that is 48.
---
Probably not.  However, I did put more hours in to FO76 as a solo player than FO4.
---
You can be the best but still be dumber than rocks.
---
Cool list.  
---
In regards of the DeathClaw on the Island, I think its level is OK, it is mostly a trial for low level characters.  
---
There are other places where higher level spawn (Hopewell Cave and Emmett Mountain Disposal Site)
---
IMO ScorchBeast, the regular one up to level 80 are easy to take down; and like you I've (level 130) not tried a SBQ yet
---
It has more base damage than the 50 cal machine gun. Loads of rifles have a fire rate of 40 but the handmade beats them all in base damage by quite far. It's the best weapon for Commando builds and some would say best for Rifleman builds if you want fire rate. It also has good ammo capacity and loads of great mods. I'd recommend you build a few then scrap them for mods; it's one of the best guns in the game, in fact it's so good it seems like a mistake...
---
Why haven't you fixed it yet?
---
Seriously considering switching my character from make to female
---
Not that I am aware of.  Before you get to the BoS questline, you can store multiple, and then stash them (at least at launch), but now when I find multiple in an area, I just fast travel back and forth and turn them in.  The Shielded lining is the best thing you can get from it, but you can get some ok legendary stuff (I sold the two extra linings I got for 8K and 10K caps).  I still turn in data hoping to get another to drop.  I have like 5 T-60 initiate Paints that no one will buy.
---
Flaws aside, it‚Äôs still a good game. 
---
Nice creative idea! I love it!
---
It can be weird. My favorite is molerats coming up through second story concrete ü§î
---
Then maybe she's wrong about picking you.
---
They could also use the ability to charge fractional caps instead of the minimum being one. Like bullets at a half a cap, so if you buy 10 it's 5 caps.
---
To play devil's advocate, Bethesda's servers are only one half of the connection.  Your end of the game plays a significant part.  How fast is your internet connection?  If you're not paying for 40mbs or better, you're going to get lag and latency issues with online games no matter what.
---
People fast traveling to your location that are carrying a lot of shit in their inventory will also bog your instance down.  Check to see if there's a few people vending nearby.
---
Has this been patched?
---
I bought it digitally for $20 on Xbox yesterday 
---
Except the announcer had ushers (community managers) specifically to curate the feedback. It wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äòplease address all complaints and suggestions to inbox@bethesda.com.
---
Rat rats take more hits from my Power Fist to kill than similar level Super Mutants
---
If I could rename him I would 100% have switched by now
---
Actually picked up the sacrificial machete mod last night that actually turns your machete into Kremvhs tooth
---
FAKE NEWS
---
I just wish it would scale. If I'm the only thing in the area and it's spawning just for me, make let her be a little more scary. At this point she's just quick Black Titanium scrap lol
---
Scorched Assistant to the Regional Manager
---
Its very clear that is the case by the extreme lack of progress in 4 months. Im pretty sure the main tean is focused solely on that elder scrolls 6 which they announced at e3 with fo76. They must be behind on it and funneling the bulk of their efferts to hit a tight deadline some time relatibely soon. Maybe 2020
---
 You live in an interesting place. ;) Mine is not far from Mosstown a Scorch center with a Fissure nearby, but the trees and general dense woods keep her away. I get the Scorched once in a while and Gulpers are what do the most damage. Still its pretty quiet where I live.
---
I just want the C.A.M.P. to be more versatile like FO4, the limited placement of most structural objects is abysmal.    
---
Why can't I stack the prefab stairs?    
---
Why do normal stairs only place in the centre?    
---
Who thought it was a good idea to put switches on the outside and keypads on the interior of doors?    
---
This all leads me to the idea that none of the devs have even played the game other then to create the clips for the promos and mostly used console commands to avoid the bugs. When your playing a game in a developer environment it is not the same as playing it in a real world situation.
---
but you can already join the Enclave
---
Do you deal with a lot of server lag? Because I don't really deal with server lag. An occasional spike but it is fairly stable connection. 
---
I have roughly two dozen Technical Datas in my STASH, just waiting to get through the BoS questline. I read that it is best to get one at a time for turn-in.
---
2 shot added base weapon damage and accuracy, that was averaged with modded weapon damage and accuracy and both shots used the average number.  The problem is they completely gimped the damage but didn't get rid of the degraded accuracy.  The accuracy hit was the downside of them.  The damage Nerf was needed but they should have removed the accuracy degradation, it's over nerfed in its current state.  Explosive should have just been moved to a primary position so you couldn't get it with ts, bloodied etc...
---
so microsoft thinks fallout 76 is selling well enough to move systems?
---
Not usually.  From my experience it appears that the vats shots for two shot guns go off of the hip fire accuracy which my guns dont usually have much of.
---
None other than my boi Todd Howard
---
Its not free youre still paying money to obtain the game 
---
I loved this post. Especially the part about farting bears.
---
Remember the "secret" no one has found on Fallout 4 yet.... This is related to that. 
---
I'm invested. I'd follow a sub for this, but you'd need a catchy name for the group of us looking for answers. Nice work OP.
---
I don‚Äôt want QoL items in the store. Nothing that gives any gameplay advantage even if it‚Äôs something as simple as crafted food. Because they said micro transactions wouldn‚Äôt be a source of anything other than cosmetics and they‚Äôve already toed that line with the Unstoppables stuff. 
---
Definitely, I hate using that crappy wood half wall around my 2nd floor deck, ruins the ambience.
---
OMG: you convinced me, I didn't actually enjoy the game! Lol
---
No..... not another Skyrim
---
Oh, duh... I totally forgot about perks. I started out as a weird PA Assassin/sniper build until I finally gave up because rifles are garbage, and then I transitioned to a melee/heavy gunner build. So I don't have any of the perks that would take advantage of of a handmade. That's probably why it seemed underwhelming. Plus, I'm used to being able to one- or two-shot most enemies with All Rise.
---
How does that equate to free? They run $100 off the One X in and out of bundles all the time. 
---
I don't think its fair to expect them to inform fans everything they are working on... If they have a fair amount of work going towards something like a big update, new content, or whatever else but it is still a ways off from completion there isn't much reasoning to reveal that now. Full transparency doesn't mean they have to tell you everything you want to know... 
---
I once got only a spoon...
---
The style is indeed very similar! =]
---
Whenever I've bought a console package I have always discarded the crap game that comes with it 
---
You're a buffoon, OP
---
I got mine for free, so that's a yay.
---
Well watch out because by the time you've read and listened to all the lore you'll probably be on your deathbed
---
Or just get Herbivore and eat all the berries in the world. Who cares if your berries spoil when there's 10 more every 5 feet. Berries are love, berries are life. 
---
 Yes. Its much more entertaining than F4. There are Scorchbeasts which are delicious cake, for some of us. ;)
---
If you're in an appropriate area in the US, it could be a mountain lion - their call can sound like a woman's scream.
---
It's unfortunate, infuriating and disappointing. What it is not however, is bewildering. The game was a commercial failure as far as Bethesda are concerned and there not going to throw good money after bad. 
---
&gt;People would be fired or at the very least reassigned for that sort of mistake.
---
Are you working in some sort of high risk development sector? The majority of software development companies aren't going to fire you for such a small mistake. Easy to fix, barely impacts anyone.
---
I live in the swamp with the treehouses. Right next to the lake spawn of a Mirelurk Queen. and every random time i fast travel or load in its a new creature. Sometimes Charred appear too. Always fun going home.
---
I always have bloodbugs nearby as well.
---
Lovely area
---
What do you mean? The Dunwich Borers? Is there a secret yet to be discovered in F4???
---
Hope it helps.  I'll probably bee working on the vendors I haven't hit yet tonight.
---
Yeah it could have connected to the her  story of missed opportunity and not knowing what happened to him, then finding an epic monster to fight.
---
Instead you're expected to just execute this sad imprisoned little ghoul.
---
Anticlimactic and kindof sad.
---
Thank you! =]]]]
---
Thats what I have on my base but plants tho cause if you spread them out in your base, and just hide with a bounty. They be destroying the props outside since they have less health then the building, so you can get ez kills
---
Holy shit, yeah I had my base on top of Seneca rocks and the same exact thing happened to me. You can build inside of there and fast travel to and from with ease, a perfect villain base.
---
Pretty sure the half wall he is referring to is the left/right half, not top/bottom.
---
because there is literally no penalty for his actions. even if he died he would've lost nothing and been able to respawn right at the guys camp to continue being a jerk. really wish we could just turn PVP off completely so I can just sit in my camp watching TV without having to worry about idiots. I've had 2 separate occasions of groups without their explosive guns just walking up to my house and attacking it for the fun of it, quite an annoying experience overall. 
---
Ah right. I'd just stay as you are then: probably better for you to just use it when you have 5.56 to burn as you'd need to move points into perception whereas staying strength lets you melee and shoot better.
---
That would be really great.
---
This community has changed..
---
I'm still having a blast with it!  It feels weird that I'm still enjoying the game and everyone else on this sub just shits on it.  But I'm weird, so that's ok :) 
---
&gt;Scorched: 
---
They may as well have just made these guys ghouls. They don't even use basic tactics like other raiders in other FO games - they just stand there pewpewing waiting to get shot in the face.
---
That does not even come close to helping your argument at all its not free youre still gonna have to pay its a bundle and congrats on throwing away games you are wasting money 
---
Bummer, I have def logged in and experienced damage glitches... But most of my bugs we resolved when I got my mem OC more stable (or just ran default settings). I don't know if it would help you, but it is easy to test.
---
Usually what I see is he'll be cool until he gets attacked, one might draw him out, then he'll go after other nearby robots. I could imagine this cycle repeating enough that he ends up on the edge of town.
---
The boundary should be the only limit to a friend camping nearby, the green circle should just be restricted to not overlapping.    
---
Also Whitespring should be off limits for building. Not a popular opinion I know but too many are exploiting it.
---
Enemies not spawning at defend workshop events
---
An ultracite infused deathclaw (like a glowing one but waaaay bigger) would be pretty insane.
---
It's fish OR cut bait. But yeah, other than that, spot on. 
---
Best of luck :)
---
I was referring to Sally, who is in the Fallout 3 Mothership Zeta DLC :) 
---
Bethesda knew what they were doing and used a positive history to dupe the client into buying something that was bad
---
Not free.  Xbox bought and bundled it.   Sad that this needs to be explained.  
---
&gt;Beth can‚Äôt really do much when it comes to items in game especially when it‚Äôs your entire stash
---
Why? It's their game on their servers. 
---
That‚Äôs how they get you. A few really good things on short timer after you‚Äôve already used your free atoms on other things. The team may be struggling with the creation engine but they know how to catch whales.

I set my pipboy flashlight to white and full brightness.
---
Guessing there's no build because you don't play? Or you made a mistake? Either way..meh.
---
Yes, pull them out one at a time or they will condense into one turn in, and 20+ bites at the apple are better than one.
---
I think you mean X. Yes B. No but it's really yes Y. Sarcastic yes which can be anywhere from actual sarcasm to a straight up threat A. Ask for more information, and say yes.
---
Both of those are games I will not be preordering, regardless of bonuses.
---
The finger-pointing of which studio to blame is an idiotic game. Regardless of who was technically hands-on with 76, Bethesda management and Howard in particular knew exactly what they were doing, with every decision they made.
---
Trust broken. I‚Äôm done with this ‚Äúpaying for the privilege to beta test for a year‚Äù bullshit.
---
I get my 60 buck a million times over from games like Fallout 3,4,NV, Halo1-4, Witcher 3. You know, games with story, and content. Even on the multiplayer scene I still play and get my money out of CoD, Battlefield, and some games I play with others on my laptop, hell even minecraft. Buying a $60 game should not only hold you for 3-4 months, but it should for much longer. It should be expected, it isn't hard to release a finished game, push good product related to it to boost intrest, to release constantly new content. 
---
The FO76 world itself is amazing.
---
It's shame that your bosses destroyed this game with greed and bad decissions.
---
They could probably do that if it was only on PC, but the red tape for patching a console game and wanting to keep them in line probably makes it easier to do a large patch rather than a lot of little ones.
---
I'd would be neat to see like a super leader scorch where those crystal growths form some sort of intimidating armor.
---
I've run that side quest 5 times with a normal clown outfit and it still won't complete, even tried a different Wendigo, the one in the named cave, without results. I'm on PC.
---
A **full** set of assassin's armor and healing factor? And he was still eating through the slap shield too fast for you to log out or get some distance? Was that all you were using? No Lone Wanderer, Med-X, Dodgy, Serendipity, Nerd Rage, hotkeyed stimpaks? Methinks you were totally un-prepared for what to do when encountering a high-level griefer. Well, now you know I guess. Hotkey Stims and that Med-X, run Lone Wanderer, and next time you will be fine.
---
Sadly all perks only work when you got the Items with you in your inventory, so all perks to keep food longer fresh won't help with your stash :/
---
PErsonally, I have enough trash in my inventory, I don't want to play as the wandering grocery.
---
Free Fallout76 https://imgur.com/gallery/3ff9IiT
---
Much WOW. 
---
I got one for a workshop defend on my alt and bought one from Harpers on the main pre patch, havent seen it since the patch, but I havent really been on either.
---
My recent list always clears when I close the game on PC, is that the same for console?
---
same here, I can't fathom all these players that live in their PA.
---
There's a bird watching spot in the North West of the forest, a camp full of fallout 4 child of atom glowing bottles, that mentions this. For some reason all of the birds have fled west virginia, and it's implied that the people there believe birds have gone extinct. It was actually a nice explanation to a missing mechanic. 
---
Not asking or expecting you to flag anything. You can easily do word searches using Google or Reddit's own search engine to find old posts. I do it all the time when trying to find out things about FO76 glitches. 
---
Clearly you are determined to defend your position to the very end. In this ae in which alternative facts are acceptable, that seems to be the norm. Seriously though, I have seen Russian chatbots on twitter make more compelling cases than you have. 
---
Did they ever patch barbarian not working with egg head and stretched genes?  I got rid of egg head to be able to use barbarian, so idk.
---
You want the game?
---
Then get the game.
---
I love the Lovecraft stuff in Fallout! Badum Tz
---
This is really a stupid rule.. Fallout related discords should be allowed. #changethestupidrule
---
I believe it‚Äôs because they would have to revert the servers to the time you had the items or because if there‚Äôs no record of the items being removed from your stash then they don‚Äôt know what to give you back
---
It's literally Chinese new year...
---
I've pretty much hit a roadblock regarding carry weight. My only real end game content has been finding and hoarding chems and alcohol but I' going to have to become extremely selective in what I acquire. 
---
The problem isn't even the Stash. I have space in there. The problem is that perks do not affect stash weight. We're all playing backwards. Ideally I'd like to store my 2000 chems and 40,000 5.56mm. I only need a small percentage on any one outing.
---
You Veggies trying to take away my Yao Guai rips and Deathclaw Stakes are the reason I openly carry a minigun.
---
&gt;It obviously works: a post shitting all over Scorchbeasts is the top of the sub and gilded, less than a week later we have news of a patch incoming to fix it.
---
Being critical of the game is different than railing on community managers in a personal way.
---
I just picked up one of these (Lv 45, 315 DAM) from a treasure map in The Mire. 
---
Thanks for checking. I'll be away from my PS4 for the foreseeable. How odd Marathoner doesn't work.
---
But aiming at a target isn't effected by accuracy stat. Range will effect the shot impact and damage. But there hasn't been a case yet that I shoot at a target standing still and I miss it.  Hip fire for anything but point blank range is the only stat that is actually effected based on my experiences both in this game and FO4 which it takes most of the combat from. 
---
It could be level based. At level 100, they play can craft and use 1* weapons and armor. At level 500, 5* items. This gives a reason to grind out the levels. 
---
Braxsons Quality Medical Supplies, east of Dyer Chemical.  I scrapped all the human bones in there and received 180 bone shards in one trip
---
You deserve gold, a shame I'm a brokeass dude.
---
True but as they have done before they drop the patch update onto PC a week prior to find all the fuckups it caused. If they just released them as they come to PC fix any issues that arrive from the fix it could then be release them to consoles in a bigger group after a dozen or so fixes have been tested on PC it could work. Because right now the here everybody we did a thing and then following weeks of you dun fucked your own game how could you do that. Probably won't happen to much.
---
You're absolutely correct!! xD happy Reddit birthday, btw!!
---
Well at least bugs are rare.
---
I'm still playing because I'm enjoying the game. It's nothing close to what it could, or should, be, but I still find enjoyment in what's there. Honestly, Stomping around in power armor and shooting mutants in the face with plasma guns is always entertaining.
---
80% now on F76 in most places I've looked.
---
I did find a BOS plan out in the wild, but not at a vendor, today.
---
Prototype is only the paint on it :) it exist only the normal x01
---
Two shot is now 1.25 shot they need to update the name of it in game. 2 shot is implying double damage..... 
---
Month 3: Still no fridges to be found.

Oh thanks

~~Battlecry Studios~~  Bethesda Game Studios Austin is probably being cleared out or re-purposed right now. After they wasted how many years on Battlecry before Bethesda pulled the plug on it, they now screwed the pooch on Fallout 76. Forcing Big Bethesda to come in and help prep the game for launch way before it was ready and then Todd Howard goes on stage to push the product hard and comes out looking like a Peter Molyneux knock off.
---
I'd be surprised to see ~~Battlecry Studios~~  Bethesda Game Studios Austin Studio Director Doug Mellencamp's name on anything after this. Sorry man but you done fucked up. And given how badly they've been handling post launch, I also wonder how many people there in Austin have been relocated to other projects or divisions.   
---
I'd be happy to be proven wrong here, but I expect them to support F76 for long enough that they won't get sued by customers for dumping a garbage product on the market, then abandon it and either disolve BS Austin, or put them in charge of support tasks like what EA did to BioWare Montreal after they fucked up Mass Effect Andromeda.   
---
Do you know how much a lvl 50 set would go for?
---
I guess we'll see, right? If you're right, we'll see some incredible things coming up, for sure. For what it's worth - I hope a million times over, that you're right :D
---
Oh God, don't go giving me 
---
Wouldn't be surprised if Bethesda is thinking - "Starfield needs to be perfect, let's cut our losses on FO76, leave a skeleton crew to maintain it and fully focus our efforts on the next thing"
---
You have 5 according to the Google machine.

Goddamn, y'all are so into drama with Bethesda, everything is so intense.  Why can't this just be a game that is getting a slow start?  It's not even been three months yet and you're calling for the game to be taken out behind the shed and shot.
---
I wish you all would either chill or just quit and stop posting these long drama posts where you armchair-analyze everything and inflate every little issue.  You care far too much about this stuff *and that is what's going to kill the game.*
---
Man, that would be something, wouldn't it?!?
---
Keep pacifist off and have non explosive guns in your wheel. That way you don't init other players, only the one you want. Had a couple of guys try to blow open my friends trap base, but he fried them up just a minute before. Was a 2fer and we were laughing how salty they were. I blew them both away in one shot and they stopped. A lot of these guys just need to be educated that they are the bottom of the food chain. Don't steal their bags, they poor.
---
The level 100 something he fried up right before that had me rolling. She was stiming over and over and tried to logout. His trap is so full proof it's unescapable xD You could feel the rage as she logged into another server bagless.
---
If you see your camp is under attack, best to just farm them until they stop or logout if it's a godroll. The godrolls can still be killed, they need to move some time. Go stealth and wait, let them level the camp. Reading the gamma gun works too, but I'm not convinced. Haven't tried it. 
---
You really keep lock pick and hacker perks slotted full time?  Major waste of perks slot.  A single rank 3 rifleman card is also a waste when you get more return on rank one of each of the three cards.   
---
I have the opposite bug. Where it says my friends are online but they aren't. When I try to join them I get an infinite loading screen as the world they are in doesn't exist as they are offline. 
---
I second the more likely king's screach being too agro. But farting Yao GUI would be the best thing ever üòÇ
---
Do you know if Revenant factors in? Or Tenderizer?
---
At this point a true-to-physics flashlight would cause server crashes, I imagine.  :/
---
This is the best suggestion i have heard for making this game interesting without needing to introduce a whole new mechanic.
---
I am on PS4, so this isn't an option for me.
---
Too expensive.
---
Same issue here, even inside Whitespring and other neutral areas I go right to caution when I crouch.
---
Mole rats.
---
Not more but about the same, FO4 was incredible in my opinion, this game is good but with a lot of unnecessary limitations FO4 didn't have. We couldn't pretty much do anything in FO4, the game is still fun and worth while if you can look past the poor design decisions, bad patches, nerfing etc. 50% of the game is great, the other 50% is very questionable, worth getting on sale.
---
I have a spreadsheet similar to this, with inventory for every vendor. The difficult thing is that some plans are, and others are not static depending on the vendor. For example, you can always find the Fusion Generator plan at Watoga Station, but there is a small variance in other CAMP plans, and even the Combat Armor plans.
---
I'm in the process of completing 10 server hops for each vendor in order to test the variance in their inventory. My spreadsheet below has all of the plans and prices I gathered from a single visit to every vendor. The information will be updated and re-formatted as I learn more and find better ways to present the information.

---
u/Kingdeath9 Please let me know if you want to team up on this project.
---
youve missed the point of the wall.... its to troll and block turrets
---
Not much, only full modded with cal shocks and Jet pack maybe 2-3k caps 
---
"It's a trap!"
---
Seriously, it is best to take your time and experience it from your own perspective.
---
Oh hey I made a big comment about this a few days ago, glad it's catching on.
---
This talk of 'damage arcs' has me even more worried. Base damage being linked between weapon categories?
---
I'm wondering if they balanced weapons against each other according to dps and linked them together with these damage arcs. But then didn't fully appreciate the greater effect of resistance on lower base damage, or realise just how high resistances get, which simply cannot be reconciled with balancing according to calculated dps.
---
I'm convinced people implementing enemies with higher resistances with each levelled variant didn't communicate with people implementing weapons and these linking damage arcs.
---
Maybe they didn't realise the alien blaster or lmg would end up having a way lower dps because of lower base damage and now it's a difficult process to correct them.
---
What about just normal nothing on it
---
I haven't really played much in a few weeks, but this game could potentially be my favorite game ever if they would just get their shit together.
---
I love the Fallout universe and the post apocalyptic themes.
---
I like survival.
---
I like having a player home.
---
I like looter shooters.
---
I like a casual MMO experience, in that people are there, I might see them, but grouping to progress isn't a daily issue.  I like real people in my world, but I just won't interact with them directly all the time.
---
FO76 has all these things going for it.  It just needs balanced, bug fixed and they need show us future plans.  I told some people I didn't think the game would be bug free until spring at launch.  At the time I thought I was being a little pessimistic, but hell, I don't think its going to be bug free until summer now, and that's a big maybe.
---
Its crazy just how bad and slow all this has been going.  Does Todd think he is just going to pop out of whatever hole he has been hiding in and start promoting Starfield later this year like this debacle never even happened?
---
I am not a dev so I dont know if it would be easier to work on patches in tandem and release in a batch or try to keep tract of a bunch of little patches.  For all we know they do the big patches because patching one thing flows into the next. sorta like the joke of programming is the act of squashing one bug to cause 5 more.
---
The chainsaw went from amazing to terrible gag weapon. Beth has a habit of ruining good weapons.
---
Same on Xbox. Now I occasionally play it, but just hunt the noobs 
---
Well how about that. Lived here literally my entire life and have never heard a single one of those mentioned in 39+ years.
---
Fire ants were a scientific mistake I thought.
---
Letterator
---
Is it hard to believe that other people might actually like the game and be willing to support it?  Sometimes you need to crawl out of your own head and consider that you are not the average player.
---
i‚Äôve always wondered this myself. 
---
You don‚Äôt really join any of them.  You‚Äôre just doing what it takes to circumvent their processes to reclaim the area. 
---
I feel unless it‚Äôs and MMO 3-4 months on one game in a row is pushing the limits of anything created. I have never in my life and I am 33 have I ever bought a 60 game and expected it to hold my interest for months and months. But I do get what your saying and not defending developers. But games have cost $60 for a long long time and only recently (past 10 years) really started to become massive open world types. So I can see both sides but also at the same time feel it is unrealistic to expect that type of life span out of any game. 
---
Would say maybe 500~1000
---
but you can craft stable loot boxes from them, which are better than raw ones
---
This is exactly what I suspect. üíØ%
---
I'm a pessimistic bastard but I doubt it.   
---
If they were planning a big content DLC like vault content, given how many people are jumping ship they'd be pushing and hyping that stuff like crazy.   
---
If people are playing, they might spend money at the Atom Store, they might convince other people to buy it. But if people are uninstalling it and abandoning the game? Well, that's bad press and no chance of getting any more money out of them.   
---
Hyping DLC would keep people playing. I mean they're trying to do just that with PVP mode. Though if I was trying to sell it, I'd be pushing HARD and doing a PR blitz. Bring in top players and youtube personalities for an early play through of the mode and stream it.
---
Yup, I do, and it causes me no issues whatsoever.
---
You know the Charisma perks, I very often slot in Hard Bargain and unslot Lone Wanderer and then forget. You know how many issues that has caused me?
---
None.
---
It's a lazy do anything build. And it works.
---
I don't know, but I'm PC. I hope it's not cleared out :(
---
I'll play with you.
---
dude works like 24/7, probably took a smoke break. chill
---
They dont allow us even to change the color and u want more than that? Hahs
---
Asking for feedback doesn't mean they are sitting around not doing anything with outstanding issues.  The two are not related like you imply.
---
IRL where I am, we hunt and kill feral cats for sport.  A matter of perspective.
---
I'm going to replay Fallout 4. I didn't get around to a really good replay after the last of the DLC came out. Seems like a better way to get my Fallout fix than 76. It's just become boring now, and I'm only level 51.
---
Mole miners always end up taking me like 3 magazines per kill. It's absurd. And then I go to loot and it's just "oh yeah, thanks for the 5 rockets and a spoon."
---
Not sure of your system, but if on PC memory's glitches can be horrendous... Make sure that you system ram is as stable as possible
---
Okay thanks
---
I think the burrow mechanic with the Molerats is a bit excessive, why are they able to get through concrete and asphalt, and why are they able to pop out in areas that are not in contact with the ground? I've seen them coming out of a 2nd floor that was just a wooden floor.
---
[this PC](https://www.wepc.com/builds/best-gaming-pc-under-500/) is $535.00 AND you now have a PC to use for school work. AND you dont have to Pay to play with your friends online. AND you can play old games without having to buy another console, this PC i linked will be good for years and if need be can be upgraded. I can keep going on but you wont care, it goes against your established ideas of why PC is bad. Also I dont need to be empathetic to anyone. also the Size of the case is 15.35 x 8.07 x 14.96 inches while a Xbox one X is 12 x 5 x 16.5 inches that a difference of 3.35 x 8.07 x 2 inches. anyway my PC was very helpful in College my XBOX not so much.
---
What?  No, it should work just like it does and prevent anything that could get you roped into PvP when you don't want to.
---
I do remember listening to the holotape about that bit. Was pretty cool to run across.
---
/u/33Games The clusters are scorchbeast nests. Each one is littered with scorchbeast guano.
---
North west part of the map has a super mutant area that's a static spawn with lots of bones all over the place.
---
Mothman shrine next to the water  has bones in a butterfly shape as well.
---
So if it works so well then why elicit feedback?  
---
Found him *across* the river before. Dude went for a casual stroll through the wasteland I guess
---
Is it just deleted... Wha-wha... 
---
Maybe uninstall too?
---
Gulped are op. They are bullet sponges and a half.
---
I was asked the same by gf at launch. I was so fucking hyped and ready for more Fallout. Then when it droped i actually loved the style so to say, but the execution is so damn bad that i cant say i love it like i expected to! 
---
Awesome! I loved the references to Lovecraft (he is one of my favorite authors). One of my favorites has to do with saving a certain painter named Pickman at his art gallery. Knowing that there could be some greater lovecraftian surprise beneath it all makes it all the more tantalising. Great work!
---
Behemoths do exist, but I only saw one outside of white springs. Once.
---
Agree. At first I thought it was cool but yeah at the sake of ruining chems it‚Äôs just useless. Especially with the ooc healing. 
---
&gt;Why can't you just add an option for a flashlight on your shoulder or  head and do away with the pip boy flashlight if you're not going to even try? 
---
You can wear a mining helmet if you want the light on your head. it will also give you a more natural light colour rather than the green Pip-boy light.
---
Got any pics you could PM me? Wanna check it out before I try it
---
Power Armor is not even the best build. With perks regular armor is way better and it pretty much IS mostly for Whitesprings nuke farming. Its just the easiest thing to run because its every where.  
---
No thanks.  Doesn't sound like fun to me.
---
My hopes and dreams, is that they have a small team working on these bug fixes, and the majority of the team is working on some big expansions that they do every few months. I know I am being super hopeful, but give me some more faith in them.
---
That's what u call a bundle
---
No. I just got the game Sunday, after running a replay of 3, NV, and 4. I am enjoying the game, but it's not as entertaining solo as 4. Also not as annoying - that asshole Preston isn't constantly sending you off to the same settlements over and over.
---
They stated in the ptach notes that most but not all plans will be static now. Electric chair plan is probably one of the ones not static.
---
but hey at least the crybabies can't complain that peopel are 1 shotting legendary mobs and TSEs are op
---
i wonder where are all the people that complained about TSEs ,not playing the game obiviously since its so dead
---
I am playing one more character to do all the quests with all SPECIAL at 1. It can get annoying not having any picks for perks and relying on perk packs for perks.
---
I once stumbled upon a Megasloth and it had babies! Shame a deathclaw also loaded in, they were all pretty dead by the time I got there. I imagine the babies were always dead though and just a prop in this random encounter. 
---
As long as they can, for some reason, get those big early dollar pledges down on the books to keep anyone with a stake in the company, and especially those looking into it, flags up at least to half-mast it works for them; am I right?
---
[Yeah well...](https://i.imgur.com/ytIjCGh.gifv)
---
I doubt they are going to drop their in-flight plans for this random idea.
---
But the pvp mode is easier to pump out, if they are going hype vault content and its not ready until end of this year people will just complain, its why ignorance is bliss. But, yeah I'm wondering if vaults are even coming at this point in the game. We still don't even have player vending machines even though they were in the beta for short time.
---
Ok so after finally getting my hands on a combat helmet, I realized that what actually happened was that I unlocked the paintjob for the helmet. But this raises another issue: that the unlock message is really vague when it comes to what the mod is actually for. This is most noticeable with armor mods. 
---
That said, there are other pressing issues related to plans, that disproportionately affect armor mods, but I know you guys have now at least been made aware of the situation.
---
Thank you for your response, and activity in the subreddit.
---
Were u in a dead nuke zone? If there were a bunch of ppl there on the server the legendaries would be pouring out of the golfclub..it's very meh when no one is really there 
---
It's exactly the same for me. I have two friends irl that play fo76, but both are on console. One has a PS4 and the other has an XB1, so none of us can play together. In some ways I kind of wish it was cross-platform. Then again, it seems like every time I see a post about griefing it's always on console. It's like the PC community are a lot friendlier. So far I haven't had anyone murder me or mess with my camp. 
---
I understand what you mean about the company of others. It's a lot of fun when several people take part in the same event. Hardly anyone is chatting, but everybody is working together. 
---
But a lot of the copies were returned so did they really make money back that was spent.
---
That made me laugh to hard for no reason. Thank you.
---
Couple quick things:
---
1. Lockpick can be swapped in as needed. No need to keep them ON all the time. That frees up 3 points to spend elsewhere.
---
2. Intelligence tree. Same basic thing, swap the hacker/scrapper perks in as you need them. You absolutely need Gunsmith perk. Both to craft and keep your guns from breaking every other reload. 
---
If you are using the mindset of never swapping perks, you have gimped your ability to make/mod/repair guns and/or armor. You will not be able to use mods purchased from vendors (you still have to have the requisite skill to equip). It looks like you are wanting to use energy weapons (Batteries included perk). Wet paper sacks have more durability than energy weapons.
---
Honestly... it is just kinda all over the place. You can carry a lot of junk/meds/food and have permanent mutations though.
---
I'm not trying to rip your build apart, if you are having fun, then that is all that really matters. But there is a lot of optimization to be had in there even as a "generalist" build.
---
I believe that one should always SOLICIT feedback ;)
---
If it's not for you, that's fine.
---
Perhaps in the future FO76 will become a min/max game, but at this time, it's not. As a theorycrafter, I hope it does, tbh, but it is what it is.
---
We might still get some new players....hopefully.
---
I just wanted to share what 280 levels have taught me. It's that you can play with quite a bit of QOL and not worry about it.
---
Did that seriously steal the jam out of your donut?
---
Idk... My 2 cents: 
---
it is really hard to sort out real glitches from people with faulty hardware...
---
No the thing in luckyhole mines head kinda looks like cuthulu https://youtu.be/AyISnBkUSRY This thing
---
Turns out you were right. Finally got a combat helmet (so much server hopping...) and had BoS as an option.
---
I‚Äôll be moving on soon to Division 2 and Sekiro pretty soon unless there is a massive update which fixes all the major issues and adds new weapons, locations, quests, gameplay mechanics, and private servers.
---
Pretty sure the mayor for a day quest has a scorchbeast coming out of one of those.
---
The real reason we need cross play
---
You know, I occasionally feel a little sympathy for the Scorched. When they haven't detected you their suffering is obvious.
---
Of course, then they see me and all just run straight into my face, even the ones with ranged weapons. 
---
I need to talk to his manager. 
---
i'm looking at the deal out of curiosity and it also includes 500 atoms as an "xbox exclusive".
---
Oh man, I'd give anything for that to be true. This wasn't a hate-post. It's a realistic post. But we can dream, can't we?
---
whatever you say, Karen.
---
Yes, I remember that! =]
---
Yes I do not get why people don‚Äôt remember we are here to always watching
---
Sort of an extreme form of Caveat Emptor ü§™
---
Me too! I hope they keep exploring this!
---
Where is the confusion?
---
Geniuses like you are the reason why so much misinformation and hate gets spread about this game. 
---
It has been like three months dude...f‚Äôk me people are dramatic
---
I have, it was beyond expensive 20k+ for one. Some robot in watoga city. 
---
How did you know my name? Dam Internets. 
---
Wut. You read it wrong. Good job spreading more bs about this game though. 
---
Maybe all they have are sloths...
---
That, I'm not at liberty to say üòÇ
---
Drama? No. I'm taking the piss mate.
---
Haha , the realism was just too good.  
---
They made the game desolate and boring just like a true nuclear fallout..
---
I still enjoy it and try to get every mutation ( i want) i have 10 for now :)
---
i have the same problem too, my base doesnt even have walls, but i place crafting stations too close together and they cant be used.
---
ITV has been skimpy every single week since launch, so it's not really that surprising. We haven't had even a hint at any new content since launch, a game that was supposed to follow gw2's formula for a living game world etc etc. They are not following the model they themselves pitched to us which is why people are angry.
---
Finally found a combat helmet, and verified that that was what I unlocked it for.
---
I'm intrigued, what's your char name???
---
I'm thinking something like Manly-manlieson
---
I'm pretty sure I could balance the energy weapons (or at least get them closer to balanced) in about 4 hours with no prior experience with the engine. I'm not sure why no one has been tasked with doing this yet considering how simple it is to tweak the numbers.
---
It's fun to use in the dark for visuals, but garbage otherwise
---
There is a Behemoth in a lake near Huntersville, I believe.
---
I found the plans for the ashtray inside whitesprings today. 
---
Bethesdas promises about the future are pretty much worthless these days, though.
---
Can people stop having these attention needing posts. 
---
If you need attention, you can get some by helping someone in real life. 
---
Go volunteer somewhere they need help.
---
Ive done Mayor for a Day. Have my All Rise. Its not permanent. Every time i walk in, robots exit their workstations and are all red.
---
If someone is a good enough shot to hit you through a stealth boy then no stealth will do you much good. 
---
Can I have your shit? 
---
Why did you feel the need to imply everyone who isn‚Äôt positive about the game isn‚Äôt normal?
---
That makes me sad. I have a decent stash built up, but I think it's only around 10k caps.... And considering that I have two CS-modded T-60 legs already, it's going to be tough to swallow dropping 40k on two X-01 legs...
---
Blah blah blah...remember the good ol‚Äô days. Most of the people that will play this game have not even bought the game yet. 
---
Can you maybe go out and do something if value for a stranger? Maybe volunteer at a center or just help someone that looks like they are struggling.
---
Instead of sitting around looking for posts and comments to reply to like this.
---
&gt;Edit 5: Silver? Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit!
---
What is this suppose to mean!?
---
Thanks for the thought, just trying to help "right the ship"
---
*Another one*
---
#DJ KHALED!
---
Never even seen one. 
---
I come from a Different&amp;D background so I come up with characters literally so his name is Ken Reyes, Johnathan Hill is another Fallout character I play who exclusively uses revolvers and long rifles in NV
---
Ghouls with guns! Except they are also objectively the easiest to fight too, since half of them stand out in the open half petrified, and none of them react to their buddies having their heads blown off.
---
Also, the variety of weapons used against us is absolutely boring. Pipe rifles, hunting rifles, assault rifles, the pump, double and combat shotgun, charging laser snipers, and very rarely miniguns or missile launchers.
---
How about we fight some enemies using gamma guns, radium rifles, handmade rifles, flamethrowers, gatling guns, grenade launchers or machine guns? I can accept enemies not using plasmatech or the more advanced heavy laser weapons (unless we got some scorched BoS or raiders in Power Armor).
---
I mean, why do high level super mutants still use automatic pipe rifles? Why not 50 cal machineguns and auto grenade launchers? That will make the muties intimidating and give them some suppression ability, especially if suiciders were more common. I have only fought one suicider ever. Nothing makes me more anxious than the beeping of a suicider mutant that i cant find while getting pinned down by a couple overlords with miniguns.
---
Sadly it appears that CAMP plans are still somewhat randomized. I've found the Cooler plan at Sutton and Pleasant Valley Station a few times, but it's possible that it can appear anywhere.
---
You can continue getting INT perks even after you've maxed INT, just scroll left or right on the level-up perk selection screen. Check the hotkeys at the bottom of your screen if you're not sure now.
---
I wish someone on ps4 nuked prime.zero since the patch 
---
Hey!
---
Thanks for your thoughts :)
---
So to point 1 - I keep it on simply for convenience. It's not essential, and yes of course I can spend those points elsewhere. Can you suggest something? :)
---
To point 2 - I absolutely DON'T need the gunsmith perk. I can swap it in when I am modding a gun, and the breakage rate is seriously not a problem. I do swap in Weapon Artisan to repair, which gives me 200% durability. Maybe I should update the guide.
---
I am not using the mindset of never swapping perks - I swap all the time, when I need to. But I try to keep it to a fairly low level of swaps. Int 6 allows me to swap in maximum repair and crafting abilities. I can even wear unyielding armour if I want to really max the Int.
---
I just....don't. Can't be arsed. Not needed.
---
Zero interest in energy weapons, by the way. If you read either the perks (short) or the writeup (long, I admit) didn't clarify this, I don't really know what will?
---
The point to the build is that optimisation is not needed. Stepping away from min/max was kinda the whole idea :)
---
Actually, as a bloodied melee player I NEED weaker weapons for legendary farming. It is fun where super mutants cry out 'RETREAT!' and 'RUN AWAY!', but then they don't dont legendary loot.
---
So maybe have an enclave quest to redistribute birds
---
If you can loot or even buy legendaries from the merchants, it really negates the need for crafting. It's almost completely wasted.
---
You're probably right.
---
Yes, that's true. But I think the clusters are more than that. In the one at ground level (in the Civic Center), you can find and search a "Scorchbeast Nest". It's an asset, it's part of the gameplay. I think the giant "clusters" are something else. https://i.imgur.com/4mOtWtu.png https://i.imgur.com/vg5MTWt.png
---
Break up posts are sad. Claiming you are a filthy casual and posting a break up post is sadder. ‚ÄúWe are not an airlines. No need to announce your departure.‚Äù
---
For you, yes.
---
I noticed this also, but I think diseases happen less often than without the perk. I eat 1-2 and nothing happens, I eat 5+ and get something 
---
A fully modded Handmade weighs over 20 pounds. A real SVD Dragonov weighs about half that if I'm not mistaken. It's absurd. It's the same weight as a Guass Rifle...
---
Hey FnordBear, what platform do you play on?   I‚Äôm on PC.  Would be glad to hang with a fellow old gamer who played all the fallouts!  Leash is my name in game.   Hope to see you on sometime. 
---
You can actually find the source. Look around a bit. 
---
Glad you got your closure :) now I‚Äôm jealous. No matter how much combat armour I scrap it‚Äôs never unlocked the bos helmet for me. I‚Äôve got every other variety. Currently wearing shadowed as a stand in. 
---
I know they said the servers will be online forever but it‚Äôs so very hard to gain back the trust of a player base that has moved on or even worse discounted the notion from the bad publicity. I can‚Äôt help but feel like sea of thieves, first days were good but then it dawned on people what was there to do, people left and with new games being released they forgot about it
---
Succulent. Underappreciated word. 
---
Nah man, I'm willing to bet there'll still be shitters bitching about getting one shot from a TSE out of combat when it was probably just somebody who abused the terribly implement workshop PVP mechanics to instakill them with a VATS crit burst that they'll then inevitably blame on TSEs that clearly weren't hit hard enough by the nerf bat with 1/4^th and 1/5^th of their original effectiveness on top of nerfing the Demo Expert perk when even the old Demo perk wouldn't even be worth using on the now +1/5^th base damage "legendary" effect while the actual vanilla explosive weapons were still shit even with Demo at +100% damage.
---
Vats maybe but you can use the two shot without needing vats to shoot. 
---
They all be red, but they won't attack.
---
People I interact with Reddit who I would meet to trade feel like genuinely decent human beings . All the randos who ever have come across my camps tended to be complete assholes
---
Are you on PC? We could work out a trade or something?
---
That should keep you set for a while. 
---
Explosive is bugged with both. Tbh I would go with aiming damage on AA and faster fire rate on Furious. I say these two because those are some of the only ones that will increase in obvious DPS. However! Instigating and Bloodied also both still work with Explosive, and TSE is probably still best for shotguns
---
Oooooh this should be good.
---
Hear hear, Bethesda.
---
 I give things away freely, so I‚Äôve never had a bad trade experience, but I‚Äôm seeing more and more people who are getting ripped off for their caps and loot because y‚Äôall never really made the trade system and it‚Äôs rules clear and simple, not to mention accessible. It‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúlearning on the go,‚Äù which sucks I‚Äôd assume.
---
Butter my biscuits son. 
---
Yeah, you kinda had that coming if you took the munitions factory. That place isn't even worth the hassle though. You can get way more ammo by scavenging/mining and crafting your own, especially with the excavator armor. In the time it takes the factory to produce like 50 bullets, you can have gathered enough materials to craft hundreds or thousands of rounds.
---
&gt; I feel the tse nerf was needed
---
and now after the TSE nerf no one plays 4head
---
Dont worry, it not the game.. its you
---
They sure do attack my ass. I did it about 80 levels ago too. Who knows maybe mine waa bugged. it doesnt bother me because of my troubleshooters unarmed that melts em anyway
---
No, they are not completely static, not for *all* plans. Harper‚Äôs ferry, for example, had a rotating option of ONE sturdy/heavy combat armor plan. I can‚Äôt confirm any beyond that but I‚Äôm pretty sure that there‚Äôs other variations as well. 
---
PC master race here!
---
Not sure. 5k?
---
Wait, you'd challenge any kind of IRL bear?! I wouldn't know which runs away because it's a bear..
---
Nah ps4. It‚Äôs aight, eventually the rng gods will shine on me and I‚Äôll get it 
---
And? Even if they were people are going to post about what they want to post about. If you don‚Äôt want to read it go elsewhere.
---
Do we know how they're bugged, specifically? Is explosive just negating them? Reducing their effect?
---
Which based on their history would still be weekly or monthly. 
---
No ,you didn't. You bought the tricentennial upgrade. THAT'S $20. 
---
PA also bumps your Strength to 11 if it's below that outside the frame.
---

Just wanted to say that this is essentially what I would have said, only they did a far superior job compared to what I would've typed up lol. Based on the upvotes I'd wager that this is probably the community's view in a nutshell as well.  
---
Also kudos to you for playing Fallout Tactics. I loved that game and hope I don't like get downvotes for saying that.
---
Wow what a bellend.
---
Sounds like something strange is afoot at your circle k.
---
They will always be red to you since they are technically enemies to you, but they have been hacked/programmed to register you as a non-combatant. 
---
Ehhh you can choose to "*act* as anything from raiders to brotherhood of steel members." Kind of? But there's little to no context or space in the game to do that (also, "raiders" get called "griefers" and the game's punishment algorithm makes this RP choice almost completely prohibitive. But that is another discussion entirely). There are no guilds. There are no set factions. You can post something on Reddit with your picture and RP story, sure, and maybe even theme your CAMP to look like your favorite group, but other than walking around and wearing outfits of the factions you want to RP as, there's zero else you can do with that. And walking around with an outfit and RPing when there is no central user hub, or city, or faction-specific content, or endgame gets old very quick.  
---
\&gt; The story is one of those choices  
---
The story really doesn't give you any choices. You do the quests. You do the faction quests (and they're not even really faction quests, they're all just part of the main questline) to completion. That's it. Anything you're picturing or wishing for outside of that isn't actually there.  
---
With your comparison to FF and WoW, I think there is a line drawn in the sand between RPGs and MMORPGs. Most RPGs these days have dialogue, faction choices, and endings that change or karma level that changes or basically some consequence to your choices and how you behave. MMORPGs can't really do this, because an MMO obviously can't change its story based on the actions of one user (although I think MMOs like Guild Wars do have some game changes based on mass user behavior. WoW and ESO at least have one side or the other controlling points and territories. But again, another discussion). So instead, of those things, MMOs have player hubs, capital cities, end-game content, raids, raid bosses, guilds, battlegrounds, etc. You will notice that Fallout 76 does not have *any* of these things. It's not a survival game, it's not an RPG, it's not an MMO. It wants to be "its own innovative genre" and be all of those things, but instead, it struck out at all of them. There isn't even a central city or player hub where you have an excuse to interact with players at the beginning or end of your day's gameplay.
---
I know my problem has been only with vats. My build is based around vats
---
Fuck me, I'm glad you said it and I didn't have to!! I feel like I'd obviously need a ton of help to figure out the systems - but if I knew them like the back of my hand, like the devs? I feel like I could handle this on my lunch break. 
---
Here's the solution: set up a dart board (from the Atom Shop!!!) filled with damage numbers *higher* than they currently are. Throw dart. Type in number.
---
Solved.

As I haven't received a response regarding this bug, I just wanted to ping you guys again in case you missed this post.
---
Unless it's not a bug but then it raises questions as to why we were misinformed in the Inside the Vault post stating that vendor plans are no longer randomised.

That is a happy little camp

my all rise does just under 300 damage before my unyielding and nerd rage kick in. i can 1 hit almost anything on the ground at full health. gets wonky once i drop my health below 20%. it's fun trying to stay alive. "balanced" builds have me just standing there swinging non stop without even moving. i like playing with low health because it feels more difficult. X-01 armor and full health feels like i never die and hardly have to even try to stay alive.
---
Bug implies a defect in the software, while suggestion implies a design decision you don't agree with. I think including suggestions on a list titled 'bug roundup' will lessen the attention on the actual bugs we need fixed, especially if you lead off with non-bug suggestions such as 'rifles are too heavy' and 'we want screws and springs from scrapping stuff.'
---
Even the t-45 shocks were 21,450 each. It was whack. Other stuff is a lot cheaper now like camp plans those shocks though *sweat drops*. I did fine t45 CS mod just walking around as well.

=| true.
---
Yeah, personally I don't mind the story being told via consoles, notes, and tapes. Those and the skeleton/corpses being placed in odd situations always felt like the most interesting parts of 3, NV, and 4 to me. I know it's not for everyone, but I always liked stumbling onto them and then figuring out what had happened.
---
I never understand how can he put those square light without having the last wall sticking out and not aligned.
---
You can get the plans for the pa for free in the whitesprings military wing next to the modus that sell stuff is a couple of red terminals in there is a plan set for x01
---
Laughed. Out. Loud.
---
TSEs were the only form of endgame gear and only form of progression
---
they were the only counter to bullet sponges,broken scorchbeasts and making SBQ somewhat viable
---
Scorchbeast queen had no level checks no gear checks so anyone could join and make it harder to kill at least a TSE made sure that that you could solo carry to some degreee
---
TSEs were also the only way to dodge craftammo 76 
---
pvp is just garbage and i doubt anyone plays fallout for pvp
---
&gt;because they cant murder whole groups of enemies
---
thats the inevitable path in any mmorpg or game with character progression,you will eventually be able to stomp weaker enemies as you move to harder content
---
Definitely NMS has made a lot of progress.  But I played SoT last night, and had quite a good time with a couple friends.  They've definitely listened to the community, and made positive changes.
---
Something that it would seem like Bethesda is wholly incapable of doing at this point.  And that's so sad, because 76 has such *great potential*.  It's like another use said above, "They made something quick, to get a quick buck out of a bunch of thirsty fans" (I'm paraphrasing of course).  But that's exactly what it feels like.  This weeks ITV is being noted because of a lack of information, as well as the huge plug for the atom store.  It's sad.
---
many people gave Bethesda a chance improve the game. The latest patches and inside the Vault just show that the problem is not missing suggestions but some major issues with the development team. Everyone has some ideas on what could be different. This goes from minor changes to complete overhauls. This should also apply to the dev`s at Bethesda. One can only play the game for so many hours before being fed up with it, when there is no new content. Now is apparently the time for many.
---
I thought they were lazy when they added cars and you can't even drive them... just damn right stupid...
---
Its a game.. just enjoy it for what it is
---
I think I saw the T-45 and T-60 CS plans for around 6k or 8k from Phoenix. I'll have to check when I'm on tonight.
---
I just wish that there was a guaranteed place to buy the X-01 CS plans/mods, like there are for the T-45 and T-60 ones, instead of hoping that the RNG gods smile on you.
---
That's a terrible comparison.
---
This is the kind of post I like to see. Some interesting critiques with great suggestions. Made me think a bit and here's some stuff I thought up of to add to the conversation:
---
&gt;Scorched: These are virtually a cut/past job of the basic raiders from Fallout 4. They are boring and uninteresting to fight. Having them use different weapons and armor as you encounter higher level versions would be a welcome change. Having them drop the weapons they are shown to be using as well would be nice.
---
Some up-armored scorched would be amazing. Perhaps have some legendary variants for each zone of the map. Scorched Fire Breather for the ash pit with high energy/fire/explosive resist and utilizing a strong melee charge with a fire axe or perhaps wielding a flamer because otherwise flamers are essentially non-existent in the game. Perhaps a legendary BoS scorched wearing a PA frame with only a couple parts still attached. A Raider scorched wearing heavy raider metal armor that's just a bastard to take down. Anything to alleviate the repetitive cookie-cutter scorched. You could even have Rose provide notifications over the radio of events where these legendary scorched are spotted.
---
&gt;Ghouls: Fine as is. Not very interesting to fight.
---
I think they should revisit the FO3/NV style of ghoul, with the explosive pustule flinging Reavers and AOE radiation exploding Glowing Ones. Can you imagine running into a nuke zone and seeing a ton of Bloated Glowing Ones all running at you while letting off explosive AOE Radbursts? And it always bothered me how there are Feral Ghoul Roamers that don't actually...roam. They'd be solitary and extremely dangerous, maybe even wielding rotted armor and mangled fist/claw weapons (hence their capability to roam solo and not be obliterated by all the other muties in the wastes). 
---
&gt;Gulpers: These are essentially reskinned deathclaws that are less difficult to kill. Giving them some kind of unique mechanic would make them interesting.
---
I'd say give them a more slippery movement. Maybe even allow them (and anglers) to dive into ground of areas with water (whether it's actually deep enough for players to swim or not) to give them an environmental combat mechanic beyond just falling from a tree or popping up from a single hiding spot. Perhaps give them a high resistance to melee due to their slippery hide and a tail whip or rapid rolling attack. They always struck me as much more slippery and quick than Deathclaws and really ought to put their tails to more use since they don't have much else besides their gummy gaping mouths to attack with. 
---
You can‚Äôt get sad about being lonely on Valentine‚Äôs Day if you remember your lonely the rest of the year too
---
I'm pretty sure this is what they are. I've inspected them as well and they usually have a bunch of SB poo around them.
---
*yawns*
---
That is actually spot-on.
---
One secret I know about is supposedly there‚Äôs a terminal no one has found in FO4 that Todd Howard mentioned a little while after the game‚Äôs launch. People have theories on what it is and have also datamined all the terminal entries and haven‚Äôt found anything that was undiscovered, but who knows. 
---
Are you downvoting everyone who disagrees with you? Near every single person who seems to be happy with their purchase has negative karma on their comments?
---
How is the durability. All energy weapons I found either had offensively low damage, offensively low durability, or both. The aliens blaster is especially egregious. Who thought it would be ok for one of the rarest, most sought after energy weapons to do 4 damage?
---
I didn't read any of your post but the title, but I support this.
---
Oh my God the stash box. Why the hell didnt I think of that
---
as soon as days gone is released i'm out of this mess...
---
I've definitely been there. It's good, but sometimes there are a few too many "thank god for this sub!" posts for my liking. I want some nice chewy conversation about the game and possible improvements without too much salt or sugar poured on it. Probably just my problem for being too picky about it I guess. 
---
The way it was explained to me is only the ballistic part of the damage is anti-armor, the explosion effect/damage are not and depending on the mob a large chunk of the explosive damage is straight up ignored by the mob, this wasnt as noticeable pre nerf as the explosive damage was much higher.
---
Super muties - explosive effect gets largely negated same with SB/SBQ's
---
Ghouls/scorched - aoe does more damage because very low DR, but seldom do aoe hits insta kill post tse nerf where before that was frequent.
---
Yes please 
---
the cabin note makes a reference to it so probably.
---
I've had generally pleasant experiences with randos. One night, I kept running into the same group of players at various events. They all seemed to know each other, but were super friendly to me, and let me tag along with their group. 
---
I've had a few neighbors come check out my camp and give me a thumbs up or tell me that it looks nice.
---
I'm not taking this experience as a slam against the game or community in general. I know that these people exist, and I'm glad that, at least for me, it seems like they're the minority.
---
It's funny because I have had no problems fighting the queen or other scorchbeast.  TSEs where a crutch for people who didn't feel like actually learning how to set up a build and instead focused on one thing. How high they could get there TSEs damage to. I use a sniper/stealth vats build with an anti armor lever action. I can do alot of damage without needing a tse. If you dont think they where broken befor then tell me how being able to snipe enemies with a tse pump made since? They nerfed them to much maybe but it was needed.
---
Lucky bastard. Don't have a PS4 :*(
---
Great post. So much this! 
---
lol you must be one of the fan boys who rather pretend the game is doing the better then it is, wrapping yourself in a blanket of feelings and drinking the Kool-aid that Bethesda puts out. Plus why TF would i lie lol. He just got a message back from bethesda but it took 2 weeks for them to respond saying they are looking into it.
---
I have had some pretty funny moments with players that talk back, I think a majority of people just use discord.
---
&gt; but I guess it's just because that one's online,
---
Well obviously. Since Bethesda apparently bought into the whole "games as a service" trend but only the part where you keep giving them money for this game with "freemium"-ly overpriced paid content but not the actually providing a service for the rest of the game around that paid content evidently.
---
It's as if someone just showed F2P games, freemium mobile games, etc. to the special kid on the block while playing the *Here Comes the Money* intro on repeat to watch him fall flat on his face because he really wants the easy money, can't even put in the bare minimum that it takes especially when it's already built around such a popular IP, but still goes and does it anyway because money.

There was a post there about the zetans already being in the game. Someone found them and left some clues - first kill the flatwoods monster, then, an underwater hatch opens in a location-unmarked small body of water with a tree in the middle, near one of the factories.

I feel like we had  the same thoughts on a lot of this. Great write up. Great Job. Give this man some Atoms. 
---
You have a very different memory than I had. I remember anxiety and concern. 
---
I knew from the beta that this game was far from ready. It's the whole reason I waited a couple of weeks until Black Friday to purchase the game, knowing full well the game wasn't worth full price.
---
Ahh, gotcha, that makes sense! Thanks for your time.
---
I'd honestly not thought much about this, but a proper working fridge would be amazing in this game. I always crafted an ice box in FO4 specifically for storing foods and/or biological components. I suppose they either overlooked that as an idea or decided it wouldn't be conducive to a "survival" game where they want you to be traveling a lot. 
---
My friends and I left 76 for Skyrim Togeather and we're having a blast.

A few buddies and I should be launching a nuke later

Youre probably not pulling your weight during SBQs fights , i used to wasted around 2k ultracite ammo with 1k damage per shot TSE automatic handmade 
---
Scorchbeasts are killable sure but they are a waste of ammo and resources , might as well quit to main menu 
---
Its cute that you think youre pulling your weight in SBQ fights , you do you champ 
---
I want to see a radroach king. But, make him no larger than a standard radroach. That'd be humourous as well as ramp up the difficulty. Give him as much HP as the Scorchbeast Queen.

Try Skyrim Togeather

These are things I've noticed and been thinking of. The connection with the mining companies and what they might be trying to dig up or find.... Makes me like to think how that the Scorched plague (which is a symbiotic virus that takes over the host to spread itself) is related to the cult/Ug-Qualtoth. 
---
What if the virus itself is a portent or harbinger of Ug-Qualtoth, a pestilence that wants to spread itself and consume everything in oneness (like all the scorched moan about being "one of us" and oneness) and how the thorns and vines motif aesthetic also kinda appears on the scorched ppl's visual designs also.... 
---
Dark sacrifices of life and bodies are an integral part of this cult and rituals that seem to be summoning or worshipping Ug-Qualtoth. If you want to twist this all into an even larger conspiracy extrapolation, you could say that cultist elite in power (RobCo. mega corps, mining companies, industrial complex, politiicans) were seeking something and, perhaps, when found, were manipulating the world into nuking itself to death as the greatest and largest sacrifice of life to Ug-Qualtoth (and its return/rebirth?). Maybe a nuked environment and the plague are ways to make the world more hospitable for Ug-Qualtoth.
---
I'm reminded also of the Krivbeknih. [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Krivbeknih](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Krivbeknih) How legend talks about pressing that into the eldritch altar would cause all those of impure blood to have a fiery death.  Sure looks like those that suffered the scorch plague burnt up in petrified agony.  Hmmm....
---
Too right. It's like I try to stay in my bunker and avoid the harsh weather of the rage and circlejerk/whiteknight shills (whichever) and occasionally check the sensors to see if the conditions are safe enough to post, haha. 
---
A regression is not a small mistake, regardless of impact. It:
---
* Makes the development team look incompetent
---
* Shatters client confidence in the product
---
* Throws all existing timelines in the bin thanks to the new question 'Do we need to add contingency for fixing things that have already been fixed?'
---
Did you not go through Patch 5 and its hotfix? No. Test like crazy until you're ready to release and then inform us of the change.
---
I don't want death by a thousand invisible cuts. If I'm going to get sucker punched, I'd like to know that it's coming.
---
Bullshit I'm not pulling my weight.  I shot it with my leveler action while its flying switch to an anti armor explosive. 50 cal while shes landed. I clear up adds with a zelots tesla and regularly revive downed players.
---
Not necessarily. I know that I can sometimes see people who are invisible because they have an arrow on top of their head giving away their position. I'm wondering if Stealth plays a factor in whether or not the arrow shows up, or to what degree and distance. I've read somewhere that a person's Perception level determines their ability to detect Stealth. I'm just wondering if anybody knows to what extent Stealth and Perception combat each other in PVP.

Spoiled meat gives food for Herbivore and doesn't cause disease. I presume that means it counts as a vegetable. Do you get a food meter boost from eating spoiled meat as carnivore too?
---
Another complaint about complaints about complaints...
---
The miner's helmets were a thoughtful addition though.
---
Ahh.. didn't think of that, but then again i need my lead and steel lol :)
---
I would LOVE if we could make an archaeological society in the game.  
---
But berrriiieesss 
---
Yeah and how much ammo do you wsste per kill+ weapon durability?
---
Anti-Armor supposedly doesn't make the explosive damage ignore armor. This means that something with really high resistances like the queen are still ignoring most of the explosive damage. If Explosive is just damage added on separately from the shot, this would make sense.
---
For Furious it's a little more frustrating because explosive completely resets the Fury modifier. If explosive is just damage added on separately from the shot, this would make sense.
---
I'm glad you found a friend that's pretty awesome. But don't bash the game.You have nothing to do because you've already done it. (You wouldn't have put that much time into a bad game) My biggest complaint (and seems to be yours) is the short story. I'm certain Bethesda is working on new content just give it some time
---
This.
---
"I constantly get disconnected from the server" *has bottom tier $15 a month internet.
---
Luck of the Draw will help out with the durability.  I started using this a few days ago and have noticed my Gatling Plasma lasts much longer before it needs repair.   Or its a placebo but it seems to be working better for me now.  I can now solo clear the nuke launch bunker without it going out on me.
---
On PS4 is says "Max INT select another slot" (15 points basically) and wouldn't let me pull another card from that category, like there is no option to do so. So I hit Lvl 50 thinking I'll swap a INT point over to a different slot and pull up the INT selection wheel on the next level up. Nope, I'm stuck with all the BS cards that I don't want in INT that I already have and no ability to pick a new one.
---
He has a discord he answers questions on a lot or you can try messaging /u/jug9. https://discord.gg/gufSxDg

Hey champ, the people working on the atom store aren't the ones responsible for patches. Should they lay them off because it hurts your fee fees that they keep making more content?
---
I just like being able to see....
---
You do realise they're not going to answer this question. No CM in their right mind would even come close to touching this.
---
Head to Watoga and check?  Last time I looked, they were there nearly 100% of the time if not every time.  (I'm sub-30, so that doesn't answer the limit question).
---
Anyone you know that can try buying it for you?  I'd find someone who was looking for it anyway, in case it can't be traded or something.
---
So furious is negated by explosive, and anti-armor doesn't apply to the explosive effect. 
---
I would agree that this is the least aggressive form and I don‚Äôt necessarily have a problem with the atomic shop in and of itself like you said you can earn atoms in game but my main point was their priorities are whacked! Constant updates to the atomic shop with new shit to buy yet the game is a broken mess. I don‚Äôt WANT to pay more because the game isn‚Äôt enough at the moment. 
---
I didn‚Äôt forget call of duty 4s dlc the maps were pretty weak I liked broadcast and Chinatown tho but in cod‚Äôs case we were willing and wanted to pay that extra 15 cuz the base game was beasty. They did not deliver. As a Bethesda fan boy there is no way they wanted us to have this experience at launch and there are no excuses. Take the time out and make the game a functioning game instead of constantly updating the atomic shop even sometimes with OLD SHIT that was in the other games and putting them behind a paywall 
---
Consolidate all that time they‚Äôve spent updating and working on the atomic shop for these last 3 months and take that time and use that instead for working on the game. If that were the case do you think the game would be in a better state than it is now? This is an honest question too.
---
Not saying they couldn‚Äôt have updated it at all in that time frame but it‚Äôs pretty evident that they are more focused on accruing more money than more gamers to their game, let alone keeping the ppl that are still playing on it and entertained. I think they have a real gem here I honestly feel that this game has FARRRR more potential than execution and that‚Äôs because where their focus is. Where their focus is their time is. We can tell what they‚Äôve been focusing on. The atomic shop.
---
Like I said earlier *Priorities* 
---
The physical PC copy actually just came with a disk-shaped piece of cardboard with an activation code.
---
My quad explosive radium is collecting dust now too. What a shame that such a rare and unique weapon would be so weak. Mine has explosive and when it fails to kill super mutants before they get in my face......it damages me once they get too close.
---
It was a ton of fun to use pre nerf.
---
What you have to do is pick another stat other than INT and then when when you are about to select a card you scroll over to INT from whichever stat you selected. I do this regularly on PS4, so I know it's possible.
---
In the past beth Fallout games, there was always an area where you could fight more than 1 higher level enemy. Deathclaw sanctuarys namely, and the glowing sea in 4 as well had a tendency to fill this niche. Honestly, if we could get an event where we just fought hordes of deathclaws, that'd make me happy. The things are so iconic, and as it stands right now as a high level player, they're not really a threat when there's only one of them. Yes they still do a lot of damage, but you don't get this hectic scenarios where multiples of them are baring down on you, one alone is really easy to kite and shoot, or stagger with heavy melee.
---
Not all players are on pc.  A lot of us are on consoles and still experience bugs.
---
Yeah, you try opening a restaurant and see what you can serve with all your specialty ingredients spoiling in 15 minutes.  
---
We got soup.
---
To have endgame, you need to have game, first. So no.
---
The problem with getting rid of pvp is that greifer have taken the place of raiders (like random encounters in fo2). I don't like 'em, but they do serve a purpose.
---
Full Charge doesn't, but Power User does.
---
I know but it won't let me craft lvl 50 pa
---
You know these complaints about complaint posts are getting old. At least with the just complaining posts, they vaguely server some purpose. All your post does is show that you're frustrated. That's it.
---
You are pushing what you want the game to be onto a game that was never marketed to be such. you were told there were no npcs, they they expected players to fill that role. at the start everyone that want to complain talked about the game as an mmorpg complaining about how it did not fit that role (i even argued against the mmo portion) but once people got used to knocking down those talking points it got shifted to "survival game" or "shooter" anything to keep the complaining alive. (I dont mean you specificly I mean the argument on the whole)
---
You want faction quest and such? well you did the quests to join the Appalachian branches. go forth and become the npc. that is how it was (in my view) the game was made. for the community as a whole to engage with each other. you can see it in the events. like the power plants that temporarily  provide power if you complete the event or the civil war reenactment. Even if you do not consider this game a mmo it is most certainly not a single player game. 
---
as for raids well WoW only had 1 raid at launch. as does fo76. as for dungeons that depends on your views on if instanced buildings are dungeons or not.
---
I look forward to that!
---
 It was 15 - 20 for a long time, the 15 - 40 was a common misconception. Watoga Station, Phoenix and Wallace were where they showed up.
---
 Its different now, and I dunno what the deal is now, as I don't farm anymore. Its soul destroying and I have the ones I want. ;)
---
Only thing that eats ammo is the .50 cal. I can shred through the adds getting 5 kills with about 3 shots if they are clustered with the tesla.  And I can do a fare amount of damage while shes airborne with crit shots on her head with my rifle.  The SBQ needs to be altered some but that doesnt have anything to do with TSEs. 
---
I was just able to buy the electric chair plan from the Raider bot vendor at the R &amp; D station a few hours ago, and I'm level 132. Don't know if it's a static plan or not though.
---
There's one guy that likes to post these who has "quit" at least 4 times so far

Probably different people with a different job.  I doubt Jimmy the bug fixer is also Jimmy the VTU track suit designer.

Then you didn't buy it on Xbox. You bought a code from a person.

So then what? Move on from Reddit.

This is such a good point. Why the hell would you hold back exciting stuff if you're shedding users by the day?!
---
Lol. I know. 
---
Handmade plans are readily available at Watoga and I think Harper's too.
---
Amazing detective work there, time to run your diagnostics
---
Thank you!! =]
---
Woah woah wait arnt there already horde events and an entire wall of log damns
---
It really does seem like the fear-mongering and circle-jerking has been intensifying. Reasonable responses are drowned out by the "righteous fury" of "true fans". You'd think the game's been out in this state for a year now. 
---
Yeah, you've got a point there. I guess I was just hoping for some sort of communication or something outside of "We'll bring it to \_\_\_\_\_\_'s attention" or "We are aware of this". 
---
I dunno.  
---
Intrest in game wains, wild hidden storylines emerge. Nothing fishy here at all folks, just 1500 atoms and you can get your very own Ug-qualtoth extra-dimensional garbage formation for your camp!
---
Im joking OP. Kind of. But good work keeping us entertained through this games's "Early No Man's Sky" phase.
---
I bought this plan yesterday from the station right next to top of the world. Before yesterday though it had never shown up there before. Level was 155 or 156 when I bought it. 
---
thank you for [reminding](https://youtu.be/I_dzkIwa-Z8?t=18) me.
---
Well, a handmade is modeled almost exactly as an AK-47 (only chambered in 5.56 instead of 7.62x39).  An AK-47 with a loaded 30-round mag weighs right around 10 pounds...and that's with solid wood furniture.
---
The mind simply boggles at your intellect. Why the legions haven't bowed down at your feet by now, I'll never understand. 
---
I would expect at the very least that nuking a fissure site would yield better results than just going to the fissure site without the nuke. Much like the SQB fight at prime but perhaps a little less intense since it's not the queen.
---
Given that fissure sites are central to the main story, you'd think something interesting would happen there but...
---
I'm also kinda reminded of that 2005 movie with Bruce Campbell, Alien Apocalypse. The aliens were like giant half-ant, half-locust tree-eaters.
---
Awesome
---
My my.
---
Someone's panties are all twisted.
---
Maybe, Reddit has taken it's toll on you.....
---
I don't think there ever was a large team.  76 was an experiment in more ways the one.  Tiny team, big return was one of those experiments.  
---
I personally find that explosive is more of an annoyance than anything. These bullet sponges always end up right in your face. I wish I had a switch to turn explosive off.
---
Sweet, I'll give it a shot
---
It points out the uselessness of complaining posts. It is ironic.
---
Think this breaks down to semantics and "qualifications".  
---
-Rifles are the only weapon class without a weight reduction perk, so to me it seems like an oversight / bug.  
---
-The weapons have "spring" and "screw" tables inside their records, but they are not working. Would have not noticed if I wasn't forced to look at the 10mm SMG, and noticed all the lists in it are pointing at broken / cut lists.   
---
A valid argument can be made for them not being bugs, but in my eyes they are.
---
That is the most realest shit I‚Äôve heard in a while. 
---
Wut are you going on about? "Shills" "alts" unironically using "cuck" in 2019..lmfao come out of the bunker dude and take your tinfoil hat off LMFAOO...I've only started using reddit since the game came out, and really only for 76 related stuff...sorry I don't live on here and get nourishment from inconsequential "kArMa" ..lmao..what a cuck.
---
gonna check it out soon, where about is it all?
---
&gt;5 million copies?
---
Is there a source for their sales numbers? Or player count?
---
I think its pretty clear its going to happen too. Fuck I wanna experience the mess for myself but im currently poor as f :P
---
They're fucking lazy about it at this point. I got my 60 outta it. Still play about 8 hours a week and have nobody to pkay with. So sad what they did to this amazing franchise.
---
I think the hint here is that there is "fresh" meat around the clusters, so they are most likely from after the bombs.
---
As well one of them has one of the enclave "triangulation" setup devices ON TOP of it, which would imply that the cluster came before the enclave setting up the device.
---
so I think the timeline we have is:  Scorchbeasts created underground by Enclave -&gt;war -&gt;scorchbeasts above ground and make cluster nests on top of their favorite statues they remember from underground, bringing back food for young? -&gt; Enclave monitoring station installed on nest -&gt; everyone dies -&gt; nests abandoned? -&gt;we emerge
---
Ah, good thinking about the Krivbeknih and the "burning" of the impure! And the virus being part of the cult! F76 seems to indeed be tying some of those things togeter!
---
I see your conspiracy theory and [raise you](https://i.imgur.com/Sy1cSq4_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium).

Rad worns
---
I bought the plans of Grahm well after lvl 100 and (ironically) I later completed the Patrol event at the prison and received as a reward -you guessed it- Handmade Rifle plans. 
---
This is about to get super nerdy, you've been warned.
---
I love theories like this and I *especially* love them in relation to Game of Thrones (both the book and the show, although the book theories are more fun, imo). These faces sparked my memory.
---
**\*SPOILER-ISH GAME OF THRONES DISCUSSION\***
---
The first connection is the faces on Weirwood trees. Part of a blood-magic wielding, human sacrificing religion that worships nature. The more fun connection, for me, is to a short story George RR Martin wrote called Sandkings. The sandkings are beetle like creatures controlled by a 'maw' - a sort of sentient hive mind that controls the individual sandkings. The protagonist of the story is sold a terrarium with four maws, one in each corner. The sandkings build 'castles' out of stone and bits of glass in the terrarium and will eventually have complex wars with each other. They also adorn their castles with a face - the visage of their owner. Those mounds you mentioned being hive-like sent alarm bells off in my head remembering this story. I don't want to give away the plot, and I highly recommend it for a quick read.
---
I love it! I leave stuff like that all the time in Flatwoods, in the first aid box outside of the church. 
---
AH! Now I need to know more!!! Gonna check on that asap! Thanks a lot!!!!
---
Its not really thats big of a deal though is it??
---
a flashlight that works as same as the sun does acording flat earth conspiracy theorists
---
It doesn't hinder nor spoil my game play that the flashlight is inaccurate to physics when there are scorched ghouls walking around with melted skin that can find it physical easy to run when the tissue would be fused together.. another stupid comparison maybe but a valid one.. its a game take it for face value 
---
what does annoy me though is missions that bug out.. people cheating and thinking its ok.. 
---
servers disconnects.. 
---
Beta testing 1 month before release..
---
Oh and paying the same price for a holiday set from the atom shop which is the same price as the far harbour dlc.. value for money
---
Bigger fish to fry i think than a flashlight i would say
---
That's a good and hard to debate point with the scorchbeast nest, I think the easy answer is out-of-universe and that's a mislabeled deathclaw nest. 
---
in-world, um.. maybe it fell? :)
---
This guy gets it. Here take my upvote
---
Yes that's the point, the fact that the camp is built at the back of the golf club house prevents other people from spawning in their own turret farm houses.
---
You can do the same thing with just putting an empty camp down but throwing up a whole wall really just makes it obvious to those people that it is blocking their own camp from spawning.... or it's just for looks. Either way it does the job so it gets the thumbs up :P
---
No clue on an actual sales count. Only thing I saw was 1.9m on **digital** sales on wiki and that was as of the end of 2018. 
---
&gt; they will go the Bungie way and separate the same way they did with Activision but with EA and get back to their roots
---
I doubt that since the Bungie-Activision partnership was ridiculously Bungie favored and gave them a guaranteed out after ten years and 3 full Destiny installments (IIRC this was agreed upon before Destiny was even off to store shelves let alone became commercially successful, which may not have been such a surprise but still something you'd want to consider when forging a 10 year partnership around this new IP). They even apparently "did better than expected" and got out of the agreement in practically half the time and without needing to pump out that last installment while ***also*** handing all the rights to the franchise over to Bungie, It actually turned out to be something of a scandal since the even the shareholders weren't made privy to this important bit of information that must have been somewhere in the contract which could be considered in violation of SEC regulations. And they had a big class action over it that undoubtedly hasn't been resolved this quickly.
---
As a yuge HPL fan I approve of your research!  Kudos!
---
Shhh delete this
---
I have 3 perception, so its is not that....You can "scan" with your cross hair, and even if someone is stealthed/chameleon their name will pop up when you hover over them.
---
I found someone hiding because trade/invite was popping up when my cross hair moved over an area  they were hiding in.
---
I've had mine when I join rooms sometimes I'll have 100 lb more then what I should with no extra perks or mutations 
---
Thank you! Indeed the folklore of the area is perfect for some dark magic lore. =]]
---
During my experience with the game, I found it extremely difficult to manoeuvre from one end of the map to the other, there was too many over powering enemies, the guns were all single fire so it wasn‚Äôt enjoyable to kill things, the automatic guns that I was using (and enjoying at the time) kept running out of ammo which took away the fun. I also struggled with having a full inventory, I was over the carrying capacity so I couldn‚Äôt run, I was being chased by enemies with no ammo, I kept dying and being respawned back with the enemies so I eventually quit and haven‚Äôt played since. Also, the graphics are extremely terrible. It‚Äôs such a shame. Because I was HYPED.  
---
Thank you!!! =]
---
A shout out to City of Heroes &amp; Villians !!   WOOOHOOO !!! 
---
I think Olivia did have a few good points. Her kom deciding to become a superhero IRL and constantly sending her out to kill people would really be a lot to deal with...
---
I almost agree, but it seems like they changed something and they're running out even faster now. They're pretty easy to find if you know where to look. Had a 97% drop off a Scorch today in front of my camp. That was pretty lucky.
---
Would be cool to see it hanging upside down from something when it‚Äôs not aggro‚Äôd.
---
How does my suggestion not add balance? Its a complete rework of all legrendary affix's that makes it worth having ANY of them instead of just a few. You dont think dupers saturated the market with bloodied/anti armor items as well? Bloodied in my suggestion is only getting a small damage nerf. You wouldnt have to change your build at all in comparison to the TSE nerf. 
---
How is enemies with more health make the game less fun? Im currently 1 shotting everything in the game because damage is so inflated. The SBQueen literally dies in under 50 melee attacks with a min/max melee BY 1 PERSON in under 5 minutes.  Enemies with more health may actually take Limb damage or get Crippled..  something you dont see often since everything just dies in 1-2 attacks. 
---
Ammo and Repairs is a none issue. Its very rare that myself or any of my friends are out of materials to repair a weapon. Its also not hard to rotate to another weapon for example 5.56 rounds when your out of .45 rounds. Just farm a bit more, you hardly have to farm at all in this game. I use 4 gatling plasmas that break all the time and i have no issue repairing these weapons that have 2 durability. I bet you complained when White Knight got "nerfed" and made you spend 1 more material to repair Armor....smh. 
---
Whats up with players that need someone to hold their hand the entire game. Players keep asking for content but if Bethesda changes their game in any way for the better its the end of the world. 
---
It's $19.99 at Newegg. 
---
Saw the Handmade plans at Harper's Ferry yesterday, I'm lvl one twenty-something.
---
Interesting, thanks for the info.
---
Get full adrenaline take off this card for 30 seconds, bonus will become permanent, put card back kill 6 mobs and repeat as many times as you like.
---
Laser rifle and gatling plasma durability is garbage. Literally break after 1-2 clips. Gatling laser breaks pretty quickly but its usable. Plasma rifle is all right by me, I've never had an issue with its durability. The tesla rifle is great, its durability is on par with like the handmade or combat rifle
---
Birds arent there because the institute isnt a thing yet
---
I don't know I run power user to get 1000 shots a FC on my gat laser and I still drain my core heavily with the jet pack.
---
You get me! Lol
---
I'll add you when I hop on later :)
---
Nope lvl 86 and saw Handmade plans today. Just be aware they are now expensive instead of rare.
---
Your game sucks
---
Good job on making something other than a box!
---
Maybe they need more people because it's such a freakin mess
---
Have you completed the Brotherhood quest Belly of the Beast?
---
Thank you for the tag! Reading this now :)
---
Don't let the vault hit you on your way back to IDGAF
---
Thanks! all those years in minecraft really paid off.
---
Every monster you listed that was in the older games: They're exactly the same as the ones in older games, thus...they don't need changing. Ghouls? Same. Super Mutants? Same. Only thing would be mole rats.
---
The only things that need improvements would be stuff that's new to this game.
---
Scorched - Agreed with you here. They're boring and they don't drop the right weapons.
---
Mole rats - I hate these bastards...SO much. Seriously. It's like they have built in trackers and can target you miles away. Walking along, no enemies then bam tons of freaking mole rats biting my ankles. The worst thing is when you're defending a workshop and you get these little bastards. They don't work right. They get stuck and warp back and forth making you run all over your workshop. Take them out of the list of enemies we have to defend workshops from or fix them. They glitch out WAY too much.
---
Mole miners - Less missile launchers please? Getting hit in the face with three missiles at once makes me never want to fight these assholes.
---
Now then. I also agree with human enemies and world bosses. Scorch Queens sort of act as world bosses...but more at various levels and various areas would be nice.
---
Human enemies...goes into human NPCs. Should have been in the game from the start...along with text chat and several other things :/
---
Oh, I was aware of it already.  It seems the DR of various mobs SCALES with level.  Similarly to the scaling of base damage on weapons for level.  But the problem is that DR is WAY more effective per point than damage.  Which is why high-level mobs are bullet sponges.
---
You have to either overwhelm the DR with HUGE damage numbers, or you have to have HUGE armor-piercing values to drop that DR back into reasonable ranges.
---
This is why the weapons with very large damage, but slow reloads STILL outdamaged lower-damage faster shooting weapons.   And it makes automatics and most minigun style weapons virtually useless against high level mobs.
---
I've seen some of the numbers people have posted, and it seems to bear this out.
---
I'm no modder (well, I'm trying to be, but just don't have the time to spend on it) but I understand how the math works.....and the mobs need adjusting as much as the weapons.
---
The flat part in the woods 
---
He‚Äôs not in Flatwoods that I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôve encountered him 4 or 5 times at my base in the savage divide
---
I‚Äôm online early today, anytime we are both on just send me a message and we can link up to swap
---
I also thought it could be a mislabeled deathclaw nest!! I don't know, i'll stick with my headcanon: "mysterious dark magic totem"! hahah =]]]] 
---
I saw a mole rat suicider the other day. Never seen one before. Funny as hell. It had a few mines strapped to it, and I kept on wondering where the hell that beeping was coming from.
---
It seems you all missed my point. My point is take that time and spend it elsewhere YOURE GAME IS NOT WORKING how it‚Äôs supposed to! Fix your game first give us something to work with before you expect us to fork over more cash. Like I said gamers want to buy dlc we want to continue our journey and we will gladly give more of the core experience is solid.
---
You guys are acting like I‚Äôm wrong or something? Let me ask you is this game done in your opinion? Do you think Bethesda anticipated and banked on the community being the way it is about this game? Do You think they wanted this for us? Truly and genuinely do you reeeeaaalllly think this is the experience they wanted us to have when they launched the game?
---
I don‚Äôt think so. Not at all. Not only did I not expect this but I‚Äôm flabbergasted and no amount of how much I love the company or the franchise can excuse this behavior. 
---
Also you can get atoms for free which is dooope most of the time they just pop up and I‚Äôm like ohü§≠ nice lol at the same time sunglasses for 3$ you know how fucking long it takes sometimes to get these atoms?? They encourage us to spend real money by making the prices a bit outrageous remember those emotes that came out and it was just a new sticker for the same emotes lol? Those CAME OUT on sale. What!? Lmao no that‚Äôs not how marketing works you actually can‚Äôt do that because we never knew the original price to begin with so how can it be on sale. I believe (could be wrong tho) that those came out at like 10-12 bucks. For sum fucking stickers you think that matches? Does that match to you!? Hell no and sunglasses shouldn‚Äôt be 300 they should be 150 or 100 even 200 would be like okay I guess cuz you can get that in a reasonable amount of time for something small like ya know.. Sunglasses! By the way I heard they added snow now to those emotes so whoop de doo 10 or 12 bucks for a snow animation. Almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter ü§™.
---
You don‚Äôt have to spend real $$ but they want you to and encourage you too that‚Äôs why this is where most of the updates have gone towards. Like you said free is free and it‚Äôs hard to argue with that I love free. I just wanna enjoy the full game tbhüò™ and I‚Äôm sad they released it in this state and made me pay 60 for something that isn‚Äôt even close to done. I‚Äôm not mad at the shop some prices are crazy but you can earn it but the core game without all that is still dead in the water and has been for a long time now.
---
Take that time you‚Äôve put into the atomic shop and put it towards gameplay and functioning systems so we can enjoy the game while we are playing it and willingly want to give you more money as praise for your achievement. 
---
TL; Dr - the atomic shop is their focus thus their priorities are out of whack Had the game been completed at launch hell yeah hook me up with that free shit b 
---
But it‚Äôs a buggy mess so their focus should be on improving the game over improving the shop first. Not saying you can‚Äôt update the shop but core gameplay is what truly matters in any and every game. An element in which this game is lacking severely.
---
Maybe you'll find this useful. I got a Bloodied Lever as a drop the other day and was curious how much the Bloodied effect increases damage. So I compared it to my non-bloodied  Lever, which for my build does 175 damage. The Blooded did the same 175 when my health was 100%. I then soaked up some rads to lower my health to two different levels. You can see what the effect on the Bloodied Lever's damage is in the image:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/iwiuUWZ](https://imgur.com/a/iwiuUWZ)
---
nice job on this!  I'll be sure to let you know if I see discrepancies.
---
I don't have any bloodied rifles but I do have an instigating rifle. First shot feels like a rifle.......every shot afterwards makes me hate this game with a passion.
---
I'd assume if your health is low enough that every shot from a bloodied rifle would be good. 
---
This.  It helped that duping existed, so certain people wefe buying 2-3 copies of the game.  Heck even some legit players have more than one account.
---
Anywhere not in Flatwoods.
---
The megasloth stories are much older than that; Thomas Jefferson went hunting for them. #thatsmysloth
---
Is this for real?
---
This is pretty much the size of it, but it's not just a FO76 issue, it's a Bethesda issue in general.  Look how quickly modders were fixing FO4 bugs even before the creation kit came out, vs the snail's pace of official fixes.
---
Statistical fixes can be made VERY quickly in Bethesda games due to the engine, they're just not.
---
Even engine fixes are often better made by the community reverse engineering things, like solving memory allocation errors in classic Skyrim.
---
I'm just going to leave this here  
---
.  
---
Orbital strikes
---
I disagree...I seem to do the most overall damage to her legs.  Probably has something to do with armor level/DR for them vs the rest of her.
---
Cool, I loved it! And didn't Bethesda took a lot of "inspiration" from Game of thrones with Elder Scrolls? Isn't Skyrim a bit close to home? The dragonborn and all? Maybe they drank from the same well again! =]]]
---
&gt;Glowing mole rats with damage reflection~~s~~  
---
Just what I need, more ways to kill myself.
---
Players: We want transparency. What are your plans for bugfixes, balance, and new content?
---
Bethesda: Fuckall.
---
Players: Well, I guess that's pretty transparent.
---
Oh?  I somehow must have missed those....
---
25 of every flux
---
Still searching for these elusive items, man, I almost wish they would cash shop it just so I can get it over with.
---
Whats personal? I asked for an update and stated the roadmap would go a lot further for the community than worthless placation. 
---
Id argue the constant groveling at the feet of CMs is worse and contributes nothing constructive
---
Very interesting timeline! I love the idea of scorchbeasts being attracted by the faces! That's a point I still have no clue, why are they making their nests there? But your take is awesome!
---
And here I thought I was the only one with shit luck. 
---
The game has been out for $20 on certain sites i will not mention here
---
Complaining about being downvoted is about as adorable and rascally as it gets.
---
Man, I cannot see "APC" without reading "Armored Personnel Carrier". 
---
That said, this is a very interesting idea. I'd say give players the option of also having the "APC" stay at your camp so anyone who comes across it can use it like the vendor bots. 
---
Deathclaw island should offer that
---
You know, this makes sense. Hence why not only is everything recycled from past Fallouts, but they didn't even bother with building a massive city like D.C. or Boston or Vegas. I assume that would take more manpower than Beth was offering.
---
Yes. [Here's an article](https://www.shacknews.com/article/108552/cardboard-disc-included-with-fallout-76-power-armor-pc-edition).
---
At least I'd believe that some of them actually put more effort into being funny/entertaining than some shitty comedians still relying on the same old shitty gimmicks and jokes for years or more effort than Rob Schneider put into his entire acting career which is kind of amazing considering how much dirt he must have on the film industry to still be getting roles in film/network tv.
---
I agree and have been thinking the same thing. 90% of the time I spend more ammo that I make defending it.
---
I'm on PC for myself, and XBox for my kid, so damn it, I've spent $100 :\*(
---
I think this Lovecraftian stuff could really help the game. Bethesda needs to understand that we love lore more than we love PVP. =]
---
Also, not spawning on my bed! Another issue is my torrents do not track anymore even when in range.  Happening more and more.  This is not the reason I sacrificed elusive budget for.
---
DUDE! That's nuts!!!
---
Ty, I can't quite make out the numbers on my phone could you type them out?
---
And nothing of value was lost...
---
If you have 3 star set of regular armour power armour is weaker, we need buff to pa to compete with legendary armour or add power armour that can be legendary
---
Which country you from mate?
---
Thank you for reading and dealing with all of us!
---
\&gt;  you were told there were no npcs, that they expected players to fill that role   
---
Correct. They did say that. But they also made zero context, space, or mechanics for players to fill any role in the story or questline whatsoever. You can't say "There's no NPCs! The players are the NPCs! You choose your story!" and then make it impossible for a user to choose any story. There are only predefined questlines, just like any other game, and Fo76 is no different. That's a cop-out. It's almost like BGS said, "hey! we can't figure this out! we need to push this game out and sell! you guys are the story!", and the complete lack of progress and history of patches and this week's "Inside the Vault" seem to support that. And before you say "the players get to make their own story with roleplay," again, there is no context or mechanic for that in Fo76 for that then there is in any other game with a questline. Like another user said in this thread, it's like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" novel where all the choices are already chosen for you. 
---
\&gt;  You want faction quest and such? well you did the quests to join the Appalachian branches. go forth and become the npc   
---
How? Do I just stand here? Do I get offer players rewards and questlines? No, really - I'm sorry, but that just isn't happening. The roleplaying and questlines are not being crowdsourced to the players.  I keep seeing this point being made over and over again with no follow-through. The players are the story. How? What *specifically* exists in Fallout 76 where the players have the option to "be the story" that doesn't in other games? I'm sorry, but I keep hearing this point reiterated by the marketing team and and then the fans inevitably at this point in the debate ad finitum when there are no other points to make. It's almost like a, "well, if you can't find anything to do, go play by yourself" argument where the responsibility for content and purpose and story is shifted from the developers to the players.   
---
I mean, if the dev team *really* wants to give up on this and shift all responsibility to the player community - like it sure seems like is happening, especially this week - then you know what you do? Allow the modding community to do your job for you. They can make content. They can make storylines, and factions. But BGS has all but said "no mods" for this game, and BGS is *used to* being able to depend on modders to do things like fix their bugs for them and add content.  
---
\&gt;  as for raids well WoW only had 1 raid at launch. as does fo76. as for dungeons that depends on your views on if instanced buildings are dungeons or not.   
---
We're getting off topic, but come on. It's hard to consider SBQ a raid boss. And WoW is 15 years old, and had constant dungeons and instances up to level 60. And WoW added BWL, ZG, AQ, and Naxx within months, and that isn't including Scholomance or Stratholme or the other lower-level raids. There were dungeons at almost every 5-10 levels until 60. Fo76 does not have dungeons.
---
Ghouls do more rad DMG than HP DMG and it's not OK.  Fighting them without power armor is horrible.
---
They have mentioned this is something they will do in the future.
---
Yeah, not even Tremors could go through rock.
---
Wow never thought of that
---
I didn‚Äôt make fallout
---
175 with 100% health
---
234 with about 2/3 health
---
283 with about 1/5 health
---
I have the death skull mask
---
I feel like if you had a full set of bolstering armor you could do well with a bloodied rifle build.
---
Thanks for fleshing this out, because it's what I was condescendingly trying to get at in my original post, but didn't want to come off cocky or out of my league. It sure SEEMS like it'd be an easy fix, though.
---

I just went down to that place in Charleston twice to try to get screws. Still don't have enough to craft 1 radium rifle.

I'm about a level 30 who's explored most of the map, and I haven't seen any of the new creatures, besides the scorched and the scorch beast.
---
I totally forgot about frogs, sloths, etc. until you mentioned them.  Where are they hiding?
---
Fanatical fans often post YouTube videos here and in the casuals subreddit inviting others to brigade...
---
We shouldn't have fire breathing ants, aren't they unique to fo3 cause that science dude made them fire breathers?
---
Because the player recently left and things don‚Äôt immediately disappear 
---
I will give the dissenters(? couldnt think of a nice way to put it) credit. trolls or not they seem to attack bethesda as a company more than the devs themselves. which is a good thing I think. relatively speaking.
---
Probably by looking in the dumpster.

Ok I‚Äôve ran bloodied since start of game and I‚Äôve actually unequipped all my bloodied cards before just to see the base damage of an item. Granted AA didn‚Äôt show on the damage stat so I figure it should be the same. In this case the item is a death claw. The base damage was 196 no cards equipped no perks no mutations full health. The bloodied damage with all cards mutations and at 20% health with full unyielding armor it‚Äôs damage was at 1267. Downside is you will die..... ALOT! I also have BE lever that base damage is at 392. With my full bloodied build I‚Äôm looking at 1696. Witch in my opinion is a great PvE build especially if you do a bloodied sneak rifle build you won‚Äôt die as much sniping everything with a one shot. But PvP sucks because you will die.... ALOT!

You don't find him,  he finds you

Is there anything I can do? As far as getting in?
---
Because we can all feel the potential and want it to come to fruition. 
---
Ill take fuckall for a thousand alex.
---
You've had that happen with rad worms?  Rad worms is only supposed to " Increase his radiation damage taken by 50% for 45 minutes ", according to [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Rad\_Worms](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Rad_Worms)
---
Well thank you for informing us you don't pay attention at all. 
---
As far as I have been able to gather, the studio Bethesda bought and gave this project to hasn't moved onto another project, though you kind of can't with a "games as a service" type game. I'm assuming having to deal with Bethesda's engine after only having what, 7 months or so to make the game is as much to blame as anything else.
---
Because its not a permanent perk it's not used by as many people in this game. See in previous Fallout games he would active all the time, if Fallout 76 he got sick of waiting around and just sits at home on the couch in his underwear eating Doritos and watching day time soap operas (he is big into a Spanish drama with subtitles at the moment).
---
Every now and again he gets a little too much into his show and forgets he is supposed to be helping you and rushes out the door with his gun and forgets to put some clothes on. If you ever see him running around in his underwear you can see a little cheese dust left on his chest from all the Doritos he has been eating.

This is not acceptable, mysterious stranger. This is you job, your livelihood and the whole reason for your existence and we expect you to take your job seriously. Start showing up in your uniform or we will be forced to find a replacement and your cable tv will be cut and you won't be able to find out if Pabelo will ever be able to win back the heart of Jennifer after she lost her memory and has be tricked into a fake marriage but his evil twin brother Antonio.

- Signed Managment, probably.
---
Ehh...neither do I lol. 
---
lol, I started thinking about all the weapons &amp; armor for each monster &amp; realized that's Monster Hunter &amp; stopped. 
---
I haven't played MH since 76 BETA was released... sorta miss it.... but Anthem is next ;p
---
I like it!
---
&gt;We're seeing months of "work" go into changing the weight of bobby pins to .001lbs... then back to .1lbs... then back to .001lbs.
---
Players aren't complaining about a lack of transparency. They are complaining that it's perfectly clear that all Bethesda did this week was nerf scorchbeasts and rework the queens loots.
---
Maybe. But still ME:A was quite a bit better IMO. Still kinda crappy tho. Just not pure hammered shit bad.
---
I read you.
---
I can't speak to any specific connections between Elder Scrolls and Game of Thrones personally, but they definitely both draw from a lot of the same lore and myth, most notably for this post Lovecraftian horrors.
---
If this is a nod to GoT and/or Sandkings, though, I love it!
---
You need to be there when 4-5 100+ level players are there.   Then its a frenzy.  Not sure why.
---
I will add you tonight and see you in Appalachia!
---
Ebay or craigslist will be cheapest
---
Of course, one of the advantages of console gaming is not having to deal with hardware issues. 
---
I played 3 and 4 on PS3/PS4, but I was a late adapter so I did not have to deal with bugs at launch.
---
I waited a month or so for 76 as well... Maybe I should have waited longer? Lol
---
Interesting idea for CAMPs. Reminds me of Firefall.
---
Not asking for a hand to hold. I play alone and I did everything you could possibly do in the game. Repairs and whatever not a problem for me, like you and your friends, most high levels don't have junk problems. 
---
Although, you forget a whole portion of the middle and lower level player base, just to fit in your egoistic balance. Just because you and your friends are bored, doesn't mean the whole game has to become one giant bullet sponge. Please, get your head out of your snowflake ass. Not everyone is running around the endgame stats and builds. So your balance screws over the majority in terms of QoL, making a more tedious experience.
---
The game doesn't need a balance, probably only on sentinel assassin. I have a full set and I must agree that it feels cheesy. Esp. on a bloodied build. We need more content, a more fluid game play, better frame rates, more creatures, factions, and activities. Balancing isn't all about burning down builds just cuz a guy on reddit and his buddies are bored.
---
If they are working on these things, wouldn't transparency mean they mention some of them in the update?
---
I only upvoted because your edit made me chuckle... adorable rascals
---
You may be entertained by the fact that I tested the theory that cats, in Fallout 4, were impervious to fall damage. I created an overly complicated stair-tower with a cat-cage at the top and a button at the bottom to press and cause the cat to fall. It was pretty funny looking but in the end the cat took no damage.
---
Switch servers.
---
If you own a workshop that had a helipad or whatever they are called, can toss the smoke grenade and the vertibot will fly to your destination. It takes a while if your far enough away. But to be able to get one for FT would be pretty damn cool
---
Why do we keep fighting the exact same two enemies, ones that have a lot of armor and shoot, and ones that have a lot of armor and melee.
---
There is no complexity to the metagame, all enemies have the exact same stats as far as defense goes, about the same armor, and about the same health across the board. Meaning that any given gun is equally effective, or ineffective against all opponents, creating static and boring gameplay.
---
It's like comparing and contrasting fallout three and New Vegas. In 3 enemies armor simply reduced the damage of all weapons by the same %, meaning the best gun was the one with the best dps, and all other guns were simply worse, 50% of the biggest number is always more than 50% of a smaller number. In New Vegas armor was a fixed damage per bullet, meaning weapons with a high damage per hit didn't care about armor, and weapons with low damage per hit could have much higher dps without being op because armor would very quickly bring their damage output down, potentially to 0. Yet despite having a system with many of the same properties as NV but more consistent fallout 4 and 76 manage to completely ruin it by simply ignoring the fundamental requirement to use differences in the enemy composition by giving higher level enemies insane armor across the board, it's like if NV had simply given all enemies 25 points of armor, suddenly the vast diversity of weapons is meaningless, as only the gun that is best against armor matters, and if you aren't using an anti materiel rifle with match load rounds or the ycs-186 with overcharge ammo you are wasting your time entirely. The game needs enemies on both ends of the defense spectrum, ones with very high health and minimal to no armor, and ones with low health but huge amounts of armor, but instead all we have are enemies with moderately high health and moderately high armor.
---
\---
---
There is a handy chart at the side that shows how shafted a low damage weapon gets when you give enemies lots of armor, with a 25 damage weapon suffering a 70% loss of damage against a target where a 250 damage weapon only loses 30%, meaning the 25 damage weapon has to hit &gt;23 times to do the same damage, and a 10 damage weapon has to hit 80 times, dealing a theoretical 800 damage to match 250.
---
And 100 armor is the least armored enemy in the game after level 50, with the average amount of armor being  around 175.
---
The way you are supposed to use armor is you put the armor value at about 2/3 the expected damage you intend the enemy to withstand, and from that point other weapons with more or less damage will be less optimal, this in theory means the devs want scorched to be shot with weapons that do at least 150 damage per hit, and super mutants should only be fought with weapons that deal at least 270, meaning the minigun at 14 damage has no reason to exist in this format. If you want it to match the lore of the BOS who claim it shreds SBs, then simply change SBs to have 0 - 10 armor and 4 times more health, as that would make the minigun the best weapon to face them with, and would "nerf" heavy hitting melee down to almost 1/3 as effective, because they don't really care about armor so the extra health is just extra health. But no, same \~200 armor as everything else.
---
Hahah!! Missed this response because Grumpypants up there's comment is hidden for its negative score. But this is funny - and worst of all, TRUE.
---
Server hop.  A new server where the last owner didn't block off the entrances.
---
Cats are yummy, I refuse to eat dogs, they are sacred to me. I was playing fo4 the other night and killed a dog attacking me, it was a brindle almost bull mastiff or cane corso looking dog named ruby. I almost cried as I have a brindle cane corso puppy named ruby, but she is named after Sam Winchester's demon girlfriend from Supernatural, I already had a brindle english mastiff/lab mix named Sam. 
---
Thank you!
---
Higher level - higher level spawns?
---
They can track quests, progress, location, stats, rads, health and like 100 other things. But items in a box, nope!
---
I think the stash needs to be server side. Like some containers I search in game, it pauses and does a little circle like it is going to the server. Like that. Oh and they need to back it up. Always. 
---
Best. Comment. Ever.
---
The loot part of the game still at least contributes at least a little bit to the overall shitfest of poorly implemented features and bad design. It's not like it's a secret that basically no other games handle their equivalent of "legendary" or endgame loot like Bethesda does where there's roughly a couple dozen or so weapons that each could have several hundred of their own possible combinations of 1-3* legendary effects that could all drop from anywhere a legendary is to be found. And the reason for that is because a massive loot table like that with no possible way to narrow it down by say farming a particular area that doesn't drop a lot of those weapons you don't want or something is just beyond shitty. It's more like "even if you farmed non-stop for all of your in-game time for 10 legendary weapon rolls you want you could farm for a few thousand weapons and it wouldn't even be all that surprising that you only got 1/10 of them even after dedicating such an ungodly amount of time to just farming them" Super Duper shitty.
---
I have all ranks of rifleman, tank killer, bloody mess, and 3 in demo expert with my lvl 35 explosive lever. I do 225 flat damage before sneak and crits. I can 2 shot lvl 68 supermutants while in sneak and 1 shot charred ghouls. 
---
I've been looking for an instigating/exploding max level lever action. Kinda my white whale right now. 
---
I also never tried the bloody prefix out so thanks fellas for the info.
---
That many bodies would have a lot to load into a server.
---
Meaning either longer load times, or laggy experiences.
---
While I agree they need some form to let us trade.....
---
A freaking Market..... (Auction House) would be just fine.
---
I don‚Äôt even know what that is but now I want one. 
---
Instigating is better on anything you can kill in 1-2 hits. After that it‚Äôs anti armor or two-shot, depending on current damage and armor penetration levels. Or the 30% specific-enemy ones, but obviously those are very specific :P
---
Bloodied trumps everything, though, if you are running a low health build. 
---
You're right, there are some outliers. The Tesla rifle was badass, if slightly underpowered.
---
I tried a plasma rifle once and was disappointed by the damage (I couldn't see any reason to use it over my current weapons despite me having all ranks of science).
---
What do they do with those caps? I know, sell 'em on eBay... But it seems like a lot of work for $2
---
Wait...bulking takes up more room??
---
Interesting....
---
Cant you just walk up the side of the foundations like they are stairs?
---
All hail the Mothman!
---
Where I have lived, we would live trap them, spay or neuter them, clip a corner of the right ear to let others know it had already been fixed, then when healed released very near where it had been captured. Kittens and very young ferals that seem to enjoy humans are usually put up for adoption or maybe given to farmers that will feed them. 
---
Rise up, still we need this one.
---
Sure there are.
---
I'm just wondering where the Mega-Beavers have gone to.
---
And seriously. They didn't put all those chewed down trees for nothing, did they? /grin
---
(Someone recently data-mined an event mentioning beavers)
---
You seem to be on the right way. Just a theory Bethesda is aware on how big they messed up, but is in financial trouble and cant afford a team to really make changes. But since Todd promised a ongoing development and free dlc¬¥s they have to continue on the bare minimum to avoid some legal issues and a big refund wave. 
---
Good, I hate birds. They just need to kill the rat populations in cities then we would be awesome. 
---
Very much so. I was running around gathering mats to make disease cures. By the time I made *one* circuit from Vault 76 down to Flatwoods, along the river to the west, and up to Point Pleasant, half my Firecaps had spoiled. It took maybe twenty minutes. Maybe. That's absurd.
---
So as I sit here and ruminate over this, it actually makes me think about another classic Chulthuian bit of lore...  
---
[The Deep Ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_One?wprov=sfsi1)...   
---
So looking past the "fish" part to the rest, the Deep ones had hybrids, and in some post-Lovecraftian writing authors flirted with it being a transmittable "disease" akin to Lycanthropy.  
---
In other stories humans and other creatures would become twisted vessels for the [Elder Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Thing?wprov=sfsi1)..
---
What if the Scorched are exactly that, not a plague brought on by a mutated disease, but a plague of conversion marking the arrival of the Heralds of one of the Elder Gods?    
---
They spread through virus and spores, are described as having technology advanced enough to be called magic...  
---
That would make Scorch Beasts not "mutated bat things" and the "scorched" creatures not infected with a virus or standard plague, but host to a larger, darker entity, almost like worker bees being commanded by the Heralds, who themselves serve one of the Old Ones..    
---
Specifically the [Mi-Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi-go?wprov=sfsi1), who spread via fungus (there are fungi in real life with some terrifying properties, and the hallmark trait of the infected was a "Pinkish hue"
---
It all fits, especially with the OP's findings.
---
Wife asks the same, and I don't have an answer
---
I like the idea but feel there‚Äôs going to be one team who uses other equipment
---
PC I got a "used" physical copy for $28 bucks last week. Shrink wrap was removed, but code hadn't been used.
---
The only quest I remember 
---
Absolutely. To quit now would mean, I assume, massive lawsuits. So instead?
---
Devote the most meager amount of energy into this game, just to keep the lights on.
---
PS4. It‚Äôs labeled as a  Halloween skull mask. 
---
It's fallout 4, they nerf it here to 5% per hit capped at 50%
---
Might be raw flux spoiling
---
After everything that's happened and how much money we have spent, the "hate" is justified, and apologists like you enable game companies to do this time and time again.
---
You like the game? Great. Congratulations.  No one else has to, and no one else has to pretend to like it to assuage your sensibilities.
---
Well......
---
I was hoping there was a way to get around it cause that‚Äôs fucking annoying 
---
Yeah especially with this game not much codt went into making this game
---
There's one in that BoS Fort/Asylum place
---
It's also from EA. I've pretty much boycotted that entire company because of their microtransactions. I am also surprised that there isn't text chat, that is just lazy. I'm still waiting for it in 76 as I see it as pretty much a requirement if you want to have a community and trade in game.
---
It's a percentage, so increasing your base health goes a long way for bloodied/unyielding builds
---
I think I've reached a stable combination of settings. I started from the "HIGH" preset, then transformed it to "CUSTOM" because I put Lighting and Shadow to "MEDIUM". After that, I put your texture settings on the .ini file. I also added some other tweaks found here and there on the web. Finally, I tweaked a bit the NVIDIA Control Panel and put a 59Hz (to kill mouse delay) cap with RivaTuner.
---
With these tweaks I can enjoy Ultra textures at 60 FPS almost everywhere except when the game must load a lot of objects (e.g., cities). It is still playable though and surely I prefer frequent dips to the low 40s than the HORRIBLE textures of the "MEDIUM" preset.
---
I just wanted the Red Canary, but I hear she just got engaged. 
---
Not sure, I know there are team build versions of this making use of the rez benefits from some charisma perks, but I prefer not to die if I can help it.
---
Or just build it on a mountain 
---
They're red for me but non aggro 
---
What system you on? And are you having the bug where if you have the exact amount of mats it won't craft? 
---
No sure, I don't want to depend on something that is definitely a bug.  I don't think the over repair trick is a bug, it's just not well known/explained.
---
Yeah, it's weird how far out of their way they went to make them the least memorable enemy ever. 
---
Like they make a big point that they have a hive mind, but like, why? You never see them moving as a unit or coordinating or anything. 
---
This is where I would go. Several bone chimes to loot and the Wendigo drops screws.
---
It‚Äôs the Dwemer
---
If you aren't getting what you need out of the anti armor, then the bloodied handmade may be perfect. You can put an armor piercing mag on the handmade, no mag mods for the lever action. I believe you can even find bloodied explosive handmades :)
---
Nope.
---
Nothing has changed that I am aware of except that the nerfs to ranged weapons have brought more folks into the melee fold.  Chainsaw/drill are super powerful to level with into the 60-70s, but a full on unyielding build using the ripper or the Mr. Handy greatly outpaces their damage eventually.
---
Now I understand most people here aren't PVP players, obviously, but I am, and that PVP mode is the first time they made me think about playing my copy. 
---
Issue is, they completely lost all of the potential PVP scene (which is what supports these survival games, not you fellows who are here for PVE content as that eventually runs dry, but you can always find another idiot to hit with a rock), because every person who had interest immediately went "HAHA FUCK THAT" when they saw how badly designed the slap system was, and I don't see them coming back. 
---
After all the negative press and constant fuckups, they need to do something big to even drag people in, and these tiny ass patches and clear lack of balance isn't going to get the PVP scene to live. 
---
Incidentally why they didn't start with this and have a full PVE mode I don't know, since it would have made all the griefers play on the server where griefers are seen as a target for righteous justice rather then a nuisance. 
---
Like people said on the first post in aint a conspiricy.
---
Chickens are the most disgusting animals on the face of this earth. I don't care if they are boxed in cages for their entire lives or free range with no limits on where they roam. They will eat their own shit no matter what. I used to raise them, and I refuse to eat the damn things. Tilapia is the same way, worse than catfish. 
---
&gt;A regression is not a small mistake...
---
It certainly can be.
---
&gt;Makes the development team look incompetent
---
Not to anyone who understand that people are...well...people, and mistakes will be made from time to time.
---
&gt;Shatters client confidence in the product
---
The only people whose confidence was "shattered" here are people who already think Bethesda can do nothing right, so, hm...yeah...
---
&gt;Throws all existing timelines in the bin thanks to the new question 'Do we need to add contingency for fixing things that have already been fixed?'
---
Team leads should already have processes in place for such contigencies. If they don't, then it's good they learned that lesson.
---
You seem to be intent on creating a mountain out of a mole hill here, and I certainly hope you aren't leading any programming teams - because they'd have terrible turnover with the attitute you seem to have towards small mistakes.
---
Really glad I only paid $25 for this game.
---
Could always mysterious savior + life saving but yeah I totally understand. Your videos Rock by the way. Definitely appreciate your folks out there trying to make this thing work
---
I believe Buttressed is the best for Marine pieces, don't remember Trapper at the moment.
---
It depends on how it was done.  If there are, for example, only 8 NPC slots on a server, and they were limited in how much they could have available for trade at any given time, it shouldn't add substantial server load.  Regardless though, that's a technical problem that I expect Bethesda to be able to solve, given that other, much larger games figured it out.
---
I can't say I like the idea of an auction house though.  The design philosophy behind this game was to encourage natural player interactions in the world, and an auction house is the opposite of that; it would funnel players into, effectively, a chat room where they can stop playing the game and just shop for whatever they want, like a post-apocalyptic Walmart. I think that works great in other online games, but I don't see it fitting well into 76.
---
I will be BOYCOTTING and not purchase upcoming Skyrim editions on any more platforms until my issue is resolved. Upcoming Apple Watch version? NOPE! Keurig Special Edition? NOPE! Fitbit Game of the Year edition? NO!!!!
---
Fix my Stash and I may reconsider...
---
has anyone found bloody heavy metal plans ? im level 134 running around in heavy metal  and iv had a heavy metal left leg thats level 30 since i was level 80 because i accidentally scrapped my leg when in power armour 
---
I hate saying this, but Bethesda turned to utter shit after Skyrim released for the ps3. All they have is a skeleton crew. I think I'm honestly done with their games
---
You read wrong. Most people shit on this game, statistically speaking most people are not neck beards.
---
I want another one too :(
---
Want the Austin studio created for this?
---
&gt; Why do I feel Inside the vault this week is like I'm being snubbed?
---
Because you are self-important, entitled, and needy?  I'm sorry that this week didn't give you everything you wanted and more, but that's life.
---
Olivia was a cunt.
---
&gt;the people who's opinion, on the direction the game should be going, matters the most.
---
You'd think that, but that is not reality.  Shareholders matter much more than a playerbase.  The playerbase only matters to keep the shareholders happy.
---
You are only being asked because you are collectively cheaper (at free) than hiring a professional consultant.  A professional designer would cost them 6 figures.  You guys are free.  It's a no brainier for them.  They staunch the bleeding of the player base while both avoiding paying a designer and lessen the impact on the plethora of shit they aren't actually doing.
---
&gt;Or Bethesda could do what the hell they liked and then get criticised by the community because it's not what they wanted.
---
That has been the past decade of Bethesda.  To expect a drastic turn of ship is foolhardy.  Your feedback on critters isn't going to help them avoid the iceberg right in front of them.  This is literally PR dampening.
---
"Hey, we promise to keep doing the bare minimum to keep you from eating us!"
---
Solid work 
---
FUN DETECTED!
---
You can add me, ign Rlauntz53, however I will probably be playing less as I'm thinking about giving Apex Legends a try.
---
Statistically speaking, most gamers are crybabies looking for Internet attention.
---
You may wish to consider reevaluating your definition of *wrong*
---
So another point for you, Bats don't make nests, they just use natural places to roost, so it wouldn't be something bats do normally.
---
thank you
---
That's not a bug, scrapping is for the sole purpose of selling and if you're really keeping it on you without selling it somethings wrong 
---
I was expecting "baddie #1 dies after you fight three waves and his helicopter". Instead they went a different route.
---
&gt;  Has anyone else noticed this too?  
---
Absolutely I have. Noticed it weeks ago, along with many other things that people on thus sub- Reddit are finally speaking up about.
---
I guess everyone else's period of denial was much longer than mine?
---
But yes, this is a real problem.
---
Then that's the wrong one
---
Sorry
---
Hit up someone that quit the game on Reddit .can probably get it for 10$ 
---
That's the man mask
---
(Already have it)
---
Yay! New endgame content!
---
Do you think they just rushed it out the door? Like, what IS the explanation for all the features missing?
---
Lvl 119 and just saw them at harpers 20 mins ago
---
CDKeys.net if you understand creative technical problem solving.  
---
PM if you don't understand 
---
To wives and girlfriends - may they never meet.
---
No. Rad worms boost all my stats plus mutations
---
Excavator armor?
---
Well, sort of. They were making Battlecry as Battlecry Studios... then Bethesda bought them, and then slaughtered them like a fattened calf and canceled their game. Then put them to work on FO76. Which is... uhh... how we came to arrive here.
---
I agree with your post, however, realistically, that‚Äôs how it would be. Hermit crabs (giant mutated crabs inside buses) would be seen much less than actual people who were hit with a post apocalyptic plague or people who were radiated extremely. 
---
Did you even read my suggested changes? 
---
How does the mid to lower level player base get effected? Nothing changes for them. Ive suggested only enemies past lvl45 get buffed. Most lvl 45 players or lower only have an "all rise". So they should be unaffected by the legendary affix overhaul. Same goes for the mutation changes, its unlikely they will even have those. 
---
These changes ive suggested actually make it easier for low-mid level players if they happen to get their hands on an enemy specific legendary such as Zealots or Exterminator until they hit enemies over lvl 45. 
---
No builds are being burn't. Its just the very top-end of builds that will be effected 
---
 will a small damage decrease but its not like we even need the damage. 
---
Sentinel/Cavalier is actually balanced since all it requires is to be staggered to die, just need someone with a stagger perk and a fast enough firing weapon. If we weren't one-shotting every add that runs are way maybe it wouldn't feel like such a face-roll. 
---
Glad to see you pulled out your big guns with the snowflake comment. My suggestions add more content and more fluid game-play. Whats the problem. 
---
Saw it at Harper‚Äôs and wotoga yesterday for about 1500 caps that was with lvl 3 barter perk
---
Bunnyvilla. Fallout 1 (maybe 2) had a reference to monty python and the holy grail; knights of the round table give you the holy hand grenade. How about increase its speed, massive health pool, heavy damage, on a normal sized white rabbit. Have it waiting outside a good loot cave.
---
know of the swan knock off and the bog workshop guardian are pretty regular though about one a week I see 2 behemoths trying to smash the whitespring gate south of the train station
---
On my non-PA character, I run around with a hodge-podge of 5 pieces of Sentinel armor. Along with other perks cards I'm using, it significantly reduces the damage I take when going up against difficult enemies. When we successfully spawn the SBQ such that we aren't taking rads, I can just block her wing attacks and mash her in the face with my unarmed bloodied weapons.
---
The holding hands weren't a snow flake reference lol? Seems like that to me buddy. Regardless, I did read the whole thing and there are a few a things that seem pretty neat and well thought. But nerfing isn't always the best way to move forward. 
---
 I want a Weapons Rack and Armor Rack. Each capable of storing 10 unique items each. Then a fridge that can store up to 25 unqiue food items. Thats all i need. 
---
Thing is, if they did more frequent but stable patches on PC, then did a consolidation of the fixes for Console bi-weekly it would solve both issues.   
---
From a technical perspective, **IT IS NOT HARD** to keep a running series of ESP with the changes, each week in a separate ESP, and then take the (4) weeks of proven fixes, compile them, then update the older console game file
---
While I can understand Devs are fire fighting to a degree as a project manager when I am getting sign off for a product to enter release i have to have reams of paperwork so show it means spec, business assurance, change ,customer and quality assurance and have  plans in for early life support. Not to mention gant charts and plans coming out the wazoo for live support. 
---
I feel at some point someone has deleted their PMO folder and the guys that are still on the project are doing the best they can with the resources left to them. Keep soldiering on, we still love fallout even if this one has came out a bit funkier than the others.
---
I still have fun with my silenced, Powerful Automatic, level 45 Furious Handmade Rifle (non-explosive). I can take out a scorchbeast in one clip.
---
Meh, doesn't hold a candle to all the legendary Flare Guns I've farmed.
---
Great post, mind if I grab a couple of these points for the bug and QoL sections when I get to the NPC's page of my consolidated bug round ups?
---
just a minor nit-pick:
---
&gt;We also know due to data-mining, the extremely uninspired &gt;"event" that's already planned to take place once one of the vault &gt;opens up, sending players across the land gathering ballots - &gt;rather than any dynamic or exciting new gameplay mechanics, &gt;revitalizing the world with fresh enemies, wars, or massive &gt;worldwide events (like I'd hoped). One can dream that's not the &gt;extent of it, but I don't have much confidence left."
---
This isn't one of the vault missions from opening up, this is an enclave mission from it opening up further, MODIS declares it's time to elect a new president, and everyone runs around trying to get the most votes from those voting machines we see in each town.  The winner gets a presidential seal, which can be cashed in for some reasonable loot.
---
I have multiple sets of Sent and Cav they were duped 
---
can i have your stuff
---
I was at my friends place playing in the middle of the night when i first found that place, after getting startled and jumping, i ran to make sure something fked wasnt happening outside lolz
---
Here's the thing though, New Vegas was a buggy shit show in the beginning as well. Now everyone says it's one of the top fallouts.
---
You mean the repurposed Skyrim dragons?
---
Had this happen the other day on the Salisbury steak factory of all places. You can try to see if there's an unbarricaded door or hole in the wall somewhere or server switch
---
Less annoying than what's usually there :D

Making a mistake that ends in a regression shows that your release process and testing is inadequate. A new defect can be explained away as 'We didn't consider this specific scenario so we didn't test for it'. A regression is 'We knew about this issue and we still don't check for it after we fixed it'.
---
Team leads have contingencies for defects and technical debt. But how do you do contingency for regressions? 10% of the overall time for the first release? Then for the second release you need that time again because you don't trust the content from the first release to be valid anymore, plus the contingency for all release 2 work? Then for the third release? The fourth?
---
&gt;You seem to be intent on creating a mountain out of a mole hill here, and I certainly hope you aren't leading any programming teams - because they'd have terrible turnover with the attitute you seem to have towards small mistakes.
---
In our team we find regressions in testing before going live and we fix them as Sev 1 pre-patch because we understand the impact of breaking something you fixed before.
---
Hate to be a nay-sayer, I've submitted over 100 bugs myself that are issues with the game engine, including a ton of fixes (literally exactly what needs to be done).  
---
Yes sorting out "performance" and some stability issues are hard, but I found the cause of a huge CTD issue effecting anyone in or near power armor using a targeting HUD, and they should have been able to isolate it themselves from the bug reports, Reddit and BethNet posts, through deductive reasoning.  
---
It's trash bro
---
Next time block him and he cant follow you.
---
Go for it! I fight Ghouls most often so I had a lot to say there, I think I got video of the walking through walls as a corpse thing too lol
---
It would be cool to have something like an in game terminal entry system where people could document the clues they've found and whatnot that we could access from the terminals in our camps ... pipe dreams at this point I suppose.
---
I call dibs on his boombox
---
But the problem is many, many of those "disconnected from servers" aren't hardware but actual bugs.
---
&gt;You can't say "There's no NPCs! The players are the NPCs! You choose your story!" and then make it impossible for a user to choose any story.
---
Not being snarky, but did you ever play minecraft? at the start there was no story no npcs no raid no nether/end granted the build limit is far far larger than it could ever be in fo76, but the community engaged with itself and made up things to do and goals to hit before the modding community for the game was even big.
---
You are limited because you want to be. You can do more in this game than the main quest and what is "allowed" if you work with other people. just because it can be played single player doesnt mean it was designed to or should be played as such.
---
&gt;  There are only predefined questlines, just like any other game, and Fo76 is no different. That's a cop-out.  
---
wait so now it is bad for being like every other game? (now I am being a bit of an ass) first it is bad for not being like every other game(no npcs, your survival is at stake not so much the world) now it is bad for being like every other game(fetch quest). pick a goal post and stay put. 
---
&gt; How? Do I just stand here? Do I get offer players rewards and questlines? No, really - I'm sorry, but that just isn't happening. 
---
So it is bethesda's fault for not holding your hand enough? there have been plenty of people that go around acting like raiders (not greifers) or brotherhood of steel members. some players play along some dont. but the end is the game is not a single player game nor is it meant to be. The game is actually harder to play as such.
---
&gt;but come on. It's hard to consider SBQ a raid boss 
---
why? you have to get attuned to the raid (enclave questline) gather the information (launch codes, harder to do if you dont used the internet for code of the week) to so you can summon the main boss (SBQ and adds) after surviving the raid (silo)
---
I mainly use WoW as sort of an example because of the claim that a liner story made this not an RPG. I could have used plenty of others (dragon quest, runescape, guild wars, the final fantasy series as a whole not just XIV) but WoW is an mmorpg given that fo76 is multiplayer it fits better than single player and I know it better than ffxiv and others.
---
&gt; give us feedback! Like you're doing and we ignore consistently, but more! 
---
They do have a place for that feedback and reddit isnt it.
---
Now the give use feedback thing does worry me. not the sales the trolls like to post or the clickbait youtube vids. the constant "tell us what events you like what enemies you like to fight" it could be anything from the usual fake community engagement (how many companies have you heard "we are listening" from?) to them scrambling to try and find what people like to hold more of an audience.
---
You sound pleasant.
---
Give it to obsidian and let them  have a go. 
---
Thanks, you too!

You tried the roof?

1.9m digital sales for Battlefield 5. Fallout 76 was 1.4m, and it might have been for both physical and digital sales.

Savage Divide. Saw him once on a building in the ash heap but most of the time in the Savage Divide.
---
Lemme get your ammo homie
---
Im a fan of the fallout series. I read this, and my mind draws to Diablo III. and II, for that matter. I love them. I think it would work for fallout 76.
---
I also sometimes look in my inventory, especially after a nuke zone or getting swarmed by a horde and have picked up things I didn‚Äôt even know I had....awards and probably my error 
---
TBH i still enjoy it. Just moved my camp and building a new neat little cliffhouse. I really enjoy it, except the really stupid building restrictions. I also started a little photalbum of some nice ingame shots. got quite a few pictures.
---
Im still waiting on more content, i havent had much issues with bugs and dcs thankfully.
---
Ooh, I like that! The entity "consuming" beings, absorbing them, becoming vessels... that's very interesting. It fits a lot with the holotape of Jeff Lane in Lucky Hole Mine. He says "the Interloper has chosen Jeff Lane as the conduit of the unknowable." Like he would "merge" with it? It does have that zombie fungus vibe to it, like how it messes with his mind and all. =]]]
---
So awesome but will never happen. They havent even added new content since the game came out...
---
The community working at gathering all of the data, consolidating the issues, and clearly presenting them removes all doubt and ambiguity.  
---
If we can't get the issues addressed, atleast we can walk away knowing we did our best. 
---
Yeah, personally think it's a great well to drink from! =]
---
This is such an easy one it drives me nuts, fallout is a 50's nukepunk setting.  What happens in the 50's when you nuke something... it grows giant.

You drop a nuke on an area, the game should pick some random animal in that area, increase its size by 10-100 times, and make it a mission to beat it. Suddenly TONS of content just falls out of the game.
---
I've now gotten +2 Contractor Perk which reduces material costs by 50% and then scrapped ALL of my crafting tables and rebuilt them. No change, still no room left in budget.
---
This limit, like the stash limit, make no sense compared to other mmo games. Conan Exiles you can build huge castles with no limits, many mmo's have huge inventory and bank limits.
---
What system? Lets team up and get him!!!
---
And the fact all the Scorched turn the pinkish / red hue seals the deal for me. 
---
Perhaps mothman eggs have some utility beyond a quick cash grab? I'm going to pick some up tonight and start dropping them at the shrines and stuff. It probably won't do anything, but it just feels like the right thing to do (as a proper researcher).

Your tone seems very pointed right now.

sucks for you. given where my camp is I run grab the workshop defend it once then do the power up event before going off to do something else when I sign in.

Solomon‚Äôs pond
---
Not to criticize the community managers, but I suspect they're as much in the dark as we are. Their suggestions seem to go into a black hole.
---
I totally agree on that.  Dr. Disrespect is an amazing character, and you can tell he put a lot of thought and work into creating that character.
---
My bad 
---
Not even close. I don't monitor my own posts for down votes. I only come back because it actively notifies me of a reply. I'll extend the respect to reply because I'm not afraid or an asshole.

there aren't plans for the X-01 mods, you need to find the mods. 
---
Raw flux gains weight when it spoils?  I had no idea, and had some in my inventory at the time.

Dude, thank you for this. I actually feel fractionally better knowing that. Thank you!
---
Nah, wasn't wearing any.
---
Crap. Just got home and tested some with Morganville Station....  Camp plans had some variance... Can't even trust them to figure out how to make them all static....  BGS is starting to be right up there with Wildcard for programming ability.
---
Bye. Nobody cares about your need for attention.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work. 
---
Xbox
---
even if someone downvoted...
---
Don't even bother, the power up events suck. Now you can buy the reactor, just spent the caps and buy it and spend your time on something more productive, also something are broken.
---
I wasn't calling you a hand-holder in that instance. I was more so making a statement on how there is a portion of this community that will never accept "a nerf" in any shape or form. Even if someone suggests some balance ideas or changes to the game that would require someone to adapt and/or farm some more.. its the end of the world. Its usually these people that make developers scared to even touch their games and why games usually go stale and die out. 
---
It would be nice if Bethesda rocked its game to the core with massive balance changes and overhauls to make the game amazing but they are either scared or unwilling to change.  
---
Exactly. I bought mine from the live store. I don't like to risk being scanned by some shady af 3rd party.
---
I can respect that.
---
TL;DR: Who cares? They're breaking it again, anyway.
---
P.S.: Salty af right now. Lost all my junk due to a godly lack, got one (!!!!) item back in my paper bag, was not player-looted, and then disconnected. Yeah, thanks...
---
Sounds like he's just an asshole. Also sounds like this game is more broken than I thought. Obviously not worth the buy
---
Ha! That's a great idea.
---
Trapper also buttressed
---
Have to keep some cryptids as dlc
---
thanks
---
Are you asking me? Absolutely not. I haven't down voted anyone for being of a different opinion. Why would you assume that? 75-80% of this sub is unhappy with the current state of things. 
---
the roof is also made with concrete foundations using the glitch, it's not just a wall.
---
yeah but it requires you to go at them from a specific angle and if it's more than one foundation high that glitch it doesn't work.
---
Your buddy can also drop a foundation on top of them and trap them forever if an enemy is near by. I hope he figures out how!
---
Yea, it made me feel better that way as well ;) 
---
It could just be as simple as I‚Äôm glad such a stupid mission isn‚Äôt wasted on the vaults! We only got 3 chances! 
---
If I had this game, all you'd hear is me cussing and flipping out xD
---
I LOVE this! This would be an awesome alternative (or compliment) to vendor bots! 
---
oh just outside the Whitesprings Golf Club on Xbox.

And you can change the color of the light, or install a (at this point TOO bright) bright lamp. I'm running the lovely blue light in my miner's helmet to go with my Vault-tec themed PA and Jumper. :)   
---
The other nice thing about the miner's helmet is that you can use it's light at that early stage when you are just running around in a bare PA frame with no helmet. 
---
With all due respect, power up events are very worthwhile if you are then claiming workshops to mine resources. Most workshops have a power box provided which if powered, negate the need to use resurfaces building a bunch of ugly and loud generators. Why waste resources on those when you can power up a plant then use its power to power extractors?
---
I always power Posidon, then claim Billings, then reap the gold , copper, crystal, and phosphate to sell on my cap runs. 
---
They started a program in Philly that has trickled down to other cities like Baltimore. Basically catch, spay, clip ear, release. Rat pop numbers have dropped noticeably in areas. 
---
Dam guess they did a good job of blocking it up. Effective way to keep it I guess. 
---
I always figured, if the Scorchbeasts were based on any cryptid, it's be Jersey Devils.
---
Have fun bro. There always needs to be a random crew of 50 guys playing that dead game that everyone else wised up to and bailed from.
---
They could set it up so when you're online, your bot is in your camp selling. When you go offline, it despawns and you go stand where it is and take its place!
---
I dont no. The way the scorchbeasts can carpet boom an area seems pretty effective at spreading there disease 
---
oh yeah about that... Ghouls can walk through the base for some reason so it'll be great
---
&gt;SCORCHBEAST QUEEN: I am level 115 and I have never fought her, ever. I don't like having to take off all my armor to wear a Hazmat suit. Make nuke zones accessible to those who prefer to not wear Power Armor PLEASE. Other reasons I haven't fought the Queen, I don't have the BEST POWER ARMOR WITH MAXED MODS, I don't have the HIGHEST DPS GUNS/MELEE WEAPONS, I have read pages of horror stories with NO LOOT, AWFUL LOOT, FLYING OUT OF BOUNDS, LOW LEVEL CHARACTERS CAMPING UP THE DR AND DIFFICULTY, and more. Every criticism of Scorchbeasts is applied to the Queen and more. Until I see people who didn't buy TSE guns and stack 50000 bobbleheads (I know these are patched now) say they can beat the Queen reliably then I'm not going to bother.
---
You should really try taking one on yourself, even if you don't have a set of power armor and don't want to remove your armor to wear a hazmat suit. These days most people position their nuke so that it hits Fissure Site Prime but doesn't cover the military bunker to the northwest of it. That way everyone can shoot the queen without worrying about radiation.
---
I've fought her about a dozen times, killed her every time and gotten decent loot every time. Never had to deal with low level players upping her health. Never had her fly out of bounds (though sometimes players wandering off will inadvertently lure her away from the main group and we had to chase after her).
---
I'm level 70 and I don't have any amazing TSE guns, just a few gatling guns, a trusty handmade (+10 dmg while aiming down sights), and at least 1000 rounds of ammo for each. I haven't seen anyone else using obviously overpowered guns in most of the groups I've fought her with and we still win every time, people just have to keep shooting. Twice I've seen evidence that people were using the explosive bug to kill her but I wasn't there in person; I saw the event start while I was in my base gearing up about to fast travel down there and then the scorched earth event ended within a minute before I could get there. I assume shenanigans were involved in those cases. But it's not the norm by any means. It's easy to take her down reliably with regular guns as long as you have enough ammo and enough people shooting.
---
Because the power up events don't always work and are bugged. It also takes way too long and if you DC you just wasted a bunch of time, so sorry they not worth it in the least., If the servers were more stable, maybe.
---
It takes 2 seconds to drop a fusion reactor which will take care of most needs, it takes at least 15 mins of not longer to do a power up and only if you have done many times and know the layout.
---
Not as bad as your need for attention. 
---
So pathetic.
---
Plus. We l know you aren‚Äôt going anywhere.
---
Holy hell! How am I just learning of this now?!?!
---
GT is MspeC34 
---
Gross dude couldn‚Äôt find a toilet?!?
---
Or in a mountain. 
---
They should make a roadmap that includes when we can expect the roadmap. 
---
Fuck it build it below the mountain
---
He‚Äôs everywhere
---
Ah, that makes sense, I was not sure. I know you can float up the side of them at base level. Thanks for clarifying tho!
---
I‚Äôve seen him once near flatwoods. But more often elsewhere 
---
Please don't reference Polygon like they're reputable. 
---
You can actually do that. There is apparently a way to glitch into the side of a mountain and build there. No one will ever find you lol
---
Yeah man u rite, have a good day and lets hop bda fixes our favorite terrible game :)
---
Scorchbeasts are mutated and diseased/infected bats. Bats spread disease very easily.
---
RemindME! Two weeks
---
Shoot your way in and take the workshop, you likely to become wanted but so be it, if you have a friend kill them. If there is a car nearby, try get it to explode a barrier or box.
---
The downvoting is getting old
---
that's what we used to go around the base while we were building the roof.
---
Pft. I haven't touched it in weeks. I needed space on my hd and wanted to see if there was maybe any updates or chances of it not staying a dry turd. Low and behold, basic bug patches but the entire premise of the storyline is still shit. Bethesda took your money and my money. They're doing hookers and blow right now laughing to the bank.

Hard drive space freed.

I think someone messed up the drum mag when they made this rifle. The gun should hold about the same amount of ammo as the hand made rifle. The difference should have been in the stability of the rifle itself with the assault rifle having better overall stability with a slightly lower dps. Logically, if they had kept it this way from fallout 4 (not including the ammo differences) it would have made sense. You pick a heavy guy that is easier to use in long suppressing fire roles and decent dps, or you make the knock off Chinese assault rifle that the raiders made, take slightly more power and slightly reduced stability. I honestly think someone wasn't paying attention to how they made this gun and goofed... I hope they fix it but, you know, it just works, we say so on the Internet so it must be true.
---
Wow. You really are fishing for attention. 
---
Thanks for not linking it, wouldn't want them to get any clicks
---
God you guys are terrible. It's like going into the dessert baking sub and telling them about diabetes. You guys just do not want to handle reality. 
---
Until release, I remember hearing that 76 was a joint venture between the Montreal and Austin, since it required massive edits to the Creation Engine.  Now, it is solely in Austin's hands...  The people for whom this is their first actual game...  And, I would say that they seem to be handling it, not well, but thus far not horribly...
---
Lol. How lame. You came here to post about a game you haven‚Äôt played in weeks. 
---
Ha ha ha. Omg that‚Äôs like the saddest excuse for a life!
---
Everything eats birds, even fish. Scorchbeasts own the sky. Could birds have been the first post apocalypse extinction? I bet there will be an atomic shop songbird eventually.
---
Where is there a clock 
---
I just need to work up enough memory loss to enjoy all my other games again.
---
I have my perks pretty much where I want them, and haven't found better gear in a while, so I'll probably tone it down until the first DLC comes.
---
I wanted 76 to help pass the time until ESO's Elsweyr, but that's not coming until June. This character's lasted longer than any of my previous Fallout 3/NV/4 characters, but the quests are few and far between.
---
That‚Äôs actually a good ball park figure of where I got to before I kinda got bored. It‚Äôs saltier here than the Dead Sea lol.
---
The reality is you didn‚Äôt need to make an announcement about how your taking your toys and going home. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry no one begged you to stick it out.
---
I agree 100%. These bogus limitations are really hurting the game, along with all the other issues. If there were no camp budget limit or at least a much larger one; I‚Äôd still be playing just for making cool bases. 
---
X01 and prototype are the same thing
---
How many hours have you put into it?
---
Yes. They're both the same thing in Fo76
---
Eh, just Polygon trash. Will never happen. 
---
Hope you never come back dipshit.
---
Geckos would be sweet but for some reason Bethesda has an aversion to including things from from NV like Geckos or dynamite.^^^or character choices.
---
Why do you people come to this sub if you quit playing? Serious.
---
Alien Blaster has bigger problems, weakest weapon in the game, tested it does even less damage than fists if you add the fusion cell mod.
---
Then consider yourself lucky. I run a sniper build with pretty much every accuracy thing maxed, and it's like playing Xcom. 95% and it'll miss most times. 
---
You didnt buy that pack for the bag, stop being a bitch. Also they are reissuing the bag.
---
there is a theory that BETH fully expect this game to sink just not the level of hate it has gotten. They decided not to allow the game on Steam due to steams cut and refund policy. Beth kept it in house so they could control the number of refunds and terms for refunds.
---
I have read a lot of people have yet to get the Canvas bag they were promised and that many people have been refused refunds by Beth.
---
Personally I think they shut down the servers in another 3 months, use the assets of Fo76 to get a running start of FO5 and pretend Fo76 never happened.  Todd is in trouble with the numerous mistakes his company has made under his leadership, they destroyed the Mass effect franchise with Andromeda, and have FO on life support thanks to this mess.
---
I am starting to worry about the next TES game, since Todd is not a person that seems to learn from his mistakes.
---
Huh. Polygon is one of the few websites I can get to at work that's not blocked.
---
The argument should stand or fall on it's own merit, despite the reputation of the person that delivers it.
---
Link was too long. Shortened url wouldn't get passed reddit rules. Soooo... You're welcome?

I found him southeast of Top of the World.
---
Well they have always worked for me.
---
But then I get to play on the secret server
---
That sucks. Hope it gets fixed for you.

Firstly I‚Äôm subscribed so it pops up in my feed and secondly if they fix it I might come back. So salty lol.

how am i suppose to role-play now? u.u
---
was gonna do this with my 3 kids tbh, had to upgrade 2 pc's for it so didnt wanna spend money on 3 extra keys, glad i only bought 1 cuz its not even installed anymore
---
I shall retitle this, due to popular demand, A Cool Idea from the No Talent Shit Heels at Polygon.
---
How am i salty for asking a question? Get a grip you mong lol.
---
What time CST?
---
Yeah, I've seen once or twice people being twats, always just some asshole killing me while I'm in a workbench at a... workbench I've taken over.  If you see a guy a tinkers bench there's a small chance he'll be carrying a shitload of bulk goods, right?
---
Honestly, I've found most people I've run into to be either timid or pretty cool.  Not a lot of the shitheads that online games tend attract.  I guess they are all online complaining about the game but not quitting it.
---
It's a stupid point, because you just find another world. 
---
Whole lot of meh. 
---
Yeah. Saw that one the other day.
---
^Case and point salty sea man. 
---
Then you'd be a twat.  Glad there aren't many of you.
---
They should just copy Rocket League's trade interface and add 3 responses for those engaged in the trade: "More/Higher", "No Thanks", &amp; "Less/Lower".
---
Great post!!! I would add one thing to this fine piece and that would be that the Grafton monster is on the pathetically  easy side to battle  a level 9 character in a Power frame with melee stats can easily defeat it and that I think is woefully lacking in excitement and danger department. unlike of course the giant sloth that will generally be pretty cool and chill and it‚Äôs kinda peaceful and relaxing when you run into him , I like that !!!! A lot!!! I think there should be scary things in this game that get the adrenaline flowing even passed level 100.  A Scorch beast as soon as it  lands is easily a 4 -9 hit melee kill for me ;not much of a contest,  so I need things to be scary out there . I totally agree scorched running around in Power armor or combat armor as bullet sponges would be a welcome test of my steel!!!!!
---
Ya they can even transmit disease via a sonic shriek. Learned that last night fighting a diseased one that I never engaged in melee (cuz it didn't land) and I didn't get hit by the gas attack.

literally who the fuck is going to buy a "Let's Play!" paint for their walking death tank. Besides extremely niche characters, it's useless. We still don't have any enclave paints.
