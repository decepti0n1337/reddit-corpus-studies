This,  all I want is a leather coat,  and the key to the camp venture weapons room.  Both have ridiculous RNG drops...  Either I get lucky or spend 5k+ to buy a dupped one and get ban üòÇ
---
---
---
This is the most pathetic piece of grand-standing bullshit I have ever read. 
---
Do people get spawn killed over and over in adventure mode? Guess I wasn't paying attention
---
perk set up yeah. but legendary rolls are something stupid. i cant begin to tell you how much trash drops ive gotten after hundreds of hours grinding whitesprings and events. finding the perfect set with a clean economy would take forever.
---
I never said more or less. Obviously our experiences differ. 
---
who gives a shit
---
Also do they lose caps equal double their level and most of their aid items?
---

---
Wow. The more you know.
---
Watoga Civic Centre, upstairs. Probably 50% of the time has a 3\* feral ghoul.
---
Pretty sure there was a bundle up there on Tuesday that was brown/tan camo.
---
Drink it.  DRINK IT!!!! 
---
i thought this was the problem pre-TSE nerf that the effects stacked thus making some weapons way overpowered.  I run a legendary explosive shotgun in PVE and dmg goes about 300.  I would bet pre-nerf that same setup was more than double.   My legendary explosive Dragon was well over 700 dmg pre nerf. 
---
Oh it‚Äôs a GIANT list. The end product was Luminol. 
---
Funny how u say its great but a post before u says it sucks
---
Love! &lt;3
---
I'm just trash so a level 10 can beat me up anytime.
---
It took no time at all for someone with max level home defense to build a base at whitesprings station and just obliterate whoever showed up. 
---
Really made the game not fun... or rather.. exactly how it is when you aren't off at whitesprings. I sat at Poseidon for an hour watching the death scroll. "Player 1 killed player 12" "Player 1 killed player 2" "Player 1 killed player 5" "Player 1 killed player 5" "Player 1 killed player 5" 
---
It was pointless and boring.. I put my game away until something fun is released. 
---
Haha, I had this happen to me last night! Four gulpers came at me while I was walking to my C.A.M.P. I wasn't prepared for them initially, so I died after a brief fight. But when I respwaned and got inside my C.A.M.P. I found that they couldn't get through my doorless entrance. So, I grabbed weapons from my stash, stood just out of arms reach as they all lined up in the narrow entrance for slaughter, and started to smack and pot shot them through the doorway until they all died. 
---
I love my C.A.M.P. 
---
If you're taking, you need to stay in the ring for it to continue. If you're in the ring, there's plenty of cover and you have the benefit time. If someone chooses to sit outside the ring waiting for you to go out of cover, and you wait in cover for the timer, you'll win. Or for them to make a break for the timer, you'll always have the advantage. It's all fair
---
Of course need the space for all my aid items I‚Äôll loose when killed ‚òπÔ∏è
---
It bored me. I think I wanna get together with a group of four and set up our bases and see who can take us. I wiped a guys base today with a couple orbital strikes. Totally wrecked. I dunno. Its almost awesome. 
---
I love you man, hadnt checked the grafton one yet. Much appreciated
---
Man I seem lucky that I got all the BoS combat plans before the patch! If you're on PS4 I can paint a set of armour for you!
---
Oh cool, I haven't played in a while ill look for those next time
---
Yeah, in the rare case that I am going to try to grab some workshops, usually for the plans, I never go back to my camp and the first two things I build are a chemistry bench and a stash box. Both can be built with the workshops resources and this way you can scrap and store everything. This way if I do get killed I'm not going to lose anything. Also if I'm going to take one Workshop I attempt to take as many as I can in that session since I figure I'm already open to PVP dot-dot-dot what's the difference between 1 and 10 at that point.
---
I have no real friends that play this otherwise I would team up and make it a mission for us all to grab as many workshops as possible and this way we could defend as a team. I know every once in a while some people organized events like that, hopefully I can get in on the next one.
---
VATS has always been a part of fallout. In fallout one and two it was the only way to do combat. 
---
That'd be great but they'd have to pay Warner Bros for the rights to even attempt to make it look and/or feel like thunderdome. 
---
Please tell me that you put a button on it so it can light a butane canister and make it look like a rocket. 
---
Herp derp, lead and aluminum indeed. Thanks for keeping me honest üòÇ
---
True, I just thought it was rare to see anything additive, effects-wise in this game. Majority seems multiplicative. 
---
Yep, some of those combos are nuts.  Clearly the devs didn‚Äôt do a thorough test of everything because there is no way that would have gone live in a PVP game released by an experienced studio who knows that everything needs to be balanced, or as balanced as feasibly possible.
---
Alright, thanks b&lt;3
---
Pro tip: when you know you'll lose aid items when you die, don't carry so many. 
---
When I go into survival mode, first thing I do is store all my excess aid items and only carry what I'll need, which is usually only 10 stimpaks and 2 of each chem.
---
wait. what?
---
Oh man if only~
---
Yes! Fallout 4's survival was really fun. I remember exploring for a long time and panicking because I couldn't find a sleeping bag or bed anywhere in the vicinity to save it.
---
 That really made me feel like it was a survival game.
---
Thanks for the tip it was my first time playing the mode so I didn‚Äôt put my things away
---
Actually, I think the nighttime tweaks they made in December caused this bug.  Probably an unexpected side effect.  Maybe if this bug gets fixed, we see the original nights come back :).
---
Didn‚Äôt you know you had the risk of losing aid items. Yet you still carry a lot of aid items. I agree the mode isn‚Äôt perfect but you played yourself my man. 
---
much more stable, though FPS still tanks in whitesprings for some reason. I can hold 60fps everywhere in game except whitesprings which brings me down to 25-30ish. (granted, this is at 1440p with ultra textures, med everything else)
---
But how do I get my stuff back? You lose like 50lb+ per death
---
2 excavator calibrated shocks for 250 caps- I will be on tomorrow at 7/8 gmt
---
I have almost zero performance issues on my Notebook. I play 1080p at 60fps on High. On Ultra I used to get slight frame drops before, I don't know how it's now on Ultra; the difference is imperceptible on a small screen.
---
I run on a i7-7700 GTX 1080 6GB 16GB RAM installed on HDD.
---
your maths is wrong, TSE doesn't give the highest boost, there are prefixes with more damage capability.
---
That's right.
---
Stimpacks. 
---
one thing i did learn by reading these posts..do not spawn in at train stations in this mode
---
That's weird, I get no issues in Whitesprings. I was getting frame drops in inside cells after patch 5 but patch 6 fixed that.

There will always be a certain percentage of people who play the game who will "no life" it.  These are the 400+ people in adventure.  I would say within the first week, if everyone started equally, there would be unbalanced levels/weapons etc.

making switches do anything require proper wiring. just like things IRL

I fully believe so, yes. But just not yet. It‚Äôs known that 76 can already be modded, but just small things. The lockpick bar, switching out the paper bags with lunchboxes, pip-boy light colours and the like. And once modding is official, we‚Äôll be getting some truly great things. I mean, trust me, I want NCR stuff just as much as you do. I nodded 4 to have it. I live in an area that looks like it‚Äôd be in New Vegas (actually it *is* in Fallout 1, but that‚Äôs another thing). But Bethesda *wont* let that happen yet, because they want to get as much money as they can from their shop. Mods come in? Everybody can have the blackbird paint for their power armour. I can get the mosaic tiles that I missed out on because I passed out after work and missed the one day sale. But, I doubt those big mods will be allowed on public servers, so the atom store will still be needed for that in the end. 
---
Totally agree with his idea of no jumping back and forth between modes. I don‚Äôt want to create a new character now so I‚Äôll stay away and not be an ‚ÄúAdventure Mode Tourist‚Äù.
---
This game is actually better with spacing imo. In 4 the map was packed tight and you couldn't really walk 10 paces anywhere without a shootout.
---
There are some enemies that pop up while traveling but it's not as bad, mostly because the locations are further separated.
---
Haha yep! I dump all my scrap and aid before even jumping onto the Survival servers, since let's be honest, I'm not going there to do much other than pvp.
---
Quoting the survival mode info from Bethesda: 
---
&gt; On death, they‚Äôll drop all of their junk as well as a random amount of the aid items they were carrying
---
They never said "minimum" amount of aid, so it's all up to rng how much and of what you lose. Best practice is to only carry what you can afford to lose
---
what resolution do you run at and what are your system specs
---
+karma
---
That was fun. Feel free to come run with us any time.
---
My neighbor and I used a 1000ft RJ11 phone cable to string across our properties just so we could 1v1 LAN on WC2, Red Alert and Jedi Academy. Sometimes I miss the good ole days. The dedication was real. 
---
My crashes get the same error code. (CE-34878-0)
---
It's completely randon for me. Like one second I'm chatting with someone, next it's crashing. Or I get shot by a laser and it crashes.
---
Survival is complete cancer just people sitting at train stations 1 shotting you before u even load into the game
---
TS guns have a hard time hitting in vats (accuracy is scuffed). I feel you though, was saying the same thing way back but it's the only way to get crits. You should try a gun with stalkers, it kind of fun to have a stealth stalkers dragon with vats.
---
Have they fixed the keypad deal yet on switches? Before you got the code which worked but anyone could open it by using switch and not the code...
---
Gauss 
---
Bro I'll take em lol
---
Its a terrible decision for the end user, but terrific monetarily for them.
---
Basically, if we assume that all the **level 200+ players with maxed out characters** (with TSE's either duped or bought online) are the **very same people who buy all the atom shop items with real money,** then, understandably, **you'd want to keep them happy and buying your merch as much as possible**.
---
So you want them to feel powerful, keep playing the game, and keep pumping money into the atom shop. And most of all, you want them to have an outlet to PVP and ruin the game for each other, rather than blow up and demolish passive PVE players and their camps for fun/ teh lol's. 
---
So right now we've got cool kids mode, assholes mode, but eventually I hope they add something in between. Something that makes you start over, no legendaries, no fast travel, no seeing other players on the map under any circumstance, and maybe even a cap on the number of perk cards you get (after what level do you statistically max out all available cards?). Maybe we call it "classic survival" or "hardcore" or something. Everything is way more deadly, you've gotta either run stealth or a tank. PVE enemies are fucking terrifying, and force you to collaborate. Maybe even give full inventory access to *anyone* who gets killed. Like 5 random inventory items, any 5. You'd think twice about getting a bounty put on you if you could lose SOME of ANY of your non-stashed shit! 
---
Right now you just walk around with 10 stims, 50 caps to travel on, and there are essentially no consequences. With my suggestion, deciding to engage would be a really, really tough decision. Akin to Day Z or whatever survival the kids play these days.
---
Haha it's definitely a mixed reception, but honestly if you enjoy PvP and are semi prepared you should have fun. Some people also really dislike getting beat.
---
Let me get geared up and I will def let you put that bounty on my head lol hide in a silo and let the aid roll in 
---
After reading a few other threads, you are 100% correct. I read a few that said the dev room, but you are correct, its location 0,0 and a place holder for people loading in. I was wrong.
---
I have the game on xbox one, so this may not be as helpful as someone who has it on PC. I do not experience any performance issues except for the occasional lag or lost connection from server (which is probably more from my wifi than the game). I would recommend the game if you can get it on sale, but it is still fairly enjoyable after about the 4 months I have owned it. And with new dlc coming out right now and in the near future (summer and fall 2019) I think it will still be pretty fun for a while.
---
Agree to both your points, I think most people consider their build done around level 70 or 80. 200 caps should definitely be the max. And as far as I know PVP Zone Maybe White Springs would be good, like if you attack another player within White Springs than all of the robots become hostile to you.  I just feel it's hard to have an actual Zone where magically you can't do damage to other people. Would make more sense, at least to me, to have someone's where if you did do damage to other players than the surroundings attacks you (robots or what not).
---
I will man that was a lot of fun thanks again 
---
Why did it bore you? I actively hunted every one I could see and went to where loot bags were to make sure I found as much combat as possible. I would love to run into a full squad in a camp set up for PvP, please do this it'd be amazing! 
---
any update on the wetsuit helmet plan?
---
I'm in between gta online and fallout 76. If I'm playing fallout 76 though, I ain't doin nothing else unless it crashes.  
---
Agreed. Flawed; I don't like that there's not a cap limit on loss, when they put a cap limit on inventory. If I'm LVL 200, I shouldn't loose more than someone LVL 100. I have definate advantage over them.
---
However, I only played for about half an hour last night and it was 1 of my funnest experiences in fallout and definitely my best PvP experience in fallout. I went to track down the number 1, 2 guys tried to ambush me just as I arrived but I killed them both. Then leading to a 4-5min stand-off with the no. 1 inside a bunker where we traded shots between taking cover, with me slowly moving in on them, and I was just 1 shot off of killing them before I died. But I didn't care, I made some caps and aid along the way, and I had alot of fun doing it. It is the BETA, so we'll see things getting tweaked that will hopefully make it even better
---
Too much crossover between gear and weapon types. Not as clean as you think.
---
I have 438 caps. i need the wetsuit helm plan
---
No worries.  I used to think that there must have been some sweet camp there since there were always people there, but couldn‚Äôt find it.  Then I read a post that mentioned it‚Äôs the exact center of the map and it made sense.  Gotta love how Bethesda‚Äôs servers aren‚Äôt used to all the traffic since so many players quit after the first month lol
---
I dunno. It's one shot kills. One guys thought they were smart and had one guy in sentinel jumping to reduce damage but he was the only person I had to hit twice then his buddy in power armor once and then blew their base to dust. Easy. 
---
Yeah I'd like to set up four bases for best effect. 
---
Well dang, that rules out my Ryzen theory :( Thank you though. Another data point is nevertheless just as important. 
---
A slight parallel between a dual CPU system and Ryzen, at least deep in the architecture (but more-so on Threadripper) is that it's similar to being a dual CPU system due to the 4-core modules inside. As such there's an inherent latency when there is communication between them. 
---
In your case, I'd be trying something like [Process Lasso](https://bitsum.com/get-lasso-pro/) to lock it to a single CPU to see if that helps (assuming you don't already, if that's how you're "quad boxing", but all done on your single machine). 
---
Survival has been a bummer for me. I play one character at level 167 and I've lost 100 caps the first day since I take a 336 cap hit with every death.
---
I don't run a power armor build and I chose my weapons to make farming legendaries easier. Killed my vibe when all the caps I worked for all day disappear, but hey, I guess that's the cost of +20% XP (and level punishment).
---
Similar story here. Only I stayed for an hour longer... but wasn‚Äôt comfortable at any point. 
---
100% even in full sentinal assassins, I'd spawn in dead. Just try to keep an eye out for the map, you see loot bags at a train station stay clear. It's definitely something that needs addressing. 
---
Hey sorry will be home in about 5 hours then i can check, if i have it you can take it no charge, just remind me... i dont sell any plans just give them away
---
Let me guess. They were standing still and jumping while they weren‚Äôt taking damage?
---
Rifleman build or heavy build?
---
Yep. Sentinel assassin combo set. Just head shot them with crits using vats and have a lot of armor penetration.
---
I was out at a lumber yard making a delivery when I saw a red bottle cap in the grass.  I legit set my stuff down to ‚Äúloot‚Äù it before remembering where I was
---
sounds like a deal to me. lol I really like the helms look
---
I walked by a clip board at work today and for a second thought, sweet a spring wood and steel.
---
Sounds like we're on the same page now, and im grown up enough to admit maybe I didn't fully articulate my point. I apologize for that, and that you for being mature about it. (Unlike our friend up above).
---
The black bird paint and lever action skins are my favorite Arom shop items. 
---
I would so much love to see more content lile that. I'm sure everyone agrees.
---
And im not even salty about Bethesda holding out to get money. 
---
I support it actually.
---
The way I see it, the more money they make off it, the more titles we will see in the future. 
---
 I want the game to evolve as well. 
---
I so hope you're right. 
---
yeah i havent tried it yet..but what i do kno..that if i go into survival..i will enter adventure mode..make sure i dont have that many caps..stash all my aid items..and loot..then i will join a team with my friends..they are all excited about it..i havent really engaged PVP but i will test it out in the near future
---
Because we are all vault dwellers who have pipboys?
---
I dislike pvp so i wouldnt play it
---
I'll be at my camp
---
Why I love this game, gems like this ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I use a terminal to close it from the inside but make sure it's connected to the switch and not the garage door
---
Gauss
---
I get you, not enough challenge, I hope that this mode encourages people to learn more about the PvP so they get better and we can have some fun sweaty fights. I've definitely ran into a few top tier squads. But other than that I've been to main killer on the server, had a 97 kills in one life. The guy who ended it was a sneaky sniper. Not even that well equipped tbh just timed his attack well, probably vats crit to the head tbh.
---
Holy crap, don't suppose I could tame one, could i?
---
If you got a good hunting rifle like me it's always one shot. Which is lame. Then my bloodied handmade makes short work.
---
I really hope they do like faction based. Something like what ESO has would be amazing
---
I've laid out this tinfoil hat theory a lot in the past, but here I go again:
---
**I think rival game developers paid youtubers  and other social media influencers to make negative reviews of 76.**
---
A lot of games launch at the same time of year as 76 did, a lot of them with more egregious issues. It wouldn't be unprecedented, in any industry, and it wouldn't be illegal.
---
Google the concept of "payola" if I sound too paranoid for ya!
---
But yeah, especially of you follow any of the US election and social media tampering stuff... companies would be totally daft not to pay people to do the same things for product reviews. There are people, interviewed by reputable news agencies, who are paid to write positive amazon reviews all day. Why would games be different?
---
Had one do that to me today, but it was a legendary and detonated as soon as the door opened.  I broke a leg and had maybe 5% health left.
---
And...the corpse blew back into the spawn capsule and got locked behind the door &gt;.&lt;
---
ok
---
Yeah, I fucking hate it 
---
Im looking for urinals so i can use them next to you guys and start a conversation
---
Got it, stagger them or VATS them...
---
But I thought SA was -75% and then another -40% of that remaining 25%?  Thus, shouldn't they be taking 15% damage, at least?
---
Nawww. I don‚Äôt play to compare myself to others. I play for the fun of it 
---
Your lack of coherence is your problem, dont make it anybody elses.
---
Yeah it was late. After you left I ended up being the only person in the server and logged off myself. It feels really really lonely in the game when literally everyone leaves
---
Doubles mining yield if you have both arms installed
---
I'm glad to hear you had fun, pro tip for you, make a new character just for PvP.
---
That's what I had to do, losing 370+ caps a death it got hard to ever walk away better off. So now I'm on a lvl 63 killing level 200+ making bank. It's worth the time investment. 
---
Vats is fine in pve, and it looks like they nerfed it sometime in Feb, at one point you could roll out the crits near full auto. It's still nice to use but an **on demand aimbot has no place in a pvp intended survival game**. 
---
Player interaction is what makes a the game fun, and fo76 is honestly a bland experience, the bots are lame, the story is cute but short.
---
I agree with most of what you posted. For the invisible players use berry mentats. 
---
Most events are triggered as the result of players entering the zone. Those events are fast travel points. If you're in the event you even get a yellow arrow over your head that's visible from quite a ways away. I join in, go into my pip boy and leave the event, and now we can PvP each other. 
---
Sorry man I have Xbox, and all my friends refuse to buy the game
---
If there are plenty of free urinals or toilets but you choose one directly adjacent to another player, it initiates pvp.
---
The first thing I think of is finding a spot that‚Äôs a bit hidden with some distance from the spawn point‚ÄîI‚Äôd bet there‚Äôs a spot on the rocks by Whitespring Station. Then use a silenced sniper weapon to take pot shots at the spawn campers. 
---
Get another teammate or two with zero caps and nothing to drop to run in and keep them distracted while another spawns in repeatedly and you‚Äôll be pretty hard to find. 
---
Throw in some artillery or orbital strikes between you and them to obscure the view even more and a good time could be had. 
---
Good thought!
---
  
---
I actually have made a few Batch files that assigns an instance of the game to a six thread grouping; 2 - 8, 9 - 14, then 15 - 21, while also keeping them on CPU 0.
---
No, just reduces the magnitude of the staggers. I ran it for a bit and you can feel the difference when mobs hit you with 2H weapons. Not sure whether that's going to help with Sentinel PvP though.
---
It works differently than you think. The percentage reduction goes into the same damage equation that armor penetration modifies. I could bore you with math but it's much easier to just say that they will ignore almost all of a normal body shot damage but will take a decent chunk of damage from a headshot crit or sneak attack. The more damage you do on a hit the less will be negated by the armor.
---
*Brain - I need it. I have 300 on me and I don‚Äôt use them often. Pick it up. Gotta have more. 
---
And that's absolutely fine. It's not easy and you with definitely have loses. Let's hope the new pve content coming will be sweet! That's the main reason I turned to PvP as the end game content is extremely lacking unfortunately.
---
Yeah, and why is drugs, explosive dmg, bloodied weapons, sneak dmg allowed....
---
Because VATS crit is a common build for many people and you can't just take that away because you don't like it.
---
If your only choice is to travel to the vault, you're broke and you need to put survival mode aside for a bit. Either you aren't prepared or you need at least a day's worth of vendor runs.
---
I‚Äôm level 43 lol, I do have a squad and we are gonna launch a nuke this weekend
---
I can tell u exactly where the random spot was for that now its gonna take a lot of server hopping to make the cat appear but if u spawn at generals steakhouse and head north up the road within about 100 yards you will see a trailer in the yard on the right out in front of it can spawn " random encounters" one of them can be the cat among other randoms and tames
---
A. Continue Conversation awkwardly   
---
B. Throw hands  
---
C. Ignore
---
Wasn‚Äôt the official wording ‚Äúa random amount‚Äù not ‚Äúsome‚Äù?
---
This is where my last sloth came from
---
There appear to be patterns in the drops, at this point I personally don't think they truly random, but a "Seed".
---
ah ok cool .. nicely done regardless ..
---
Ideally you should have an infinite inventory space for a survival mode
---
Nah it was some. I‚Äôll post a comment with a pic of ‚Äúsome‚Äù
---
I have a friend with a pure rifle build, it's truely nasty. I felt they balanced PvP a little bit though, I don't seem to as easily one shot with melee or my shotty and I'm a bloodied build so you know my damage output is high af. I think it may be the concentrated fire that's still over powered? Unsure though. 
---
I would love a faction war. Maybe limit the map to say a city and then increase the player count? But then that's just tdm I guess?
---
You're completely right. This world compared to the others is so dead and lifeless (and not in a fallout way). So many areas have nothing of interest, or are just so grey. It seems stupid that Bethesda would go to all the trouble of creating these characters and after not left little Easter eggs in the town to make it a more interesting place when you visit, and maybe even give you a hit of nostalgia if you find yourself in Helvetia for some reason.
---
Well I'm an engineer, so I love math...  incidentally has anyone reverse-engineered the damage equations?
---
If you want to do a science project, I'm willing to get shot a lot wearing different armors.
---
I know one person that plays a junkie build. It's damage is on par with executioner and still better than two shot, anti-armor, or furious. Bloodied would still get some benefit from adrenal reaction, but the trade off is too severe.
---
I am reading ‚Äúa random amount‚Äù on their inside the vault post right now. 
---
Yes Bethesda, change it just for this guy. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/lbsGvrS
---
This is what I mean. 
---
yeah..go in adventure mode..store all your aid and loot..id also make sure i dont have too many caps on me :)
---
Bank a crit, VATS, right on the stick to target head from torso, spam that fire till one of you drops
---
And to add if u see one that is tamable its level will be 21 unless it's some weird glitchy tame which is possible 
---
If you get invited to team up that means they are on your server and if your in Adventure, so are they.
---
I am fully behind this idea. 
---
It would be easier to see, lore friendly, and just more aesthetically appealing. 
---
So in other words don't bother with the 60s and 90s it more then likely will not let u tame it
---
I understand. It‚Äôs probably an unfortunate shorthand that doesn‚Äôt translate well. Their more thorough blog post explains the mechanics better. And says it‚Äôs a random amount. 
---
Maybe they tried to make some premium canvas bags, but all they could afford was paper?
---
‚ÄúSome‚Äù:
---
adjective
---
being an undetermined or unspecified one:
---
Yeah, once I read you were wearing PA I realized you were not equipped and did not have the knowledge about PVP builds. It's not a knock, I'm not sure I would if I didn't read about it here and play with a bunch a douchecanoe friends with PVP builds. Sentinel assassin's or cavalier assassin's armor negates 23% of damage per piece and they stack up to 95% or 99% (I'm not sure which, but does it really matter?) You need VATS crits to kill them. Be careful out there. 
---
Sadly yeah
---
Most of the people who complain about having bad drops are the same ones that wouldn't otherwise step foot in a PvP server. You can, somewhat, complete the challenges associated with the named weapons without much incident. For some, it'd be better than running around with their current weapons which are probably non-legendary. 
---
So...do you realize that this is 900 hours guy you replied to, and your videos hugely contributed to his whole thing becoming famous, and even he doesn't like your videos...someone must be doing something wrong somewhere, and I suspect it isn't Bethesda this time.
---
You need 10 violet pure flux which is the main mat you need.
---
Walking through the supermarket there was a huge pile of globes for sale...my eyes lit up!!!!
---
Ah, thanks for the clarification. 
---
Yup. You just talked me out of survival mode.
---
Only carry the absolute necessary about of aid for one life. Do not get killed to 0 caps as it applies a -50% dmg in PvP.  
---
Don't be ashamed to swap servers or walk away from a fight. You don't want to get farmed. Take note of your strengths and weaknesses, research and improve. 
---
Most of all, have fun, don't get salty. 
---
Good luck!
---
Not if they send you Xbox invite or you join through gamer tag
---
I honestly wouldn't mind if they just removed the aid-item drop mechanic, it's just something that makes people not want to play and is easily exploitable with camping and all.   
---
If anything make it to where the player drops a random aid item and it's like a small-average percentage.
---
Yeah, that would be great!
---
Yeah I understand that, I just like the idea of trying to make people interact more. :)
---
Escape artist doesn't work the same way as it does in Fallout 4. In 4, once you crouched, you were instantly lost by the enemy. In 76, your \[danger\] and \[caution\] will slowly go away while you're crouched. If you notice the \[ \] getting further apart, that means you are slowly being lost by the enemy. This doesn't happen without the perk. It stays the current level until you get out of enemy perception range. You can try this out by alerting the ghouls in the golf club and then 'hiding' on the flower bed. Without the perk, they won't ever stop looking for you (or it will take forever for them to stop). With the perk, you will gradually gain back more and more stealth. As long as you're out of line of sight, that is.
---
Like in your credit card video, you say "at this point, it is not an accident; someone is taking conscious decisions that are causing these mishaps one after the other". Like, what is that even supposed to mean? That Bethesda purposely chose to leak the info? Because your comments section sure as hell came to that conclusion. And before you say "I'm not responsible for people's comments", yes, you are. They call you an "influencer" for a reason.
---
&gt; The old system worked fine except for the fact that critical shots were ludicrously op due to a bug that made them ignore all resistances and effects like sentinel and assassin actually stacked
---
Critical shots are how you break through sentinel's. It staggers them and during the stagger you're vulnerable. Everything in this thread that people are speaking of as unbalanced has a distinct counter tactic. Assassin+sentinel is easy to identify and easy to defeat. 
---
Or tie a balloon to the bag. 
---
Oh I do, but then it's just spray and pray at the pink mist, it's alright but it gets old quick, I think their should be a cool down on stealth boys so people cant be constantly invisible? 
---
I just want to be able to have a fair fight , not be fucking demolished with a tse 
---
Fo 1 through 4 were single player though so it made sense
---
Yes.
---
Power armor basically signals to me that a person will be killable, and often more easily so than someone outside of power armor. They \*may\* have higher damage resistance (though you can get pretty high with Vanguard's metal armor) but they definitely aren't running sentinel or cavalier, which, right now, are in a class of their own. Only advantage PA has IMHO is the jet pack for getting out of the way of bloodied cavalier death clawers.
---
I liked the favourites system in Fallout 4. Now I can never slam enough radaway when I'm jammed in a corner by ferals. 
---
I didn‚Äôt. I spawned around whitesprings and did a couple laps getting legendaries. Lasted 16m without seeing anyone. 
---
Finally found a player in power armor. Went to take him down. Figured it would be easy as I run an bloodied unyielding melee. Usually do 1,000 damage. Wrong. Pacifist mode was still on. He kills me after I hit him 6-7 times with my polehook. 
---
Respawned at train station. Insta-death twice. The story keeps going. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to sound whiny, but I have seen other people talking about this and I do believe this quick fix could really help Survival mode. Survival is in Beta and Bethesda is looking for feedback, I highly doubt anyone at Bethesda will see this post, but hey, who knows!
---
I actually talked about him in a dedicated video specifically because it was getting so much attention. I mentioned him briefly in a previous video. I don't think I was a main contributor, upvotes on this sub were likely the main one/YongYea. I specifically made a video on it due to the misinformation. 
---
I still get messages daily from people who claim to be falsely banned. I still personally believe some people were falsely banned. 900 hours guy might be lying, but that wasn't really the point of either video. I'm not sure what I am doing wrong could you elaborate? 
---
Do you recognize how this post can be seen as misleading? I don't mind constructive criticism, but this post seems like it is very misleading to people who did not watch my videos. 
---
Sent  psn friend request like an hour ago, you still on? Onepompousa55
---
I remember reading people asking for this exact thing and now that it's here...
---
Honestly, I didn't *really* consider actual players being the courier in my suggestion, but that could indeed be a way to add new Dailies! 
---
I see it functioning something like: ~~The package is almost instantly delivered~~ *~~(or within a couple minutes, doesn't need to be prioritized as a server process)~~*~~, since we've grown accustomed to fast service. However, to keep with the "lore" of mail delivery, players can do these Dailies to earn caps and XP~~ 
---
Nope, that isn't going to work out as I originally planned I don't think, so switching gears just slightly...  
---
We'll stick with it taking X-minutes to be delivered (where it **will** get delivered no matter what), and it being a Daily quest that people can accept, maybe up to 5/day depending on reward balance. However, if a player decides to run a delivery now it becomes a bit of a race. You are given X-amount of time, based on where you start and the distance to the delivery. The faster you are, the more XP and Caps (Atoms?) you receive as a reward, but if you Fast Travel you only receive a fraction of the reward. In other words you are rewarded for huffing it on foot. Naturally, there would be at least one random spawn to throw a wrench in your plans. Perhaps a guaranteed Legendary to sweeten the deal? Maybe that *in itself* is the incentive to run it on foot (no fast travel), instead of the delivery reward being cut back?
---
If you happen to deliver it before that guaranteed server-issued delivery time, then it literally is delivered by you to the player's mailbox. 
---
Contingencies:  
---
\-If the player has not already placed a Mailbox at their CAMP, one will temporarily spawn next to the point where you would arrive when you TP to it. That will then guarantee the 'courier' has something to physically interact with, but *also* allow players to designate where they'd like the mailbox to actually be in order to better fit their build.  
---
\-CAMP owner is not allowed to move its location until the delivery is made. Something-something-"You have an incoming mail delivery, please wait!"  
---
\-In the event the CAMP owner signs off/disconnects, maybe an indestructible phantom-base lingers until the time runs out on the delivery.... Or maybe just the Mailbox remains for the courier to deliver to. 
---
Holy crap ive never seen that guy before! How cute:)
---
And I agree with that last bit too. Like I said originally, I play Team Fortress 2. The in-game store is way overpriced there compared to the community market for Steam, but I‚Äôll still occasionally buy from it to support the game. 
---
I can craft you the marine armor helm, then if you scrap it you can also craft that one
---
I haven‚Äôt had much of a problem w/ the whole spawn camping thing, but I think that the invulnerability should last a few minutes, but go away once you move/equip weapon
---
Not sure about these cats, but I found a house cat yesterday I had the option to tame. There‚Äôs a commonly used random encounter location in the top right of the map, and I‚Äôve seen both a guard dog and a house cat spawn there.
---
I'd much rather wait for a private server and know with certainty that I won't have to worry about someone trying to kill/troll/annoy me at all. It's great that it doesn't cause you stress or result in an unpleasant game session for you. For myself though, if I can't play it without removing that potential source of stress then I just won't play it because it's not worth the tradeoff to me. I'll just wait for the reviews on the next single player fallout game.
---
That‚Äôs me. I find PvP stressful. I didn‚Äôt get into the COD type online shooters. This was new. This was fast. 
---
Everytime I see a first aid kit in real life, I ALWAYS have the urge to just loot it. Never gone through with it, of course. But still, there could be some stimpaks and radaway in there. 
---
I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs little point in venturing into survival mode if you don‚Äôt have a TSE weapon? Seems to me that these will just be one shot battles
---
I have thought this exact same thing. The only thing I‚Äôve noticed the sneak perk making a difference with is mobs. They will stand right in front of u without seeing you 9/10 times.
---
Forreal I wanted to buy it yest but was busy hopped on today it‚Äôs not there ;( 
---
1. Is it safe to drink
---
2. Is it carbonated, like, you know, soda
---
3. Does it taste good
---
4. If yes to all of the above, how soon can i buy a bottle
---
thx - i definitely wont get salty..this should be fun
---
Assuming you filled out the support ticket, start over using the bethesda account he used to order it. Other than that, no.
---
The fact this happens literally made stop playing survival, why should I lose a crap ton of meds and food just because I died? The punishment for dying is just too much to be worth 20% extra exp.
---
Depends on your build. If you specialise into heavy weapons then the Gatling Gun is best. If you have a rifleman build, then the Gauss rifle is better.
---
You can craft it at your camp. It‚Äôs under utility for the cooking bench. You can grow all the ingredients at your camp for cooking oil btw.
---
No it's fine the way it is, if you're stupid enough to run around with a ridiculous surplus of aid items when you know you lose aid on death.. Yeah that's on you. Take the bare minimum for one life. If you need more restock. 
---
I'm pretty sure I've found a few...but honestly I might just be thinking of 4. I'm gonna make sure to keep an eye out now
---
what does this comment add to the universe, it simply does not need to exist
---
Players will always find a way to troll or interfere with you, even if it's just dragging enemies over next to you and fighting them on top of you, or killing everything in the area you're trying to farm. I'm not interested in that so I'll wait for the private server or just not play at all if they never end up being released. Thanks for the suggestion though.
---
Yes, but wholes sentinel assassin sets and the 5000 damage criticals shouldn‚Äôt exist in the first place. If both ceased to exist, the game would have been fine.
---
That's why I loved the Scrap Everything type mods in Fallout 4. Erase any and all trees and shrubs!
---
I have no where to store my extra stims! And can‚Äôt make a mule character because I can‚Äôt trust anyone with transferring my items. 
---
Is the offer still up sorry fell r to check reddut
---
Get Dense on your chest piece and a maxed fireproof perk card :)
---
Sure I'm just at my camp add me and stop by
---
Sorry I dont have the caps atm will hit up the vendors real quick
---
man... thats awesome!
---
Whitesprings - outbuilding with the Christmas tree has toys. Also the toy store inside the resort occasionally has loose toys. You can find 9-12 at the Aaronholt Homestead - remember the two loose banjos have a screw each in them plus one of the houses has a guaranteed Carlisle typewriter and pepper mill (4 screws total between these two items). Along the S/SW corner of the lake near Charleston are a good stretch of various large houses, toys in the kids rooms and usually desk fan and typewriter in each home office (15-20 screws for a decent run). The water park has a good amount of toys, the fair ground has a few but nothing too wild if you aren‚Äôt in the area (the lab close by up the hill has some toys also). The amusement park in the Ash Heap has some toys, not worth a separate trip though.
---
The general point being your best bets are always houses. Each one has a home office, children‚Äôs bedroom, and kitchen (chance for pepper mills). Plus they seem less trafficked than places like Sugar Grove or the Enclave that are always looted. Office buildings and factories have decent quantities sometimes, but I can clear a house in a minute or two whereas a place like WV Lumber Co. can take half an hour to loot thoroughly for the same amount of screws. 
---
I rarely ever recommend this final source, but do not hesitate to buy them in bulk from vendors. They are kind of expensive but caps are easy enough to come by and it saves time in a pinch.
---
980ti here and I get the same. Game runs great everywhere but whitesprings.
---
Then get good armour, sneak, choose your fights, kill them first. 
---
Stop complaining.
---
Tse are weak! You're just a noob at PvP.
---
Do you have dense as your chest armour mod do you run fireproof level 3? 
---
Youre complaining about something you don't understand when it's easily countered. 
---
So many of you idiots. I never thought the fallout player base was filled with casuals.
---
If you can't find anyone, I'd love to team up. I'm Lvl 131, run a PA heavy weapons build with a AAE Gatling Gun 
---
You mean give player choices that can effect their gameplay/story? Isn‚Äôt that what obsidian is for?
---
You're missing:
---
* **NIRA**, Supermutants
---
* **Pleasant Valley**, Scorched (Yes, conquerors can spawn as 3*) or Supermutants. Sometimes Moleminers which suck.
---
* **Harpers Ferry**, Supermutants and/or Scorched.
---
Is this on PC? I had a similar issue, pressing Enter instead of space bar connected the wires in my case, even though the instructions said space.
---
People have been doing this forever. I remember in CS before steam people did the ol jump crouch and shoot around corners
---
i managed to get the bundle earlier today. however the icon for it on the atom shop is no longer there for me to preview it, but all the items are added as separate things in my owned selection
---
*You can now jump higher with less load.*
---
Awesome thanks for that info! Yea I've noticed its tricky looting all the enemies at fissure with the lag and sometimes just disappearing entirely but dont they drop the same supplies as well? Is there all variants of flux there? I've primarily encountered yellowcake and ultraviolet I think. 
---
Isn't that ironic, considering how your (and others such as YongYea, why push it all on your shoulders only) videos mislead people who have never played the game? You made an entire video titled "Is Fallout 76 going F2p?" and *another* one titled "Fallout 76 quietly moving towards F2P?" or something of that sort. Both videos based on *completely* baseless rumors. You very tactfully get away with it by adding a note of interrogation after each sentence. Instead of making a statement, you make a suggestion and fool people into thinking it's their own idea. Notice how my post asks "Is there any low this guy won't sink to?" and the general consensus is that there indeed isn't. I never said it, I just suggested it. Same thing happens with your viewers.
---
Coming back to 76: so you made F2P rumor videos. But was there any video titled that Bethesda debunks such rumors? No. You said it, yes, but at the end of the video. You know not everyone watches your entire (albeit tiny) videos with the same attention. People form 70% of their opinion from the click-baity headline, and 99.9% is done within the first two minutes of your video, where you very thinly veil your opinions as facts. You do this with the ban videos about how you are "sure" that Bethesda's anti-cheat is falsely flagging players. You do this with your lunchbox videos and use the datamined footage "evidence" that lunchboxes are coming to the game. Now your fans comment everywhere how Fallout 76 is filled with lootboxes and pay-to-win microtransactions. There are 2posts like that on the sub every week even now, and they all must have gotten the idea somewhere. But no, you are not responsiblr for their opinions, right? You didn't light the fire, you just poured a lot of fuel into it, how can they charge you with arson?
---
it's not all about you.
---
I'd also love to have the option to atleast track my own stats, something past games have had.
---
Being able to compare myself with other players is an enjoyable reflection on mine and others play styles. 
---
and thats why i stay away from survival ... never ever found a two shot or exploseive weapon ... safe to say both perks on one weapon ... And seeing everyone being stacked with several of these TSE weapons, i realized there is no point in trying out survival either because i can't compete anyway with my anti-mirelurk assault rifle. 
---
Ok this seriously makes me think again about this. Today and yesterday I‚Äôve had a legendary enemy almost instantly despawn when I killed them. At first I thought the body just got exploded or knocked somewhere I missed and kept checking bodies, but the second one was a ghoul in the clubhouse and there isn‚Äôt much room for him to go flying off, yet once again I couldn‚Äôt find his body to loot.
---
I know how this sub has had to deal with people making up bullshit rumors, so for now I‚Äôm gonna assume they are not vanishing and I somehow lost a dead legendary twice. I do have a video of the second, gonna go look.
---
Just because you are having a blast doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good. Fallout 76 on launch is an example. Loved the game but it was still bad. 
---
High level players get fucked if they hold any amount of caps, low players get fucked if they carry any amount of caps, the spawn invincibility is fucked because of the loading times, if you die at a train station good luck getting anything back unless you have a friend or can actually load in. Just trying to farm supplies is a pain because if you are in first place you have a target on you. You can get killed multiple times but kill the player once and you have a 200 cap bounty and now you are even more fucked just for fighting back. You go to your camp, if they have any clue how to play you camp is completely fucked. Not being able to fast travel is fun and all, but if no players are next to you and your in the wasteland good luck getting any caps if you are completely out. Which is a problem on adventure too but you can see people and travel to them if they let you. Same in survival but the chances are almost 0.
---
Cures disease.  Must have toilet paper too. 
---
Love when that happens 
---
1. Absolutely not, it‚Äôs unfortunately toxic
---
2. Sadly no
---
3. Eh probably, it looks like it does
---
4. 1/3 are yes!
---
Or, just load in first and place that juicy 10 turrets wined right at the spawn point!
---
Every player above level 50 if they have level 50 loot should be able to have a chance no matter what. I‚Äôm not saying they should win 50/50 but they should be able to win at least once out of every 10 times which just isn‚Äôt a thing. Stealth boys and assassin sentinel armor is just complete aids. 
---
Melee players have no chance unless the other player is stupid or just doesn‚Äôt care to pay attention.
---
They need to tone down those percentages on those legendaries.
---
that title is what my ex said and now I feel sad 
---
"Probably"
---
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!
---
I like the brown paper bag because it reminds me of trips to buy weed, legally, mind you. I want cannabis plants for my camp.
---
Me, just like I played FO4 before. I hope one day we can host private servers with no legendaries.
---
No need:
---
Damage = damage x (damage / armor x 0.15)^0.36
---
Good idea. Or maybe just certain legendary effects, like keep weightless and a couple others that offer buffs to special 
---
My theory is that Survival mode was actually put in ONLY to try to get all the cheaters and griefers to go there and leave the rest of the player-base alone for a while.
---
No.

perk loadout manager mod is saying they are changing the resource archive line, so it has to be updated:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124?tab=posts
---
but he doesn't say to what, just that the latest version of his mod uses a different load line.
---
Fallout 76 has outdated engine (made in 2011). It is terrible at allocating resources &amp; unstable. Even with highend &amp; latest video cards you sometimes get frame losses and slight freezes when playing the game. When the game is terribly bad at processing efficiency, the chip must work twice as hard. More work means more heat.
---
Fallout related?
---
Also serendipity can negate all damage. 
---
There is a lot of counters to the armour. Grenades are also very effective and will force them to move. No changes are necessary people just need to educate themselves, and get good.
---
Next version: All Rise
---
There is a reason for downvotes, when the opinion is highly disagreed upon or the person says something stupid. There is a reason all of the comments were downvoted.

Also instead of just saying no or get good, give a reason.

I think we've had enough nerfs. Let's try the nerf via buffing other things approach this time.
---
We could have saved custom phrases that you put in to use like the emote wheel
---
Events seize control over major in game locations for your faction 
---
Casuals? This is a casual game what‚Äôs the problem?
---
You're two weeks late with the news, friend, but welcome back to Appalachia.

It's all about your build, tse aren't the best weapons, in fact they're actually terrible against top tier builds.
---
These arent new just random Mr squeeze
---
How do I get densed is it a mod ? Or a legendary perk 
---
Tse are trash, especially in PvP. Against good players anyways.

There‚Äôs a saying in Eve Online.

Lol is the current system pretty much like how they send people back in the movie Looper?
---
Mr. Squeeze is new to some
---
Lol just search the word lemonade in the sub you may see a few of it 
---
Tons of people smoke and we're not all jerks. The friends I play with don't partake and they still invite me to play so I can't be that bad. In fact, nothing in my camp is locked and I am right by a station. Some low level people have shown up when I am there and I have modded or repaired their gear before continuing on the adventure. There are definitely audible bong rips cuz sometimes I forget to mute. That's all that really happens. I forget things. I don't become a jerk.
---
I need to buy more workshop plans
---
Its much better for me. Much less CTD &amp; Disconnects. FPS seems generally higher (though I echo the Whitesprings FPS drop, as well as Grafton train station if you look north). Running i7-6700k/32GB/1070 SLI (which may have something to do with it, don't think its optimized for SLI per the usual)
---
if you were the one afk by camp venture yesterday, im sorry, had so many aid items i couldnt even sell them all to the vendors.
---
Yeah... as soon as I hit #3 on the leader board for time played, that was my cue to log out of survival.  Time to get there?  45 minutes.
---
Need a whole bunch of supervillain outfits. Kick in the Captain Cosmos outfit too. Just in general more costumes
---
Psn?
---
Why not just go for simple text-chat like any other multiplayergame has in these modern days ?
---
Same as my name draco_86
---
I was honing to buy it Friday when I got paid.  It said 6 Days... 
---
If you carry more than you need for one life, you're an idiot. When you can lose aid why would you carry more than the absolute bare minimum. 
---
As of March 27; yes.
---
This way, you can quickly select a phrase instead of having to type it out.
---
I will team up with you, I‚Äôm a stealth rifleman build with an explosive lever action rifle. If we have two more people at least level 90 we can do pretty well in survival 
---
The spawn killing needs fixing. Nothing else is really a problem. It's fantastic.
---
lost so many this way
---
Stimpaks
---
Google it. Fallout power armor mods. There is list and description.  I asked they same thing before and that is how I found my answer. 
---
Mole Rat Chunks are my lifeline.
---
... 
---
Stash management is a crucial part of this game.  Bulk and sell resources you are not using.  Sell 1 star legendaries that don't fit playstyle.  Sell a few of your 200 PLUS STIMPACKS THAT'S AT LEAST 50 WEIGHT DEPENDING ON PERKS!  WHY DO YOU NEED THAT MANY STIMS?  MAKE LIKE SANTA CLAUS AND PASS THOSE OUT AS PARTY FAVORS! 
---
Whew, sorry.  Got a little worked up.  Someone needs to start a YouTube series on video game hoarders.

Oh shit mistyped it I have 1060 not 1080.
---
Okay.
---
Thank you dude!
---
If you do it well, you make much more caps than you lose
---
Also wondering the same thing, I have a TSE assaultron head but no point in using it.
---
I should maybe be nerfed a bit though. Having an aim bot with increased damage is a bit op with no real disadvantage. The only counter is stealth boys. At least most other things have a reasonable counter. 
---
I had at one point with super duper about 80 and thought it was time to sell 50 of them. 
---
I have never seen Mr. Squeeze before until now.
---
I may be talking completely out of my arse, but your cross hairs in first person should be a bit closer together and/or come together faster when you are non scoped. Should be a tighter grouping of bullets if scoped.

Accuracy in FO76 modulates the COF (cone of fire).

I think last bastion's benefit is pretty small. Certainly not a game changer. You won't miss it if you have a better chest piece.

My buddy has so many mini nukes and missiles, he's been looking for excuses to use em all lol. My favorite thing is when he uses his two shot MIRV. He can only fire straight into the air because if he shoots anywhere else he dies instantly
---
Well I mean, I think you should have more than 30 stimpacks. I just take a lot of damage I guess.

Literally legendaries are the only thing that make this game fun,  whats the point of getting good gear if you can‚Äôt even use it

If they didn't want these guns doing thousands of damage, why did they make them do thousands of damage? Hell, I'd be happy with a nerf if it made the thing actually viable. Maybe limit it to 500 Energy Damage? I dunno. Anything's more useful than eighty.

 **KTHXBAI** means "OK, Thanks, Bye" . Typically used on memes or texting.

My bad - I thought you guys were still talking about West Tek, not Defiance!

‚ÄúSide effects: illness, addiction, permanent brain damage... y‚Äôknow the list goes on, it‚Äôs not great, but you get the idea.‚Äù

I have full sentinel assassins, I have fireproof max, swapped dense for pneumatic, I PvP A LOT, I think pneumatic is slightly better for me.

Bulking junk reduces weight.

I made 1 video on Fallout 76 going free to play where I give my take on the issue and conclude: we might see a price cut soon (this was during a period where it was consistently on sale) and conclude that no it is almost certainly not going free to play anytime soon. 
---
I also think you really miss the point with many of those videos. In a lot of my recent upload I quite clearly lay out the facts and then give my opinions and speculation. You also make it seem like I make these claims in the videos. I never said loot boxes were on the way, I was super clear that this thing that looks like a loot box was found in a dev room and in the files. I expand saying I really don't think Bethesda is that dumb to add it in. I don't think the solution is ignoring it either though?
---
Same with the ban videos. I point out some players say they were falsely banned and that a couple false positives are plausible. I also am really clear in saying that might be just 1% of players with 99% of the posts we see being lies. 
---
I think you are giving way too much influence to me and really miscommunicating what I say which is unfair. Like this post, was the goal to just mislead people to stir up hate? Why do that, there are genuine things to criticize and then there is BS like this which is just so unecessarily misleading. You pick out these select few examples and ignore so many others. What about when the pay 2 win controversy started and I said people were blowing that out of proportion? Or when I showcased how nice people in this game are? Or literally any video that isn't over 2 months old when most of the ones you reference are. Honestly to me it feels like you are mad people are toxic towards Fallout 76 and trying to put the blame on me, using misleading information in the process. 
---
I am all for criticism of me and my content. I think there is a lot of room for me to improve and if you watch some of the above mentioned videos vs some I posted in the past few weeks I think that shows. Were there times where I was unnecessarily toxic towards this game? Absolutely. I got way to excited and made several fuckups. 
---
In the end I adore you taking the time to respond to me as many will just ignore me, I just genuinely believe you are not going about this in the best way possible. I think we both want the best for this game and there are better ways to communicate than this, certain more cordial ways. 
---
My Survival character runs with Serendipity and it is amazing.
---
Yup it does feel like that, and its so much better than any BR I've played.
---
Well, it is autoequipped when I switch to my crafting profile, but I guess I can stop looking to see if it will proc.
---
Lunch boxes could be an add on. Like drop them then transfer stuff into them
---
I could see
---
1-10
---
11-30
---
31-50
---
51+
---
Obviously the majority of servers would exist in the 51+ category but you could actually play low levels on survival like this.
---
yeah for sure. its just safe for now to not trust fast traveling to any stations. im sure they will do something about it
---
You were part of a different, Team Justice.
---
Yeah I was planning on getting this near the end of the week when I had enough atoms saved for it. Hope they didn't remove it early for some reason :/
---
I know it had issues with the shotgun skin where it wasn't giving it out with the rest of the bundle, so it might just be taken down until they fix that.
---
/u/ladydevann do you know what happened to the Camo Bundle and if its just been temporarily taken off, or is it gone for good?
---
I don‚Äôt use Reddit a lot as posts so yeah. I don‚Äôt know how to do that. I was just trying to help some people out.
---
I think the BOS bot has it? Or maybe check the Raiders? I'm not completely sure, sorry
---
yeah a few things were bugged when I played. For a little while, none of the top 3 could even be seen. So i lived for a very long time. You get literally nothing for it anyway to be top 3 lol. but yeah, hardmode is being a fresh spawn and ive been really enjoying it and getting picks on higher level characters!
---
Are the "Scorched" variants of creatures tamable? 
---
I ask not just out of actual curiosity, but also because technically that would go against the lore of a Hive Mind, as I wouldn't expect them to be capable of being tamed then. 
---
Sucks that they have to be alone, though. There was a pack of wolves (non-hostile, as I recall, and I want to say two Grey Wolves) that once spawned near the Razorback location, and one looked an awful lot like my Husky IRL (tan and white). Would've loved to be able to tame one :)
---
I'm sure they already have such a thing for limiting the number of paper bags from any one player.
---
True, but there is a mod for glowing paper bags, making them easier to find. 
---
I am sorry that the mods are not on console, but the good news is that the PC right now works as a "beta" for mods for F76, and when official mod support does come out a lot of already tested mods can immediatly be ported over to consoles. 
---
The only problem here is the no spawn protection. 
---
You know the risks of this mode. You shouldn't have been stood around in one location. 
---
Maybe switch the top three shown to most kills instead of time alive though as well.
---
You shouldn't have respawned more than twice at the location after getting spawn killed, that parts on you.
---
Well, there ya go then. Problem solved.
---
Isn‚Äôt the
---
Or, and here's a crazy thought - maybe they need to have PvP-specific perk cards that deal with exactly this.  They would cost SPECIAL points, so you'd have to choose what you feel more comfortable dropping.  Want to keep more Caps than usual?  Or reduce the amount of Aid you drop?
---
I ran into this event during the beta, and have followed a ginger cat around the Ash Heap a few times. There's also the Eyed Piper, an eyebot taking a bunch of radrats on a trip.  The dog Walker protectron with it's pack of (wild) dogs. Apparently people have found a dead Deathclaw that registers as a vendor too.
---
Ooooh thanks, yeah that makes sense I feel dumb now that‚Äôs like physics 101
---
The SBQ is supposed to drop a different prime plan every time you kill her until you‚Äôve learned them all
---
Some friends and I are joking about the same thing but with spears instead of knives, whoever survives the longest wins
---
No sand here. Just a lot of other weapons I do actually play with. Keeps the game entertaining 
---
My level 60 can kill everyone as it has the absolute best armour and weapons. So you want to limit me to other low levels? It'd be a massacre.
---
Think again.
---
I mean... that's what mine are there for... üòã
---
I hate those darn things with a passion! I managed to defeat the queen and its countless mobs, beat 3 players in PvP after the event. Over encumbered and highly radiated with only a sliver of health left i heard that burrowing noise and im like nope! Jumped with marsupial and then used my jet pack only to see this darn thing shoot up in the air and bite me dead! Though i also managed to kill it mid air, as i picked up loot i could still see that burrow high up in the air. Seriously? What in the freakin world is that BS. 
---
I honestly think its Bethesda's way of trolling,  kind of like those exploding robots in watoga, ive seen countless players die off of em, as soon as i see a melee dude trying to whack those things i take a few step back and watch as they get blown up.
---
Yeah its like,"hey,pvp time!" then i get killed once "ok time to go back to  A mode to farm stims for an hour"  that sucks.And yeah I just heard about just taking what you need wich sound good but my problem is i cannot stash anymore stims.Stashed all I can and now i have a full stash and still 125 stims with me.So yeah i dont know what to do.I want to pvp ( i like it) but really i dont want to loose stuff i farm.  
---
I dont know why we have to drop stuff when pvping.Before srvival mode I used to pvp a lot and I will just do it for fun.I dont even cared about what they dropped.  
---
Why not add some kinds of buff you earn by killing players and that you can also loose by being killed by players.Or titles.Or even a pvp currency like ESO Imperial city dlc.  
---
These are the things I dropped. Didnt loose them cause i killed myself with a mobs to see what i drop.  
---
22 Ballistic Bock (brewing,ouch!)  
---
4 cranberry relish :(  
---
8 med X  
---
10 psychobuffs  
---
29 purified water  
---
11 rad away  
---
29 diluted stims  
---
14 stims  
---
3 super stims  
---
2 disease cure  
---
That in just 1 life.I know i didnt loose like 100 of something like other ppl,but with just loosing the 22 ballistic bock,just that would make me quit.Now I have to see what i can do to stash more stims and other aid i carry so i can go pvp and not loose that much.Surely its going to be having to spend 30 mins sorting my stash and deciding what to eliminate and what not.Sucks.Hopefully they will adjust the mode.
---
ok, but whats the resolution you play at?
---
Inb4 Bethesda makes buyable bag skins
---
Just an armor mod
---
Scrapping gear for that one should yield it eventually
---
Can‚Äôt recall if that one is plan locked only to be honest...
---
Fissure enemies probably drop the same stuff but I‚Äôm gonna be real honest, if I go on a queen run I rarely ever manage to loot anything but the dead queen lol. Flux I find at Whitesprings is yellowcake, fluorescent, crimson, &amp; cobalt. But I will go down to the fissure if I need violet cause I‚Äôm almost certain there‚Äôs none at Whitesprings. I don‚Äôt worry about any other flux at the fissure tbh. I know the flora at Whitesprings well enough &amp; I get a ton of each. So maybe it‚Äôs just me ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
Well put.
---
bone worms. rad worms is ghouls
---
I shouldnt have respawned in the same place three times true. His switchblade shouldnt be stronger than a gun though.
---
Why do people keep saying that locking out old characters would change anything? 
---
Its not like explosive weapons are *impossibly rare* even discounting douping. The servers would end up like this in time anyway.
---
Where's the ants?! I only seen them when doing that tea event, that and mosquitos.
---
How many stars? I'll trade a TES dragon for it or 500 caps and ass/sent combat armor chest piece if it's a bloodied 3* .. I'm in survival though. /s Looks awesome!
---
Only bulk lead and aluminium reduce weight if I recall correctly
---
huh?  you been drinking again?
---
Sad thing is the number of recently excited players who will not return to Survival Mode or may even leave the game because of the bad taste from these one shot camps, there are other games out there.
---
Probably be best if they just automatically deducted caps from the wanted players when they leave server.
---
If I may ask - when another players uses Serendipity, what does it look like on the attacker's side if they use melee?  Do you still get a hit sound effect?  Or is it like you swung at air?
---
another alcoholic voices nonsense.  could not even comprehend my OP he is so DAK (drunk at keyboard)
---
I have max strength and perception and all the heavy weapons and rifleman perks. So if I have both maxed out, what do u think is the best in the end. 
---
Fuck it. I just logon at my home base, cook some shit ,go off and do my quests ( lvl 34)  and enjoy 20 % exp!
---
*Hears burrowing sound*
---
‚ÄúOh boy here I go getting diseased again!‚Äù
---
Just need to scale and balance 
---
There is a mod that does just that. Changes the bag to a lunchbox. Another turns it into a 76 backpack. Only those with the mod installed can see it. Without the mod they just see a brown bag. But I agree with you on the bags are ugly and not part of the Fallout theme. Bethesda should pay more attention to what the mod authors are doing. They make some of the coolest stuff as well as fixing things Bethesda failed to get right.

If you feel like giving any away, hit me up.
---
Chance to catch a disease from sitting on a public toilet, 10% chance of catching ebola (Die in 3 days ingame time unless cured), 50% chance of catching e.coli (Slowly drains health per use of AP).
---
That's how it works on PC, but not consoles
---
Sell junk/aid items to the vendors every day. You can make 1400/day by going to the 7 vendors.
---
Responders, raiders, harpers ferry, watoga train station, watoga shopping plaza, White springs and White springs bunker (enclave)
---
Yeah the queen always drops a prime plan and typically an ultracite pa plan. Have only gotten 1 prime plan from a regular sb.
---
thats probably why then. the combination of the CPU being better and a lower resolution means better performance. 
---
Same processor, but half the RAM and a 980 ti.  The game's performance is generally fine, but there are definite hiccups that seem related to loading player CAMPs.  If someone builds their CAMP in Summersville Lake, for example, I get a lot of hitching as that CAMP phases into existence.
---
I think I got it from Grahm 
---
Yes, if you could opt out of a leaderboard challenge, I think that would be the optimal solution. 
---
I think there is a little camp fire by their name on the social menu to show they are in survival. Not sure if it shows at all during an invite tho. 
---
Well I cant really blame you there. The queen is hard enough to take down at this point. Fluorescent was the other one I was thinking about at whitesprings. There was one time at fissure where I went through the entire map collecting all kinds of flux but someone that was in pvp with my teammate just one hit killed me and took all my junk, so I couldn't stabilize anything. Honestly haven't really tried to collect flora since then lol

Thanks, I‚Äôll keep checking 
---
Enclave White springs bunker I believe 
---
Gilded as in like, looks gold? üò∂
---
I concur. I've picked up higher damage weapons, but my vampire .50-cal has totally negated my need for stimpacks, and has made me essentially unkillable in normal PvE. Does it take longer to kill big tough mobs than it would with a TSE weapon? Yes. Is it worth it to just keep the bullets rolling and not have to worry about dying? Heck yes.
---
Thank you 
---
Weighs nothing? Pick it u- oh...
---
Wrong. Get stabbed in the throat you are dead. 
---
With perks mutations and the right build you can make melee weapons easily hit 300+ 
---
Most dmg I've got to with a melee weapons was 6.5k and that wasnt with any magazines or bobble heads. If your weapon isn't doing 200+ you're weak.
---
Most of my weapons and my friends weapons dmg range from 500 - 2000 dmg. 
---
Yea you know something is up cause they just dropped the thing entirely, nothing in the inside the vault about ‚Äúhow successful‚Äù it was, and not a single response to anything in here since the ‚Äúit‚Äôs dropping, just to people who never post online or wear them...‚Äù 
---
And it WAS a successful event, it was fun as heck, it got everyone together and let us dress up and show off, it was great. 
---
But it‚Äôs now been ruined, nobody will talk about it till next year, next year the 5 unobtainable masks will be the first 5 and people will day that‚Äôs what they meant to do in the first place.  
---
Nice!  I will check there again
---
I had one fall into a patch of asters. It was impossible to pick up. Only the asters would highlight. Eventually I had an idea. I moved my camp and used the water pump to bulldoze the asters. Then I was able to get the bag. I wanted that bag badly as I had just left a nuke zone and my flux was in there.
---
Make sure you go to the vendors in the armory for that
---
Server hop at Charleston there‚Äôs two Grafton monsters that have about 30 to 50 caps between them also Charleston has a decent amount of super mutants along with that there‚Äôs 1400 caps a day to be made between all vendors when you fast travel try to make it so there‚Äôs a event near your destination so you can offset your travel cost
---
Right on, as you couldn't get addictions until a patch or 2 ago it wasn't anything I'd ever considered.  
---
But I recall builds in fo4 dealing 10k+ damage with junkies Gauss Rifles and every last addition in existence :)
---
In addition to that, I've tamed a Mirelurk King, a radrat and a cat, and can confirm wolves.
---
Definitely need diseases that WILL kill you instead of just being a temporary annoyance.
---
I think you two should ask the Mayor of Watoga to resolve this dispute.
---
Thanks 
---
Last I saw, they took it down to fix the issue with the shotgun skin not being given. Once its fixed, it'll be put back on the shop, and owners of it before it was taken down will get the skin.
---
This is something I find conflicting, because the lore of the Mechanist is... Odd. In Fallout 3 he's described as being a post-War superhero. In Fallout 4, the new Mechanist claims she found the designs on a ransacked caravan and that it was a made up hero, again, post-War. But then the Silver Shroud, a pre-War radio play, has the Mechanist. Not just as a character, but as a super-villain.
---
Bethesda doesn't know whether the character THEY CREATED is pre-War, post-War, hero or villain. They can't make their gosh darn minds up.
---
Assuming that the Mechanist WAS a pre-War villain and the man in Canterbury Commons simply thought it was a hero, and then Isabella Cruz made the same mistake in Boston, then I guess it's okay for a Mechanist costume to exist in Fallout 76 (hopefully different than the Fallout 4 version, since that was a proper suit made of metal, a pre-War Halloween costume would look a bit different). So long as they don't bring in the AntAgonizer...
---
Dr. Brainwash, Commie-Kazi and Red Menace costumes would also be cool.
---
Thats a problem in a so called survival mode. This kind of PVP shouldnt be based on whether youve managed to find that legendary weapon and stacked perks that make you do OP damage. Especially if the servers are not based on your level. Either scale all weapons to a realistic standard or make ot so that level 5-50 players arent in the same servers as 100+ players. I shot him five times with a rifle when he was already at about %25 health and it did almost nothing.
---
I would like to formally thank the troll who, in another suggestion post, said "stop suggesting shitty ideas". No sir, no I will not.
---
There are seven different vendor factions. You can sell up to 200 caps per day per faction. So that means you can earn 1,400 caps a day from selling stuff. Start with collecting the golf uniforms from the golf course, bulk your scrap, sell the armor and weapons you don't want, though I prefer to scrap to learn more mods and to get the scrap. These are some actions you can take. 
---
Here is a map that I feel will be useful which can be found at http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-vendor-map-2.jpg.
---
I'm in your world on my heavy weapons dude.
---
That's pretty awesome! Great work!
---
It's black with a fancy gold baroque(?) and floral designs, I'll post a picture as soon as I can
---
Save ammo you don't use and sell it. Shotgun shells and 5.56 sell pretty well. Hard to farm junk like ballistic fiber, screws, and fiber optics are also worth some change to players in need. Stimpacks, Rad-X, and Radaway may also be worth a bit.
---
As mentioned, hit up all seven faction vendors every day. They're on a 20-hour reset I believe, so dump your stuff and come back the next day for more. 
---
It was fixed last update- I fired off my first assaultron head since the ‚Äòincident we don‚Äôt speak of‚Äô. Still not my fave weapon but nice to not lose all my ammo in one blast
---
I'd say it depends on how confident you are in PvP, how tanky you are, both are really good when done properly. At this point you just have to choose how you want to play. I would like to see more heavy gunners out there though. People are sleeping on them.
---
Indeed
---
Sure right
---
Still waiting on some nice matte black Enclave Power Armor Paint.

There's a mod on Nexus which teases me every single time I look at someone wearing Bumblebee Prototype X-01 or unpainted Chrome X-01.

I don't think you can tame Scorched creatures, but tame creatures can be Scorched (during Scorchbeast attacks), at which point they turn permanently hostile on your CAMP.
---
some cardboard armor but fancy super sledge xd
---
Actually not that hard. The .ba2 format mods are just a file name in a section of the Fallout76custom.ini. And there's a mod manager that will write that file for you. It also installs the BA2 file.
---
This one time at band camp...
---
For the love of god dump most of your aid in your stash.
---
Omw
---
There was, but according to other comments on this post they're taking it down for fixes or something.
---
I want to say I've seen it at the Harper's Ferry vendor, but don't quote me.
---
I believe you still get the contact sound. But it's not something I've honestly tested. But I'm like 90% sure you here contact.
---
Bethesda got the outliers.  All the folks that have maxed out characters with OP shit bringing it into a new mode is stupid.  Level the playing field so newcomers aren't discouraged from the game's first major new feature.
---
Plenty of folks are still selling insane amounts of things on the community discords for ludicrous amounts of caps or even real $.  Some are doing this legit, many aren't and are still reaping the benefits of establishing multiple characters filled to the brim, just below the point where it would've been noticed - with minimal effort thanks to the exploits.
---
Will that save it? I have no clue what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôd rather not lose all of my things
---
Good luck üçÄ 
---
I mean, it is beta right now so that means they are testing it out..
---
Maybe it could be a brown paper bag.
---
Cool glad it works for ya üëç
---
Just don't look then. You have to choose to browse the leaderboards. Smh.
---
Caps stashs and quests keep my train going lmao
---
Prime Gatling Gun is a beauty!
---
So we are unpaid testers? They are still supposed to test it before realese.
---
Oh yea when you die you will lose ALOT of aid and all your junk 
---
I loved this :') 
---
Alot of caps too
---
Oh, but what I would want is for plans to be introduced for unbroken toilets that you can build in your camp, and that the only toilets that can be used are the good ones that you build or maybe find rarely.  This would make the discovery of a good toilet in a bathroom stall a nice surprise, and you may make choose to make special trips to your CAMP to use the toilet. If doing so to treat a disease, there is a chance you will break your own toilet and have to fix it, or the toilet out in the world will be unavailable until a server reset.
---
There should be daily "find a toilet" events.
---
Silo complete. Going to launch in 7min. Right at 10. 
---
Maybe, unless there's some kind of perk related to a specific faction.
---
I think there's some really interesting potential in having the current factions represented.  Right now, players are fully incentivized to be Raiders and it's all very wild west.  But imagine if you had the equivalent of a "sheriff faction," a role the Responders could play.
---
Ok lol. I figured you‚Äôd lose junk, but that‚Äôs good to know about the aid. Maybe I‚Äôll spend most of my caps on stuff before heading into survival 
---
I'm getting on soon. I will accept your friend request and look for you. IGN: jchamlin
---
Okay well keep crying about it then I don‚Äôt know what else to say.
---
Oh my lord please stash almost all of your aid. Seriously take like... 4 stimpaks.
---
The community will quickly make that the "Stand still while my trap/ambush unfolds" emote.
---
rolling pins
---
If it's so casual why are 99% percent of people I run into so easy to walk all over and so clueless about the game. 
---
Apparently casuals don't like being called out for what they are lol. 
---
If you try to drop a second bag it just puts everything into the first bag.
---
Yes!  Stash your aid in adventure mode before you go in.  I killed some poor guy and he dropped 35 stimpacks and about 1000 caps worth of aid and junk.
---
Yea watch out for the lvl 200s jumping around like crackheads with explosive weapons 
---
Just normal Scorchbeasts also drop prime plans. I have looted 2 or 3 from them. Good luck finding one. What bothers me the most is you need stable flux to make ultracite ammo. Needing only ammo components and ultracite scraps would make many of us use the prime recievers and make those plans true rewards.
---
I'm not "crying" asshole, I'm angry that something that is such a huge deal in the new game mode is so completely broken. The only possible fast travel locations are just spawn traps so if you want to go anywhere on the map at all then you just have to walk from where you are. 
---
So logically it follows that because a train station is camped one time or several times it will always be camped? Or is it more likely that you are using it as poor excuse to promote your argument?
---
Put most your aid in a stash. You will lose most of what‚Äôs under your aid tab when you die 
---
Oh god. I always carry excessive aid; I‚Äôm so glad I checked out what reddit had to say first lol. 
---
See above, but a note of caution from experience: maybe others have had different results, but the Tesla Coils don't do jack for damage. They do continuous damage over time and it's kinda funny to watch enemies spark, but it takes my excavator's Tesla Coils several seconds to kill a level 1 Radroach. IMO not remotely worth it.
---
Good for you
---
For me In cranberry that road that winds into watoga is usually busy lvl62 scorched or mutie or Mirelurk queens of crickets
---
That really doesn‚Äôt mean anything. At all. Of course your guy who is 50+ is competitive. He has the ability to use pretty much any perk and armor in the game. There‚Äôs almost no competitive difference between someone who is level 50 and someone who is level 400. They both get the same amount of SPECIAL points, the same amount of cards for builds (unless you fucked and didn‚Äôt use any kind of plan while leveling to 50), and the same gear since the best gear only requires level 50 and nothing beyond that. 
---
The OP mentioned characters below level 50 who don‚Äôt have max SPECIAL, can‚Äôt use the best gear, and don‚Äôt have full perk builds. It isn‚Äôt about OP or anyone else not understanding PVP. It‚Äôs about the fact they *do*. There is a massive power discrepancy between non-50+ and 50+ people. Even someone who‚Äôs at level 49 is still at a massive disadvantage just because that *one* level locks them out of the best gear. 
---
I put the lunch box mod in and it was just as hard to see as the bags. But it looked better. But glowing bags. That works.
---
Missing that slap dmg? Lolz
---
I don‚Äôt understand the point your trying to make
---
If you don‚Äôt care about stealth, I would probably use a Gatling Laser, since it has a faster rate of fire than a Gauss Rifle. It also fires more rounds per magazine. 
---
It‚Äôs really fun as long as you don‚Äôt roll in with too much stuff you can loose.
---
Er, no, I'm talking about the bug where it doesn't do any damage other than a single cell's worth. The "losing all your ammo" bug didn't affect me, since I didn't get an assaultron head until after that was fixed.
---
I'd say a new week-long temp event every month. If they all work like Fasnacht I'll do nothing but events until I go insane. :D
---
The mind of a Fallout 76 fanboy is too powerful
---
gonna save that reply ,thanks
---
I never would've figured this out, although years of Minecraft should've made it obvious. Cheers for this.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm ok with losing some caps and stuff, I just don‚Äôt want to lose *everything*. I‚Äôll store most of the important stuff in my stash, before heading out 
---
Thanks for giving it to me :D
---
No, I play with pacifist on. I can‚Äôt wait till they remove camp damage too. The kill players achievements are will be boosted with a friend cause I hate pvp. 
---
Did you not know I was agreeing with you? Lol
---
The list is just text. To render everything on the list is massive in comparison.
---
I just chalk it up to a angry ghost enraged to see someone still alive after the nuclear apocalypse 
---
No problem. I'm a generous guy after all.
---
Whatever works for you, man, I tried that, but the game frustrated me away. Maybe someday the game will be good, if Bethesda will prioritize the right things.
---
Id really like to see this myself, never heard of this.
---
yes, at least that‚Äôs exactly what happened with mine. which is why i thought id have the BoS with bloody stuff on it
---
All rise isnt that great checkout some of the other super sledges or grognaks axes
---
I carry 5 - 10 at a time per life on survival. Does sound like you're struggling with inventory management, I understand that. But if you're going to risk junk or aid to PvP I'd consider trying to sort it.
---
What platform are you on? I definitely have used friends to transfer caps gear and junk to mule characters. It's something I consider almost essential tbh.
---
You‚Äôre good. I just think a survival mode is the LAST thing the game needs and was a complete waste of time.
---
If you‚Äôre willing to put up with this game and Bethesda‚Äôs behavior, I‚Äôd say yeah, you‚Äôre generous
---
Sounds like a fun way to pass some time with a group!
---
because paintjob. lol. pretty sure its just how the paintjob is in the atomic shop and when you modify armor to BoS its just naturally blue as in it doesnt have a paintjob

I think this guy got yours lol
---
I googled it and actually some one found one a few months ago off a scorched champion at fissure prime. Now I want one just for collectors reason. Maybe use as decoration next month.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, yeah I‚Äôm tryin to sort stuff out!
---
You don't lose aid items. Only junk. But junk can be very important. I lost my just collected flux once. Server glitched right after I died. There went 30 minutes of nuke zone work down the drain. Plus all the ammo and chems I used.
---
now i dont play pvp so i don't have a dog in this race but , yes "over time" it would but not day one or even week one , there would be a few. I don't think people realize how low of a drop rate those things really have without duping there would not be anywhere near this number
---
I've only gotten 1 prime plan out of like 10 SBQ fights
---
If you decide to change the rule so that Survival mode needs a brand new character, please do it fast, because right now I don't know if I should invest time or not in my brand new Survival mode character...
---
I've seen it at watoga and harpers.
---
Thanks.  I‚Äôll check again 
---
Dude I am all for the development of factions inside of pve and PvP it sounds amazing, they have said its something they're doing so let's hope it's awesome! I'd love to actually be hunted down by the "good guys" and some nerdy rp to it hell yeah :')
---
It seems that most weapons tear you apart within seconds. With a regular 50 cal machine gun with all the perks, enemies die in 3-5 hits, less than half a second. 
---
Nice! I met a nice dude who had a shop to buy Quantums. It wasn't this slick, but I love that people were doing this. 
---
Sounds smart, hopefully I survive when I log in and dont lose all my aid and junk.. I raid I be raided lif is fun!!!
---
Wait you can tame stuff now?
---
I have been to every shack on the map. Can't remember any boxes. Maybe in vault 76. None that you could pick up. My collector alter ego would have one in stash.
---
100% support this idea !!!! 
---
I turned the grass off.
---
There is a static spawn in the garahann mansion, so it‚Äôs not as rare as you might think. It‚Äôs probably worth 500 caps.

just checked when i got on, when you remove the bloodied paint job it does go back to the blue BoS coloring

I added the imgur link
---
If its adventure mode, in the recent update Bethesda made it where theres no more slap damage. 
---
Definitely not like the orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes through a meat stage.

You need to have enough tokens to redeem

---
Check /r/fo76marketplace and when asking this sort of thing mention your platform because it matters.
---
Yes, usually low level.
---
Prime receivers are only good on weapons that don‚Äôt have damage boosting receivers, such as the railway rifle, Gatling gun, Gatling laser, etc.
---
Funny that you reference my mind while you make an absolutely brainless post with zero substance.
---
wtf? you dont need 400 tokens to buy them because i already bought the head with only 300
---
I'd be glad to help you, I'm also on Xbox, I have multiple characters with max caps and all the gear I need if that would help you feel more confident to trust me but I totally understand if you don't take me up on the offer. 
---
You can do it by yourself but there Is a some risk to that as well. I have over 850 hours play time and my mains level 367. 
---
Offers there but as I said I totally understand if you don't want to. 
---
Oh boy, here comes another tantrum...
---
I made a post about this a got a reply saying that they will notify the team. Hopefully that means they know about it now.

Okay I‚Äôll come back after you‚Äôre done crying and woke up for your nap. 
---
You have offered no real points in defense of this fiasco. You are not worth conversing with. Move along little kid.
---
There should be a minimum number, and a percentage.
---
You always drop two, or 25% whichever is greater. Still a reward for the killer and still something to lose if you die. (Example, much harder to code if you drop more than just stimpaks from aid)
---
Try to do low level horde events and kill the legendaries that usually spawn. Horde events are guaranteed legendaries but with a new character you want to be sure to stick to the low level areas 
---
Did you make it? It was fast. I‚Äôm down for round 2

Oh man you‚Äôre not gonna get a juice box if you keep being cranky.

I scrapped my camp and built one that‚Äôs nothing but defenses and traps. It‚Äôs basically a maze of spiked boards, turrets, giant walls that lead to dead ends, and a bunch of annoying shit.

Can I get back to you tomorrow, I mean, you haven‚Äôt given me a reason NOT to trust you, sooo. Look, I would really appreciate this. I‚Äôll be on later tomorrow. How much caps you want? 
---
I farm super mutants at west tek and the robco building. 
---
hey avg 2-6 caps per kill.
---
  Pick up anything with crystal, it goes for 2caps a piece at vendors. 
---
You can join my team anytime. RB1955
---
What platform?
---
im about to launch another one if anybody wants to stay in the server.
---
Okay first, it's not a casual game, it's pretty damn complex and takes a lot of testing and research to fully understand the mechanics and get good. Especially in PvP.
---
Also The current survival mode is great. Spawn killing is a huge problem, and I do believe the top three shown should be based on kills not time alive. But apart from that nothing needs changing. People just complain because people are better than them. 
---
That's my points. 
---
The fucking entitlement on display here is baffling. 
---
"Unpaid testers blah blah" sftu. You voluntarily opted into the beta test genius. It stops you in no way from playing the actual base game. 
---
It's people like you that make me wish the internet/voting/reproduction required skill testing questions from their participants. 
---
he maybe had a full assassin sentinel armor set? negates almost every dmg from a player. Do you have the incisor perk maxed+an anti armor weapon? (helps a lot during pvp). OR the game was fucking something.
---
RIP 
---
Is it? Odd, I always assumed it was a paintjob, as that's how it worked in Fallout 4.
---
I don't know you, but I know I don't like you...
---
Just kidding! Kinda
---
One can only hope.
---
It's not just a new game mode clown.
---
It's the beta test of a new game mode. 
---
So criticism and feedback are expected. Your entitled rage about it is not. 
---
I want to bind the scroll wheel to zoom, darnit. I NEVER want the mousewheel to pop up when I'm scrolling, and *especially* not when I just pick up my mouse to adjust its placement on my mouse pad.

Camp budget goes up with level?? 
---
Thanks for the advice. How can I make sure not to lose too many caps in survival mode?
---
I'm overencombered right now from all the stimpaks and dog food I've gotten from looting ppls bags
---
He spawns in 4 locations around the forest I know so far.
---
Serendipity?
---
Yes!!! 
---
Bethesda loves ridiculous. I mean who eats 30 cans of dog food a day to survive. You would literally explode. And since when does a .556 weigh more than a mini gun?
---
Me either, I hate bumping into people and competing for resources, Fallout should have remained single player. 
---
check the wiki
---
Good idea!  That'll be 1000 atoms.
---
Before you removed it you just said you believed in eugenics so that tells me you aren't someone worth arguing with.
---
That would lead to a super blend end game. Poor suggestion if you ask me.
---
The bags should also have a skull &amp; crossbones if it was dropped by a dead player.
---
Leader of the pack event by Tyler Fairgrounds. Usually spawn 3 to 4 low level legendary wolves. 
---
This is the real question that needs to be answered 
---
Cute that you removed your post so you don‚Äôt get banned. What‚Äôre you scared of, bud?
---
I'm digging survival even tho I've lost alot too
---
Actually car/truck roofs work. They cannot penetrate certain items. But any scenery no matter what it is they can.
---
Just don‚Äôt have any. Penalty is reduction in damage to players if you can‚Äôt afford to pay your cap bounty. If you‚Äôre just doing it for the challenge I doubt you care about that. 
---
My team and I got that trophy just by killing each other 
---
They should remove fast travel entirely. Made it so you have to eat, drink, and sleep regularly. Food and drink drain faster and you need to sleep or your stats suffer. Turn this into true survival so people aren't primarily focus on killing each other. 
---
It's possible he had full assassin sentinel armor.  I do have incisor maxed out, but did not use an anti armor power fist, Imessed up because I have one but was hoping my instigating powerfist would be more effective. But my incisor should have penetrated his armor. The game did glitch up shortly after that as everything froze and I was forced to quit the game from my home screen. But I didn't think that was related. 
---
Without the ranting, most pot smokers I know are pretty chill people.  I can't imagine them going off their heads like that.
---
They‚Äôre definitely separate buys
---
Doesn‚Äôt come as a set
---
It sucks but it's ok, I've lost over 75 pounds of aid so far  some mine some looted from bags. Fun stuff
---
Bethesda ain‚Äôt gonna notice you, you don‚Äôt have to act cool for them
---
Should I make a new character and level him a bit in the normal mode? Give all his caps and aid to my main before putting him in survival to get the weapons.
---
Yeah.  I always get a bit weirded out when someone sends me an invite.  I'm too paranoid =/  
---
Thanks!
---
I've been hunting him lately. Thank you for the write up.
---
I will submit to third party moderation with an Assaultron 
---
I like how PA is protecting you but the instant a ghoul touches you an infection starts. You would think some damage to the suit would be required.
---
64 ghouls are quite squishy, even if you are lower level. If you have trouble then try luring them to the whitespring bots so you can run in and get the blade
---
From some PvP numbers I've checked, the Fallout 76 formula seems to have a different factor somewhere, but the 0.365 exponent is at least roughly the same as Fallout 4, so most of the conclusions are the same. More Fallout 76 specific tests would be good for isolating the point where additional armor penetration no longer matters.
---
However, there was also a test post yesterday where nominal damage, DR and armor penetration seemed to be irrelevant for Survival PvP.
---
THANK YOU!  I'm in exactly the same position.  I run Traveling Pharmacy on all my characters and have little to no stash space for such.  
---
Me too dude. I turned 50 in Oct. And I have smoked on and off for at least 25 years. Stoners are good people. 
---
I got my explosive shotgun without duping. I got my explosive subgun without dooping. 
---
Why would it be better for everyone to have this in a couple of weeks instead of now?
---
No longer an SBQ virgin! Thx!
---
I‚Äôd probably make a new character then not care what happens to his inventory or caps. Just grind for the 25 legendary kills with whatever items you need to get that done on that character. Killing 25 may not be easy as a low level as we don‚Äôt encounter that many early on. 
---
Then don't go into survival until you're ready to accept the fact you will get killed easy by others. Also my PvP character at level 45 was able to kill level 300s. I think you should maybe just avoid PvP in this game. Or put in the effort to get good.
---
Yeah I just don‚Äôt want to lose all my caps.
---
West Tec is a good place to farm some 1-3 star legendaries and gives a large amount of xp
---
Oh wow, as a filthy casual, thank you for that Subreddit. I don't always want to hear about Bloodied this and TSE that! 
---
Same here but good thing it‚Äôs still gonna be available just not rn due to a bug , pretty sure you seen comment below 
---
"you suddenly feel relieved" +2 charisma
---
Quicker fix is putting your bloody aid in your stash. 
---
I‚Äôve actually employed this tactic in PVE.  It‚Äôs very rare now for anyone to sneak up on me with the op melee build and gank me because reflective plates will usually ruin their day.  Honestly, of all my mutations and mods it‚Äôs one of the better ones to have for that reason. 
---
I purchased the bundle and only had the option to paint one leg of my t60 in woodland warrior camo. I could paint the whole t60 in the sand coloured camo paint though. 
---
I will be on later like 11 et add me Mammouthu
---
Bummer its still like that but thanks !
---
thats looking fire. can't wait to see the cosplay
---
Bethesda devs be like: wait there is still a player who enjoys this game, WE NEED TO FIX THAT.
---
Luckily, I have level 3 tank killer and tormenter 
---
They just need a brief 15 second respawn peace period or until you shoot at railroad stations too.
---
lol cause it wouldn't be everyone , not everyone has the same luck as you and there wouldn't be the plethora of duped weapons for people to buy for cheap so it would take much longer for people to get to that point is what im saying , i really think you underestimate what duping did to this game
---
omfg I loove this
---
Awesome, where did you find the Nuka Cola sign plans?
---
Then who did they make it for? Casuals? People who will throw money at them for releasing unfinished games? 
---
Sadly....its true. It's a commonplace thing these days. Release now, fix a little later.  Release dlc and cosmetics and fix a bit more.
---
Maybe if there wasnt little cunts that think it's ok for development and publishers to rush a game out of nothing more than the need for money then games could be what they used to be.
---
*inter-console hifive*
---
i have 700 hours and have only one TSE weapon that i found and yes i have a few explosive that i found too but only like 2 of them are worth taking into battle 
---
the fact that they can burrow out from anywhere, and diseased ones are impossible to combat the disease makes them my most hated wasteland enemy. also 99% of my food is mole rat chunks
---
I think they should just make train stations safe zones and prevent PVP in them or lift the fast travel restriction all together and let you travel anywhere? 
---
The PVP encounters feel a bit forced at the moment, it's best when it's organic and you come across someone while you're out exploring or hear gun shots off in the distance, it feels like a living breathing wasteland... spawning at a train station and being killed before you've even loaded in dosent. 
---
PVP should compliment the game mode not become the sole complete focus of it, my thoughts anyway. 
---
Really enjoying the concept though 
---
Oh the classic Get Gud comment. Im not gonna argue with you especially since my opinion seems to be the majority on this sub. It is obvious there are major issues with the way they did survival mode. 
---
Whitesprings is level-unlocked and there's usually a high level player or several nearby, so it tends to have max level ghouls. Unless you can arrange an escort (tagging along behind a ghoul farmer is possible), getting the sword is pretty tough.
---
Best solo method depends on your build. Melee + PA is strong enough that you should be able to fight directly. Psycho helps. If you're doing shotguns, max out Enforcer (level 32) and pop the ghouls in the legs. If you have a rifle build, get a suppressor and some Sneak, try to pick the ghouls off one at a time and run back to the Whitespring bots if you get spotted.
---
It's not even worth arguing with someone like you.
---
Yeah nah, I killed a 3 star mutie post patch and got a 1 star lead pipe.
---
bookmarked
---
thank you kind sir
---
For the life of me, I can't remember. If I do, I'll let you  know. 
---
Are you high, /u/ilovetrees420 ?
---
All survival mode players should have equal ability. Letting skill determine the outcome. I have run into this unequal player lvl problem in other games. I do not play them anymore for that very reason. No fun going into a game knowing someone 200 lvls above will just end your match with no chance of survival.
---
It's all risk no reward imo...for 2\* weapons that will end up taking up stash weight and nothing else ever. Why risk it for a flaming bag of dog poop with a unique name written on it.
---
It's still in Beta. Give them more than 2 days to go through the data.
---
Early access has been a thing for ten years already, dude. Get the fuck over it.
---
Clearly a bloodied weapon as they had kow health. My bloodied dagger does around 300 damage even without the right perks.
---
do you not remember the first 3 months of this game where nothing worked?  are you surprised that a new feature still has major problems, as the other guy said, this is a BETA.  if you don't like it play in the standard mode or just don't fast travel.
---
The same reason I wont be playing survival mode until it's fixed.
---
Are you guys ever going to fix bloodied melee builds or increase the damage TSE's do? I think it's kind of bullshit that I can be passively playing in Adventure mode and still get killed with one hit by someone with a bloodied melee build. Fix the build or give us back our TSE's, it's unfair how much damage they can still do.
---
This has nothing to do with Bethesda.
---
This is about an adult (or at least I'm assuming you are an adult) crying on Reddit about a videogame. Yikes.
---
For animals you tame, permanent. They then travel on foot to your camp (they can die on the way). A few downsides are that they‚Äôre hard to find, AND they can be killed. You need to find an animal that spawns as a random encounter. You can find some videos about where to find them. 
---
Alright. Been told multiple times explosive weapons increase stagger chance. Maybe it's more like, with explosive you're more likely to hit them with some amount of damage, meaning you're more likely to get a stagger proc?
---
Idk I only what the lone wanderer lever action and the medical malpractice because its the perfect gun for a vats crit pistol cowboy
---
Thank you. I hadn‚Äôt seen all the comments in that thread and couldn‚Äôt find anything else about it!
---
My point exactly.... the entire fast travel mechanic is gone in survival. Fast travel is just a way to dump all your caps and aid down the toilet. 
---
Thank you for your very valuable contribution to this discussion.
---
Yeah Ive heard of these legendary melee builds. Legendaries should be disabled in Survival mode.
---
Don't carry any serums
---
Next level stuff when a lvl 100 criticizes a new player farming exp safely
---
Ive been getting a lot  of legendaries from whitesprings golf course, even when its not nuked, it seems like there are more the more people in the area but idk if thats how the spawns work
---
Also the event Uranium Fever 
---
I think maybe the mole rats are just more noticeable because they are aggressive and most animals aren't. 
---
leader boards and map locations are silly.
---
I setup camp and all was fine. Came back later and there was a tree growing thru my floor and out the roof. Funny part was it was not there when I built my camp.
---
What causes the substance to glow? 
---
I will wait, and I am still somewhat hopeful. Its just really frustrating because these seem like issues theyd notice if they spent just a couple hours testing it.
---
I have no idea why you would make such a baseless assumption! Wait, what were we talking about?
---
Didnt realise that. 
---
So he was probably just wearing a full set of armor that makes you more resistant to player damage. 
---
It took me a while to get the sword being a lowly lvl 15 when I found out what white springs was all about. Eventually I used stealth boy and ran my ass off. 
---
Even if you *don't* PVP, someone with the right build can still kill you with one hit. My friend and I were surprised when a level 76 killed both of us tonight and took our 100+ caps from each of us. Neither of us provoked the attack and we didn't retaliate, but they were still able to kill us without being hostile in Adventure mode.
---
That would kill the end game. People would reach their most optimised build very fast.
---
Apology's... I am on PC.
---
I am sure there are better alternatives, I have just not found them yet :D
---
Exactly, longer TTK.
---
Did you have a turret base?
---
nah, the majority or players don't understand the complexities of the game. They don't know how to negate explosive damage they don't know how to counter sentinel assassins they don't know about the power of certain mutation combinations. Most people are casuals. Then they run into people who one shot them or just beat their ass and cry about it. You know who doesn't get one shorted, me. I take tse shots to the face all day I can counter any PvP build. I know how to do over 30,000 damage. It's park of the game and its what makes fallout fallout. With enough understanding you can become a God. I solod the scortchbeast queen in a minute. So yes, get good, if you want to PvP anyways. Otherwise stay in pve and be mediocre at best.
---
Not sure why but Grognaks can only be repaired to 100%
---
Agree with mootmutemoat. I have a character built specifically for yesterday's launch. I'm having a blast in survival. It's pulse pounding fun!
---
Not just turrets. Open farm, water, and crafting stations.
---
Mind you, you only need to tag a ghoul for the points &amp; gear
---
Round 2 coming now!
---
[Im looking for this homie](https://imgur.com/i9oWg40)
---
there should be legendary things to get / make but they should have heavy limits and fast breakdown. getting the components to maintain or establish legendary effect should be the main objective and reason why players are crossing path at the various hotspots where rare materials for these MIGHT be spawning. everything available to use by garden variety should be plain and rough. Shiny things should be what players are having to have high drama over whether to co operate, battle, or otherwise organize (karma system anyone?)
---
the game is really strugglign to find any footing with the multiplayer identity piece despite very strong heritage in the 4 really important identity elements that fallout embodies of adventure/treasure/secret richness, character/base building RP system, Vast open zen as a small inhabitant of a large place, and violence/contemplation of death --- but as multiplayer it just is not finished, this is its first try and its approaching alpha quality. the game feels like a bunch of test apps for the multiplayer game of fallout.
---
I don't even understand how anyone can be "bullied" in Adventure mode.  There's no more slap damage.  I only partake in PvP when someone keeps slapping me.  At which point I put the smack down since I get "first shot".  However, I get to take my time, chose the right weapon, pop a chem, it's hilarious.  As soon as I "slap them back" I just log off the server and onto the next.
---
I would love that! I miss the lunchboxes. I liked making the bottle cap mines with them. Killed many deathclaws that way. Oh and I miss the confetti and little party horn noise they made when you opened them in Fallout 4. Good times.
---
Never leave CAMP without your lunch hun!
---
Ah, right. My reading comprehension failed me. Must be all the rads I‚Äôve taken :)
---
Shoot her! Shoot her!
---
It would eventually. 
---
The thing is if you see this as a problem, then what you're offering is just a temporary solution anyway. High levels would dominate in time with OP 1 hit kill weapons, and this suggestion would put it off for weeks at most.
---
If it is really a problem, why not come up with a solution that is more permanent? 
---
Ah yes, we all need to start caring more about the environmental issues of our beloved wasteland
---
stockpile glowing and ionized meat from nuke events if you have a hazmat suit, and make sure to consistently get spacesuits and straight jackets from Fort Defiance and the crashed satellite. Then just sell them to the 7 vendors (get hard bargain if you can) 
---
tf are you talking about, you're acting like there aren't alternative ways to program the game to nullify camping, gtfo camper...
---
I did that one today and got a Nuka  dark recipe. I literally walked out the building and jumped on the buss out front, crouched, hit the vats, fired a shot, and it registered the completion. 
---
Here's an idea guy's. Maybe walk to the train station and shoot the campers in their asses? I did it multiple times yesterday. Why fast travel ever in survival? it's much more profitable to walk it out.
---
It happens to me randomly all over. Never could work it out
---
I run a commando build that focuses str per end instead of agi and luck. No power armor so barbarian and ironclad as well as blocker are my defensives. Commando + tank killer my offensives. Works pretty well for all content and can change into a rifleman build by changing 3 perk cards. It's supposed to be a silver shroud build and I love it.
---
Using a cryolater when she lands keeps her there for a long time. Making it super easy especially with the amount of melee only builds running around 
---
I think the crows and owls probably aren't in there because they put unncessary load on the engine and server for only an asthetic benefit because even though you could shoot them in FO4 they weren't targetable in VATS and IIRC they gave no loot or XP.
---
Awesome!
---
The axe can't be repaired to 200. It's a glitch they haven't fixed with weapon artisan. So it may just seem like it's faster to lose condition
---
So that's what I've been doing wrong. Trying to air shot her with grenades wasn't quite working as intended. Thanks for the tip!
---
Long range?
---
If i see one of those bases i destroy it
---
sure let's use google for 'fallout 76 patches'
---
Ah, thousands of results, this'll be easy...
---
&gt;THE FIRST HUNDRED PAGES LEADING TO FORUMS THAT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE DAY 1 PATCH AND NOTHING ELSE
---
Yeah, no I'm asking here for a reason smartass
---
What I don't get is why I can't respawn at claimed workshops. Like, you can respawn at your camp and then fast travel to your claimed workshops anyway, so why can't we just cut the middle man and loading screens to respawn at the workshops we own instead? It would actually give people another reason to claim workshops in survival mode, too. It gives you another optional area to respawn at besides CAMP/76/SpawnCampStations.
---
Nomination for post of the year!   Say hello to my reactive plates you one shot deathclaw gaunlet wielding d-bag!  Maybe the counter is wearing clothes and dropping the clown mask
---
Alcohol works too got addicted fast, bumped up a weapon like 10-16 points lol
---
haha true. I lust the moment of devouring the flesh of my most hated foes!
---
war never changes
---
True, but what really triggers my trigger is when they burrow out of nowhere and immediately burrow back into the ground.
---
Nah, just make the current survival mode the same as it is, but with a different name, add deathmatch, which is survival but no dropped money or meds, and make a genuine survival mode with less supplies dropping all the time and difficulty more akin to survival mode in fallout 4, where a couple bullets would kill you or your enemies, but nerf molotovs, because those were the Antichrist in fo4 obviously make it require new characters as well.
---
I alternate btw an AA lever and a handmade. 
---
Pretty weird when running on water and they make an explosion sound.
---
Yup, knew this was gonna happen. Legendaries just don't mix with PvP, and most of them are just...well..batshit insane in effects? I think it would be best to disable all legendaries, wait for a week of feedback, and while that's at it, try to tweak the legendaries in Survival Mode, nerf them, work on them and see what happens when you slowly implement them back in. Hell, who knows, I doubt people will even want them back in once the playing field is leveled out, and then it just comes down to your perk cards and how well you can handle the weapon/armor of your choosing. 
---
It really interferes with the ghoul spawns when you do that, and you end up stealing half of the club house before the player the spawned them even fully loads in.
---
Wait is this legit? I'll definitely do this if it works.
---
I have no problem with a level 30 at whitesprings and I rarely go there. If there is a turret base there during the rare times I do go, that's an orbital strike incoming.
---
Oh my god! I ran into this guy last week! I found the same video from March 11 and commented on it the night he griefed me! I‚Äôm so glad to know I wasn‚Äôt crazy when I told him he was hacking.
---
It's stuck for me as well. I'm on PS4.
---
\*Hears iconic mole rat noise\*
---
\*Stands there waiting until the heat of the universe itself\*

\*Mole rat pops out and gets one-shot by me in VATS\*
---
10/10 enemy.
---
If your preferred weapon type has a cripple card use it this can stun lock the queen once she lands. I'll throw up a video of a 3 mins queen fight tomorrow if I have time.
---
Yeah I don't know when server is lagging some of my hits also don't get detected or my V.A.T.S. is having a stroke or whatever. For me it feels like these issues got even worse with the last few patches. 
---
I'll just leave this here:

**[PvP in Fallout 76: What it is, and how it can be improved](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djsNSmuRLbpNgyZauhhRQPl3lTSKv6NpKvjPbUPSETM/edit?usp=sharing)**
---
Check the part under faction PvP.
---
hell, Pre-nerf, the Dragon was capable of doing 5,000 damage on some poor sap, and it's still incredibly deadly even after the nerfs, just not able to one-shot a Mirelurk Queen anymore. 
---
Placing the circle over fissure site prime but not over the bunker helps the non power armor people. Helps everyone really with visibility and radiation. 
---
I'm level 68 and I've never once camped at Whitesprings, nor have I ever deliberately farmed for exp. Are you implying that exp farming is somehow a necessity? It's really, really not.
---
So your argument is that Survival is meant to be for those of you who know how to work the system, figured out the best builds, and put in the hours to make your character ridiculously strong? Then why did they strongly encourage making a new character for survival mode? 
---
I might just be a casual, but do you know of a single other game that has PVP, a leveling system that includes perks, legendary weapons and equipment that make it so you can give and recieve an ungodly amount of damage, and didnt seperate players by their level during PVP? 
---
I personally cant think of a single one, because having all those things combined makes the game virtually unplayable for new players. They didnt make survival mode with the intention of having players level up through adventure mode and switch to survival once they are OP.
---
You are making up reasonings that the Devs at Bethesda never once claimed. PVE should be where you can do 30,000 damage. PVP should be %80 skill.
---
Yeah it does the cryolater and the adrenal syringe gun works very well on her 
---
Not necessarily.
---
7/10 times the ghouls go straight for the person luring them, and I'm forced to run out. About 3-4 ghouls from the lower level come down.
---
Plus I was on a server once that was bugged and spawned none.
---
Yeah freezes her solid almost reduces her movement by like 90 percent keeping her grounded for almost twice as long if not more. 
---
He's the final boss
---
Yeah man. I have 20ish at all times. Mentioned it here and got slaughtered in comments. Idk why more people don't do this
---
And get another disease.
---
yes! the worst is when ur in pvp and they pop out of the ground and stagger u with their attack
---
Fallout 76 pounds
---
Anyone know what the difference is between the currently listed  "Woodland Warrior" and "Camouflage Paints" beside the 400 atom price difference?  Detail and content seem to be identical?
---
I just use anything i can swing at them.
---
I guess it could be considered an exploit, since if you aim at the fusion cores in vats and shoot immediately, it‚Äôs a 95% hit chance and they die. Plus they drop a lot of 5.56 ammo but I never use it sadly
---
It's not crazy, it's a smart idea. Also remove VATS.
---
Ya, well for those of us that don't, it's not worth the time/expense to fight someone.
---
Preach 
---
A guy complained about fusion core spawn rate being reduced a while ago. I offered the solution you mentioned. He did not like it
---
I mostly run everywhere too.
---
very true. I bet that week the challenge will be level up 10 times or some crap
---
I have some of every kind!
---
I have some of every kind
---
Yeah maybe I can buy the guns from someone who doesn‚Äôt want them. I would lose more caps trying to get them myself anyways.
---
Ah ok this is what I was thinking. Well I read the elder plan so I guess that's it for me haha, thanks!
---
People play differently, and the grind to level, manage gear, and progress is vast. 
---
I want to level fast, so playing will become easier, then I can farm to build myself a bar for the scorched queen hunters.
---
I've power grinded only to 26 so far, and mixing other missions in, and still find difficulties when I find out loot hotspots are gone before I arrive
---
Eh, I'm not a huge fan. I thought I was going to really enjoy it but no one roleplays or talks and it's simply KOS. I guess that's expected but when I die it's always from like some crazy ass explosive TSE that literally shreds me in half a second, it's just dumb.
---
Wow, yeah I forgot those were even a thing it's been so long since I've seen one.
---
They're ugly too.
---
What's the point of PvP if you either automatically get shit on by somebody who got more lucky with legendary drop or automatically shit on somebody who didn't?
---
If you leave the area and come back 2-3 minutes later, the body will spawn where it was killed at.
---
Sell to all the vendors available to you. Do events, dailies, and defend events.
---
Fo76 the equation is 0.15; fo4 it's 0.16.
---
Armor based DR and nominal damage are irrelevant in pvp because of percentage based damage reduction. Armor penetration is not irrelevant. It is super important to bypassing sentinel issues because it effects the ratio of damage / armor in the opposite direction.
---
Hardcore player who can't fight without OP gun and autoaim here.
---
I've seen a lot of people say the wendigo clown quest resets after log in/out, so I just haven't bothered.
---
The trick with the unruly golfer ghouls is that they're all super low level, like around level 9. If you hit the Whitesprings at high level, the level 48 and 62 ghouls replace the golfers. The best way I've seen to do this is either bring a low-level friend and let them go first, or to keep an eye on the map and if you see a lower-level player at the Whitesprings, jump in. 
---
Agreed. The pvp game is broken and need lots of fixing.
---
I expected everybody to start from lvl 1 with no legendaries and complete overhaul of the crafting and surviving systems. Sadly they just tweaked few values and called it a ‚Äúnew mode‚Äù...
---
I did not know that, thank you!
---
Know any radium mods?
---
I'll blow your mind but in CS all guns are the same for all players. People who play it must be total morons.
---
Sounds like a guy I ran into once, same thing dick just wanted to bully others. They got pissed because I was taunting them and they couldn't find me. Chameleon rocks. 
---
That's a shame, but you're deliberately ruining things for others in order for you to level in an unconventional and, frankly, inefficient way. You'll get no sympathy here.
---
Sweet
---
Yes I made both. Great Fun!
---
250 caps maybe 500 at best.
---
they are tamable and they are jerks. they will be aggressive and attack everything at your camp (they won't damage it though) and if it's a Deathclaw they will do their roar nonstop (which actually does slightly damage everything in your camp). and to add to it I once tamed a Glowing creature and he instantly became scorched so unless it was an isolated glitch glowing= scorched. 
---
What are some of these ‚Äúmechanics ‚Äú
---
I have like 5k .45 ammo
---
It helps a lot being able to do that..
---
I do it close to the end of my night. So when I log back I theyre not hostile
---
I followed the Vet once and saw it get destroyed by Scorched. The cats just turned around and walked off.
---
This is an rpg, it's not supposed to be realistic. If that was to be implemented all perks, mutations and gear stats whould have to be turned off. 
---
Off the top of my head Destiny 1 and 2 and pretty much every mmorpg.
---
It wasn't encouraged to make new characters. 
---
It's honestly not hard to get good all the information is easily available thanks to dedicated players testing literally every aspect of the game. 
---
We did the hard work for you, all you have to do is listen and learn.
---
I believe Beth did that so we'd stop farming Watoga.  Lol.
---
was, is and will remain broken.
---
Oh thats so good to hear
---
None at all.
---
When the entire game costs only twice their price, it no longer works that way.
---
The amount of aid that drops upon death is insane 
---
The only bounties I have ever intentionally incurred are golf club camps. My alt has a camp way back on the green but it's far far out of range of the golf club because I'm not an ass. Not in that way, anyway.
---
Then price things properly. This is not an MMO
---
Yo this would be prime content for r/FO76Oddities
---
Actually this is very conventional.
---
High spawns, open area and views, so anyone can get hits, low ammo, meds, and maintenance costs, Located central between nuke hotzone and a junk workshop. 
---
True toxic strategy would be high level turrets, and 1-shot all the enemies yourself, not sharing.
---
I DO avoid online gaming, unfortunately this is the only Fallout we get until probably 2025, I have to make do.
---
Differing opinion = Trolling. Stay classy, reddit. 
---
Gauss!!!!! 
---
Probably 
---
OF COURSE!!! But to join you have to do some harder than normal things. 
---
Like kill legendary beasts at night. 
---
Suggestions for other quests, anyone?!
---
Agreed, they need to tweak the percentages
---
Technical data, or as the quest calls it techncial data
---
Combat Armor not Power Armor??
---
Tech data
---
Removing for witchhunting. If you think someone is cheating report it to Bethesda, not here.
---
Where I got mine
---
Combat Armor?? Not Power Armor?
---
I hate battle royale but honestly i think it would work really well in 76 
---
Is that legendary challenge working for anyone? I killed two or three legendary glowing ones and it's still at zero. If the challenge isn't going to work then I have no reason to play that mode.
---
You should really just wait til lvl 50 to craft it otherwise you‚Äôll probably regret it 
---
Your telling me turning in Tech Data gives Combat Armor Chest Piece , Legs and Arms now?
---
probably lag
---
You didn't even know about dense. 
---
Explosive negation.
---
Armour penetration.
---
The importance of stagger and how to counter it.
---
How to boost your damage to the 1000s.
---
The combination and results of mixing drugs and foods and drinks.
---
The actual percentages and limits of certain perk and legendary combinations.
---
The game is so so deep.
---
But thankfully dedicated players have done the research for you and its easily available. 
---
So why don't you know all this. Because you're casual, and that's fine, but don't expect to compete with players who are putting in a 1000 hours already and have taken the time to test and research every in and out of this game.
---
Just go watch some God damn YouTube videos at least :)
---
PEOPLES NAME APPEARING ABOVE THEIR HEAD IS MAGIC
---
I had the same exact thing, also on t60 could only paint the right leg. I ended up doing it in the desert camo but the woodland warrior is so nice.
---
Yes, so one Seige event would be claim a vaccine facility for your faction. Produce 100, 10k, 100k vaccines. Summon faction vertibot and load vaccines from production site to vertibot. Protect Veribot until it takes off. Like a workshop but unsecurable solo. You must have faction members. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand this post. Why shouldn‚Äôt we hate on them? There‚Äôs a long history of problems that are created. If you camp anywhere, you might get attacked. If you piss people off, it‚Äôs guaranteed.
---
A camp without turrets is fine. One with them is gonna get taken out by me and others. You can ‚Äúwarn‚Äù us all day long, but we are ‚Äúwarning‚Äù you back. 
---
Good luck in the wasteland!
---
After months of play servers would be about 10% of what they are now. The vast majority of these super weapons are duped guns and players who maxed out on caps from various glitches and bought everything they need to make things op.
---
Now i think some things should be made account wide (like camp plans) to ease survival mode but farming white spring won't be a thing on survival in the way we had seen
---
You're still stealing spawns. When you load in you get your ghouls, and when another player loads in you steal the ones that spawn for them. If you keep your base there after your initial run you interfere with the next player. You should remove your base if you want to continue leveling up at Whitesprings. You'll find the high levels more friendly if you do this, and they'll probably let you tag the ghouls during their run.
---
not sure. ill check when i get back online
---
My point is low levels have little choice in the matter
---
Leave the server if your low lvl when you get close to the top of the leaderboards on time. Other than a few random encounters with players you will be fine. If some one trys to camp you just server hop. Keep all your aid other than some food and drink and one or two stinking packs in your stash box too.
---
No, like actual battle themed events where you have to defend a area, Charleston for example, and fight a group of other players and have the events be named where they are fought, like The Battle of Charleston 
---
See this seems to be a feature that the players want. 
---
What are current %
---
Secondly, farming SBQ will be almost impossible even at high level. 1 lvl 50 with a gatling gun could wipe the entire event.
---
Where I got it.
---
u on xbox?
---
Sorry for asking but when did you get them? Like recently? Because I don‚Äôt wanna farm for nothing.
---
I agree with the cap limit. It is way to low. But the vendor cap limit I can see because then someone can just make a bunch of caps off random junk or aid items. And it doesn‚Äôt help that someone could just kill someone in survival mode get a crap ton of aid items and the vendor would have enough caps to where you could sell all of it
---
Pffffffft hahahahahahahaha
---
Find a toilet Events? Get real dude. 
---
It gave me the mod to make combat armor into BoS combat armor.
---
Nah man PS4 sorry.
---
What kind of fool goes in PVP mode with that much Aid on them? That's just bad planning on your part
---
No one is telling you to be quiet about it. Bethesda wants feedback. They *need* it. But most people complaining don't report things to the proper channels, they just come to the sub and go "fuk u bugthesda". 
---
I will watch a video , any certain content creators you recommend ?
---
If someone has literally set up a turret camp right outside the club, they know EXACTLY what they‚Äôre doing. 
---
Stash box your aid items and stay away from train stations. Hunt the 1 2 and 3 players on your map.
---
A month or so ago.
---
They could be wearing assassins sentinel gear. But idk they should still take a little with that
---
You're suggesting the player is
---
A. Strong enough and fast enough to kill before the higher level player takes them out
---
B. Willing to kill, instead tag the enemies, and let the other player take them, or such
---
I've seen plenty of people just wipe out ghouls before I can get 1 pipe revolver tag in. I'm not stealing anything
---
Ok thanks
---
Why is it a bad thing that we can sell our junk to a vendor? I'm not saying that vendors should have infinite caps but 1000 seems a bit more reasonable. 
---
Recently? And if so you can make as many BoS Combat Armor As you want right?
---
their armor is with over 30k caps that's why
---
I legit only bought the game because its a fallout game &amp; it‚Äôs based in my home state, I never read up on anything because i wanted to go into the game with no prior knowledge to enjoy it to the fullest extent 
---
Sure, whatever makes you feel better about pretending the past didn't exist. Enjoy living in your bubble of ignorance.
---
A month ago or so. And I can make any combat armor into BoS combat armor.
---
But there is 7 vendors that reset each day. So someone who makes frequent vendor runs with plenty of stuff to sell will make 7000 caps per day
---
no I could do 0 damage. It was not armor, it was a straight up glitch or obscure mechanic.
---
How many hours on average does it take to level, without the ability to 1-shot all enemies
---
Damn that sucks, you might as well go sneak sniper, Heavy guns drain AP too fast no auto aim here.
---
That is certainly an option.  I can tell you though, for every one jerk there are TONS of good, respectful players out there. I think the FO76 community as a whole that makes the game. Don‚Äôt let the griefers ruin an opportunity to have fun with some good wasteland wanderers. üòÄ
---
There‚Äôs dead raiders all over the Appalachia tho
---
I have yet to get a single explosive perk weapon lvl 90.
---
Wrong, I didn't do a small amount of damage, they were literally undamagable. Either a glitch or fucked up mechanic.
---
Well if you can‚Äôt see it I guess it‚Äôs working.
---
He is in bed with the hacker. &lt; Insert Illuminati &gt;
---
Ok. Then link all vendors caps and just have the total of 7000, why should we have to spend 200+ caps and 7 loading screens to sell our stuff? 
---
You need Molotov's. If you just asked a high level they'd probably agro the ghouls into the tennis court so you can tag them with Molotov's from the roof before they kill them.
---
It would probably keep things slowed for almost a year. Farming in this mode only would be much much harder with everyone competing for the same loot. Also goodbye caps every death, and aid items.
---
We call it the ‚ÄúDamage bug‚Äù happens quite often 
---
Forever now. I get your point. And actually I think the white springs thing is less of an issue than it once was. But ... if someone‚Äôs gonna piss others off (which camping there does), then lessons will be taught. 
---
Remove fast travel. 
---
Make sleeping a must.
---
Make eating and drinking most often a must.
---
Make ammo harder to come by.
---
Make it so that players can setup small tents or mini camp sites that disappear after you leave it, kinda like power armor.
---
It's completely broken and I'm sure it wont be fixed for a few months.
---
Idk man. I have a set of assassins sentinel and it‚Äôs pretty op in PvP. But whenever the enemies gun causes you to stagger you take a lot of damage. But you must stand still
---
There are game mechanics in the game already for pvp you just have to use them. My toon takes zero explosive dmg....I mean none. Most people use explosive guns in pvp still for some reason....probably because they work on pve players that dont prepare for pvp.
---
Don't assume you speak for everyone. What do you gain from holding more caps? The best weapons and armor are trade only items. Having 9 million caps does nothing but further devalue them. So why have more? So you can lose more in survival? That can't be it. So you can buy more things? Like what? The most expensive items in game are serum recipes and for the price of one from an in game vendor you can get five from another player.  This is an online game and all of them are about grinding for what you want, not instant gratification.
---
Is that what Sentinel assassin armor is getting now? Where does that armor originate from in the game? I‚Äôve never seen a single sentinel anything in 101lvls. 
---
True. The people that make the most caps are the ones who frequently use the fallout market for trades. It puts everyone else at a disadvantage but it doesn‚Äôt bother me. üòê
---
Again. Under level 30, so no **Marsupial** Mutation, If I could get on the roof, or atleast the windows, I'd be camping that way.
---
This is also assuming the High level wont just quickly dispatch of them all before I can even get a word in.
---
I could literally do 0 damage with tse handmade or tse pump action shotgun. It wasn't the armor, something else is happening.
---
I‚Äôm scared to even login and take damage to lose caps in the survival mode. If I had a bank or something I could hide my caps inside Safe....
---
It‚Äôs super rare. But a month or so ago people were selling it on the fallout market. But now that the duplication glitch is patched it is less common
---
Conventional is doing the story. Will get you to lvl 40ish. Turret bases at Whitesprings ruin everyone elses ability to farm it.
---
Probably lag then or some other sort of issue
---
Do you call saving up caps "instant gratification"? You are certainly in the minority of you are actively against being able to hold mor wealth. Having more does not "devalue" them as there is inflation affect on an ingame currency that can be created infinitely. 
---
TSE is your problem, it's easily mitigated with perks, not even armor. You'll want anti armor or Furious instead.
---
considering there is no difference between a level 50 and a level 500 I fully agree. the max should stop at 50
---
Happens to me randomly all the time. I kept thinking I was walking through hidden traps but now I think Bethesda just likes the spikes of anxiety it gives me
---
I'm Power leveling best I can at this point, I've received threats and ridicule for this post and in-game, but it is extremely valid for a game that has taken the MMO slow Leveling approach.
---
It's immensely infuriating, especially when there exists players who instantly kill Mobs, before you can get 1 shot in to in the very lease, receive the 20-100 xp points, this especially applies to Events.
---
I'm Soloing until my mate can afford the game.
---
Hey man, think you can max out this ultracite laser rifle I have? 
---
No it does not. Only aluminum and lead. Everything else weighs more when bulked. The only reason to bulk other items is to sell them to vendors. 
---
+karma thank you :)
---
If PA protects you from waterborne and airborne disease it should also protect from melee-inflicted disease until the pieces break.
---
Just because it's "conventional" doesn't make it right, and as you can quite clearly see, bases at the golf club are considered toxic regardless of whatever vague justifications you can make to yourself. Go level up the way everyone else does it, you're not deserving of special treatment just because you care less about other players. 
---
If you are lvl 200+ dont even try it. You will get spawn killed for 400 caps each death. You can go from 10000+ to nothing in minutes at a train station.
---
You're really trying to justify your cheat camp. I'm trying to be polite and help you out here, but you continue to throw it back in my face. Enjoy having your base destroyed and being treated like an a-hole at Whitesprings.
---
Nah if I see a camp directly behind the golf club with turrets, I don't care what level you are, I'm destroying your camp and killing you repeatedly until you leave
---

---
You miss the point entirely and are changing the subject from, "this is why it should be this way" to "this symptom is something you should prepare for because anyone could have any load out covered even though you have no idea what gear they have but its not the games fault its abusive so leave it abusive" 
---
Please !!!
---
One of content creators that I've followed for information, especially concerning PvP is a guy called polarbear igloo.
---
But you may have some luck with just searching things like "op builds" 
---
I've also learnt a lot from just talking with other fellow pvp players. Some are douchebags granted, but I've made some good friends from PvP and then just messaging them nd starting talking.
---
The fallout community is mostly amazing, that extends to the PvP side as well. 
---
I wish you luck. 
---
Us higher tier pvpers would love more people to get good. We want more challenging fights. We want you to kill us. The challenge is the fun part :)
---
I agree that the current approach penalizes those of us without currently playing friends. 
---
I've been doing the story on and off, but the development I've run into, hasn't gotten me ***That*** far. 
---
You're also acting like the player who spawns there can't use the base to their own benefit either, or just lure the ghouls to another spot, which I have seen be done plenty of times too
---
I think you need a dictionary. This is not witch hunting I didn't use the players name. Furthermore I provided proof. Finally this player has been reported for some time and like every other issue people result to reddit for Bethesda doesn't reply nor do shit. They never fixed my problem I posted about a month ago. Ticket remained open for other a month until this patch came out which ended up fixing my problem for me. That was a month I could not play so don't tell me "open a ticket" to a company who gives no fucks.
---
Congratulations on not farming I guess. 
---
What a sad existence you must live for you to get enjoyment this way.
---
You could just server hop at tyler fairgrounds until leader of the pack pops up. If you're in the area of an event, I'm pretty sure there is no pvp until it is over or you leave the area. As soon as the event is complete, just quit and join a new server.
---
This just happened to me, and your explanation makes perfect sense based on what I've observed and did prior. Thumbs up!
---
Nobody is "competing for the same loot". It is the same loot system as Adventure Mode, if anything being able to kill the people trying to farm the same spot as you would make things go faster. 
---
And even if it was two years, it still comes to the question "Why not make a solution that actually works forever instead?"
---
I like that even better! 
---
Lmk im desprately looking for a stock mod the hole through it il pay 800c
---
Homieüòè
---
Same way as ***everyone*** isn't clearly made or justified either.
---
Listen, you can‚Äôt be immortal, if you aren‚Äôt running Dense you‚Äôre probably gonna have ska bad time 
---
Isn't that called griefing.
---
Events stop PVP, you silly. They play out as normal. If they want to wipe out the whole event they have to wait until it ends. 
---
I am running dense.... and I'm getting staggered with such rapid succession that I cant even bring my gun up.
---
Isn't that basically what quantum canonically does anyway?
---
You just gotta think like a raider. Everyone is out to get ya, and you are too.
---
Interesting. I didn‚Äôt realize this post was self interested. I dunno what to tell you. Maybe make friends in the game (despite my bitterness, i and a lot of others are super willing to help). But this approach of camping there has a long history. We‚Äôve seen it for months and it pisses us off. You‚Äôre not gonna win the battle with ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm new‚Äù because we‚Äôve continued to see this. I‚Äôm gonna destroy your turrets at least, if not your camp‚Äîbounty be dammed. 
---
You need help with quests or leveling or supplies, I‚Äôm super ready to assist. 
---
I found one in the hut at the NAR repair yard near watoga 2 days ago, super random. 
---
The early bird catches the worm. Set your alarm for 3 am, get a prime perch and wait 6 hours for the kiddos to join the server.
---
Oh, you actually want the game to provide  a somewhat relistic experience, where you aren't killed in less than 3 sec before your character spawns? HaHaHa.
---
Ah, nothing better than a hard day of corrupting the youth
---
Just game mechanics working as intended I‚Äôm afraid friend.
---
They are almost certainly sporting a 5 piece set of Assassin/Sentinel/Powered or Assassins/Cavalier/Powered pieces and likely have a spare Chameleon piece in there for the upperhand in damage and pvp tactic. They add in things like Dodgy, Suppressor, Serendipity to their perk loadout as well as cards such as Barbarian &amp; ( I‚Äôm brainfarting on the AGI perks and possibly more like Barb that exist)
---
They stack all these items and cards for damage reduction as well as the absorb mitigation cards like Dodgy. Then you have food, drinks, chems. Med-X for example give another huge damage resist with a timer. 
---
I‚Äôm off my game rn so I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other shit I‚Äôm missing in the perks and buffs department but someone will come chime in about what I missed to better inform you. 
---
It‚Äôs rough, I agree. You got to just be a soldier hold your head down and troop through it til you build up your own.

Best way to solve your problem is make friends, join trading communities. I am aware of Reddit as well as FB groups and I imagine there are other sources to post so you can acquire the items you seek. After a while you‚Äôll bulk up like the big swinging dicks out there and you can laugh your way through it.

I get shits overpowered, but any good game offers the ability to be overpowered. It‚Äôs the shit games that give every casual a gold star and prevent an individual from becoming truly godlike. Personally I feel it‚Äôs the main reason I choose to play.
---
My personal feelings aside though I do hope you catch up so you don‚Äôt feel so defeated cuz it‚Äôs a lot of fun when you get this gear put together. Best of luck.
---
I get staggered as well, pneumatic will reduce staggers but you‚Äôll get murdered by explosive damage so the trade off is basically worthless even if you have fireproof.
---
You got be a sneaky boi in survival 
---
You're assuming too much, and expecting someone to have all the required materials.
---
I've been only scraping by in this, and a lot of farm locations I look up hardly even meet up with what was suggested. There is literally little locations I am able to find that help, and this is all Solo.

Are you saying that the reasons you shouldn't set up camp at the golf club aren't justifiable? Ah, I was right. You *don't* care about other players.
---
That's how I discovered I had a bad controller. Switched out and lag disappeared
---
Ok, but what if I'm running sentinal assassin? Would the trade off be better then? 
---
As someone who runs technical data religiously, I've never once gotten it from that. Only Power Armor Paint plans and BOS outfits.

That's really a shame they made it like that. I don't have any low level players to play with. I've tried going to the Vault and and Flatwoods to look for low level players to help me out but none of them use mics. If anyone reading this has a low level character or would like to make one to help me, it would be much appreciated. I play on PS4. My PSN tag is ThoughtShift. Feel free to add me.
---
Yes, but with a methylphenadate kicker. 
---
Maybe he just has a hard time banking caps.
---
Gib me
---
Percentage of what?
---
It depends who you‚Äôre fighting, if it was me with a BE LMG with an insane fire rate, no because you‚Äôd die with 12% Stagger a bullet, againster slower firing weapons you might be better off.
---
It‚Äôs unfortunate but there will ALWAYS be a counter to every build.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I do
---
Upgrade it to add another blade. It's still pretty decent for everyday usage
---
A couple of my friends have camps in the tunnels and they are my favorites!!!!
---
In this case? No, it's called "you had it coming"
---
Also i fucked up. Me and this guy were going at it. He liked me repeatedly. I kept going back for punishment. But when I snuck up on him with my body explosive gun, I crit shot boom and it said you are in pacifist mode.
---
Wat
---
What?!
---
Why is pacifist mode even in PVP? 
---
That makes since. People who aren't constantly getting the "max caps" notification all the time wouldn't understand.

The body launches up but normally lands somewhere.

Or you step outside of range of the event and take pots shots at people without joining it.
---
I'm ok with counters, just not absolute power. Infinite staggering is absurd.
---
Ya'll really out here acting like everyone is guilty though. Like, I know I am, I'm definitely not denying that. But seriously, there are many people who got hit in that wave who definitely had nothing to do with duping. Now, if you removed every item on duper's, I wouldn't even be mad. Want to know why? I still have plenty of pieces chilling with my clan, and I'm still in a full sentinel set on another character. So yeah, delete all the items and gimme my character back lmfao
---
They should make a better solution. This works as a really good long term bandaid while they do that. A 2 step plan.
---
I absolutely agree with you OP. Idk what the hell is wrong with this community.
---
People (including myself) were posting this 24 hours ago and getting downvoted into oblivion for pointing this out.
---
It is incredibly obvious that Legendaries, VATS, and Stealthboys \*\*DO NOT BELONG IN PVP\*\*
---
Farmed. The shit out of it. Just didnt want to accept any duped gear.
---
made 10k between yesterday and noon today. Bought some expensive stuff and played for another 2 hours. I'm up another 5k. I barely got any stims, but that's ok
---
To be honest, with all the comments made, shows the worst of this community.
---
It's disgusting, and I don't want to interact with anyone, this was merely a fresh player's view, and people are assuming so much worse. It's not going to stop me, because I still need to level, and researching new ways has been a bitch, and I usually end up stalking a level 100+ just to get decent xp gains.
---
Regardless, this reminds me why I hate playing MMOs/Survival pvp and I'm just going to do this shit to power level until I can play with mutations making it easier or with my friends, and hopefully make sure they don't have to deal with epitome of bloody BS.
---
Thanks for the hospitality tonight!
---
I wish there was some kind of mole rat bait we could craft at the tinker's bench.  It would force one of the underground mole rats to pop up where you place it and they would be there for a second or two or one bite animation to "eat" the bait.  Maybe have it only work for mole rats underground so you cant spam them and never get diseased.
---
The situation that annoys me with mole rats is waiting for it to pop its stupid head up so I can fast travel.  I know its there because it's been popping up behind me from sutton to summerville.
---
I call you wanting more wealth with no need to have it other than having it, instant gratification. Sell to a vendor and watch that pile of caps get higher. The reason we could originally only trade for 5k max was an attempt at limiting what could be changed for items. It did not work. Not because the idea was bad but because of greed. Go and see the first few weeks on the market, it was ridiculous. Also no inflation? Your are aware the the number one duped item on all three systems is Nuka Cola right? Don't think that duping went away either. Hop on ps4 side of the market and look for a furious explosive handmade with damage resistance while reloading. Duping still happens. So now that we've established that the instant that the limit gets raised there are people who will have five characters minimum at max again, tell me how much do you want to sell a good item for? You don't because you don't need to. So caps are mostly worthless except for vendor bots. So what do they sell that you need? If it seems like I'm talking circles it's because I am. You'll gain nothing with 50,000 caps. You'll gain nothing with 125,000 caps. Ask the people who already are there. Sure you might be able to buy something that you don't need but for what end? Do you need every legendary in game? No. So, you know what? Go ahead, remove the limit. New players will never be able to get enough to buy what they want from others but at least everyone's greed will be satisfied.

It's survival mode, no need to apologize.

Yeah that's called griefing

Seriously awesome! also how the he'll docyou post an image and text to this sub reddit. it tells me it only accepts text??

please someone help

You might be surprised at how helpful some of us can be if you don‚Äôt knowing ignore our advice. That goes for life, I suppose, not just this game. But you do you.

It would be neat for there to be a perk that allows crits to happen passively.

I would really like to see an accurate depiction of a rad roach nest. There should be hundreds if not thousands of those lil' babys hiding under every surface. I wanna walk in, loot a fridge, and have 5 scurry out. Idk, it's the little things.

I don't aim to steal kills, I tag the enemies when I can, and that's it.
---
I do not. There is just no point to having more.
---
I've been practicing in Adventure to prepare for Survival.

I'm too scared to jump right in with the big boys. Plus I have too many aid items I need to store.

From what I've heard, Survival is just shoot on sight. 
---
Thank u
---
I'm level 172 and solo'd all the way there. I didn't even start farming the ghouls until I was over level 90. You've also had more then one offer of help in this thread alone, and I've offered you a different strategy that's way easier on your resources (if you can't get on the damn roof then get on-top of the bus instead!). If you need help just ask. You can make a thread here asking if someone will help you, and you'll probably find a bored high level willing to help you farm it. Nobody is going to say your turret base is okay, because it's not. 
---
Nah it's not, but hey whatever helps you sleep at night
---
Why you taking that much out? That's not wise. Take like 15 or 20. If you need more then wtf are you doing? Clearly something you shouldn't if you need hundreds of stimpacks.
---
I second this. :)
---
The added strength bonus of Moke rat meat has saved me so many times. 
---
Now that survival mode is up and running, these "rats" provide a fair share of my nourishment.
---
On a serious note, I agree with OP. I would love to see some birds or other winged creatures other than scorch beasts.
---
I'm not ignoring it, just none have actually given a actual place that would help, or a particular way that would help.
---
Some said "on the roof!" but I can't get up there without *marsupial*, others say "like everyone else!" but that is broad, and the other 80% is just complaints, like you said. Only thing that I've learned, is there is an impressive amount of hate on the topic.
---
I‚Äôm still new here and feel dumb too so I feel ya. Have had some issues failing at posting the last couple weeks and I know it‚Äôs just me doin it wrong.
---
Like the plan on the ground or in a baggie?
---
I bet it's probably going to be a few weeks to a month before we see big changes.
---
This is one of the most ridiculous "points" I have ever seen. Your argument is that of we can hold more caps then people will charge more for "duped" items? Being able to hold whatever you earn is optimal as you have earned it. Also "do we need every legendary?". How silly a question is that? The entire point of this whole game is to get better loot so that is a weak "point" to make. Your argument doesn't actually have any real basis or points at all.
---
The wendigo quest has to be done in the wendigo cave. I had the same problem and then did it in the cave and it‚Äôs never come back.

The actual plan, 100% organic.
---
Good idea, I‚Äôm due for a new one
---
My god you‚Äôre annoying. You purport to be listening but you‚Äôre not at all. I want to destroy your base wherever it is now. 
---
alright cool thanks. ill be aiming for her wings right?
---
Seems the legendary must have stars and you must get final hit.
---
I tried actually. Felt dumb after. 
---
I like it. Anything would be better than the brown paper bag!
---
I guess they used it to make people aware that it's temporary. 
---
I would bet when legendary vendor is implemented they'll have something that addresses this.
---
LMAO wow you just can't stand losing an argument, can you? It's not griefing. If you build a base behind the golf club with turrets, no matter what level you are, you're an asshole who is gonna get what you deserve: your camp destroyed. Deal with it.
---
Lol
---
I've killed players every single day since release.  It's okay,  just a game  although some take it very, very seriously lol. 
---
If you're worried about your stuff,  I'd get another character created as a mule and store your stuff and most caps on it before going on survival. 
---
After that, just jump in the fray. Even if you get eaten alive it'll be fun. 
---
Woodland Warrior is a new darker camo pattern.
---
yeah i've gotten the final hit on a 3 star and a 2 star glowing ones yet the counter still doesn't go up.
---
I buy flux, ammo, more ammo, stuff i dont feel like farming anymore like circuits and nuke cards, which gives me more time to launch nukes and cut deals with newly farmed weapons and stuff. Its a vicious cycle but its good. I don't think prices will go outrageous for anything other than the latest trend till it gets nerfed. 
---
Still sounds like you dont make much bank tho.
---
Only one mod exists. The one that changes it to take fusion cells
---
Hopefully so, i have a couple good legendaries that are unfortunately too low of a level. 
---
Okay so let's say you get better loot. Let's say you get better than than. Let's say you get absolutely everything your little heart has ever wanted. What then? You look for a different game. But as I said towards the end of my last comment. Go right on ahead. Remove the limit. See how much more fun the game is. I'm willing to bet not very.
---
Oh wow, what a cool idea.  What's the re-post on this?  We shorten it to every 12 hours yet?
---
Punished Props would be proud of that work.
---
Hmm dunno.  Have been counting for me.   Uh and I'm sure you're doing it in survival mode right?  Can't think of anything else..
---
Ah, I see. Thank you.
---
Still not seeing any real point here other than "I dont want people to get loot in a reasonable amount of time".
---
Yeah I have just created a mule yesterday who will hold all of my caps and aid. It's just a pain having to use another player to transfer or guard items. 
---
I will jump in soon. A few more kills on Adventure first...
---
I don't think scorched variations of the tameable creatures exist. I did hear someone say their deathclaw turned scorched after a scorchbeast attack and had to be put down because it wouldn't stop attacking their crops. That's secondhand though.
---
I've seen the dead deathclaw vendor, I server hopped that spawn in the NE of the map for the witch costume plan and saw a bunch of weird stuff.
---
yeah, i was throat chopped by a guy in a mr fuzzy suit and the summary thing popped up on my screen.  i don't know if it was that one server.
---
Crafting profile? What? That exists?
---
Sounds like you don't play the game so much as just do raids. I'm using mmo terms here as the queen us the closest answer to a raid that we have. Anyway I'm not knocking your choice there. However I play a game to actually play the game. Farming, hunting, pvp it's all fun. Killing the queen again and again and again is boring. I do alright in caps. I'm actually one of the cheapest traders because I don't need the money. I have every weapon I want and most of the gear. What I do want can't be bought so again caps don't help.
---
Would be a fuck ton easier to spot in tall grass
---
Is this your first game with grinding as a major part of it?
---
Not at all. Most games have content to supplement though and this one doesn't soooo....
---
It's worth way more than that. Most people won't sell it for caps, and those who do generally don't know the value of what they are selling.
---
I've got exactly 2 sentinel/assassin drops, one was level 20 the other was 2 nights ago. Thats 800 hours of game play. I got most of my set from trading and getting lucky at in game vendors.

I would rather see that there are similar community wide events of other kinds such that when Fasnacht ends, some new event runs for a period of time, etc. I have to say that I miss the Fasnacht event which brings the players together in a less frantic setting than the fissure battle, but I would get pretty tired of doing the same event for months and months. So, yes to permanent availability of events which invite all the players to participate.

You can't submit the link as the post itself. You need to make a text post (like this one) and put the link in the text body. Reddit will sometimes put a thumbnail of what's linked in the text making it look like a link was submitted. It's meant to mitigate shitposting and spambots.

Well apparently share live stream clips of a obvious hacker along with other videos is now considered Witch Hunting but don't worry you can open a ticket like the rest of the world and a month later realize not only was your ticket not answered but the guy is still playing.

Same here man. I didn‚Äôt do enough research before diving in. I lost over 100 aid items across four deaths. That just ain‚Äôt right

Is it not an event in real life the times when you need to find a toilet before time runs out?
---
If I see a low level at the golf club, I will bash mobs, lure them out, and tank them for you to tag. I will drag legendaries across the map and let them wail on me just to give you a shot at tagging them. 
---
If I see a turret base, you‚Äôre asking for it. The worst are the ones with the rocket turrets. I have tableware flying everywhere, rockets hitting the tennis courts, etc. 
---
Are you sure it‚Äôs under quest items I believe till you complete the quest then moves to explosive and it‚Äôs auto learned when doing the quest

well it's 21 normally but apperently you can find a glitchy one that is higher but super rare
---
Maybe you're the crazy guy I killed at Wes Tek?  Someone dropped full stash worth of junk an aid.  I had to make a muel for me and my friends to put it on.  I was like ... "Why was this guy in survival???"

The ones I tamed were higher level but went down to 21 when they got home

I dont kill the queen often, though we have been known to burn out multiple servers on a Friday night. We enjoy downing random nukes in random spots to see what happens, 2 or 3 simultaneously for the real shock and awe. I'll run low levels through and teach them the bunkers for nothing more than the fun of it. I build at level 20s camps, i drop screws and tons of useful stuff on randoms, i craft level 5 hardened weapons for new players coming into flatwoods for the first time. Raiding certainly isnt all we do. But after level 140, farming and collecting caps is pretty much all we CAN do until more content actually comes out. Actual content.
---
I've sold bloodied weapons for 500 caps to people that gave me great conversation in chat prior, I've dropped tse weapons to people in trade for something needed. And ive absolutely destroyed camps and people for screwing me or my team.
---
And i still want more caps because i like shiny things.
---
I wish there was a poll we could take for it.  They had a great balance going at launch, wasn't too dark, wasn't too bright, and personal lights had more purpose outdoors.  They hurt the atmosphere fo76 was going for by brightening things up.
---
Unfortunately, the griefers just ruin that social aspect for me. I appreciate the advice and all, but it's not like I've never played a multiplayer game before. I've put up with a lot of griefers over the years and now I'm not interested in tolerating it anymore. Over time, my willingness to put up with it just evaporated. More importantly, there's no need for me TO tolerate it.
---
We live in an era of bountiful gaming, where big titles and indie games both are flourishing and you can find a game to cater to just about any preference. It's beautiful, really. Something like fifteen years ago I was part of a ranked fps pvp server and participated competitively there. Eventually pvp lost its appeal and I moved to mmo's mainly. Now, putting up with pvp/griefing/ect holds no appeal for me either. There's no lack of single player games and games that explicitly ban pvp/griefing/ect, so I'm not in any risk of running out of things to do.
---
I'd love to play fo76 - but only in a single player/private server mode. If that never happens, well, it won't be the first game I've passed up because of features I didn't like.

---
Yes but again. So are drugs OP, so is explosive damage, so is bloodied. But it's about the build, i don't use drugs because I don't have enough endurance points to use perks that extend the time of drugs and nothing can negate that dmg if I did use them. If you're using VATS and somebody dips behind cover, crouches engaging stealth, runs past grass, vats becomes useless. Also when you start VATS there's about 1 second before it actually gains percentage. My experience last night was a fire fight between a matched opponent where I'm normally a VATS using build and I couldn't even use it. I used berry mentats, so I knew where they were but they were in stealth and I couldn't vats them. And once the fight broke out, we were needing to be ducking back and forth between cover, not enough time for VATS. Infact I died when I tried to rush them and try for a VATS crit headshot, but took too long. There are already faults to the system and you can be beaten with it. I just feel like melee has always been so completely OP and unbalanced for so long that finally ranged is actually relevant again and people are like WTF, that's not fair, I want to be the only 1 able to kill people by using my melee build. You shouldn't be able to win using ranged.
---
100% this.        It took me like half an hour but it worked

Sorry. Someone put a landmine down on the reenactor and it seems he disappeared.

No way...  really?  Seems like Tanaas said, all the ones I‚Äôve seen are 21.  
---
But the reason I ask is I‚Äôve been trying, most likely futilely, to tame the L91 Glowing Dearhclaw that spawns near my base all the time.  No luck obviously so far. 
---
As someone with a nearly complete vanguard set....yeah,   pack a lunch. Not invincible, per se, but tanky as hell.

Build is Vanguard/heavy gunner/furious.

Several bloodied/melee builds have discovered rushing me is a great way to lose some carry weight and respawn.

We like screwing around for a few hours. Maybe we farm, maybe we kill, but we don't grief or pvp. Nukes, trolling fissure sites or finding random spots. The guy i usually play with matches me at lvl 140
---
I died twice and went from 40+ Stims to 3 and have only 1 of every other aid item.  I think I lost about 90% of my aid. I didn't check it until after my second death and then it was too late. 
---
Just got an email.....something just pre-released...........gotta go! 
---
The environment in 76 is so on point that when the game came out and I had just started playing it, if I was in the passenger seat of a car I'd zone out and subconsciously start looking for scorched and shit beside the road

I live in WV and it's dead on. Seriously get the urge to loot the old abandoned 60's style trailers on the side of the road lol 
---
max out? what mods are u looking for?
---
Yeah I have the same issue. It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt use it. Not a waste as I used free tokens to get it but yeah; would be nice if the graphics mesh for it was fixed.
---
I'm really glad I got to witness this thread. Good luck you crazy kids. 
---
I like your glass half full comment, but this is Bethesda and they arent renowned for their forward thinking. 
---
But I hope your right.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs called doing the Lord‚Äôs work. Fuck CAMPS in Whitesprings. 
---
I don‚Äôt think it should be that simple, I just think the high level players that constantly do this are just assholes. 
---
I think Bethesda didn‚Äôt think this through all the way.
---
It is some real pussy shit porting over your high level character. I made a fresh one because I thought a good amount of people would and that the high tension would be fun. But nope. All my junk gone because a level 200 who had way more supplies than me decided to spawn kill me over and over again by no fault of my own, when I have no means or resources to fight back what so ever. Maybe Bethesda should level gate survival and treat it like the DZ in the division.

Yup same here all x-cells serums psychos med x calmex stims rad away etc its all gone forever for me

It 100% devalues them. I have 4 characters maxed. I have a legendary you really, really, realllly want... you offer me 25k.. what do you think my answer is going to be if i already have 100k?  Hell, raise the cap limit... now I have 300k. You offer me 40k... see the point? 
---
Wheres a good spot to find a tamable death claw? Can it fast travel with you?
---
I'm level 140+, so no place scares me to travel to.
---
They should have done ‚Äúlevels‚Äù right in the first place.A real exp curve and actual benefits for leveling.There shouldn‚Äôt be level 400 or 500 toons would in game.If everyone was in a more reasonable level 50-75 level range like they should be,this system would make much more sense.Level 100 should have been near impossible to attain.At this rate by this time next year,what are we gonna have? Level 5000 toons? That‚Äôs just stupid imo.
---
Are you talking about the helmet in the CE or the replica weapons they licensed Chronicle collectibles to produce? Either way the super sledge was only $80 and its actually well made and looks great. Not criticizing his work either, it looks fantastic. 
---
In 4 I think it scaled your damage 10% per addiction, up to like 150% or something. It was nutty if you invested in it. Not sure what it Caps at now but would like to try it one day 
---
You gotta pay the troll toll to get in!
---
Where does it spawn may I ask?
---
That's the thing though, if no one is willing to pay you 40k then you will have to sell for a reasonable price. It's a little the called "the free market" and it works wonders.
---
I searched every section of the tinkers, it wasn‚Äôt there
---
It can spawn in many places. Currently it is near the Overseer's Camp.

I've got furious prime railway rifle 1 star legendary. Damage is great. Just need to acquire more mods to make it viable.

Or ..and hear me out..i  wont sell it but i will trade you it for a legendary i desire! Fallouts market is 100% not a free market.  Its dictated by those who have the OP items.

My favorite one is the Mr. Handy and Ms. Nanny that are stuck in an endless debate loop. They ask some great questions.
---
This is the only other thing I can think of shut off your system completely and clear your system cache by unplugging the power cord if you‚Äôre on console. Then relaunch it should update the quest and add the plan to the bench. If that doesn‚Äôt work then idk what to do besides buying one from another player
---
R u on now? I can check if i have it Just need a radium rifle as I don't have one myself.
---
What is the point of the "assasin" modifier then?
---
And I understand that it's an auto-aim system. But for me to do real dmg, I need crit headshots. For that you need all your points in perception and luck and the enemy to be a relatively close distance. So you loose out on health, defence, anti-staggering, resistances. I'm a glass cannon compared to melee, shotgun, commando builds.
---
If a melee fighter gets close/the drop on me, it's over
---
If you go running through an open field, without thinking, taking cover to advance on a ranged fighter, you deserve to die.
---
If I don't asses situations properly to make sure I'm not going to be surprise attacked or keep distance from a target, as a range fighter. I deserve to die.
---
If you find your loosing too much, maybe look at your build or strategy. Because it can go both ways
---
Level 68 don't drop level 35.
---
The problem is you're killing legendary enemies below level 40. The level 42 ghouls at Whitesprings, legendary Wendingo's, and Mole Miners can't drop max level loot.
---
I agree it's annoying to have a 3* ghoul spawn as a level 42 and drop an awesome legendary at less than max level.
---
Not sure if that offer at the end was to make a point but if you dont use something you will have to sell it for what the market dictates because you can only hold so much. Its sell for a price people are willing to take or have no storage left and be unable to obtain new items. 
---
I main a junkie. It is a lot of work getting all the chems but it's not bad at all damage wise. 
---
I believe it caps off at 4 addictions. I have been addicted to all 15ish chems in one sitting though. Needs further testing on my part.
---
Commenting so I can read later thinking about making a new char
---
Yea im on gt V0NCL0USE zeros for os
---
Yea I think so. 
---
No bites yet but let‚Äôs be hopeful together! ü§òüèº
---
What if I buy the set and I've already got the skin. Do I get refunded some atoms?
---
Just to add on to this, mysterious stranger hardly works for me. About 60% of the time he just stands there and doesn‚Äôt do anything.
---
They don‚Äôt weigh more. 
---
I don‚Äôt worry, I reported him. I just hope he doesn‚Äôt terrorize too many more people :/
---
The last time I got in a team with somebody was around beta or immediately after release. It's the only person that I friended but haven't seen him online ever since. I played this game almost 100% solo apart from the I am become death: site prime. Partially bc I want to avoid ppl other than freinds and members from my faction and bc I like solo playing. You could report him for harassment I think, do it, it will help you and fo76 :) good day yo you. 
---
Well I have 1 main, 1 alt and 3 mules, and they all have weight reduction armor and weight reduction perks... we can hold A LOT
---
But for me and the vast majority of anyone who trades in highly desired items (seriously, go look at the market and see that 90% of items are trade only) I will make my mule fat walk  before i sell any god tier item for caps. 
---
Is that ... a very recent change?
---
Doing a "I have a gift for you" emote right before launching a mini nuke at somebody is the most Fallout thing I can think of
---
You mean to get this boys soul?
---
Drove past a lumber yard  a month into the game amd wondered how many wood scraps I would get. 
---
Pc mod that gives you perk loadouts. Not official, but desperately wanted :(
---
It‚Äôs just a very snotty wording man. It‚Äôs ok I have a -40 something comment cause I called something gay ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
True. But you are talking "God Tier". Those are mostly trade only anyway kist like you said so at least with a higher cap limit maybe we can get enough caps to actually buy a "God Teir" item if we aren't fortunate enough to get on our own. This actually helps my arguement. Lol.
---
Have you tried challenging yourself by purchasing a duped set of Assassin's Sentinel armor and standing perfectly still at a train station when players spawn in and then shooting them with a duped anti armor explosive shotgun?
---
Wow I found this very helpful since I‚Äôve only been doing 200 caps a day at Whitesprings! 
---
Quick question. Once you tame one can you remove those perk cards or will that mess things up?
---
Iv got my pet deathclaw and has been afraid to swap cards since. 
---
Looking to just increase the maximum damage output for it that still keeps it in the rifle category 
---
I don't mind the mole rats tbh. Their meats gives me a strength buff which gives me more carry weight for 30 mins :P
---
When I had my Deathclaw it didn't even occur to me to walk back home with it, I just ignored it and when I got home it was there. 
---
I got mine at the random spawn by southern lookout. 
---
Ok , thank you!
---
Same here. I often find that connecting from the 0 (non-powered) point to the 1 (powered)  point will cause the issue to happen less. 
---
Well I bet you will be popular!
---
I don't hate them.
---
I hate that they don't clear out their level 22 spawns. Because I didn't fast travel across the map to kill a bunch of level 22 ghouls 
---
I didn't think player vendors were viable yet I'll definitely send a friend request and probably be repeat customer üëçüèª
---
I wouldn‚Äôt write off survival completely yet. If you can get into a rhythm it‚Äôs just the same as Adventure with less Aid items and a nice XP boost. And sure, while the endgame players are annoying I think with time the novelty will wear off and things will relatively calm down.
---
With some PvP weapon tuning that levels the playing field a bit for lower-level players it should be a fine mode.
---
Tell us more 
---
Thanks!  lol ... as I said, we were visiting a friend's camp and just put this up. :P
---
Jesus. Uh...ok listen , if you have 20000000k caps and i have 5. But i have evey god tier item ... i still wouldn't sell them for caps. Why? Cause what can i do with those caps? 
---
As I'm reading this I felt every oz of anxiety and tension that you described lol. Then came the let down of no battle.. ))= 
---
Both of these miscellaneous quests are bugged. The golfer feral ghouls barely ever spawn (I‚Äôve killed only 5 in over 200 hours playing). The Wendigo quest just keeps going back after you do it (I‚Äôve done it 3 times lol) 
---
I‚Äôve just given up on both of these. 
---
Thanks :)
---
Wait, I'm confused. You're upset at losing double caps per your level, but you think it's fair that a level 80 looses 200 caps per death? That's more than double? 
---
Maybe I'm misreading that.
---
REEEEEE is the sound I now probably-always make after my 1,824th molerat ambush. Wish they'd just take them out of the game completely tbh. They annoyed me in Fallout 4, they piss me off more in this game. 
---
I don‚Äôt know if it counts but I took a new character into survival and it‚Äôs kind of awesome actually. You can heal with food, lose like 10 caps when you die, and still hit surprisingly hard with a hunting rifle. I‚Äôm like lvl 14 with over 1k caps and a stockpile of all the aid I‚Äôll need running around with no fucks to give! Give it a try!
---
Still available?
---
Hey guys, I just started getting in on some of these sweet sweet mutations and I noticed something kinda odd. I have Marcupial and Speed Demon with class freak 3* but speed demon still shows 50% hunger/thirst. Marcupials negative was reduced to - 1. Is this a bug? I honestly can't tell too much of a difference to my hunger, it's just extremely annoying not seeing that - 50% when I take off and put on Class Freak. ü§î
---
With foam and pvc, I'd believe the swing speed and weight reduction 
---
Kill me, I‚Äôve lost 3000 caps in 12 minutes 
---
Fast travel, buy junk, buy aid, buy non God tier items, buy plans, set bounties, pay bounties, claim workshops, PvP, ect. 
---
Caps are really meant for everything but God Tier player trading.
---
Dude I‚Äôm sorry, but an event to find a toilet? That sounds like a complete nuisance. Nothing of value would be added by that. It might be funny to do it once, but after 8 or 9 times it would just be completely annoying. ‚ÄúHold on guys, I can‚Äôt go do Uranium Fever, because I have to take a shit *in a video game*.‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs just a bad idea. Not every quest idea that someone posts is amazing, sometimes it‚Äôs just stupid. This is one of those ideas. 
---
No problem!
---
Are you talking about that pelican? 
---
I'm talking about that floating roof piece
---
My head hurts man , feels bad . Bye now

I made it onto the dish:

I get what you're saying. Honestly, rather than increasing the level, it should just give the reward and cap "levels" at 100. 
---
.....no reply to the fact that you still need caps even if you have all the gear you need? 
---
Nope. But if it makes you feel better,  ill give you 125k from my mules. 
---
Ooh, I could use that ammo. I really like my handmade, but don't have enough for it. 
---
Haha. I wish.
---
I‚Äôve got some 
---
I'm having the same issue. 
---
You can get them on the same piece. 
---
NICE. That rust on there looks totally legit, too.
---
Well, unfortunately I‚Äôve yet to find a solution. It‚Äôs extremely annoying 
---
Build walls down to a floor and then delete it from the top to bottem. Let me know if it works! 
---
Could you imagine if they built it before release, then this game wouldn't have been the laughing stock of the gaming community.
---
Aight 
---
Agreed. Also let us actually play pool. 
---
That was delightful. I forgot this was a fan made post.
---
There's one you missed, on the road I believe north of the Abandoned Bog Town near an unmarked fissure site is an encounter point, I found the lemonade stand there
---
Could you imagine building it before release?
---
I don't mind the loss of "random" amounts of aid items as I think it encourages thought when leaving your camp. There are TONS of issues with survival at this time but this one is an easy one to deal with. Take a smaller amount of necessary chems/food during each outing. 
---
Bonus points for building yourself a mobile camp so you can easily reload when needed and not have to deal with a lot of camps paid for travel. I don't do this myself but it is an option for some.
---
Other companies do. 
---
Slappers only
---
Don't carry so many aid items. Why were you trying to kill someone in their concrete base? Seems like a bad idea. 
---
This mode is an absolute joke!!! I played for 10 minutes and got killed as soon as I spawned. And then 10 seconds after every next spawn. Lost so much shit and caps. GARBAGE 
---
But they were brand new to the multiplayer spectrum. That was evident with elder scrolls online as well. But, with the people that stuck with the game and enjoyed it even with the bugs, they fixed, they worked, and now it‚Äôs decent. 76 is the same way.
---
Same thing! His name was red! He could kill me but I couldn‚Äôt kill him!
---
It makes sense, everyone else moved on, I‚Äôm just stubborn (apparently we have that in common).
---
They can be as delusional as they want, but they know the game has a bunch of problems even though it does sound like there‚Äôs been some improvement.
---
I‚Äôm thinking of jumping back in and seeing what‚Äôs changed, the ‚Äúones mans trash is another man‚Äôs $60 game‚Äù crowd said there‚Äôs been significant improvements. You play at all lately? I‚Äôd rather get the impression of someone who acknowledhebthe reality of the problems.
---
All i do with this mode is just quickly switch over to it while i'm at the whitespring golfclub and silently farm the place. I usually make out with 3+ legendaries a rub. Then i just go to advemture mode, im not a big pvp guy.
---
Wow, that's really cool!
---
People would cheat with VATS
---
The moment when you realize you had balls but forgot to use them. That's gotta be worth at least a one handed clap.
---
Nice one bro 
---
How long does the glow last
---
It doesnt work like that already? :o 
---
I really wish Bethesda would take note of this and do something to fix it. I'm a completionist in these type games and to have quests that are uncompletable really urk me.
---
It has to be on survival for the weekly challenge. 
---
Me too, I hate having those quests hanging around in data, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve tried many times to complete them- but alas! 
---
Maybe more vaults have tranquility loungers than we thought 
---
StayüëèAwayüëèFromüëèWhitesprings Stationüëè It is pure chaos and cap drainage. 
---
Ayeee that would be sick
---
But it was at a high cost. Bethesda really looked bad throughout it all. Your opinion of how it went down doesn't match most gamers. This was the most hated game for a long time. Even now with it's polish and fixes many people who were hesitant to buy this are still hesitant 
---
Purely incidental info...but my wife‚Äôs had 3 deathclaw pets. 
---
DC 1.0 never made it to her camp.
---
DC 2.0 glitched into the ground on day two and disappeared next log in.
---
DC 3.0 lasted 2 weeks. She took down her max level animal friend card. 2 days later DC 3 was gone. 
---
Me , I‚Äôve had the same level 30 Mirelurk King (Elvis) for a month keeping my card up. 
---
Game is so glitchy... who knows how things work!
---
I get that there is suppose to be some risk to playing survival.  It is what gives it that little extra edge.  However, I don't want to start keeping 90% of my aid items in my stash.  That's even more inventory management to be done.    
---
Happeningto me on ps4 as well, also did they unlock some headlamps or have they always been unlocked and I somehow missed them.
---
I've been trying for the last hour to communicate with some low level players in order to look for golfer ferals and either none of them have mics or they don't want to group up. Super annoying!
---
Why would you play survival with serums on your character .....seriously. Why?
---
I got one, I have no clue what it worth though 
---
By and large this game is exactly what they said it would be at E3. I don't know why people whine that it "wasn't finished" or whatever.... Too me that was the best part of this game, it was going to be barebones and full of hiccups and we were offered the opportunity to help build it with Bethesda. Call me a "fanboi" or whatever helps you feel superior to me, but paying $80 to get in on the ground floor and play this game from conception to fruition is just a way cooler to me than a 30 hour pump and dump that'll never revisit after a single playthrough. Personally I only buy games that I know I'll be playing for years, not weeks. This game was a perfect fit for my gaming habits 
---
There is a dog version of this too with mongrels that attack!
---
Awesome, thank you!!
---
I thought there were 6 days remaining to grab it 
---
+Karma
---
Yeah, I haven't been on since the update and wasn't aware of the challenge. I thought OP was just looking for help on a normal legendary run.
---
While were at it, add back bottle cap mines. Then I can bait someone into thinking I dropped junk when its actually a trap!
---
this will tell you all you need to know about legendary effects
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
It was temporarily taken down, something to do with the pump shotgun skin being missing, I believe. Should be back up at some point or another.
---
The camo one had a bug so there fixing it
---
How‚Äôd it go ?
---
I'm by no means an expert on this, but if you run a high health build Vanguard armor seems to work pretty well for me.  I use 3 pieces vanguard, 1 regenerating and 1 unyielding.  The only reason i use the unyielding is for the 3rd star fall damage reduction.  Vanguard works well even with 3 pieces, I can take a direct screech from a SB and incur zero damage.  Once It starts to fall, however, it becomes no different than generic armor.  It's all situational.  The mutation 'grounded' gives you 100 energy resistance and the perks lone wanderer and iron clad boost DR/ER.  
---
The only way I'm dying is if I get absolutely mobbed by Gutsy's or swarmed in a nuke zone without my armor.  Just my preference, but I don't like the idea of always being almost dead to boost my character.  
---
Yes! Or at least make legendary weapons unequipable. This will even the playing field so that gameplay is entirely skill-based and not 'Who has the most op weapon'.
---
It was temp taken down due to bug with camo shotgun paint I think 
---
Ha! Indeed. 
---
Awesome, I really liked that tan camo 
---
Thanks! It's difficult to read on mobile, but I'll give it a good read on the desktop tomorrow.
---
At that low of a level stick to missions. It's probably the least frustrating (read least lethal) way of grinding. 
---
Otherwise Whitesprings. If you're wanting to level quickly this is it  but you'll die a lot. 
---
I think it's just a cheeky nod at the game's nature as, well, a game. Pretty sure there were similar references made in regards to Fallout 3.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs different on PS4 than XBox but I started a new character about a week or so ago, and played about 4 days, the fastest way I made it to 47 was exploring the crap out of everywhere but the Mire and the Bog.  Events, quest lines (up to the Free States part haven‚Äôt started it yet).  You can go to whitesprings and do that sort of thing but the best way is running around everywhere killing things, and doing every event you see.  Invest in Inspirational (if you play in group) or Lone Wanderer (if you‚Äôre alone).  You‚Äôd be surprised how much faster it goes up exploring.  You also find SO MUCH stuff.  
---
Haha, legit had a long conversation about this exact thing with several friends, thought it's not Todd Howard who handles Fallout 76, that's the head of the Bethesda Game studios Austin
---
Someone tested it, if player dont have 100% hp, instagasting efect wont trigger. Radiation protect from this too.
---
No one special.  JUst a friend of mine.   We are both 40.  i missed u saying you were 50.  This " have smoked weed for 35 of those years, I'm also a Dudeist minister and a pacifist, "  is literally something he would say :)
---
i found him in beta near the dry lake, he was saying that he was escort those cat or something, then i went to kill some super mutand and found him dead with all the cats on the road, that was a sad morning 
---
Never underestimate mutants or gutsies. Even as a high level with decent dr 
---
Great! I lost some caps, but I figured it would! I really like the mode, tbh, makes it feel like a totally different mode! 
---
But I gotta admit, I was an idiot right at the end of the session. I worked my way up to second place for survival time, got bored building a workshop then decided to go find the number one survivor and try take him out to claim the top spot! Got my armour all repaired, put the power armour on, had some stimpacks, used a bobblehead, and everything is hunky dory. I go to take this guy out; fast travel to his location, (his workshop had a ‚Äòprotect **x** workshop, it‚Äôs under attack‚Äô event going on), and start firing mini nukes like nobody‚Äôs business. The firefight goes on a while, and I‚Äôm on my last nuke, and the guy finally gets a good shot in and kills me. That‚Äôs when I realized I hadn‚Äôt damaged him at all. I had pacifist on the entire time. I felt pretty silly, but it seemed like both of us got a good chuckle out of my mistake. 
---
My BIGGEST issues with survival outside of the awful balance are the caps loss and ease of spawn camping.
---
I love the idea of limited fast travel locations but each point should have dozens of points spread all around the area and you should be invincible for at least 30s maybe 45s after spawning in unless you engage someone.
---
Other issues being things like TSE being as awful to deal with as expected and mutations being wonky to deal with. Fighting someone who has bird bones and marsupial feels like fighting someone that has a little bit of lag since the floating+movement system that allows moving while in air makes makes people look jittery. Nothing feels worse than landing a few shots on someone 50+ yards out only for the person to bounce around plastering your location with TSE rounds. Who needs aim when you have a direction and TSE?
---
The leader board is also a big miss. It encourages hunting people that are questing which is usually low levels. When I heard about survival mode I was hoping for a version of the base game with PvP always enabled so there was danger around every encounter. What we have now is hunting people questing in between camping spawn points. If bethesda is 100% against removing the leader board then fine make it the people with the longest kill streaks between deaths with a minimum of say 3 kills before you can reach rank 3 or just the people with the most kills in a lobby not starting before someone has again like 3.
---
Population allowing servers having a level bracket could also be a neat idea. 1-25, 26-50, 51-75 etc. Just an example that could lead to better balance fights. I would also love a full release version of survival mode after the beta ends that forces one to level fresh on survival servers and maybe implement a FFA style server with no brackets? I don't know but I think that if Bethesda gets serious about making survival mode better with pvp balance then population won't be a problem.
---
There are a hundred other suggestions to make and people making them but those are my 2cents.
---
you have to use the button for power attack on melee.  not the regular attack button.  I believe for xbox it is the right bumper, not trigger
---
That is just brilliant
---
Anywhere in the Forrest (west of the vault) is pretty low level. 
---
Can‚Äôt tell if genuine enjoyment or no. 
---
I respect your opinion
---
yeah he is always dead and says traveler merchant when you aproach lol
---
Wish i could have an assault rifle that dealt ludicrous poison damage like that.
---
You can just put tse and everyone will know you don‚Äôt mean bloodied. No armor sets really benefit tse so anything you want to stay alive long enough to kill them with the mediocre buffs of a tse weapon
---
Were you able to loot the gun? If not it was probably that "I look like a super mutant but I'm actually an exploding robot" type glitch.
---
You can stream it on the website. And if you dont have time for that I guarantee there will be a large amount of videos covering it on YT
---
on the other hand i wish people accept my team invites at the nuke zones so i can use that perk that heals both u.u
---
Just be happy it wasn't a scorched with a gamma gun
---
Yeah my bud was saying he spoke to his armor guy and that vanguard sentinel combat (which is what I sort of wanted? Lol) is terrible for PVP but great for PVE.  I don‚Äôt know how to balance that out by maybe having a few vanguard pieces and maybe 2 assassin pieces? I‚Äôm just so dumb with armor it‚Äôs never been my strong suit! 
---
There's always an albino deathclaw in a fight accompanying him as well, maybe the mate killing the murderers of its lover? At least there was the few times it spawned for me.
---
I've seen quite a few posts saying you needed to and they could die on the trip, but leaving and waiting for them to show up at camp has had a 100% success rate for me.
---
Events like the power plants.
---
Could be in pacifist mode you don‚Äôt take damage when your in that mode
---
It‚Äôs a lot smaller than the actual effigy during the parade, so the mask looks to be too small to wear anyway lol
---
I understand this was probably blocked in the name of balance, but also new features should be made to work with existing perks. I felt kinda jipped. 
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just salty because I‚Äôm always out of wood and boiled water now. 
---
Bad is PVP is because everyone is using AA weapons.  Doesn't really matter what you're wearing when other players ignore it through their builds.
---
It looks like a combination of lag, missing some of your shots (evasive perk) and stacked auto-stim armor. 
---
New patch means players won't take damage unless in pvp. 
---
My GT is Lady Rot Roh 
---
Mostly do exploring, scavenging, and crafting :)
---
I‚Äôm in Australia though so depends when you usually play, I might be asleep haha
---
Ok that's fair xD
---
None
---
The reward of knowing that you‚Äôre the one everybody is trying to track down and assassinate üôÉ
---
Until its death
---
It's an idea I can float with the team! Thank you for taking the time to make the suggestion :D
---
Thanks for the input!  I don‚Äôt consider TSE OR AAE to be mediocre, I‚Äôve done alright up to this point using them with regular armor.  The whole bloodied melee thing is cool but to me personally it‚Äôs overdone.  I knew people would move on from explosive but I chose to stick it out.  I have a gut feeling melee is going to get nerfed soon anyhow, and I‚Äôd rather be adjusting my new character to the already nerfed stuff rather than be left in the dust.
---
Do you mind explaining why no armor sets benefit that build?  Just cause I don‚Äôt know why and I‚Äôd like to?  
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

I am 200lvl with sentinel armor. 19 level killed me with handmade pretty easy. I didn't even find out where he is shoting from, before i was dead. Automatic weapons are op. Also someone killed me with one mininuke.
---
Blades? It downloaded to my phone and says early access but still not able to play yet.  Looks like a fun game while I‚Äôm on break at work. 
---
Yes that‚Äôs what I figured.  Like every AA weapon is going to tear armor to shreds so I don‚Äôt know why exactly it matters what armor you do wear.  I don‚Äôt really understand the whole god build thing haha, I just like running around killing stuff and not getting killed often ü§£
---
I‚Äôve said before that for this game- the players and Bethesda are partners helping create their first online experience. 
---
I never felt mislead by what they said. I read between the lines. 
---
And for me it‚Äôs been great since day one, in the beta. Love this game. I‚Äôve never playing one character So long, and I still have more to do because the focus isn‚Äôt quests. 
---
Does that one actually work now? I grabbed it a few times but every time it just gave me a regular minigun.
---
MATE, this is awesome. Please show us the final cosplay when you're done! :D
---
If it gives you any trouble change all the walls to doorways and try again.
---
Yeah but what if he's raising an army of cats to take over the wasteland
---
No they didn‚Äôt. Guys like you screamed and cried and told us to see them negatively. But I just view you negatively instead, because so many come off as whiny entitled douchebags. 
---
They got a üëç from me right at the start. Damn crybabies. 
---
Hahaha the sunroof made me laugh. I love this! Thanks for sharing hollowro :D
---
I thought they fixed that?? I haven looked into the specifics BUT.. Whenever my stash box is full I bulk literally all of my junk and it dramatically reduces the weight so it‚Äôs not full anymore..... 
---
I like/prefer armor/weapon sets that have synergy with the entire build. 2shot has a stagnant 25% damage increase and no armor/perk/mutation stacks with it. Imo this makes 2shot a mediocre legendary effect as nothing improves/increases the damage output and the benefit of 25% is too insignificant. 
---
No. If you add bonus then it will become a real hunt for being number 1.
---
I got into 7man hunter/hunted event on survival. I killed one guy that i was chasing. Then my marker disapeared, so i was camping for while, killed two guys were after me. Finaly i found out that my target is inside some house. Went for him, he was inside hidden chinese center under dolce mama factory. There weren't mobs killed, so i was running around not knowing if that marker was bug, then 19lvl guy killed me from behind with handmade, with few shots. Realy funny pvp...... I am level 200 with sentinel armor, so if you are camping you can kill anyone in this game haha.
---
yes you can remove cards after
---
New quests start on the 9th, so I assume the next update will be big fixes and tweaks for the PvP mode.
---
May you pick all the locks with that beauty

Would make for an interesting discussion internally. I'll share your thread with the team :)
---
Got a few down votes and just want to remind people that the players I've killed all owned workshops. Every single one. 
---
Once you take a workshop you know that you are opening yourself up for PvP. 
---
I very disappointed we can‚Äôt make that inverted triangle piece floating any longer. That was my favorite decorative piece and I never saw anyone use it in their camp. 
---
On the other side, i was server hoping watoga to get those 25legendaries, not carring about other players just to be smashed with deathclaw fist seconds after using elevator. Cool guy camping inside like chicken.
---
That's no fun
---
Sharing this one with the team :D Thank you mate!
---
Okay so you know what it will be? The survival mode isn‚Äôt really something I‚Äôm interested in because I imagine it‚Äôs just a griefing fest.
---
Are you on a survival server or a adventure server? 
---
It looks like (as far as I'm aware) one of them fired back, causing you to be able to kill that person but their friend never fired back so any damage you do to them is reduced to zero unless they fire back. 
---
If this is a Survival Server it could be that due to the 'Invincibility After Fast-Traveling' patch that the invincibility only gets removed once you either move, or start firing, and they simply stood still so they wouldn't take damage. 
---
I'm on a phone so can't see the video as well as I'd like. 
---
I've never heard of it; where does it take place?
---
The mire
---
The cryptid one looks so cool. I want to play it!
---
Dopamine.
---
I know what imma do now for fusion cores :)
---
If you need serums remade, I have them all unlocked
---
Two points into fire proof and one dense torso mod. You've just castrated all explosive weapons in the game
---
I‚Äôve had the same thing with my legendary The Dragon black powder 
---
My guess is first guy with high health had stim armor and the stim card maxed and had super stims and regular stims so both hit, possibly had a nuka cola quantum hot keyed as well. Second guy with the bloodied build had unyielding armor probably with dodgy and serendipity build. Full health guy you could have dropped with a few more shots. Second guy withThat particular bloodied build though you would probably need a high rate of fire weapon to kill or get very lucky with a crit head shot.
---
So hunting rifle with reload time 10hours have same damage as automatic 10mm? Oh ok i choosed bad build then.
---
I'm soo ready for the vendor and those new quests for the pioneers 
---
It's ok -- you're allowed to have fun even if the Internet disagrees with you. I think we all have that feeling with the whole game, really :-)
---
Heavy weapons build with one-gun army perk which causes a crippling effect, which keeps her stapled to the ground for most of the fight.  Keeping her on the ground is key to beating her.  I use a .50 cal anti-armor combined with stabilized and one gun army and haven't lost a  fight with her in a long while. 
---
They also break my stealth 3/4 of the time they burrow from the ground. Max stealth perks coupled with +25 AGI and STILL they detect me -- right in the feels, man
---
Tell me lies eat some sweet chicken thighs.
---
Believe me, if people get the item they really want, 7 out of 10 quit after a while. Good stuff should be difficult to come by.
---
Free fusion cores + 500 xp
---
I'm staying out of it, and hoping that griefers are learning their lesson.
---
It does get silly how often a legendary robot will be absolutely *nowhere* to be found after it explodes.
---
False
---
I don't know what it will be, I'm just guessing based on the roadmap. We are getting new quests April 9th, so I assume the update before then will be to support Survival mode. I can't speak too much to Survival because I haven't had a chance to really dig into it yet, but there is a seemingly a need to tweak the invulnerability at load in and probably additional steps to discourage spawn camping. I assume those will be addressed in the next update as we're two weeks away from the next Wild Appalachia addition.
---
The Fireproof perk card, so you don't accidentally kill yourself when shooting at close range.
---
Cue the swarm of ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not possible, you‚Äôre either lying or clearly you don‚Äôt understand PvP in this game‚Äù comments...
---
But in all seriousness I‚Äôve had someone kill me when I was just minding my own business in pacifist mode too, everyone told me that‚Äôs impossible but I reckon there‚Äôs either a glitch or a sneaky way around it tbh
---
Yeah, there's a whole new PvP server and special challenges you can only do there. 
---
It is quite easy to go about unnoticed. Plenty of people are on the servers playing the game as normal except with no PvP restrictions if they encounter someone. Those people are playing like they‚Äôre in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, ducking danger and picking only the fights they know they can win. It‚Äôs not uncommon to check the leaderboard and see there‚Äôs only 4 players getting kills. 
---
Tha_caps_man 
---
I think they fixed that event or many I just dont run into it bugged anymore. Now its a couple dead humans, one labeled as a merchant, and a deathclaw roaming around who presumably killed them. The bugged version is funnier though I'd love a deathclaw vendor lol 
---
What if, Bethesda knows fast traveling is dangerous/risky and wants you to think harder about surviving? What if, you should be logging out at your camp because that is the safest place to log out and back in? Fast traveling is pretty lazy and honestly deserves punishment for being too lazy to walk to your real destination and instead warping to a spawn point instead of surviving your way to your destination? Just something to think about while all you futuristic fast travel warp travelers complain about game mechanics you ain‚Äôt using correctly. 
---
Do they drop with high charge? Been a while since I've run into a hostile sentry bot.
---
Ladydevann, is there any chance of getting some developer feedback on why Bethesda decided to allow characters to freely switch between modes?  
---
I can't see any positive side at all but perhaps I am missing something.  Survival mode, with some serious thought, would have been a perfect chance to capture returning players and new players to the game.  Getting one shot by a group of level 150 - 200+ players that know precisely where you are isn't going to win over many newcomers or basically anyone for that matter.  I'd love to know the reasoning or thought process behind the decision.
---
im in adventure
---
I got a ton of those they can hold up my hair too pretty neat.
---
If they turn red, it means they are engaged in pvp with you and should take full dmg.
---
I've experienced this multiple times and once got him to stop firing and asked him to stand still, got close and went full auto with my quad combat shotgun on the face and guess what, he doesn't die. I see his health bar grey out and hit zero but it immediately recovers as soon as I stop shooting. This be hacks or some weird glitch? Or is it just that some builds are this tanky? If this happened on other games, I would just call him hacker but this is fallout 76 so... it could be anything
---
Girlscoutcookiej 
---
Make legendary weapon mods spread across a couple of weapons (eg: 10mm pistol and SMG) that way you still have to do the same amount of grinding/buying to get your ideal item. Also have a rarity tier along the lines of uncommon(incendiary,poisoners etc.) epic (vampires, suppressor and that sort of stuff and legendary(two shot, explosive and medics effect)
---
Not in Mulholland Drive?
---
Not gonna lie I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it if players kill me but if a glowing hound killed me I‚Äôd be pissed lol.
---
Is there a perk that affects projectiles. That would be an interesting build. 
---
Then they, like me (and you at the start of this video) probably has Pacifist on therefore can no longer be hurt unless they fire back. 
---
I feel my fear in mulholland drive was pretty rational actually haha
---
And my axe!
---
It‚Äôs coming soon, just need to wait a couple of weeks
---
I agree. Plus it does not make sense. Where did they go?
---
So this is clearly the plot of the wastelander DLC right??
---
Damn. I'm glad I didn't try on my main (and I won't). I spawned in on a new character to see what it was like but got camped by a level 65 right off the bat lol.
---
Are you running with a group?
---
I honestly don‚Äôt see it working that way in experience, the dmg values are definitely wrong in many cases, such as two shot explosive weapons, or energy explosive weapons.
---
Not to mention the accuracy is absolutely ruined on a two shot shotgun, making it horribly unreliable and in my opinion ineffective compared to other options.
---
Do you like hoarding pencils, cos, you know, Eraserhead.
---
I'll stop now! üòÇ
---
Not currently i have my friends i roll with. But a team to run the queen in survival would be great
---
As soon I can establish enough dps for the queen I'll throw you an add. 
---
Count me in 
---
I‚Äôve got them to drop after the patch the pulled them from Grafton by killing scorch beast. Some have found them from armor spawns around the map. Seems pretty rare in general now tho. I‚Äôve only gotten the chest piece mod since and I pretty much play daily. 
---
No. That would mean a hell lot less grinding. Besides, there are many people out there with almost perfect legendaries. like bloodied/vats cost handmade rifle but with 40% bash dmg increase and things like that. In this case, all you gotta do is get an explosive receiver and you beat the game
---
I have one. 
---
Not going to lie. I freaked out when I saw a pile of wood on the ground. 
---
You all know which one. 
---
Love these stories!
---
Nice, I‚Äôd love to buy a recipe or 2 off of you if they aren‚Äôt absurdly expensive... how much and when are you on? (GT: Lady Rot Roh)
---
Worlds full am in que
---
Stop before it‚Äôs too late
---
Yes please. I would undress and just sit there waiting for players to find me. 
---
ok a little back story, for me you were the go to guy for fallout, and i really enjoy your videos and find them informative and well orginazied. i can tell you do you reseach and have put you time into it. I also think you are original on the way you presented your content.
---
but their was a few videos that I found they were not your normal content videos, and felt like they were a copy and paste for other youtubers that were straight up hating on the game.I know their is two side to the coin, and things need to be brought up, for them to get fixed. 
---
I dont know thats just the way it felt to me.
---
with that I have also seen a few off your last videos and it looks like your going back to your roots, and not simply put the game down with out giving it a chance like others have done.
---
 
---
Common: 75% drop rate from legendary enemies
---
Uncommon: 17% drop rate from legendary enemies
---
Epic: 6% drop rate from legendary enemies
---
Legendary: 2% drop rate from 2+ star legendaries
---
thank you for the info. I guess you learn something new every day.
---
I made 2 nuka shines because of super duper procing so uhh what? 
---
Nah the hate bandwagon has moved on to Epic. It will be 12 months of hate.
---
It doesn't use AP.
---
Should I make a chart for this and add it as an attachment/link
---
I just want the exclusive weapons :(
---
You're  right I messed with it more no ap used.
---
I would love to transfer my progress to the steam version
---
Ash Heap was my home for a long time as I was sitting on a lead deposit. Because if that I ended up exploring the place a great deal. It‚Äôs a great zone with a lot to explore!
---
First of all, Pacifist Mode does not protect you from getting attack.
---
Secondly, did you have any workshop?
---
It‚Äôs ku. The Order of Mystery don‚Äôt need one, we can handle our own :(
---
Thats what I said
---
First of all, Pacifist Mode does not protect you from getting attacked.
---
I never screamed and cried. I'm just stating how most people felt. Not how I felt. 
---
Honestly if love it if people would stop spawn camping my now level 10 character
---
If the player fast travels to that clubhouse in the back sure,  the ghouls go for the player.  If the player spawns at the main resort or train station and does a run through by the time they reach the clubhouse most of the ghouls have been killed off by the assholes base.  
---
If the asshole isn't currently at their base not a single person benefits from this.  If the asshole is at their base they soak up all the xp and legendary drops from everyone else currently at whitesprings hoping to run through the clubhouse.   This is why it's considered a shitty thing to do and why no one feels bad about these CAMPs getting destroyed.
---
By setting up behind the clubhouse you're cheating other players.  Oddly this is one of the very few instances where CAMP destroying has some form of objective benefit and isn't necessarily griefing.
---
Cool idea.but as is right now its too much for the game. We have a balancing problem as is. That will just add on to that. 
---
I am well aware of that but supposedly you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt die to slap damage.‚Äù I never fought back and no I never take workshops. Haven‚Äôt claimed a workshop since like January and this incident happened about a week ago (only ever claimed them to complete the challenge). And before you ask I was playing solo as well so there‚Äôs no reason I could have entered PvP mode.
---
Right, they can attack, but it does miniscule damage, and I can't damage them. This fight was over fast, not the minimal damage I've taken before when someone has tried to initiate. 
---
No workshops. 
---
How much damage do you do and what perks cards do you run? 
---
You are assigned the most occupied server with the highest ping, with ping given priority. That's why you keep ending up on the same server. Just block someone on the sever from your Recent list and server hop and you'll be put in a new server (unless they have server hopped as well).
---
I believe they already said they are working on some changes to the post 50 system
---
" 
---
* **New Feature: Legendary Players** ‚Äì An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities."
---
But this is not clear if the lvls will still be infinite. 
---
Todd: Nice try sly bastard :)
---
This is why people asked to be forced to create new characters for survival mode. 
---
No, what I‚Äôm discussing here is exclusive to Survival on PvP...
---
I am also well aware of the full PvP implementation but spawn sniping is simply taking the fun out of it for everyone. You spawn and someone one shot snipes you and then you respawn and the same again and now you‚Äôre down 200 caps.
---
Have you played Survival yet?
---
Then it's possible that you somehow walked into one of their workshops, marking you as red.
---
Instead of a faction dedicated to solo players there should be perks, either activated or passive, for each faction that change whether your playing in a group or solo. An example for BoS could be better stealth when solo (trying to find plans undetected) and less damage in groups with other BoS members (team spirit). I just wouldn't want to have only 1 option that would benefit solo players. And I know that sounds kinda funny wanting solo bonuses while in a faction but most real world factions/organizations have members trained in doing their jobs alone.
---
Joke on them. I‚Äôm broke all the time. 
---
Why should Newbies go into Survival in the first place?
---
Thanks for your reply. 
---
The freezes I'm experiencing may be 0.5s to sometimes 10s.
---
They occur randomly. Sometimes I'm combat, sometimes when stationary or accessing the Pipboy. I can go hours without and then get them every few minutes. Occurs independent of location.
---
My CPU is a Xeon E3 1231v3 4c/8t. 
---
1060GTX 6Gb, 16Gb RAM
---
Because the mode is open to all who choose to join???
---
Chally tell Brother Grahm at night. Grahm come hit human face with big hammer. Brother Grahm strong. Do good trade and good hit.
---
Agreed. If you were here in the duping days and went along with the ride your set for  while.  If you didn‚Äôt you are severely lacking. 
---
With the Sheepsquatch coming and emphasis on cryptids there could be a cryptic hunters group and another group that worships the cryptids with different branches within it devoted to each type.
---
Hang on, just walking into a claimed workshop can make you red(/hostile)? Do you stay that way when you leave? Because I was at my CAMP when it happened...
---
Add me nealixxthenomad 
---
Were there green things involved?
---
Yes but choice is not consequence free. By joining Survival, you agree to take the risks that come with it.
---
There is an option to block per session but you can also just block the player. I had one person that I blocked because he was grieving someone I knew, a month later he wants to trade with me and we can't figure out why friends requests are not going through. When we finally did meet up through a third party, I still couldn't hear his mic. That's when I realized he was this guy that I had blocked a month ago.
---
The real interesting thing is that you can't even unblock them unless you end up in the same session and unselect block from the players list.
---
Have seen a few of these comments about the top 3 mechanic as well. Thank you for adding to the discussion mate. I'll share your thread with the team now.
---
Maybe people are dropping out of survival?
---
Less than you would expect.
---
Yes. Since patch 6, I think. Walking into a workshop's buildable area initiates workshop contesting and opens you for PvP with the workshop owner.
---
Walking into someone's workshop's buildable area initiates workshop contesting and opens you for PvP with the workshop owner.
---
I don‚Äôt know. I have mixed feelings. 
---
Even after you leave?! Having not had a hostile encounter with the workshop‚Äôs owner?? Wtf...
---
Except that duped weapons were deleted in the Great Server Purge of February '19.
---
You need to clarify the scenario. If you got 1 shot you were flagged for pvp. Did you have a workshop? Were you on pacifist mode? 
---
There isn't any slap damage anymore, so you can't be killed unless you are flagged for pvp.
---
I've PvPed often, dabbled in survival and I've never been one shot without proper flags. I was killed by slap once, but thats cause I was doing something else in the room and wasn't at the controller. 
---
I've seen lots of reports about getting killed despite being non-hostile, but neither me or anyone I play with have ever experienced it and we've been harassed by even the one shot bloodied builds.
---
Nope
---
Yeah. But not the caps it created. 
---
As far as I know, yes.
---
&gt; I honestly don‚Äôt see it working that way in experience, the dmg values are definitely wrong in many cases, such as two shot demolition weapons, or energy explosive weapons.
---
That's probably because of the DT-based system. Adding one projectile and increasing damage by 25% *can* mean a decrease in damage if you have no DT-bypassing effects/perks to aid the weapon. Otherwise the math doesn't care.
---
&gt; Not to mention the accuracy is absolutely ruined on a two shot shotgun, making it horribly unreliable and in my opinion ineffective compared to other options.
---
I had a look because I was curious, and you're not entirely wrong: the maximum spread on weapons with the Two Shot prefix is increased by 50%. That said, that's not a flat increase, that just expands the range a proportional amount. Take the right perks and that can be easily countered, and in my estimation that's worth the increase in damage.
---
Ran into one like that at WestTec yesterday. It was using a minigun or LMG and just shredding. Surprised the heck outta me.
---
Wow well thanks for tell me! That‚Äôs just poor game mechanics...
---
Yeah but the max cap limit is 25k so what's the point? Most expert players can farm 25k caps in a few hours.
---
Best comment I‚Äôve ever heard
---
Thanks for replying. I've posted this issue more than once but never got any significant replies.
---
Thanks to you guys I've finally got a lead.
---
It would be nice to see Bethesda not ignoring the problem. So far no reply, no acknowledgement.
---
Then he dropped you a 1\* Ghoul Slayer Golf Club?
---
Ill join you! Im at lvl 74. 
---
Ahh thanks I think I can tell now.  Seems a bit more weathered as well.
---
Aside from the LMG, the .50 Cal MG is also pretty good since I've been able to kill players in 3-4 shots. For heavy guns both are dependable since they have no-wind up, instant trigger firing is a nice plus for them.
---
Still...I agree that PVP is whack.
---
This was glorious! 
---
They fire at me first,doing no damage.I turned pacifist off so i can respond to their fire and start pvp.Thats why their health bar turned red and full pvp started.
---
My favorite melee weapon! This is amazing. Great job dude. 
---
Since people were already maxed out they had nothing better to do than camp 76. With a forced restart by the time everyone got back to a higher level there would be less new players coming out of 76 and less people wasting time camping it. Dont have to agree its literally whats happening so I guess yall just gotta deal with it. Ill keep holding out until they do a fresh start server, if not ill just move on. 
---
HAHAHAHAHA no. Almost every tse you see today is a dupe. Next time someone pulls out a tse pump, bet them 100 caps you can guess the 3rd legendary effect, tell them it is 15% after reload speed and enjoy your profit. Also, the dupe purge missed anyone under the generous cutoffs, and didn‚Äôt remove I‚Äôll gotten caps.
---
Except...they changed that with the most recent update. Pacifist *does* mean you can‚Äôt be attacked, and they‚Äôll soon be extending that to your camp too. 
---
I too made a .bat file allocating threads 2 through 7 to the game keeping 0 and 1 fire the OS. No love though, same issues.
---
I guess the starvation and dehydration stopped me from building then? Otherwise I have no idea why I couldn't build.
---
We are not in pacifist,I was and i turned it off so i can respond back to their fire and start pvp.Also they are taking damage,you can see it clearly they are just not dying.
---
I will try this! 
---
I purged my caps before going in. I still had some but no more than 300. Right now its just a bad decision to go pvp when you are sufficiently leveled and have any meaningful amount of caps. Which means if you want to pvp you can't really save up caps. 
---
Power armor builds are actually pretty weak in PvP. You can't get legendary effects and armor piercing is readily available for most popular weapon types. Rifles and melee especially.  I run a support heavy gunner build and so far I've had decent luck in pvp I usually make a handful of caps, but damage is so absurd and many people are running with AAE handmades. Pretty much it feels like whoever gets the ambush gets melted first. 
---
The aid loss is the real problem for me. Most of the time it feels like you lose 20% or more of your items. 
---
There does need to be a cap limit though. I think 150 would be a decent limit.  I wouldn't want anymore than that. I currently only lose 188 caps per death, but if I were paying as much as you i doubt I would be making a profit at all. 
---
That‚Äôs great for them. 
---
All it takes is to sell a few duped items to vendors and make caps for fake items. Take those caps and launder them around until they become normalized. Take those cap and ice them and repeat the process. Soon after you‚Äôll have max limit caps and multiple players that in theory really just made fake money. Pass around a few more duped items and make back the caps that aren‚Äôt really real. 
---
Probably a legendary armor perk you're wearing that doesnt apply to stash weight. I think ammo reductions worked for stash at one point.
---
Well I forgot to look, but
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Lead_Champagne_Bellini
---
Yes!  Same here.   Downloaded.  Did you get a quick combat tutorial?
---
Thanks for the heads up. I have now ammended the post.
---
It should also increase hunger.  LOL.  I can't eat breakfast until I have a cup of coffee and finish my morning "server maintenance".
---
Maybe using a port-a-potty carries a risk of "the oopsies".
---
I think maybe survival games will jump the shark when a game requires you to poop regularly.
---
I think this happens when you‚Äôre using Perk cards that decrease the weight of junks.
---
No I don't think so but I do have the "Pack Rat" perk.  This is stupid though as I don't want to carry junk around as I lose it if I die.
---
It was Blades!  Got to download it and do a quick combat tutorial, but nothing else.   They will notify me when I can play.
---
Maybe? I was near Berkley springs, but I don't remember it saying I was contesting or that it was even owned 
---
I‚Äôm specifically talking about cap farming, when they initiate takeover, kill the victim, then stop the takeover. Then once he‚Äôs spawned, they repeat the process. Because they never take it over, the victim still owns it. He CAN‚ÄôT give it up. 
---
Well thats kinda bad judgement to keep going back. You gotta pick your battles and getting spawn camped (even worse if its a team) is a bad tactical decision. Its best just to spawn somewhere else, take your loss, and jump servers if you need too.
---
If you have pacifist on, you can fire at people and it won't remove pacifist mode, that would be silly (due to friendly fire against the queen ect). Pacifist mode can only be turned off in two ways, like you did in the video (going into settings) or repeatedly hitting an enemy. 
---
What you can do is fast travel once hitting someone so they may have hit you a few times and then fast traveled to the same location (resetting the invincible fast travel) and while on the loading screen turned pacifist back on. 
---
In that case the pack rat perk is pretty useless once you come to store your junk.
---
Exactly,in many occasions,and you can see it in the vid if you observe closely to their health bar that they get to zero red bar, just leaving a short grey bar before they heal.Or its some kind of exploit or a pretty broken build.And this was very frustrating since i normally used to snipe players easily with 2-3 shots.
---
Internet clout 
---
lol your weight perks dont apply to your stash.... why would they?
---
PREACH
---
If that‚Äôs the case then it‚Äôs frustrating, yes.
---
My level 2 was killed by a level 88 who was camping the overseers camp. 
---
Unfortunately, this is still a bug and the max repair is capped at 100%. 
---
I will say though, it does appear to loose condition a lot quicker than other mele weapons. 
---
So when I try to calculate what space I have 800 plus 305 in PA I may as well not bother. Or I carry junk around and lose it all if I get killed? I may as well remove pack rat and use another perk instead.
---
Think it's a glitch or hacks. I seen invincible people long before TSE nerfs, when we could do thousands of damage per shot. I mean pre-nerf TSEs not able to kill people? enough said
---
I literally run around with like 2 stimpacks the whole time. You can‚Äôt walk half a mile without tripping over a red rocket or a train station, and camp fast travel is free...
---
What the hell are you thinking bringing that many into survival?
---
Lol, only if you have a mic and say "somebody's in here!"
---
i think i have a couple on my alt but only 1*, i was looking for one as well üòÇ.
---
Same, even funnier would be if you had to pay in meat.
---
If you are on PC, I can craft them for you. I can also craft the black BOS under armor (with all protection stages) and I might even have a BOS combat armour chest plan too much. Just PM me.
---
I say make nuke zones a persistent event. That way people who do go to the event will get something. Make a kill count extermination type of thing. Kill enough mobs you complete the event and the rest of the nuke zone is still open for exploration and looting. 
---
I use pack rat so I can get more junk to my base 
---
In the Mire. You get a bunch of glowing honey beasts and a yao gui.
---
I‚Äôve commented this idk how many times. It‚Äôs survival it isn‚Äôt supposed to be low risk it‚Äôs supposed to be extremely high risk. If you value some stuff put it in your stash don‚Äôt carry everything around with you
---
Port-a-pottys should definitely have a risk involved, and if another player interrupts the process by opening the door, the evacuation should fail resulting in no buff.
---
That‚Äôs why I choose not to join in on the fun of fallout 76 the hunger games edition. Great idea but needed more time in the oven and more testing and feedback. From the full Spectrum of players. 
---
I came across him also, right by the Overseers camp.
---
Tldr below. 
---
I read through the whole post and OP and i have to disagree on what you said. Todd's speech was a company marketing it's product, nothing more. 
---
It doesn't matter what their intentions were, the fact is they messed up on their product. 
---
All these problems and what you mentioned about developing the game with the players could be done so much more smoothly by giving pre-order players(or some other customer grouping criteria) a beta testing over a longer period than they had done. In essence, release the product at a later date while offering all the benefits you mentioned in your post, by labelling the game as uncomplete, a.k.a a beta. 
---
Bethesda made a mistake by releasing the game and announcing it as a completed product when it is not. And when players expect a polished stone and got a ordinary pebble with flaws all about, you can be sure players will be mad and the reputation of Bethesda tarnished as a result. 
---
Tldr: Shld have opened game to players as beta testers for a longer period of time than they did and released the game as a completed product after most major flaws have been polished and the benefits op described would have been achieved without this whole saga btw "haters" and "shills" and a scarred Bethesda reputation. 
---
Especially when you're out and about with friends, sharing should not be a problem. It can also harvest only one person flux, then you have to wait until it is "regrown".
---
I have often walked through WS and searched only dead glowing ones and very often found the necessary resources.
---
I think it's OK the way it is. If you want to have flux, that is the most valuable resource, you have to expend some effort to get it
---
I realise that now, but it still sucks that my stash fills up even faster once I store it. I could dump excess wood, steel, etc but then I might need it later. I will probably remove pack rat all the same.
---
I would  but unfortunately people are rude and don‚Äôt knock. 
---
I had this problem just the night before the dlc released and never got a solution but ended up having to reinstall the game and the dlc. But it corrected it so Idk
---
You on Xbox? If so, come team with me and give it another go with a level 1 character. I‚Äôll show you where the real fun is at.
---
I turned on pacifist mode because people kept hunting me down. I even got on mic and said ‚Äúplease leave me alone‚Äù but they kept killing me and destroying my base. Now I just run away when I see people 
---
Lol. And what did you learn today?
---
Don't take anything you can't afford to lose to Survival.
---
*THIS MESSAGE BROUGHT TO YOU BY Don't  Underestimate Human Habits D.U.H.H*
---
Bro enclave guy just leave it it‚Äôs obviously griefing and you lost so just leave players like that alone or just go inside the golf club and kill the ghouls there
---
We are not worthy. 
---
Better advise would be "Dont say hello and wave"
---
PvP shoot first.
---
This was before the last patch so it may have changed? Does it have an or or an and with the condition? 
---
Basically Bethesda is doing his best in benefit of the community and the game, and block existing perks to inutilize them in certain is so good for community and game :)
---
/sarcasm off
---
I mean it is in Beta, that's what they are doing. 
---
I dropped in, was killed in one shot, dropped 15 Stimpaks, 20 Canned Dog Foods, 10 Stimpak Dilutes, 40 Beers and some other aid items. 
---
I leave Survival there and feedback that it shouldn't take 90% of the Aid Items I'm carrying. 
---
Thanks, it worked.
---
Long story short: You didn‚Äôt read the patch notes and now you‚Äôre crying about it. 
---
This is why reading is fundamental. You should try it out sometime. Patch notes are released before the servers go down so you have something to read instead of crying the servers are down. 
---
Lol what did you expect? Its survival mode, consider everyone as an enemy, and why are you carrying so much stuff in survival mode? 
---
I am not great at pvp, I have good gear and a ok pvp build. been doing pretty well in pvp by picking and choosing my battles, making a little over 10k a day off it. Most of what you said has been true for me as well. That's said I have seen 3 different players that dominate pvp so mutch, that I will usually leave a server if one of them is on it. From what I can tell they use the chameleon mutation with weightless armor possibly with cavalier on it too. Completely invisible with no name plate they swap to weapon, gun some one down swap out weapon and permanently invisible again and off running. If you pop a berry mentats they run away and your only chance is to try to manual aim as they run hop away. My point is the 3 best players I have seen dont use any of the current best builds. I am willing to bet there are more good gear combos out there too. Oh and one is a shot gun build the other two are rifle if anyone was wondering.
---
The charge is randomized I‚Äôm pretty sure, but they‚Äôre usually at least at 80/100 for me
---
Yeah it doesn't make a big difference 
---
My alt melee character hasn't finished Mayor For A Day, and when I go to Watoga I make the circuit and kill all the bots.  Usually about 3/4 through a pack of 5 Gutsies will appear and try to stomp me out.  It happens almost every time.  I don't think it's tied to not finishing that specific quest, because I've had it happen with my main sniper character while trying to farm lead, aluminum and steel, and he's done everything there is to be done in the game.  Anyways, at least one of those gutsies will be legendary 99% of the time. (there's always room to "roll a 1" in 76, so to speak.)  More often than not it's a 2-3 star boss and a hell of a fight against 5-6 Colonel Gutsies all armed with .50cal tentacle cannons.  Very easy to eat shit if you're not prepared to go HAM and ready to deploy stimpaks.
---
On my first guy, each time low level quest sent me that way, i was running into level 40 to 70 monsters. On my next one, altough i learned to server hop until i see lower level, i haven't explored it as much as i should have. I'm on my third character while waiting for player vending and i intend to do a lot of things differently.
---
You can see the condition on the screenshot; the variable is 'HasKeyword' and the condition is 'Not Equal To' with a value of '1' (True).
---
Is that the only condition or are there more? If you collapse it it'll show an and or or
---
Thank you! I just posted my first screen shot from the game over there and Subbed up!
---
A bullet to the head from 70% of the rest of the people on the server and the honour of giving them lots of caps and healing items ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
This week, that's my point too. Next week reward is better, so yep I also want it fixed. But not gonna do such a grind if not fixed when the losses are greater than the gains.
---
Achievements are full of bugs. Learn recipes 4/76 (And I already know almost all of them). Bethesda.
---
So....drink it?
---
That is the only condition as far as I can see.
---
If you would like to quickly double check the perk FormIDs are:
---
SuperDuper01 "Super Duper" \[PERK:003BD597\]
---
SuperDuper02 "Super Duper" \[PERK:003BD598\]
---
SuperDuper03 "Super Duper" \[PERK:003BD599\]
---
Well that's a waste of food...
---
You're right. I'm guessing they updated this with the recent patch as I did this slightly before
---
I agree 4's method was better but I guess it's to make people waste perks on the cards that let you craft them
---
Just the 4 common.
---
Could I be cheeky and ask you to go through the perk record themselves?
---
I get the subjective impression that Super Duper is not as 'generous' as it once was but cannot work out why...
---
Gah... why are these specials on for such a short time... oh well... saves me atoms I guess...
---
I'll definitely take a look! 
---
Lol @ waving at someone in survival mode. Sorry dude but you obviously didn't make any effort to find out what you were getting into. That said, kudos for posting a warning for any other doe-eyed wanderers who don't know that fire is hot.
---
I'm not a dedicated PvP player but I checked out Survival   Mode for a bit. Got killed more than I killed, lost some stuff but didn't gamble more than I could afford to lose.
---
I was stuck for a week on this exact one too. Tried everything. 
---
Got it the other day by heading to Watoga (robots were friendly to me), stripping off all perk cards and gear, then drinking the bourbon. Afterwards, I snuck up to a protectron and punched it in the back. This finally registered the sneak attack. 
---
Super frustrating, I don't know how many bottles of bourbon I made this past week. At least a dozen or so. 
---
I‚Äôm not disagreeing that it‚Äôs not beta. But based on the ‚Äúthis is our mode‚Äù mentality. And ‚Äúwe all deserve to play it‚Äù. It feels more early workings of a mode. And not one that was clearly planned out whiles ago. 
---
A lot of people seem to and including myself would enjoy the idea of survival more with fresh made characters. 
---
 And yeah people already are crying because their one hit wonder builds wouldn‚Äôt be used there. Or the ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt make a new character, I don‚Äôt have time‚Äù. 
---
Based on the beta now as it seems it needs a lot more time to be hashed out. 
---
It‚Äôs actually fine. You will still do plenty of damage even at low level, barring an enemy with a full sentinel assassin setup. 
---
you just opened a can off worms with that bong line.
---
you need to get ove the old metallity about smoking weed, and join us in the 21th century, 99% off the people I know that smoke weed is medical related myself included, and HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED Fallout ON WEED MAN!!!!!!
---
but seriously hitting a bong and been an asshole or jerk are not related at all, and for you to make the assumption that everyone that hits a bond as like him is totaly wrong. 
---
but hey whenever you want we can have a smoke session, I bet you will change your mind. 
---
This is a PVP from a company that doesn't know how to PVP if not in an arena. Illogic 200% in an open world with leveling limits (although you can be a BILLION lvl, you are just another 50)
---
you got the plan?
---
So why, when you're crafting, does it treat all your junk items in stash, as though you are carrying them? Doesn't make sense.
---
You can be attacked but you take no damage.
---
 Doing a "I have a gift for you" emote right before one shotting a TSE to the face is the most Fallout 76 thing I can think of 
---
i gotta sleep soon
---
How? I've gotten ambushed and lost and died a few times but I've never lost that many caps. 
---
If I'm getting ambushed I disengage, if I'm going into a losing battle I'd just cut my losses.
---
Running mods? If a mod edits your strings files (ie it edits game text) and the game updates, your game will still load the modded (and outdated) strings, which causes this error. Either update your mods, or if they haven't been updated yet remove them. 
---
I don't understand that. Like you aren't even getting rewards. 4 caps? A super mutant is worth more on average.
---
I guess some people just wanna murder defenseless players
---
Sorry about the miscommunication! 
---
You are right, I think Survival has a lot of potential but I feel what they should do is let people play the Beta for a few weeks, gather all the feedback then take it offline for a full release and implement the feedback and what the community wants. 
---
&gt;Well yeah a non PA player can have much higher defenses than a PA wearing player with the appropriate affixes on their armor
---
I don't see this lasting though.   You can't have a PVP mode where entire builds are completely useless.   There will inevitably be balance changes in the future.   
---
Bethesda did not miss this.   They have lunchboxes planned for the ATOM shop.  Someone dumped out the files and saw placeholders for them.
---
I'm addicted to replying, but I've stopped bothering at this point, but your comment was so weird reading it aloud in my head.
---
Never fast travel in survival. Spawn at your camp, and walk everywhere. 
---
Learned that real fast
---
If I've ever learned anything from DayZ. Shoot first, ask if theyre friendly after their dead.
---
It's a bug your supposed to be invincible for a time but it only works at vault 76.
---
And yeah 1 spawn point is just stupid it should be 10 to 15 random locations around the stations
---
Heavy weapons don't require 15 strength though, I do not think?  But I see your point in getting QOL weight reduction perks.
---
At 140+, I just find I dont pick up much at all.   Flux weigh too much to store, I think I got 10 of each only, but that's quite a bit of weight stored in stash.   So I never pick up flux either.  Only pick up legendaries that I might use, leave everything else.
---
Money is a fake concept in this game anyway. Caps appear out of thin air when you do quests and vanish when you sell to the vendors.
---
It was datamined that there were bronze iron and g8ld statues for your camp so maybe that eventually.
---
Same I have an inert bomb in my stash and I don't know were I found it but I think it is pretty neat so I kept it is there something neat you got
---
I use the gatling plasma. Its good for staggering but its not the most efficent killer, the wind up really hurts it but normally if I can get about 3 seconds of continuous fire it kills most players.
---
The wind up is a really big issue for those. Not to mention the reloading bug where you have to reload after every weapon switch.
---
TOO THICC üò§ü§§üò©üí¶
---
Bethesda: Blah blah blah ‚Äúfor the good of the game‚Äôs economy‚Äù blah blah blah.
---
Translation: We want you, people with jobs/family/friends/obligations/other interests, to play the game on a daily basis to earn caps and unlockables. Also, look at the newly released ivory grip skins for every weapon on the Atomic Shop! Better buy them all now, since they‚Äôre only there for 52 minutes! Buy atoms!
---
I wish we could stick weapons on display, even if it takes some of the build budget to do so, would be cool üòé. 
---
Most people I've seen lose a ton of caps keep going back to where they get killed. Usually into an ambush or versus someone with very good gear.
---
I think a lot of comments talk about the losses but don't cover the pick your battles mentality enough. 
---
I already saw a flute playing eyebot followed by some RadRats
---
Maybe I have a picture of it somewhere
---
What's the challenge? I could find any information about how to get it.
---
I love it, I incorporate the foliage into my home. But then I'm a messy kind of bloke.
---
I believe i do have an extra of those :) 
---
Even with a fresh start this would still be happening about now that people that grind would have reached level 120-130 already, most people clearly just want to play Survival so that they can kill other players, no matter what this subreddit (Only a small portion of the playerbase, after all) says. 
---
In Survival Mode you will. This guy is planning ahead.
---
Yeah I miss being able to decorate my settlement in fallout 4 plus with being overencumbered being able to pick up the heavy item and bring to a vendor to sell useless stuff then pick up the heavy item 
---
I kinda imagined this is why they made our characters transferable between both modes, not that I'd expect them to actually shut it down for a bit, but if they did, it would make sense in this case that, "we're just here to test the waters for them".
---
Sounds better as long as only the owner can take them.  I've never liked the 'go back and collect your junk' thing anyway.  You shouldn't have to go back to a location and search for a bag if you don't want to go back. Put it back in our inventories, Bethesda. It adds to the boredom.  
---
All good. A good month of testing and weekly feedback is what needs to happen. 
---
In Elite Dangerous we have something similar: don't fly without a rebuy :P
---
dont know what you mean by glitch, but y camp is a floating camp that I just did yesterday night.
---
No mate sorry, was sure i had
---
Even non TSE guns will shred you pretty fast. Handmades are awful to go against.
---
 Camp warnings aeem bugged. I rarely get them and when I do it‚Äôs far too late to stop anything. I can get them if I‚Äôm sitting on my porch from the molerat in my face but not when I‚Äôm down the street or across the map. It needs to be looked at some. 
---
Wouldn't the biggest clue be that we can revive after we die and go pick up the crap that we had on us when we died?
---
Otherwise maybe we are clones like in [Paranoia RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia_\(role-playing_game\))
---
Legendary farmers and power creep dudebros are going to scream murder if Beth nerfed their "Meta" fastest TTK setups.
---
Like, shotguns, auto rifles, single shot weapons, etc, etc.
---
Welcome to game balance.
---
Go to weekly challenges and one is labeled SURVIVAL CHALLENGE and there is a new weapon reward for every weekly challenge
---
Thanks
---
So far I'm level 9 in this mode. I don't mind getting 1 shot by level 200s, its a given. What pissed me off just now though was the fact that twice now a level 2 guy managed to 1 shot me with a fucking lvl 1 pipe revolver XD. The 2nd time I was even able to get at least 3 shots on him with my own revolver in sneak mode and only did about 30% of his health. I had to see it to believe it. Even the weapon level scaling is a disaster in this mode. 
---
As for the xp bonus. Its not so bad. I've managed to avoid the PvP hotspots and go to any event I can (where you take 0 PvP damage because everyone is forced to go pacifist XD). Manged to juke 2 level 200 X01 power armor users also at the end of the event who wanted to kill me. 
---
You don't. Beth hate workshops, so they scripted THREE Scorchbeasts to pop out at once and get bugged, break worskshop stuffs and send event signal so someone can fast travel on you and kill you.
---
Don‚Äôt forget that duping isn‚Äôt just about the weapons and armours. But also the caps it created. 
---
You just described a Gourmand, not a raider.
---
Ha
---
I was about to buy it earlier and was wondering the same thing
---
No, this is not the case.
---
They must have migrated for mating season?
---
Currently the bloodied Tesla rifle has been rising in the ranks as it kills squads and that‚Äôs the new meta is just squad kill. So anything that can kill squads + bloodied is god tier now.  
---
Nice, is there a tier list from S to lowest? Like where do rifles fit or shottys?
---
I would love any kind of sign with editable text.  Something you can just type your message into without using loads of budget to place many individual letters.
---
According to the roadmap they are skipping a week.   [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)  Next update is April 9.
---
Same here. In survival, killed at least two legendarys, one had a star, I hadn‚Äôt died, checked the challenge and it registered as zero still.
---
Going to be super pissed if Bethesda have released a limited time unique legendary that is bugged for some people. 
---
Totally disagree with the use of a Vault-Tec or Normal Lunch Boxes. The plastic and metal are not bio-degradable :D .  
---
Best gun for pvp as of now is the handmade bloodied explosive or anti armor explosive. Stealth sniping is strong vs the team kill meta and is widely used for spawn camping at stations shotguns are pretty bad as every one who is on pvp has wised up and equipped perks to negate limb damage and reduce explosive damage making aoe explosives pretty bad but better than melee I‚Äôve seen an increase in the demand for bloodied Tesla with fire rate or vats cost reduction. Spraying lightning in a heavy pvp area usually will kill every one as the thing has a good chain range and energy reduction seems to be good against the metal armors and has a fat fire rate to get around the max damage per shot. But a tier list doesn‚Äôt exist yet as people are still experimenting with the PvP damage buff/ rework and I suspect it will continue to change for a few days weeks. 
---
That‚Äôs not how it works. You can get attack if you own a workshop and someone contests your owned workshop. You can then fast travel to the owner and sometimes you can still pvp them. This is what they are meaning above maybe. So if you did not own a workshop then this is not the case for u 
---
I've never even seen a Radstag but I've fought like 200 mole rats
---
Where did they say new update next week? Next content will on 9 April so i guess the update will be in 2 weeks.
---
I‚Äôm glad the op lost his shit. Did you not realize what the new survival mode was, seriously. The patch notes specifically mentioned losing junk and a ‚Äúrandom‚Äù amount of aid items..... let me guess you lost a shit ton of serums too. Dumbass!!
---
This man cave looks more like a mans grave.
---
Ew.  No 
---
Sounds like a great idea I like it 
---
When I did,  she kicked me!
---
im down to roam around and have some fun. 
---
i will add you when I get out off work, I am on GE time so6 hours ahead off EST time.
---
Do you need to kill different types of legendaries? Cause I kept killing legendary super mutants and it only gave one. 
---
Nuclear Winter is us waking up in the Vault to the true ruined Wasteland. This is the new content with all new "important" quests. Wastelanders has us solving the issues (defeating whatever the hivemind is, fixing the rad storms with ATLAS, etc.) and bringing people back to the area.
---
Theory I've had from before the roadmap and it fits too well. Tinfoil Hat equipped!
---
Make character level account based. I wanna be level 500. 
---
Yea but CS:GO is also Death match shooter where round lasts 3 minutes and have no character progression behind it. F76 otherhand is MMO or looter shooter. If you want Fallout 76 be like CS:GO and have everyone same weapons- take away levels, take away perks, take away armors and make a map size of morgantown airfield, no half of that or even less and make each round last 3 minutes. And when game finishes put everyone back to main menu where they que to game if they want to play again.
---
No one is un- killable.....
---
nuke site in whitesprings, 
---
where ever you start just run around in a circle, i might take a few rounds but the will spawn. i did it 2 night ago and game out with 30 legen 1-3\* weapons/gear along with a ton of flux material. I didnt even did that long either maybe 45 minutes to one hour. 
---
Yeah, she's a loyal one.
---
Beth bad at math
---
My main is over level 200 but i still don't play the survival mode. I just don't like the fact that if you survive longer you are shown on the map and then everyone starts hunting you. This ain't Fallout so duck that. Hopefully this mode will die pretty soon and they can go back to creating PvE content.
---
I use a shotty myself, it‚Äôs pretty good. It‚Äôs not even bloodied and kills players with 2/3 hits
---
Do you ever get a prize for hide and seek? 
---
I agree, no one is entitled to anything. That's a fair point. However, I'll counter with... why tease us with these "rare" masks in the game and via promo materials and then make them nearly impossible to attain? If the event were to run for months, eventually we could get them with diligence and perseverance. With an event scheduled to run for only 7 days, there was effectively no way to get the masks using normal play methods. Bethesda just doesn't have their head on right. These masks shouldn't have even been shown in the game or in promo materials if they're not going to drop. I'm about this || close to calling the whole situation fraud.
---
Wow, that sounds boring. Camping overseers' camp to shoot noobs. Amazing
---
Problem is you have to be close and by that time your likely already dead every gun can be viable it‚Äôs just when compared to bloodied handmade it‚Äôs just bad why use anything else right now you can two tap anyone with a normal handmade from across the map its just gross
---
Okay I think I have that I‚Äôll have to check tho 
---
Yeah your a bit judge mental arnt you. Are you better than him because he smokes?
---
Ooh, that is nice
---
Its not, player vending machines are supposed to come sometime next month.
---
I think a cash register might be a cool decorative addition to our camps but i honestly doubt they will add an inventory functionality to it.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug. You lost double your level in caps, and a random amount of aid items. Both things are in the notes. 
---
It looks like you were just carrying way too many. 
---
Just change the bag colour to blue so we can all see them a lot easier... 
---
Probably most of us lost that much, because everyone knew that you lose only "some" and those who scared that you wont lose some, couldn't stash them. 100 stimpacks weight like 100 space, most of you didn't probably have that much space. 
---
I lost most of my super stimpacks. It is nice, now I have something to collect and do inside the game, but it is disappointing on Beth end. It just shows how poor quality they keep pushing out. I mean, when they say "some", they actually did "Most". When Beth says "We tuned weapons for PVP", in reality they only "Fixed 1 or 2".
---
I look forward to a few weeks from now where everyone doesn‚Äôt just instantly shoot first. But yeah, right now we are all just a bunch of murderers who don‚Äôt care about rebuilding America 
---
and don't get me started on "events" travel half way across the map to a lifeless event, thats the same kill/fetch quest for a stimpack , useless armor and scrap....
---
it's like they where trying to make a bad game. 
---
Downvoted why?
---
The vaults already are going to be raids and are actually quite scripted already just not enabled 
---
I dont want to re-open the endless talks about it. Just search this forum forum fun and nerf
---
There should be safe spawn points so you can at least load into the game and be given a chance... 
---
I have an extra one, and am on PC, but it is only a level 40 one, which I know isn't ideal. If you're interested though, let me know what you would be willing to trade for it.
---
I don‚Äôt have a bloodied explosive bu I have an executioners explosive and the first shot will drop them to like 30 percent health and then the second shot finishes them. I can only imagine a bloodied is even better. Will likely one shot even though that was supposed to be fixed I‚Äôve seen it happen if your below 80 percent health. Seems they just made t so one shot can‚Äôt drop you more than 80 percent health in a single hit. Two shot ignores this as the first one hits then the second shot deletes you essentially two tapping you in the eyes of the game.  The reason shotguns are not great as they can‚Äôt kill multiple targets as fast as the handmade can. Too slow rate of fire 
---
Maybe you are right. I think I will check back in another year or so
---
You can also make it so that you can send items out of survival but never in, so that you can still benefit your main from survival loot.
---
Honestly, what is with  Legendary Super Mutants and  running away? I chased one to the roof of the Watoga Emergency building a couple times..
---
I'm really only play the game for the combat and exploring. 
---
BARTIE!! BARTIEE!! BARTIEEEEEEEE!!!!!
---
I'm curious on this too, I've had it spawn as a Public Event a couple times, never found the boss as someone had already killed it,
---
then by all means do enjoy it. 
---
But for me you got the point right: It shouldnt be "serious". Meaning as soon as a game becomes a chore to me I stop playing. Why? Because it should be fun and not another point of "work". 
---
thats what i thought i would enjoy to, but i been to so many locations, and theres just nothing really to see other then another burnt town, theres nothing new.....FO 3/4 had stuff that was interesting to find. 
---
Ah, so that‚Äôs the reason, nice!
---
Kill 3 yesterday not one exploded.
---
I love the anarchy of survival. There's nothing quite as terrifying as seeing a level 200 jump over a building with an explosive gun, coming right for you. 
---
I had a Chameleon Deathclaw spawn down there once...I watched him through my sniper scope as he changed colours, was pretty cool.
---
I get that. For me, I love the aesthetic of the biomes and locations, and finding the hidden stories in places
---
Any recommendations as to how to obtain it effectively? In my experience it seems to bugged to an extent and doesn‚Äôt properly count legendary enemies even though that‚Äôs exactly what the challenge specifies..
---
based on your post i think your misstake was think that FO76 was going to be like fallout4. 
---
yes it looks like it and in someways it is very similar to fallout 4, but you have to remeber fallout 4 is not a online game. it is a stand alone game. 
---
FO76 is more like a MMO and you can not expect them to bring all the content they have plan on lunch, they need to keep us interested with new stuff for the longevity porpuses. 
---
I agree the story is dull at times and more often than none the story feels unfinished, but again that could be planned like that, for example the overssers quest it drive me crazy  that I have all the holo tapes but i cant finish it, but I have read and also thought that it was made like that for future content.
---
the thing I do not agree with is not been anything to do, their ton off things to do that are not quest related, discoring new places, farming plans for wapons/camp/gear/PA. i have over 200 hours on fo76 and im still far for doing everything. if you dont know were to start look here or do a google search, im sure you will find something you didnt knew it was there. 
---
20-30 hours in fallout 76 and you say thier is nothing to do or see, is just not true. like i said i have over 200 hours and im still finding new places or things to do. 
---
also try to play with some other ppl 99% of the time they are there to help, I know i do it all the time and its a hell off a time. 
---
I play on xbox, if you do as well hit me up my xbox ID is the same as here. 
---
Should be able to learn any weapon MOD that is in the game.
---
Sometimes it's like than a 1% chance to learn it though.
---
Bought it was such a bargain and manly got it for the shotgun canon for the character I'm playing now as I sold my tse shotgun to a vendee by mistake,lucky for me I got it back as the skin should take it off your weapon list while selling like the lever rifle.
---
Oh no! Another player killed me when I could have avoided him easily!
---
I have found.d super mutants will smash their way to generators.to destroy them.
---
That paint is amazing, hopefully they add some enclave paint to it. 
---
There is a camo PA pack now without the guns for 1k atoms :(
---
Absent Without Leave, military term.
---
I've heard it's a new glitch with a tinkers work bench. That's the sound and it's glitched. Something either it just doesn't stop or it has a larger radius of hearing, like crazy large. 
---
I'll join
---
perk cards are boost for the character not your stash box.
---
Sorry No I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was sarcasm or sincerity.
---
My apologies. Lately, I‚Äôve been arguing w/griefers, about their sense of entitlement.
---
My apologies.
---
True, but then you're forced to stash your junk at a weight disadvantage. Why aren't you forced to carry your junk when crafting?
---
were also gonna need a higher camp build cap lol
---
I joined 6other people on Hunter/hunted event. Killed most of them. When there was last three, i was looking for my target inside of chinese base under dolce mama. It was 19level guy that killed me from behind with few shots from hadmade. Get yourself automatic rifle, you can kill even 200level easily.
---
What is the red glow mean.  I've seen it a few times on the bots at the Fasnacht Parade.
---
You can have mine if you want I don't use it. 
---
Yeah I suppose that makes a lot of sense! :)
---
You only think you do. Radscorpions are terrible, terrible things. Sneakier than mole rats with the same magic tunneling ability and way more armor/defense.
---
There is a hell lot of PAs from previous games. It would have to be some storytelling work to not break the timelines but hell yeah tesla PA and those APA MK II
---
Thx for your answer. The range is indeed extremely large, sometimes it comes up when I am sure a Tinkers WB is nowhere near.
---
im down, xbox live ID is the same as here! lvl 80 here
---
They need to be at least 1* legendaries.  Simply saying Legendary isn't enough, they need the star(s).
---
I have the same critical hit quest. Have had it since before the update and have gone through a silly amount of beers after the update and it still won't complete for me. I've scored so many crits both in and out of vats and nothing seems to do the trick. 
---
That paint looks soooo cool!
---
Weren't crows suppose to be Institute spies originally? 
---
Would a bloodied gamma gun do any good? Or would that only be effective vs other bloodied builds?
---
I would actually prefer ants. Yes they are way are stronger, but they also worth more carry weight as food and alcohol.
---
500hours here.
---
Fallout 76 is basically i ever wanted. Oh man i spend so many days flexing in front of orgrimar in world of warcraft. Later playing TES and fallout games i thought it would be great mmo game.
---
I love progressing, killed scorchbeast queen over 100times, nuked many places, farmed plans, legendaries, plans.
---
I did play with my GF for few hours. She did not enjoy it so much as i do tho.
---
But yesterday we were in survival, she was enjoying it, but i was not, because i can't stand loosing so much things there.
---
So basicaly i played all those hours to get fancy dress and camp. 
---
God damnit Bethesda, thanks man
---
In my head i read all of those quotes in the voice of Codsworth üòÇ I absolutely agree with you, Helvetia was rather empty to begin with, and now it‚Äôs empty again. I had never visited before Fasnacht, and I likely won‚Äôt visit again until next year and I think that that‚Äôs just a shame. Besides, like you said, where did the robots vanish to?
---
I got mine doing leader of the pack on a newbie characters while leveling them up in survivor.  25th kill I did with higher level character for better level on the reward.
---
Tbh, it usually means someone near you is running PA with a targeting HUD, and the contagious targeting HUD bug is happening. Not sure that it's relevent to the robots exploding at all, but they could have a red glow if about to destruct even without that effect going on. Can't say i've noticed that, but i run targeting HUD on my toons, so they -always- have that. 
---
If it isn‚Äôt under ‚ÄúGrenades‚Äù you need to restart your system.
---
Higher lvl players on adventure will help you, believe me.
---
To get the most of melee i think it takes the entire 15 perk points 9 for the damage boosting ones and 6 for the armour pen and attack speed ones
---
Its 95% just for the carry weight aspect ti be honest, i use things like ordinance express level 3, bear arms level 3, martial artist level 3, bandolier level 3 and something else, so strait up thats 12 strengh points being used for those weight reducing ones but it allows me to carry so much more, the the 3 autp grenade launchers i carry, 2 fat mans ect...
---
You have your answer in the title,solo play 
---
Sold 60k thank you.  
---
That'd fucking suck.
---
Why ? :) 
---
Ha ha, same! Kill us all you want, for we have nothing to lose!
---
I'm not sure, but it wasn't said anywhere if it's the case. I was suspicious that it might just be in there and I didnt realize
---
so. fortnite?
---
L√ÇMP
---
At lvl16, I‚Äôd grind at wv lumber and head south, or..
---
Grafton, and head east towards penitentiary or steel mill or south at flatwoods.
---
Maybe . But there are no stairs to the first floor.. I jump on it with marsupial 
---
Yes indeed... He was really really sorry...
---
Teach us your ways oh wise sensei.
---
Selling it right now is a bad idea since pretty much everyone can just farm it.
---
Sell it in a month or so, there are always people willing to collect rare and unique items.
---
The more you wait the more money you can get.
---
I mean, it was pretty nice of bethesda to give us target rich enviroments like that. Probably a smart move to avoid being one of said targets though, yes. 
---
Aww bless you! When I have a full set I want can I hit you up for that? I‚Äôll pay caps! 
---
Totally agree, a most excellent idea, but will it happen? I hope it does.
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
"But why did you not just drop your stuff into your stash?"
---
A) My stash was full.
---
B) When they say drop "some" "random" items I was like that's fine, I can stand to drop "some" items but that was WAY more than I imagined and it was only the good stuff it dropped from my aid tab.
---
Not complaining about it, was a learning experience for all. Just saying that my definition of "some" was a lot less than theirs were :P
---
You can't take them with you. Tamed animals go to your camp - and sometimes, they just die on the way there. 
---
It's very broken anyone with explosive or two shot weapons 1 shot you before you can get close and then spawn camp you. Reguardless of what Bethesda says you are not immune to damage when respawning 
---
This is true regarding past level 50. Due to having more special slots, a Level 40 is def more powerful then say, a level 20. But whether you're level 50 or 500, you have the same special points. Hell, i'm almost scared to try and level up beyond 100ish due to me being scared to lose more than that in caps if someone uses the workshop pvp trick.
---
Berets value around 2k don‚Äôt they?
---
Its not all luck, there are markets you can use to obtain weapons you can buy low/mid tier ones, if you want something high tier you grind and farm increasing your chance with every 3* you get something worth trading I grinded till i got some furious explosive heavies and swing speed melees then traded from there. The more grind the higher your chance, so ofcourse somone whos never farmed before will ever get these weapons. Its a mix of skill effort and luck like when you want to achieve anything in life.
---
Irrelevant. I don't need duping to generate the amount of caps I need, and so does hundreds of other players. My easy limit is 10k daily without doing any farming nor survival PVP :P My point is that people were complaining a lot they stand no chances as their enemies all sported gear that they deemed "unfair" because of the fact it was commonly duped at some point, and its true, it was commonly duped at some point and commonly considered meta and best end-game gear, and this argument lost all of its relevance as a typical build that was based on this old meta has no reliable means of fighting the actual one, and the actual one does not seem to be based on gear that's expensive.
---
Why do we need silly cosmetic alterations when the dev's could be writing quests? I didn't realise this was Fallout: Fortnite. Leave the design to the designers 
---
People are gonna be singing 76's praises in one or two years. Mark my words. Bethesda has improved the game so much already, with many more months of fixes/content coming that have me excited
---
Happy to be heard! Thank you guys for responding, it's nice to know our input means something.
---
yeah it sucks, they should get away with the wieght from the raw materials and the stash problem would go away for the most part.
---
I would say saving the raw materail in the client side off things which i dont see a problem doing on the consoles but in PC will bring problems.
---
but i do believe that if they ever take the weight away from the raw materials will help with the stash problems, becuase every time i have to clear my stash to make space more than half is raw materials, and I dont keep more than 150 of each. 
---
Yeah same here, seems a common bug.
---
Can you also add which ones are and are not effect by perks? 
---
Yeah but respawn somewhere else. Or server hop if getting camped. Going back into a fight when you're getting camped and die before you can spawn or right after you spawn is a bad idea. 
---
Also two shot and explosive weapons don't give you more range just extra damage. There are also ways to reduce explosive damage pretty heavily. So if they are outranging you with them then they would outrange you either way. If you're losing straight up dps fights, then the TSE weapons probably are they reason. 
---
The power of TSE weapons are overstated, the sentinel and assassin builds are way worse. You can easily get kills with low level weapons, people have been running with new characters just for the challenge. 
---
Getting the jump on someone is really valuable thats one reason spawn campers are so effective. 
---
Seems like there is an intentional hole in all all godlike builds. Seems each has it‚Äôs own ‚ÄúDeath Star reactor‚Äù. 
---
I figure anyone who chose to learn has reached this conclusion.
---
I did wonder if the dartboard was functional, I want it, but only if it is useable.  
---
And while you're at it, can you make the nixie alarm clock display the correct time. Pls.
---
I hid in a prison for over an hour lol 
---
I was like "I don't get I.."
---
Then the penny dropped. 
---
really ? iv havent seen them.sell.for 2k  seen them from 500 to 1k
---
If I broke into the mine you lived in since the bombs dropped, killed everyone you knew, and then ate them, what would you call me?
---
I'm not cooking them, I am chowing down without a frown.
---
So what happens in 3 months time when there will be the massive level difference again? 
---
Definitely! Then it would be more skill based than anything else.
---
I hear you, makes a lot of sense.  I guess I kind of like a bit of a challenge, the one shot stuff is getting a bit silly to me but that‚Äôs cause I don‚Äôt one shot anything.  I think I may just be safe and go with assassins sentinel with a few perk boosts and see what happens.  
---
I made one outside of Helvetia for the parade.. it was fun! 
---
I think somewhere around top of the world would get traffic. Around that pleasant valley station sort of area.
---
You are right about one thing  and that‚Äôs this debate lost meaning.   You keep believing in what justifies what‚Äôs going on. And don‚Äôt respond cuz I‚Äôve got better things to do than to back and forth your logic. ‚úåÔ∏è 
---
Sadly, blackbird is about the most enclave-y PA paint we have right now, and thats still more SR 71-y than anything else.
---
...I really want proper Enclave paint already, the BoS have about 5 ffs..
---
i support the Idea of having better rewards for killing someone.
---
but lossing everything its a little extreme, yes after all its your choice to play that mode.
---
But i for one wouldnt be playing it, i do play pvp and I enjoy it, even if it means getting my new character lvl 7 blown away by a 100+ lvl character.
---
but losing everything, then I would be rolling around with a pipe pistol, aid full of spoiled food and nothing else. 
---
but putting in the line gear that litteraly took me 100 of hours to get, no thank you. 
---
You have saved me some Atoms. I was eyeing that up for my brewery C.A.M.P.
---
Yes to this.
---
Terrible idea. People need to be able to build characters in adventure mode to have a chance in survival. If everyone had to start fresh in survival, what chance would a level 5 have against level 50+ a month from now? The people that are in at the beginning will just dominate indefinitely.
---
'What next! You are made of metal!?'
---
If you are using heavy weapons, try and focus on one of them.  With Auto Grenade Launchers, bandolier wont help that.  Only if you got something like a minigun or gatling.   Even then, check out the weight you are actually saving by bandolier and compare it to something like the extra damage from crits.   Not sure where the stagger perk is for heavy weapons but definitely get that one.
---
I honestly think that weapon is perfect for pistol crit builds. 
---
I'm still analyzing how come the invisible bloodguy who shredded my gang alone did not die from my gamma gun. I suppose my set did not allow me to get in range to actually place the hits correctly, as he was a guy who took three automatic bullets (nonVats, I suppose, but I gotta check it out) and used these three bullets to shred me in less than a second, so I guess its not even him being invincible, just me being outplayed.  
---
Also, my working theory is that certain weapons were given advantage against certain effects. I can't be sure as you know, the math changes were not explained at all, but there is a subset of weapons that people say work just as good as they worked, no buffs, but they seem much more dangerous against me now, and there's a subset of weapons that were commonly considered thrash, that still don't do me anything, and that somehow shred the typical sentinel builds to pieces in a second by just good-old-regular shooting.
---
Nah see i specialise in weight reduction perks so i can carry a wide variety of death, .50 cal is probably my main weapon but for groups the grenade launchers works well
---
That's really not a bad idea, I basically used this theory last night by hanging out in a large indoor area so they couldn't see exactly where I was.  
---
Pretty hard for someone to get on level 100 like this, don‚Äòt you think? They would be leading the list, and people would gang up on them, just to get his/her loot - don‚Äòt you think ? 
---
Did you even read the whole post? The level difference is marginal because of the damage boost to low levels, the power creep is only from duped items making it into survival. Duped items includes the xp to pefect builds, op armor and weapons that are too common to be justified as fairly gained (tse ass/sent) duped mutation serums so everyone has every mutation under the sun. All those combined make a veteran player smash any new player even if the new player is 200 lvls higher.
---
Then he'll succeed.
---
You can server hop at the Overseer's camp and hope to find him.  
---
On spawn, the location is just down the street to the left, by the truck.  
---
If he's there, his booth will be very obvious.
---
sure thing! though you don't need to pay me caps, i'll do it for free
---
Got mine from Gram
---
So DLB likes to give it out but can't take it? Typical bully stereotype, all mouth and little action.  
---
This is mainly why I dislike PvP in games, it can empower the wrong kind of people and others suffer because of it.  
---
I rarely accept invites to team up, I wander Appalachia alone mostly, but I will admit to coming across more friendly players than unfriendly.  
---
So far I am pretty happy with FO76, well apart from the occasional disconnect or two.
---
Ew. 
---
Where do you see the similarities ?
---
Pst! My thoughts on nuka cola quantum:   
---
* Make it tasting like lemon.
---
* Make it glow under a blacklight using chinin.
---
* Iconic neon blue colour should not be hard to archieve.
---
* DO NOT FORGET SAFETY ADVICES (as not to mix it with alcohol or to not consume it with that as chinin can cause a reaction that will take people into a coma.  
---
It is quite simple to get that. I am honestly surprised no one did make something like this comercially yet.
---
I saw a Mr Handy last night with a single file line of mongrels following it. Similar to this.
---
My first thought was "Huh, must be some kind of event spawn"
---
My second thought was hurling frag grenades. 
---
I'm one of the best long range throwers, like, I like climbing towers, killing scorched who are 2 squares away, but I can't hit shit when it comes to close range, and when I tell my friend "Oh I killed this guy that's 50 meters away, they don't believe me, this is a way I can prove I'm the best make this happen
---
Irrelevant again and hence you are now blocked.
---
How about this one? ;)

Pretty hard for someone to get on a level like this, don‚Äòt you think? They would be leading the list, and people would gang up on them, just to get his/her loot - don‚Äòt you think ? 
---
No it doesn‚Äôt and this is the point I‚Äôm making. Good to know about the icon in game though.
---
New mode was basically made for masochists and guys with TSE
---
Shoot the legs and stand way back,kill if he don't blow up proced to loot dead body,was capping myself in case it did go boom as I've had this problem last patch.
---
With every increase they've done to the stash box they always say they will keep increasing it in the future. They always need to keep server stability in mind which is why they didn't make it a massive amount in the first place. Just give it time and manage your space. 
---
Probably thats why its called Beta Survival so we can feedback all of that to devs
---
I have a Ryzen CPU and Charlestown was off limits for me ( as above ). Some SBQ events don't work but I have made some adjustments to the game settings recently ( from a post on here ) and it is going better. The game will still bug out occassionly from simple things ie fast travel or food consumption. etc.
---
But today I launched my first nuke and the game hung in all the way and completed the SBQ event after running the silo for an hour.
---
Nope, the only way to get the skin to stay is from the SB drop. They did fix the garahann mining spawn for like, one patch, since i got mine there. But then it broke again &gt;&lt;
---
Its still a bad design you can defend it all you want lol idc
---
Only safe way to do so I think, is to be at your camp when you join. So if it's survival, you have less chance of being insta-ganked and can leave.
---
So am I not allowed to complain when I start the game spawning at the vault on a new character only to be immediately killed? How about when that's done to me over and over including when changing server? Tell me how exactly that seems in any way an OK way to play the game. 
---
They could use the same radius they use in hunter/hunted. 
---
Indeed it is lol
---
The only one new recipes that are effected are the drinks that were in the game prior to the update such as  Nuka dark and the named beers like old opossum 
---
That and player vending should help with freeing  some space up.  I‚Äôm twiddling my thumbs waiting... getting close to that stash limit. Haha
---
Thank you
---
This would be great, especially without legendaries
---
I hate reading garbage like this. If they wanted to "build something with us" dont release something so insanely broken you could LITERALLY CRASH A SERVER BY CRAFTING TOO MANY ITEMS.
---
No unfortunately not.
---
/**Grunts*/*
---
The fact that you say "the story is almost non-existant" tells me that you never even invested yourself into it. This game has an abundance of story telling. It may not be as direct and in your face like the other Fallout games but it is definitely there. 
---
You know its going to happen though. So plan for it. This shit is the "content" we aren't getting. Figuring out what bugs get introduced and playing around them.
---
When Todd god was selling the game the way he described it was cool as fuck. The tension of that first PVP video was really cool. I figured that‚Äôs what Bethesda was going for again with Survival mode.. but I really feel that min maxxed legendary stuff takes that feeling away. Perks are one thing but legendary effects really take it way over the top.
---
I have a couple setups like that and are strong af but I don‚Äôt have much fun just shitting on someone stacking percentage bonuses and all that. But I‚Äôve had a good amount of scraps without that stuff on either side and it was fun as HELL. Idk man, maybe this game is just not for me. lol 
---
Pump Shotgun is NOT A WEAPON IN FALLOUT 76. It's called a Pump-Action Shotgun. Probably some stupid shit like that with labels in their code that broke it.
---
She a ho.
---
OH SHOOT. Frick what will I do with this epic gamer response.
---
Survival against the environment is PVE.  Survival VS Players is PVP.  This mode is primarily a PVP mode.  So I would rather it stay PVP
---
Yep, will need the space for my hundreds of stims and meat, always need to stay prepared üòÄ
---
Lol one that didn't realise and read the vault notes first.
---
I lost like 15nuka cola and all my meds
---
Case in point would be no mans' sky. Bad release, basically what fo76 did, releasing an unfinished product. And now it's improved and promises made were delivered, albeit much later than release date. 
---
I wouldn't doubt Bethesda would be able to save this game from what they've already done so far. 
---
The reality though is the game could've been so much more well received if Bethesda hadn't rushed releasing the game. The game could improve but the damage to this title is already done and irreparable. It's really tragic. 
---
Pcmr are just better at convincing the wife to stop worrying about the bills.  
---
Consoles have a lower entry cost, I can get a second hand xbone for less than the price of the video card in my kids machine.  
---
But it does mean a lower financial threshold for toxic wankers to be in your game environment.
---
I hear that the lighter the armor the vetter and easier it is to stealth. Keep in mind also shadowed mods on armor.

---
I loaded into it yesterday on joining through Xbox gamer tag and poo my pants managed to quickly quit, nearly did an Xbox power off haha l had a heap of junk on me!
---
Well I don't know about a level 5 but I was killing level 80+ players on a level 15 using a spiked boxing glove and all the mutations.
---
What's wrong? I feel like a helmet plan shouldn't be to much
---
I'm about 400 hours in and it gets dull for me at times. Then sometimes I log in and it just gets interesting because you never know what will happen this session. I mainly look for SBQ events - that's my main interest. Also looking for Legendary weapons etc. You can have boring days though.
---
I think this is actually one of the unofficial directives of the new mode tbh.
---
The notion of camping has grown into building mini mcmansions and farm houses. None of which easily transport.
---
I'm backing having a simple camp where everything can be transported in one.
---
Just wait till mods are available, then everyone can have glowing paper bags, and glowing meat piles (imagine living the dream of being able to find everything you kill at a SBQ fight).
---
Explosive work really well on heavy gunners versus sentinels, it helps make more of your shots connect which maximizes your 12% stagger chance. 
---
The hopping bunny thing really makes it hard to aim though. Honestly they should just make jumping remove sentinel and it would be much better.
---
You get randomly 1 to 600 seconds to loot it before BOOM!  Take your chances!  Its like Russian Roulette!
---
Then we bow down to our cat masters.
---
Man I love this quest too. Sucks I rarely see it. 
---
me too. when I arrived in the top three in the standings I took refuge in a closed place, so as not to be directly identified
---
Neat thing that pacifist mode stays on in survival as well, took me couple deaths to notice. I'm definately staying in adventure. For me the whole mode is a total disaster. Sounds like you had worse time than me testing it though
---
5 lead, 15 steel for about 30 rounds if i remember correctly. So not a lot and since the gauss rifle is a slow firing gun people won't need thousands of 2mmEC. They're also heavy as heck.
---
Personally i would only buy this ammo if it's 0.25 caps/round or less.
---
It also happens with respawns after death, not just fast travel.
---
Ok cheers
---
Yeah I did a similar thing with my friend. He could barely 3 shot a level 10ish scorched and he was dealing like 20% damage to me in full max t60 armor!
---
I never denied it was bad design. 
---
I'm not defending it, I'm looking at it more rationally. Yes combat is unbalanced it has some issues but its not like having a TSE weapon is an insta-win. 
---
My original comment was stating we need to differentiate between bad design and bad player decisions. 
---
The ability to die before you spawn in is bad game design. Going back repeatedly after you keep getting killed is bad player decision.
---
Right now you should never fast travel in survival, walking is the safest option. They need to fix that. But blaming Bethesda for you losing 10,000 caps because you insisted on fighting a losing battle doesn't help the conversation or the game.
---
First time I saw them the protectron asked me to protect them until they got to a safe sanctuary. It had a quest marker but didn't work. I've seen them since and then they are just walking around.
---
It‚Äôs the only price I see offered or requested so far. I‚Äôm on PC though. Power to you though, buy em up!
---
You need the all three lock picking perk cards to be able to lock the stall door.

Bee harvesting, good loot, i got a handmade.

Fucking savage. Use some slightly damp oak in your fire and it gives a very smooth smokey taste.
---
-.-
---
Do you know some good spots where I can find tamable animals? The only ones I know are the lake at extreme north east of the map, the bridge at north of treetops and the road between crevasse dam and dyer chimical plant. Can I tame animals pacifiable with wasteland whisperer like radscorpion? 
---
100% bullshit, the new meta does not use the duped gear but shred though old meta.
---
For me the true game is finding nice places to build camps, and going with the flow of the game through the main updates. I suppose in this way there really isn‚Äôt an end but a continuing story. 
---
I have just reached the main story line‚Äôs last quest since first playing during the beta, basically milking my time through each quest. Not to mention the surplus of side and misc. quests I‚Äôve yet to do.
---
I‚Äôve loved the building mechanic since fo4. Creating camps in bizarre and clever places is a lot of fun for me. I find laying down foundations and decorating to be somewhat therapeutic. 
---
I agree that there really isn‚Äôt an endgame, and additional content comes in slow waves for this game. After a two month hiatus I picked 76 up again for the Fasnacht event, and managed to play the booze quest as well. Been playing since.
---
Overall it‚Äôs really up to the player. Depending on what you want to get out of playing. I believe that Bethesda has laid down a great foundation for letting your imagination and creativity take the reigns of the ‚Äústory,‚Äù or in this case your head canon. 
---
I‚Äôm sure once I get burned out again, the next big update will be enough to have me return to the game over incremental periods of time. 
---
4 stars Legend Sledge there.
---
ok..yeh i  notice prices differ between platforms
---
I got the dead deathclaw vendor 3-4 days ago.
---
What's the new meta? You made a post about it and never stated what it was.
---
If you're going to make claims that your new build is vastly superior at least give others the information to verify this information.
---
Yeah, but usually the body lands after the explosion, this one just vanished, no pieces, arms, legs, torso, etc, nothing.
---
TSE + assassin/sentinel is currently 3rd tier of items and their prices will drop hard as they became often irrelevant for PvP.
---
I am fairly certain that is not the case as explained in this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a62apk/updated\_weapon\_mod\_spreadsheet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a62apk/updated_weapon_mod_spreadsheet/)
---
The spreadsheet given there does list Black Powder Rifle Large Bayonet as having a medium chance to learn, but the entry is strange given that it is listed as "Black Powder Rifle Large Bayonet" instead of "Black Powder Rifle", and not learning it in 30 scraps does not seem like a medium chance.
---
Realistic cat AI.
---
I‚Äôm not sure of the bloodied effect on. The gamma gun I‚Äôve seen people use it and delete bloodied builds but I would assume it would be pretty weak versus everything else. 
---
I think they gotta have things pre-approved by some officials before putting it out to the public. Either way though I think it might just be a day or so for it to come out again. 
---
Clearly we play at different times. If you know what time you‚Äôll be on Saturday I can make arrangements to be on as well. What time zone are you in and do you know if you‚Äôll be on at a specific time? 
---
Not since the start of beta, no, and that was the whole game. Sounds like you're gonna have to reinstall. Wierd that validate isn't repairing tho. You opened a ticket / poked bethesda support about this ? 
---
I think stimpacks could be an issue they were forseening. They already nerfed them only allowing one at a time. 
---
I think they were trying ro avoid a situation in which players are spongy and it takes some time to kill them where both players just keep popping healing items until one runs out. Leading to super long drawn out slogs. 
---
But right now its the other side of the problem where everyone feels like they are made of paper.  
---
I think it'll be hard to find the right balance so they might be taking a more gradual approach, but right now I think most people can agree the quick pace of combat isn't super interesting, and could be done better.
---
Yeah let‚Äôs add others variables like there are not enough in the game right now!
---
Nope, there was zero delay between taking the shot and the robot exploding. Unless I've been running an explosive black powder pistol without noticing.
---
Not OP but according to a Wikipedia article on luminol, about 30s, so it's short lived.
---
You words fall on deaf ears. 
---
Regular scorched beasts wings don't count for hit boxes unless in vats and I cants recall if its the for the queen.
---
So If in vats yes other wise aim for the body or face
---
In my 300+ hours I have not seen one sentinel or cavalier piece so how do some players have a full set? I get loads of assassin, bolstering and unyielding but none of these others...why?
---
You could take this one step further and say No Mutants.....in PVP
---
this! or at least provide an option to toggle on/off ..
---
Its kinda human paranoia that plays a part in it. Shoot first before they do, its a sad consequence of systems like this thats gonna be hard to break.
---
Not too sure how to resolve this issue. Try to fill out a ticket.
---
I don‚Äôt think they made a bad game. I think that they made a good game, and provided a great platform for us to expand on. I can see this game evolving as time goes on. It already isn‚Äôt the game I played during the beta. 
---
I like to see it as a series of tests on what happens when you let all these players out onto the wasteland and do their thing. You have raiders, farmers, and traders, people taking on these roles as they play. 
---
Maybe they can learn from these ‚Äútests‚Äù and implement them into another game in a better way in the future. Who knows. The game isn‚Äôt bad. I believe some of it has to do with your imagination.
---
When you put it that way, consider radiation a slow cooker. ;)
---
‚ÄúChowing down without a frown‚Äù....
---
Lol! üëçüëçüëç
---
If you can‚Äôt lock someone, they might be doing the chameleon glitch, they might appear invisible to themselves but not always others, that could explain why you couldn‚Äôt lock on him.
---
Even if you leave the area it should still trigger as completed of the mob is killed. Unfortunately this only happens to SB who get distracted when They are supposed to travel directly to the workshop. 
---
1. Yes. Two-shot is terrible with VATS. I'm stashing all of my Two-Shots to sell to other people, it's simply not worth using them with VATS.
---
2. Engage combat and try again. It should work. 
---
3. Change bAllowCreateGrass = 1 to bAllowCreateGrass = 0 in your ini files. I don't think it's something bethesda can fix. Some people are using it to gain more frames/second. 
---
Also the advantage given by glowing bags mods or removing grass is not as big as you might think. The red glow is from Berry Mentats and it highlights living targets for 5 min. With or without grass you're still being highlighted. 
---
Paper bags are marked on the map so with or without glowing bags someone can find your bag if they want to.
---
Make it happen bethesda.
---
In-universe, they use a non-toxic radioisotope to make it glow
---
I don't know what this regrow bit is your on about, but if you're saying you can't pick a nuked flora right after your friend or whoever, that's wrong. My team and I go out together to gather flux all time and point out the plants to one another so we can all pick them. There's no waiting, unless it's for someone to get out of the way. 
---
But, you're absolutely right about checking the bodies and piles at Whitesprings or any nuke site, really. They often do not load in the good stuff until people have moved on. 
---
TSE power is overstated.  They are strong but not an insta-win button.  Getting an ambush on someone is really important and never fast travel to anywhere public. Right no the invincibility isn't long enough and you can get spawn killed. 
---
Explosive weapons are strong but also easily countered, dense chest mods and fireproof will cripple them. 
---
I've got plenty of kills using a supressors gatling plasma, and a furious laser rifle. I have a TSE gatling plasma, I don't tend to use it a ton because it normally ends up killing/hurting me with the splash, and its accuracy is noticeably worse.
---
Won't it just be vendor machines?
---
I would love a good counter, like the DLC ones in Fallout 4, and a cash register to put on top.
---
It's quite a rush doing that event. I always love doing it even though I have done it many times. :)
---
The same algorithm to calculate your caps lost applies to lowbies as well.
---
We lose the same amount as lowbies in survival 
---
My best guess on these freezes is garbage collection. A standard process which runs to dispose unused assets in memory. If you notice (at least for me) the lag spike occurs with absolute peak CPU usage. And at relatively regular intervals
---
That would be Permadeath mode, not survival mode.  
---
Also im really against the idea of losing everything which i could have had gather over months spent in a game where a few lucky drops to a guy that has been playing the game for a couple days.
---
But there's a war going outside and I'd loose my advantage. I planned to share knowledge once I assert domination. I'm a knowledgeable pushover right now.
---
The truth is that I got onto the traces of that build while trying to fall asleep. Laid down on midnight, been thinkig four hours before managed to fall asleep. I still gotta test that, but these are my findings related to this build:
---
Explosive is a hinderance. Chameleon is often irrelevant for stealthy guys. Sentinel and cavalier are useless for that build. The vast majority of the math is done on prefix level, and unyielding + endurance seems to be the foundation onto which these guys are based. Sneak is much more complicated that commonly believed and does not need a stealthboy to negate vats. Pellets based weapons and automatic rifles are the king, each of their own kingdom.
---
I assume you already checked the map menu? Besides that I really don't know as I play on pc. Hopefully you find a solution. 
---
Happened to me a few months bk, launcher couldn't detect game so was using the .exe to launch, worked for a few days then that stopped launching it too.  Only way around it was a fresh install.  
---
Right click on player via the map
---
Block per session and block permanently are available 
---
Yelled in mutie voice watching you die !
---
No! No! we have to stop the spread of plastic in the world!
---
Actually, wait, this is a game so does not matter, in a post nuclear world, so we are already poked, even though it is virtual plastic.
---
I fully agree!
---
It is but lets be honest who‚Äôs running a pistol crit build?
---
Keep in mind that at a vender it is called "Level gun" a tad bit misleading but understandable non the less. 
---
This duped armor makes you a freefrag for the guys that play it right so "omg duped gear" argument is irrelevant by now.
---
Oh... Guess I have to find another weapon I guess :(
---
Yeah I know how to remove grass, just didn't want to go this far for PvP, guess I have no choice as well
---
By engage combat you mean like shoot a bullet then try again V.A.T.S?
---
Thx btw &lt;3
---
Four thousand dollars! Can i talk you down to a few bucks and a piece of warm gum.
---
Yeah I could I still hope someone just will sell it.
---
No thank you sir 
---
I don't know about this glitch, so a player could be using chameleon even if I do see him?
---
Worth a shot
---
Yup. I do believe you're right. 
---
If you block them they can‚Äôt hurt you 
---
Had some lowbie sniffing around my camp asked him over mic what‚Äôs up what he wanted 
---
No response? Blocked 
---
He was attempting to look around my camp so I server hopped
---
How many caps will I lose on death at level 15? I have 1400 caps I don‚Äôt want to just lose them all.
---
Sadly yes, you can still kill them, just can‚Äôt vats them.
---
The ones that don't laugh...are the broken ones.
---
Because they're dead...
---
Sad to watch, but I'm 100% with him. Really wanted to like it but higher level characters(esp with TSE) and leaderboard visibility killed it totally. This is deathmatch, not survival.
---
New mode-specific character would be all that it needs, and some fixes to protection after events and spawning.
---
Fun fact though: as level 6 character I was able to take half HP of 150 lvl TSE player before he one shotted me, just with my unmodded 10mm pistol. Level difference didn't seem much of a problem.
---
That would be great as an additional minigame so we can actually put our well decorated camps to good use other then using the workbenches :D
---
No one wants a deathmatch game mode, We wanted a PvP Fallout 76 and we now have it. Albeit a currently unbalanced beta version but IF Bethesda listens to the PvP community we should be able to sort that out.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Great video, could do with being reposted with a better title. Not sure many people click on videos that just say "Great Video". Mention MATN by name in the title, people know who he is
---
Oh my... Thx
---
So you‚Äôre not playing Fallout 76 but your replying about to posts about Fallout 76 griefers?
---
There are lots of nice combinations of effects other than TSE, don't worry too much. 
---
And yeah, hit your target once, trigger vats and finish him. The one time i tried it it worked.
---
*ptsd flashbacks to this morning when all the potectrons spawned legendary and died in the area I was standing near the vendor*
---
Other people have said it, but I‚Äôm going to reinforce it: you‚Äôre a moron for carrying that many and this is entirely your fault. 
---
I saw a horde event for them as well, but it was mole rats or wolves (can‚Äôt remember which) when I got there. 
---
There nothing I‚Äôd love more GT Vincentblackk 
---
Yeah i dont get people complaining , my armor-piercing sniper rifle is doing excellent work against overleveled snipers and im only like level 17.
---
really? I only had time to do the event once and apparently got it first try, i dint knew its that rare.. o\_O
---
It would be cool if they were occupying Helvetia instead of the Scorched, it'd keep that road clean for travelling from Morgantown to Charleston. 
---
I hate reading your garbage. If you don't like the game don't play it and let people enjoy it if they do. 
---
We can't expect perfect games nowadays, least of all online games. There are bound to be issues that won't show up in a controlled environment. Obviously you start to see faults if you have players who do stuff in the game that devs didn't expect. Also, the engine never supported more than one player character before. They pretty much made that clear from the get go. 76 was and still is an experiment. But that doesn't mean that people can still enjoy it. I very much enjoy the game because I know that I can expect bugs and I won't throw a fit about it.
---
Thanks guys! All of this has been useful. Even the grumbling ;) Don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt do this sooner 
---
I did not had Pacifist enabled. I think it was "no damage" time after death. So both of us could not do/take any damage for some time.
---
After Paladin is Elder.   And I am prettt sure that is the end in Falloit 76 for now at least. 
---
I‚Äôve added you all. I swear the Xbox clubs thing is just as empty. I‚Äôve joined a bunch of them and never met anyone. The layout is also a bit of a mess. Grumble grumble 
---
buying stuff ? what is this ?
---
surely you mean finding stuff thats laying on the ground 
---
What is this buying stuff ?
---
caps are meant to be handed over to your betters in survival mode.
---
This morning only 10people was playing survival in europe, cause in 30minutes of server hopping i was every time on same server with them. It is death anyway haha.
---
It's a receiver so it modifies the base damage before your perks and legendary effects. However, it's additional damage should be modified by those perks and effects.
---
Na from what I heard is that theres 6 total 
---
yea, I tried to get back into it after the "booze" update. It's still a laggy mess. Crashed to DT in the middle of Uranium Fever. Any setting I try it runs about 9 FPS, which is awful. I've tried the settings fixes I'm learned from googling the problem but it hasn't improved in that regard. 
---
All they've done from my perspective is increase Stash size to appease the hoarders, and made changes to stem the tide of duping, which is a good thing.
---
it would be almost imposible to get to lvl 100 if you lose everything everytime someone kills you, it would be fun for a monment or too but after that not so much.
---
 I see ppl at the end not even bothering with it or just using stuff they dont want to keep. I think some ppl will still play but not many for the simple fact of lossing everything will get some ppl not playing or even stop playing at all, not good for business. 
---
as far as gangin up that happens now, intentionally or not. I have done it, saw 3 ppl fighting it was 1 vs 2 and i just waited on the distance, i killed 2 of the 3. so ganging up is already happening.
---
like I said I agree with you as far as givin better/more rewards per kill, but loosing everything, I still think its a little too extreme. I would be ok with it if the stuff i would be loosing i can get back easily but that is not the case. 
---
I also think the cap reward should be adjusted to everyone above lvl 50 a set 100 caps per death, and everyone else below 50 then double the lvl on caps. 
---
It just came out. And it‚Äôs a beta.
---
The PvP floodgates opened and a lot of people are catching the current and joining in the killing fun. In a week or two it will die down. I don‚Äôt love it‚Äôs current state either but I totally get it. 
---
I'm level 170 with 300+ hrs and farm random encounters pretty regularly. The other day I came across one I've never seen. It was a responder body with a note that triggered a misc quest to retrieve a weapon from Uncanny Caverns. Have you heard of that one?
---
I'm glad that different play styles now have somewhere to go that suits their sensibilities.
---
So the third option? Good
---
There is one Unique weapon in the game that has a skin like this, The Meteorite Sword, it looks like a normal Chinese officer sword when you first look at it, but when you hold it out as an actual weapon, it's glowing orange and the handle is practically on fire, it looks amazing, it just sucks that it's stuck at level 25 so is practically unusable 
---
Are you complaining because people do PVP on a PVP server?
---
Yea, not touching Survival until this gets fixed.
---
I hope they do some tweaks to it though because there is pretty one build you can have if you don‚Äôt have it then you just have to avoid combat at all costs.
---
so that's only 35% which is a random amount.. i find it amusing that everyone was making fun of the PvE people about "its the wasteland, suck it up" and now there are all these threads whining about, too much aid, too many caps, this isn't fair, etc etc. you all got what you asked for and now what you got isn't what you want.. plus it was just released. give them time to tweak the mechanics 
---
'Good job' to you and to the Level 190.  He was a troll trying to re-inflate his ego by running back to the Adventure server.  Glad he got an attitude adjustment.
---
Just go in with no caps or aid and you have nothing to lose. 
---
Yeah, another bastion of civilization would be good. Yeah, they're robots, but y'know.
---
It's a shame their weapon systems are reprogrammed to shoot confetti at hostile lifeforms.
---
amen
---
There is really only one good playstyle i this mode and thats camping with sentinel/unyielding with a TSE shotgun
---
Couldn't have said it better. Though to be fair, the community got much better after all the haters jumped the train early on. I love that there are plenty of people who stuck with it throughout the hard times to see it become better. Of course, 76 was a risky experiment what with the singleplayer engine and all. But I didn't buy the game and expect it to be flawless. It's Bethesda, after all :P
---
I for my part appreciate your post and the hopeful words. You have my upvote.
---
Yea, i think the same about the map, that no one can see were players are, exept if they have a bounty on them, then perhapa it han show a large area were that player might be in
---
I think you‚Äôd end up with people setting up unraidable turret bases where they farm xp all day, so no I don‚Äôt think it would be very hard to get to that level and then make it a toxic game mode for new players. These high level players would team up and control the xp farming spots and not let any lower levels farm whitesprings or west Tek. 
---
You made some good points but I think you went a little too far with your idea. A game mode with no legendaries could be fun but the perma death thing sounds like way too much of a grind the way the progression in this game is set up. 
---
Yeah but we shouldn‚Äôt have to dump all our stuff to another account to be willing to play a gamemode
---
It‚Äôs a suggestion sir, it‚Äôs meant to expendable.
---
\^ This.
---
That logic is rather flawed, been put into same server in adventure mode 3 times today yet I doubt there's only 15 or so people playing.
---
I agree, a simple emote of a present or something isn‚Äôt that hard 
---
Not sure why you would want to get Leggos in Survival but the massive killing will die down in a few weeks and even more so when they fix and possibly add in multiple spawn locations to train stations.
---
I don't see any huge issues with Survival mode a part from spawn camping. 
---
I am annoyed by VATs but that's more a moral issue with me and more of a Fallout mechanic to Bethesda. I personally would've loved if new characters were a requirement. But unfortunately it's too late to look back on that. 
---
No I like pvp but this gamemode is a cap sink for low levels with bad loot and free caps for people with TSE shotguns and sentinel/unyielding. It doesn‚Äôt matter how expensive that combo is they‚Äôll make the caps back anyway in this gamemode in a week
---
I used the rad puking then help, then the rad puking emote (because I couldn‚Äôt find rad away for 8 levels) and some guy dropped stimpaks and waved. I wanted radaway! Smh
---
Its just disappointing the only valid strategy is camping with sentinel/unyielding and a TSE shotgun
---
Me too.  I never join teams. I just enjoy chatting with new people, sharing information, fighting a few battles with them and moving on.  Sometimes we help each other and show each other our CAMPs and that makes me feel good too. Different mind-set.  
---
Not sure about the pose, but for the emote to show up, you need to open the emote wheel and go to the one about looking for a group. Then press "Q" (or whatever the keybind is) to extend the tile and switch it to "taking a picture". Since the emote wheel only has limited space, emotes with a similar theme are grouped.
---
What are you gonna do with all the caps?
---
It‚Äôs really just the spawn camping that‚Äôs egregious. At train stations you‚Äôll get got before you‚Äôre even loaded in enough to move. 
---
Make it a temp inventory function that you can store something until you log off or server hop. With a low storage volume, it would work great for trades.
---
Ditto. I always think it might be Chinese hackers or data miners.
---
Buy gats and BBH‚Äôs
---
Yes, a good counter too would be great.
---
I listed the ones available after the ones the OP already got. 
---
Get ready for the ALOD posts lol
---
Wow, that is a fantastic job in general but the paint job and weathering on the steel parts is just amazing! Enjoy PAX!
---
Oh is that what they mean? I thought those peoplw were just throwing up in disgust of something I did lol
---
Did you yell "Die, Mutha-f\*\*ker. Die!"
---
Guess I'm not a team-player either  ;D
---
The weapon came like this which upsets me a little because I was hoping for a plan to put Thos look on all miniguns
---
I can think of a decent amount of people that would enjoy a deathmatch gamemode among my friends and including yours truly, I don't really understand the appeal of adding full on pvp to a standard fallout76 world when the foundation you're adding that pvp mode too is almost completely designed against that whole principle, it might make questing and exploring more tense but it's hardly going to function as a valid form of repeatable pvp content
---
Adding a deathmatch gamemode which has already been datamined as being/having been in the works would solve every issue aside from the romanticized idea of the game functioning like a traditional survival game alike ARK or Rust or whatever you'd want to pick as your poison
---
So people can't abuse it more than they already do.
---
If turret kills give exp people can just place down their camps at the golf club, go afk, sleep or whatever and when they're back they leveled up a bunch of times.
---
Yeah sometimes I‚Äôm still invisible even though I‚Äôm moving, I thought it was just lag but perhaps it‚Äôs this glitch?
---
account no, another character...
---
Syringers only
---
Good news
---
Iv read a bunch if posts saying this mode will devolve into naked people attacking each other with hatchets and having one boiled water and one cap on them. If so I will play just to watch and laugh.
---
then do what I did and start a new character just for PvP, 
---
what system?
---
Glad it was helpful. As a person mentioned, get hard bargain to level 3 will help get you more for each item from a vendor.
---
Happy exploring and hunting!
---
What‚Äôs a bloodied 50% limb damage M79 worth?
---
I‚Äôm a level 45 and I killed a level 150 with a full sentinel set. All I had to do was hide in some bushes and bait him to move to try to find me. 2 VATS to the head and he was dead.
---
I agree with you generally but it‚Äôs not impossible. It‚Äôs also fairly easy to avoid most other players. As most pvp players are hanging out around spawns. Just spawn at camp mostly and use the more uncommon stations. 
---
Same happened to in flatwoods but I noticed it was caused by "fertile soil" event. No damage to anyone. But if you were in front of vault 76 it shouldn't be event zone so hard to say why
---
Like i said, i know this type of thing can happen which is why the turrets would possible give you 20% less xp. Or (just another idea) the xp lost by turrets increases by 1% for every level until your a high enough level that turrets are practically useless for gaining xp. So at level 10 your losing 10% xp, lvl 25 your losing 25% xp and this just keeps growing as you level
---
I‚Äôm having issue where the top3 aren‚Äôt visible, or only one is visible (on ps4). Anyone know why? 
---
Well when i say growing i mean the percentage keeps growing, and your overall xp gained from the turrets is decreased
---
I already know about the "Deathmatch" game mode they've talked about before.
---
But it adds nothing to the game, I'm sure they can make legendary rewards just like survival mode but all it would be is a CoD size map with people spawning with premade outfits while I could see the appeal and I'd probably play it myself I'd rather more energy go into PvE and PvP Survival mode than a Deathmatch mode at current moment.
---
The sentiment in adventure mode should change soon enough, now that you can't damage other players and their bases anymore without their consent.
---
You mean Blood Dome? :)
---
PS4
---
Oh wow I myself ran into one of those like radio eye bots and it was playing like minutemen type music followed by a row of mutant rats.
---
It's still an easy way to level up from 1 to 100 with 0 effort. 
---
There are already too many turret platform cancer in game. Giving people more reasons to use them is a huge no-no for me. 
---
10k taps daily with the 7 pool of vendor with 200 taps each? the count doesn't come back to me. How?
---
I just started a new character so I have nothing to lose.  I bet people get real upset that they get 50 caps and shitty beginner chems
---
Never happedned to me. Maybe one time, but not for 30minutes of tryin.
---
Right now we have deathmatch mode and it‚Äôs called Survival 
---
Way to many whiners for this to happen. I dont see why people like grinding, I play games to play games, not to simulate work. But to each their own
---
I agree - this need to change. I like the idea of restricting fast travel though.
---
that will not fix the problem at al.
---
All I can say to you man is i enjoy being good at things being at the top whats the best sign of that? Crushing 90% of other players that means squeezing every bit of value i can out of my gear and my perks. Honestly surprises me how many ppl complain about tse weapons they are like 2 metas behind the high tier guys. I 100% understand thar most people dont want to get all this gear as its alot of work the message im trying to spread is stop trying to ruin the fun of guys like me we put in a ton of effort to be powerful i this game but people wanna keep nerfing our stuff, but thing is all it does is piss us off then we work harder to find other way to one shot people or beat them with ease simply because they less time playing and know next to knowing about game mechanics
---
If you are after that feeling of tension and even fights there is plenty of it, most players have average gear and average builds so if you fight a couple of them at once you may enjoy that. I don‚Äôt get it too often but when I do i appreciate it because the pvp in the game can be very tense.
---
Yeah I'm lean more towards commando. I've yet to use auto weapons much and it looks fun. We won't talk about always looking for lead and steel. 
---
Don't the serum recipes cost 19k by default?  And you can't find them in the game so wet would you but then and sell them for less?
---
Or do you mean the serum made from the recipes
---
And mutations
---
Fair point. Well either way its just my personal opinion and i understand that you have your own opinion on this idea as im sure others do as well. But i'd still like to see this sort of thing implemented despite the fact that other lazy players making bases with turrets at white springs can abuse this for xp and gain lvls hella easily. 
---
Why do you find it hard on console? Mine works just fine.
---
I have a spare you can have for free!!
---
wow..no i give you caps..or you need ammo?
---
I've said it so many times, hard cap the weapon damage no matter the effects. This way it's easy to achieve balance and so much easier to make other guns viable. The competitive pvp mode would be so much more fun. 
---
And you don't need to touch the legendary effects at all. 
---
Nah, no need :) you can just have it :D 
---
I‚Äôm going to finally make an alt mule then, never bothered making a second character. I‚Äôve accrued max caps in my main, nothing to buy really so I really need to bank my bottle tops.
---
For me, Monongah was booting me frequently on PC last week.
---
legend  psn buntybill
---
I like what turd suggests although I‚Äôm not particularly fond of map markers in a survival mode
---
Cough cough, whitesprings camper
---
To make it harder for people to abuse the sytem
---
I got a friend to send me there exe and that worked :-(
---
How to you get these?
---
a have been saying this all along, and I can tell that ppl that have said the samething as me have some type of knowledge about playing PvP games, not so much for the ppl that are crying to get new character.
---
time is a much bigger factor than gear, and i agree 10000000% locking characters to a mode will fuck royaly the guys coming to play later, unless they do like some PvP games that regularly they wipe everything and force everyone to start from scratch again. 
---
When you get the medical malpractice and the lone wanderer I‚Äôll buy them off of you
---
my psn's merrowench :)
---
Personally I'm hoping that the Legendary player options will be worth it enough that we won't see super high level players any longer because folks will be trading in thier levels for those legendary benefits.
---
Of course that will introduce a whole new level of balancing they need to do, but it should still help.
---
Photo challenge worked for me at the tree surrounded by the circular shaped concrete near the entrance (the tomb with the concrete lion statues is nearby). Imagine you're standing at the center of the circle where the tree is. If the tomb is at 12 o'clock position, stand at the 3 o'clock position with your back against the large bush and face the entrance gate. If you're in the right spot, you will have the bush fight against your back. For your reference,  there is large rock behind the bush and park bench behind the rock. Hope this helps!
---
Besides, an alpha usually happens in a controlled environment. If you're a developer of any kind, you know how to use your product and you have a hard time to use it in a way that you neither intended nor expected. That's what the beta is for. You have plenty of people using your product so woefully wrong that all the faults are exposded. Or at least most of them.

I agree dude/dudet, me and my friend are fairly new to fo76 (well im lvl 30 and hes lvl 9 but that doesnt matter :p) and ive been trying different ways to get his lazy arse to actually lvl up and what not, so i thought that me and him should go into white springs and farm the ghouls from a window. Whilst the xp was worth it and we leveled up once or twice there were a few level 150+players there murdering each other and murdering use with a single hit and they weren't even collecting our loot which is pointless. I even went into vc and said to them that i was trying to help my friend lvl up and they just laughed and kept doing it (now purposely trying to stop me from helping my friend) and we had to ditch to adventure. 
---
Balancing problem? Everyone dies in 1-3 hits, it almost doesn‚Äôt matter what weapon dmg is in the future. All weapons may as well be obscenely powerful, nothings going to change pvp at this rate. It‚Äôs always going to be 1-3 unless you‚Äôre purposely trying to use the very weakest weapons. 
---
I think a simple solution with the cap problem and I agree with you, only reason I started a new character was just that, losing 170 caps everytime I get kill is crazy. 
---
but what do you thing about everyone that is above lvl 50 a set 100 caps √ºer death and everyone below lvl 50 then the double the lvl you are on caps? what do you think. 
---
He is completely wrong. Either he's trolling or don't know shit about taming.
---
It can spawn at 35 also.
---
you are playing in the wrong system LOL ;)
---
From the beginning I didn't trust people in this game. I'm an older player (40yo), and I just don't trust other people easily, especially online, be it social media or video games. I have my select group of friends I run with, and that's about it. I do try to help lower level players when I can, but I'm also the guy who will kill them if they're wanted, LoL. Nine times out of ten I don't take their stuff though. I'm also the kind of guy who will just give people stuff and not chargefor them. To me in-game currency is much easier to come by than a legendary two-shot explosive weapon so why charge for it when I can do events and daily sales runs to get my cap limit? I guess I'm just Mr. Nice Guy, LoL.
---
Come on post a pic. Oh i'm sure it was your cousin's friend deathclaw and it was killed. How unlucky you cannot take a pic.
---
I guess people finally figured it out. Beth says players will drop aids but players are shocked to find out aids have dropped. Beth says it will cost you caps and players are surprised it costs caps. It only took a few days for some players to figure out how to manage the simple mechanics...
---
I happen to agree its not hard to make 25k caps a day on the survival servers if you play with friends.  
---
Random rewards for turning in Technical Data at Camp Venture. 
---
They appear to drop in order, once you learn one, you can received the next. 
---
I cant seem to find the comment but whomever called me a white springs camper im not, my camp is at the top of the map, as im farming lead with the resource miner thingy for ammo :p and either way i think camping that place is way too time consuming and im a melee build 
---
I think that sounds reasonable.
---
damn at 400 hours, you at least got your moneys worth...
---
SBQ is...scorched beast quests?  am only level 40 so i don't think i can do her just yet
---
I mean, on one hand it makes sense, when you're running/ hiding from hostiles and you've got a bottleneck to funnel them through, it's the battle of Thermopylae. I personally wouldn't bother trying to go after someone indoors unless that location had multiple entrance and exits. At least a chance not the get door shanked.
---
I would imagine that an (alt character) level 10 with chameleon and a silenced hunting rifle could eek out an existence sneaking around in Survival. No junk to lose, no aid to lose but a few pieces of food and only 20+ caps to lose when hunted. A 2 x 1 wooden shack camp hidden in the mountains. A few thousand .308 rounds and a truck full of grenades (that cant be lost when you are killed) and you are oxo. 
---
I read so many posts about people losing so much aid and caps in survival. Its time to get sneaky!
---
Because your turret did and not you. Don‚Äôt be dense
---
You lost 600 caps to two deaths, so you must be level 300. You made like 90 caps in 7 kills, so those "mid range" players were an average of level 6. So, what, as a level 300, you spend your time camping new characters with an explosive shotgun at Flatwoods, and then rage quitting as soon as someone comes along that can kill you?
---
Im not being dense, if i built it so i think i should be able to gain a bit of xp from it. Also its a discussion so try not to be mean :P its just my personal opinion dude/dudet
---
It takes few moments to aim for head with vats, without is is really hardcore. In this time you may be already dead by salve of explosive bulets.
---
Nvm it didnt say i edited the post. 
---
Players are shocked with amound, because it is fucked up to lose 100stimpacks on death.
---
As cool as that situation is, it‚Äôs not likely or feasible for me to encounter, and it isn‚Äôt meta.
---
Cavalier people can be countered with stagger much easier, and fall flat on their faces when up against sentinel people.
---
I think that you‚Äôre encountering the chameleon exploit with armor that allows the player to turn continuously invisible by smashing the sneak key with a piece of chameleon armor. Well of course it‚Äôs gonna be op if you‚Äôre invisible all the time, but this is an exploit. I‚Äôm referring to the state of the game without this exploit, and I did not mention this in the post for a reason.
---
Gonna be honest, I was underwheled when I read about the weapons. As a trader, most of them seemed like the kind of stuff I would vendor or just straight up drop because I couldn't scrap it.  I can't imagine they have unique skins (that might actually make it worth it for some people) and you can probably get better for the ammount of caps you would grind in a week.
---
I don't have a problem with it. It might be in your end.  Maybe restart your router? I find I have to do that every so often to keep it running smoothly.
---
If they allow a player to get xp from a turrent kill, they should also require the turrents to use the players ammo. If they have no ammo then the turrent becomes a decoration.
---
I think the MG42 is a bit more accurate, and has a faster fire rate, but the .50 cal would be a nice find as well.
---
I suspected that every weapon operates on the 3-4 hit to kill level, which is flat out broken.
---
It isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs scarecrows vs invisible people.
---
You're welcome to enjoy the game but I think people who paid full price for a triple-A "experiment" are entitled to be frustrated when they read posts like this that try to white wash what happened.
---
"We are gonna build something. Not release. Not give you. We are going to BUILD something special. Not just Bethesda, or their game studio... but all of us."
---
Hey, if I'm helping to "build" their 60 dollar game, can I get a cut of those sweet, sweet atom purchase dollars? 
---
Friend/Guest mats would be great! That way they don't spawn into my foundation every..single..time.
---
What?
---
Just make it five caps per kill. We aren‚Äôt spongy so our caps should be. We can still drop copious amounts of aid to sell 
---
The real question from here on out is.. will they be listening???
---
If the devs read this, PLEASE add NPC‚Äôs to the CAMP. Just one. Just. One. The CAMP feels like home but it‚Äôs missing the feeling of ‚Äúlife‚Äù. It just feels so empty no matter how much I build. 
---
... wait.  What? 
---
Omg YES! Or maybe depending on what type of turrets you have the amount of turrets you can have is decreased or maybe higher tiers of turrets use up more ammo.
---
If anything server hopping will continue to be eliminated. It‚Äôs not an intended mechanic. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúrequired‚Äù, not like it was before with the buggy quests. It‚Äôs only ‚Äúrequired‚Äù because you want to get rare items easier. 
---
I disagree, and in fact - I'd take it a step further and reset progression every three months.
---
There's a very strong sense that once you've hit cap, logging back into F76 is somewhat pointless. Sure you can farm more and get better gear, but much of the survival aspects in the game are more meaningful at lower level, and having access to an already viable capped character kind of takes that away from you, while simultaneously causing the earlier parts of the game to feel abandoned.
---
As an example:
---
Path of Exile resets progression every 3 months by launching new content to coincide with a fresh-start "challenge league" to play together. At the end of the league, existing league-players are moved into a central "standard" league, and a new one starts, complete with new content, and fresh characters to play together.
---
This puts league players back at the starting line together so they can co-operate or compete throughout the leveling process once more, keeping the entire arc of the game relevant, rather than just endgame.
---
It allows existing players to keep playing in standard if they prefer the stronger/finished/leveled up character experience at endgame.
---
Furthermore, it provides devs a focused beta test of new, fun content/mechanics that they can tweak and evaluate before shifting them wholesale into the standard league.
---
If there was a similar mechanism that reset the baseline in F76, many players would feel more incentivized to log back in and check out the new content and toys as they become available, as there would be a large amount more replay value due to the re-emphasised leveling/accumulation of power competition etc.
---
It‚Äôs fucked up to carry 100 stimpacks period, never mind on a game mode where you drop aid on death
---
cool adding
---
What is it? Grenade launcher?
---
I got killed by a player at a station went back killed him with a grenade got so much aid stuff I over loaded it was like 250+ items and started immediately putting it in the stations stash box before he could come back and kill me I managed to stash 30+ of his stimpacks.
---
He killed me 2 more times because I respawned overloaded and couldn't move and I still had 90 cram and about 30 other misc things 
---
I'm complaining about the servers lagging because of this flaw.. thanks for downvoting and missing the point asshole.
---
Nice, long ways to go then. Cheers
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote. I just commented on your post and you decided to call me an asshole. Look who the asshole is.
---
Should of been new characters only. No mode crossing at all.
---
I lost all interest when they said you could bring your God mode characters over and switch back whenever you want.
---
I laugh that they actually think that's "survival".
---
They made it a spawn camping griefers wet dream.
---
BGS is being lead by a moron. Very very poor game decisions. 
---
I will often wait for them at the vault, the overseer camp or flatwoods. Other times i try to follow them around. But several times i had the feeling that i'm bothering them. And it add to it when they seems to server hop...
---
I will buy one too if anybody has one left. Or trade for civil war plans
---
Cats were once worshiped as gods. They remember this.
---
I for one welcome our purry overlords.
---
Queue the "Am I out of touch? No, its the children who are wrong" meme.
---
Whne literally everyone else is seeing the flaws in something and you aren't, you can still enjoy that thing, but you can't just hand waive away the criticism.
---
This subreddit is such a joke. It's a perfect example of the echo chamber that is reddit. 
---
"I don't like what you're saying so you're wrong and I'm going to downvote you. How dare you challenge my emotionally derived opinions."
---
This new thing the cool kids are doing, is called sarcasm. And you cant sniff it for shit. Useless! Deleting my entire post, probs more like you to come.
---
Maybe you are right, but I find that I often can not harvest the flowers in the flower boxes at Whitesprings (which hang on the porch).
---
But I also realize that not all vegetation changes and often their unblurred counterparts are available.
---
Often I can not collect the blue glowing resin at the entrance. I really think that certain plants need regrowth.
---
You tried to be cute and make a post using song lyrics and it didn‚Äôt come across great. Sorry about that dude. 
---
I love the concept, there was a mod for Fallout 4 for a similar concept.  Unfortunately, at least for Fallout 4, it was almost game breaking how overpowered you could make some weapons.  
---
VATS off players would actually be awesome
---
Next time don't cheat, then you will be able to continue playing a game you obviously hate. 
---
Theres the pullers and pushers of society. I know what you are.
---
Its junk. They had a chance to make a true survival version and completely dropped the ball.
---
The moronic decisions they have been making of late are really mind boggling. 
---
So hopefully people that enjoy that will go to it. It's unfortunate though, that they didn't account for one of the most fundamental problems in PvP games which of course is spawn camping.
---
hmm
---
Yes I did. Wish there was more but will have to be patient. 
---
Wow you know that much based on a internet comment. You must be really smart.
---
Yeah its quite annoying
---
1) that would bring more problems than anything, first is just a temporary fix, time is more than a factor that the gear you have. locking characters to a mode we will see the samething hapenning with inia few days. I have 3 or 4 hours off play when im luck, and i wont keep up that has 30 minutes more than me to play let alone some one that has 8 hours.
---
2) dont care their is always a flaw.
---
3)the need to make vendors and spawn locations safezones
---
4) thats on you for taking so much to battle when you know what would happen, in fact i think they should make better rewards per kill. 
---
You didn't understand but still criticised. So yeah that says alot asshole.
---
By using the vendor pool more than once per day :p
---
The last time I tried to help a new player, this past weekend in fact, I dropped them a bag full of water, non-perishable food, a brotherhood recon rifle, some ammo, a couple outfits to hide the vault blues, and some stims.
---
Instead of picking up the bag they began hopping around like a CSGO player spraying me with their pipe pistol while I sat stoically in my T-60 and wondered if he even comprehended he was level 5 and I was level 70.
---
I picked my offering back up he obviously had spurned and eventually calmed him down after I showed him how a two-shot minigun works. 
---
I think it's because it would make taking a workshop from someone too difficult. It wouldn't make sense to allow the defender to respawn at the workshop and not the person trying to capture it. This way you each get one chance, whoever survives keeps the workshop
---
it used to. it was fun sneaking in to heal friends lol
---
That's awesome. I have a friend who buolt there too, but looks like scratch art compared to this, LoL. Good job.
---
I see its gets downvoted. Have fun being free frags, suckers ^^
---
Fallout 4‚Äôs*
---
The lunchboxes are metal aren't they?
---
i spend half my time on this game fast traveling to every merchant on the map just to sell stuff, 200 caps is not enough. Takes the fun out of the game when you have to stare at loading screens 50% of the time.
---
So maybe I misunderstood your half cryptic edgy song lyric post. And I called out server hoppers for why they server hop. I didn‚Äôt make it personal or derogatory. You went there. It was you bro. 
---
He did no damage to players who didnt attack him back.
---
I think, it will be sooner than that
---
Agreed, It's polished well and it still has limitless potential
---
You realize that the super Sledge looks different in each game right? This is the 4/76 Sledge. How stupid are you? Older Fallouts don't exist my ass if you cared that much you'd at least know this simple fact
---
This is interesting and fresh
---
And not carry a ton of aid. 
---
I knew that the pool refresh every 24 hours
---
The scenario is exactly what I stated. I was not hostile, I was not doing anything wrong. I was sitting at the Overseer‚Äôs CAMP and was one shorted as was my friend. This happened around 9:30 last night. The player appeared and hit me once with a power fist and I died before I even knew what happened. Same with my friend. We both re-spawned (did not select ‚Äòseek revenge‚Äô) and the player came along and killed us both again. Took 126 caps from me each time, 114 from my friend. They had a buddy with them who was shooting us without doing damage, but their power fist was killing us immediately. Just because it hasn‚Äôt happened to you or your friends doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt happen. 
---
So it's a synth dream?
---
does the railway rifle?
---
flaming chainsaw didn't work. beta wave didn't either.
---
 just tried flaming pitch fork. doesn't work either.
---
I enjoy gifting items to other players. I enjoy making any missing leather armor for anyone under level 5. I make the sacrificial machete for them and upgrade their gun or craft a pipe pistol for them, usually can add a couple hundred rounds of ammo.
---
Try this in real life.
---
Chase after random people and drop a brown bag with a soda, a cup of soup, and some bandages and antiseptic.
---
Then yell at them to pick it up. Chase them if they try to leave without your gifts. Run in front of them and drop it again directly in their path. Make odd signs using your hands and body motions only. Don't speak.
---
Try to avoid getting arrested. 
---
Yeah, I built in the Raider tower using partly that approach, but I fit some stairs and floors in. I was walking through the tunnels last week and wondering what would fit but I didn't want to blow up my new camp to try. 
---
This is basically what I am doing with my level 35 alt. I dump all her junk and aid items in her stash, switch to survival in watoga, and stealth sniper the robots with a combo of cranberry cobbler and well rested. I don't engage other players but have no qualms on nicking their dropped stuff. 
---
The 20% xp boost plust well rested and cobler is nice for a frugal leveling sniper. No one in Watoga eve looks up...
---
Do the bullets fire from two barrels, or are the bullets firing back to back?
---
I'm kinda regretting leaving my 2nd one in a drop bag after an event.  No idea it was worth so much
---
+karma  thanks you very much
---
Yeah! Give killstreakers pad on the back. Leave survivors alone
---
I know i'm not!
---
Thx
---
do you understand how programing a game works? a few differences can be huge to program, you might see and activate lever but what goes in the background I can assure you is more complex that what you see happening.
---
after all is the beta and how the game indunstry is working now beta is the test, is more time effecty for the devs but it sucks for us the consumer. 
---
im sure they will make adjustments to the problems that are going on right now. i have plyed it and the only thing is the spawn kills that is messing that mode up, besides that its fun. 
---
I did the same. And if I see myself in the top three, I eat and drink my stuff and store most of my junk in a random nearby container. I leave a joke item like a baby bottle or toy truck as a reward for the team of 4 that barely manages to kill my level 6 (Since I'm armed with the best weapons a random group of scorched can drop).
---
yeh i gave a few away to people that didnt have one..
---
Because they are poopybags... You drop it when you die üëç
---
I‚Äôve actually found this thread thanks to searching as I‚Äôve had the same thing today. 
---
4 out of the 6 daily challenges are already showing as complete yet I haven‚Äôt played since yesterday morning (long before they change over for me).
---
I don‚Äôt appear to have any additional atom points either.
---
Annoyingly they are simple challenges I could have completed for the atoms ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
---
Not my own fault that perks that affect the weight of items don‚Äôt apply to the stash ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I have over 200 stimpaks and 150 radaway among countless other bits of food and chems, and no more than 80 pounds of space remaining in my stash at most times 
---
Survival is like the pirate motto 
---
"Take everything, give nothing back"
---
I've created an alt to eventually play the Survival, he's got no caps or aid items so any I get is a bonus and if I die I'm not giving the opponent nothing 
---
Wow I thought you fellas were kidding about the aid loss, played survival for around 20 minutes last night before we found people to fight with, died a single time to some lady who couldn't be damaged cause of her legendaries. I lost 50 pounds worth of aid items after both weight reduction perks, all the alcohol I''ve crafted, around 70+ bottles, 35 bottles of nuka cherry, 27 glowing mass and high radiation fluids. Won't be playing survival again until either the aid loss is cut down severely or legendary effects aren't enabled for pvp, only npc creatures. Heck I'd even prefer a new character for the people who want to play survival at this point, such a shame cause it could be so much fun. They put the bare minimum amount of effort into this.
---
I'm surprised the drop rate was so low for it.  I only did the event about 15 times and got 2.  Guess I used up all my luck for a while...
---
Jumping off a cliff... Why didn't I think of that?!
---
They made it clear that survival is for PvP. Why do you even join that mode if you just want to mind your own business? 
---
The only issue I can see for exploitation is people who do load in quickly having the remainder of the 120 seconds  in god mode. I think it must be such a fine line for them to balance it.
---

i got about 6 of them in the first 2 days then got none after that..im after another 2 for my friends
---
Are you talking about the non-feral ghouls near Dyer chemical?
---
Np. I expect them to patch it soon. A random amount is cool. But maybe they should have a upper limit on how much it can be. 
---
How does the same question that has been asked weekly since launch still manage to get so many up votes! 
---
It's a stray shot going through dimensional barrier from other servers.
---
As some who is level 97 and my build is an absolute mess because I fucked around, I would hate that. Especially considering we don't have just a normal respec system so every level I gotta try to undo my horrible choices.
---
I don't play that game but i think you lose everything on death, that's why he said fortnite.
---
haven church and galleria mall hinted about their existence 
---
I‚Äôve done it twice ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I was wondering where they were from, haven't discovered the lore of that vault but I assumed it was something like that.
---
I mean, he did finish that statement with 'if you want that stuff'.
---
I farmed the event for all the masks. All of them will be worth a bit when new wave of players will join the game. And with player vending it will be sweet soon
---
Wow, went back and read the replies. Not the intent. Just as if someone was drinking and causing trouble it may have been part of the problem. We all have that friend who is already trashed that wants just one more drink. This guy was seriously baked and not mellow at all. He was downright hostile. 
---
I get some people are starting an alt and don't want the help, but pick up the damn gift and say thank you.  You can drop it 5 min later if you really wanna be a hard core lone wolf.
---
Sheesh, like some people were born in a barn vault.
---
That's why they're hiding behind the "Beta" tag on it.
---
 It's amazing they gave us something so poorly designed and poorly thought out.
---
 I honestly don't think they have enough developers left on fallout 76 to even come close to getting it where it's going to need to be to actually be a playable fun version.
---
Its almost as if they took all their lead designers and programmers and put them on the games that haven't been released yet and left all the half ass developers on this game. 
---
Or...stash your junk and aid and only travel with a handful of stimpacks and some other basics if you want to PvP.
---
If you seriously think that un-completable quests, perks with no effect, NPCs that couldn't take damage, and unannounced changes in patches, etc were "the best part of the game", then I don't even know if fanboy is the right term; masochist might fit better. 
---
Agreed about it being level based. They should make it work the same as the aid drops üòÇ
---
I have a few hundred hours into the game. I like to farm challenges (besides daily and weekly) and buy as much stuff from the atomic shop for free 
---
I see you reinstalled you game and are enjoying your stolen serums. How lovely of you. 
---
Did you ever think that maybe op meant that the guy didn't mute his mic while he took his hit? It is just as annoying as when someone is eating loudly or playing music over the mic. 
---
unpopular opinion:
---
the stuff you throw on the floor isnt supposed to be interesting or nice looking! it's junk! paper bags are hard to locate in the wild, yes, but lunch boxes?! aw man, thats just not right.  its not like vault dweller has disposable lunch boxes left and right... 
---
Its little bit less than 24h and its character-bound and not account-bound based so if your main character can easily craft stuff worth 10k caps (and I do it it one sitting), then you can just move stuff to alts and then use the pool many many times.
---
Being honest with you I can do that but I'm not doing that. I love to find and use every possible advantage once, but I'm not using them all as part of my regular gameplay because I LOVE challenge.  I haven't been at vendors for a week. My point is not that I can do that, but that if I can do so then everybody else can too, and if they can, some of they do, so the problem of duped "caps" is not an actual problem if there is a way that is legit and that is allowing you to compete against the dupers while not breaking the terms of service.
---
Example of my playstyle is that when I learned about time-spent-alive leaderboards, I immidately built a glitched camp that cannot be penetrated by regular weapons. I haven't used it for anything besides learning how to penetrate impenetrable camps, then deconstructed it as soon as the lesson was learned.
---
Yesterday I met a leaderboards n1 that was locked in such camp. She was just casually building her stuff, and gained the n1 position as there was no "regular" way of entering her camp. Using the lessons learned from my own camp I just rejoined the server, and entered the place again before it finished loading, effectively falling through the floor, locking me up inside.
---
Big kudos to the author of that clever camp. It has an easy way of rebuilding and disassembling the enterance, and unlike my glitched nonsense she actually used the terrerain for her advantage, without resorting to glitches, and made her camp look good too.
---
I'm just going to point out the falicy in your statement. You said you "imagine" it's just a greifing fest. Pop in and check it out! Don't let your dreams stay dreams, experience it for yourself.
---
I wonder what the "camera" update will be. No one ever talk about it.
---
I'm all for it. Maybe it should only affect the pvp side. I think it's kind of lame to get a legendary gun if it don't work in pve.
---
No problem, stop by any time 
---
It's on a terminal within the cave to the vault, and another in Harpers Ferry I believe! I really hope they expand on this story when the vault opens.
---
Interested?
---
The problem with making vendors safe zones is that in Harpers Ferry and Flatwoods the vendors are in the middle of town, so would that just make the entire town a safe area?
---
But if they shoot or swing then it should cancel out the invulnerability.
---
It‚Äôs the let‚Äôs cook together emote in the atomic shop. It looks like a red cooking pot
---
you can find it at the watago shopping plaza
---
Thanks for stopping by!
---
No problem, stop by anytime! 
---
900 hours played and I'm still engaged and enjoying playing :).
---
I play mostly Solo but have been teaming up to teach other players what I've learned as of late.
---
What I realized is that the Game World while outwardly appearing 'static' is constantly evolving and changing as your character grows and changes. What I mean is that as I leveled and added new abilities new facets of the world opened up. Marsupial being such a huge Game Changer is a great example.
---
I set goals for myself, like farming for ammo or Caps or Food, do Events, farm WS and go Scorchbeast hunting. Sometimes I just pick a direction and go.
---
I ALWAYS find something to do but I have placed that responsibility on Myself because I view the Game as a giant sandbox that I can play in and shape for a few hours and do whatever I want! 
---
I let my imagination fly free, so if one day you see a Crazy Lady out for a jog on the roads wearing the VTU Track Suit - say hi and wave!
---
No they are not. Come back to reality. Those who are "singing" will be on drugs or mentally ill.

All spawns are a safe zone. No shots can be fired while inside the circle. And no one can shoot inside from the outside. When you leave the spawn safe zone, you get a temporary debuff to damage and a buff to resistance. This will prevent campers from waiting outside the safe zone to kill you. After about 30 seconds that buff is gone and it‚Äôs game on. 
---
Lolz 
---
Bump and upvoting 
---
You couldn‚Äôt get more then flagging folks down before your live-streamed on YouTube about being crazy 
---
Yup, hopefully the pre-existence of this will make it quicker to get for all when either mods become officially supported or the Devs add it officially themselves.
---
I got some from doing Boomer's quest in The Mire.
---
Maybe they left the game as soon as they were on top of the leaderboard 
---
That isn't true, the currency would be devalued if you can make so much of it that using the currency becomes pointless. As an example, the most expensive PA mod plans from pheonix cost about 5k caps, depending on charisma and perks. So if i can make 7k caps a day just from the vendors, i would have all the mods i want from vendors in a couple days. A couple days later i could have all the mutations i want to aqcuire through serums. Now after about a week, i have purchased everything i want with caps, and now they no longer serve a purpose as a currency, which means they lose value. It wouldn't devalue the currency in the in game world, it would devalue it to us as players

It is your fault for not utilizing your stash efficiently. 
---
Learn better inventory management. There‚Äôs no reason your stash should be so full that you can‚Äôt keep an ample supply of the shit the literally keeps you alive. 
---
L2P maybe
---
Playing this mode is a waste of time as it was a waste of time creating it. All those valuable dev hours just went through the sink. I‚Äôd love to see user data‚Äôs: how many inactive accounts did log into the game after the new quest and after the new event compared to this. I mean, who asked for that? 
---
Stimpack weight 1lbs per in stash, with perk 0,1lbs.  I don't have 150lbs space in stash haha. Had to put everything on mule.
---
i tried using a crossbow. 
---
if you‚Äôre okay with a HUGE impact radius, it works. 
---
Farm scorch queen funny guy 
---
Farm scorch queen she drops serum recipes. You funny guy. 
---
There's a potential for exploiting of that idea but its not necessarily needing to happen.
---
If you'd be given 60 or 120 seconds, but lost the protection as soon as you ran, took out your gun or gone crouching you should be loosing the protection.
---
That would allow you to casually walk away from the spot without being directly endangered, and preventing you from abusing this new form of slap damage. As soon as you ran, sprinted, crouched or took your weapon out you are fair game, but if you are scouting for your group, you might be able to lure some of the enemies out of the spawn, going after you as you walk away slowly, and allowing your friends to jump onto their backs.
---
I made my camp there above welch and it's such a good place for scrap. The mole miners are good xp and there's almost nobody there ever which is kinda nice tbh. Wish there were more quests there.
---
   
---
no legendary effects activated, shot damage and the received increased  stimulants with application time and delayed effect  without maracadores or fast trip  mortal diseases greater importance to food and water (and cooked food) 
---
So much this. Imagine all those dev hours would have been used to improve the game...
---
I haven't had issues after powering it up with disconnects. I have had problems with defending it and enemies spawning in the ground.
---
Honestly, I think it is the sound of fermented booze finishing in your fermentor.  Always seems when I hear that sound, my booze is done.
---

---
I was going to say that I‚Äôll keep an eye out for you, but that all depends on what kind of junk you have on you. 
---
Damage is a bit tricky (messed up) in Survival. So no one really knows what's going on.
---
I feel bad. I made a new character and it is so nice to see people wanting to give me stuff because I am low level. But I have an alternate character that is 100+. I feel that stuff can go to someone who needs it more than me. I feel bad when people drop stuff and I don‚Äôt take it. The no emote looks too harsh, wish there was a no thank you.
---
Yeah super immersive: killing someone in a power armor with two shots. Following the lore, the US won on the conventional field against China because of those armors. It‚Äôs just pathetic 
---
I'm confused...  100 out of 290 isn't "some?"
---
I don't get it either. They even released an open letter that basically said that the game would've been quite messy at the beginning, they were open to everyone about it and everyone, here on reddit and elsewhere, read that letter.
---
I don't know how can someone be "mislead" about the game even after that.
---
Knight SGT is out of order, dropping after CPT, but otherwise they follow an order.
---
Yeah i haven't even touched it yet and I'm scared to go on because if my small 300 caps
---
So what if random means a lot?
---
It can also mean a little?
---
Just shows Someone didn‚Äôt pay attention to the patch notes
---
The OP has 2 options 
---
Change your carry items and amounts or
---
Don‚Äôt 
---
Not that freakin hard..
---
Theres a challange that lists all of em new drink recipes (just the names, no effects)
---
I'm using a Bloodied Lever Action and I kill level 80 SB in 3-4 shots. For the ghoulies at Whitespring I have a Ghoul slayer Explosive Lever Action that dropped that I've been playing with and while it's fun - the Bloodied with my Gun-fu/Adrenaline Unyielding build is much much more powerful.
---
My next one should be officer but I want the Paladin paint back on my armor so badly. Someone painted it for me when people broke into the dev room but I stripped it off once I realized what had happened.
---
It‚Äôs about as efficient as it can get, all the lead and aluminum I have is bulked (as only those two items save space that way) and I pretty much only keep junk items that I need to repair my guns and camp. I have no aid in the stash at all. And I only store ammo for guns that I am using. I have a bunch of outfits, but they weight 0.1 each so that‚Äôs negligible. Even with all that utilization of space, the lead and aluminum take up an enormous amount of space, and the various other junk adds up alongside side it. There‚Äôs maybe 5 things total in my stash that I could remove that would get me 10-15 pounds of space back. 
---
Has to be a random spawn point not a set spawn point like deathclaw island or the abandoned waste dump.
---
Sounds good! It‚Äôs only doable right now if you‚Äôre willing to spend a lot of time at your own camp in case folks stop by. It‚Äôll be a lot easier for everyone to do this when they introduce those player vending machines
---
Give us the perks and rewards of what the OoM would get.
---
I figure there would be a damage bonus vs Raiders. 
---
What else? 
---
Appalachia specific factions ie Mothman, Order of Mysteries, Crytpids would be a nice addition but I feel like those factions would need to be harder to get into and your chances of actually making it would be slim. Something for the players to struggle for. 
---
I'm in CDT (UTC-5), and I normally play late (evenings/nights), but I can log in during the day for a quick trade. What time do you want to meet?
---
I played Survival Mode to Donate 4k Caps and unlimited Stimpaks.
---
I'm actually serious. Cleaned up my Stash! :)
---
I‚Äôm looking to compliment all the effects, thank you! 
---
I assumed thats what Nuclear Winter is going to be
---
me? i posted ad to buy berets
---
We will never have a true anti-cheat pvp game as long as the ini files that define the actual game are open to modification. 
---
It happens when enemies spawn in near you. Mostly ghouls, but I've had it happen with other enemies occasionally. It's probably ghouls spawning in the cottages up the hill.
---
People will whine when you increase it. 
---
They always do.
---
It started at 400.   People whined.
---
They increased it to 600.  People whined.
---
They increased it to 800.  You are whining. 
---
Why not use your mic 
---
Ya, I just meant "in set order" not really in "real rank order".
---
I just put the whole "SGT after CPT" thing down as a general lack of rank knowledge or mistake.  But they always seem to drop in that order, and you don't get the previous ranks once you learn them.
---
I have not tried not learning the plan to see if I can get multiples of a single.  I'm guessing it should be possible.  Reach the Paladin step and just don't learn it, farm up some Paladin plans and sell them. Because it looks the best, I think.  That Orange highlighting, and it's up near the top to make it rare enough to have some value to those not wanting to grind Tech Data.
---
This bug happened to me 5 minutes ago. Annoying as fuck. 
---
Do you think someone is really going to be able to SLEEP with this game still running? They'll eventually crash smh
---
No worries
---
I have not had this happen yet.
---
I think I have only exploded about 100-150 of the robots in Watoga though in the course of the game.
---
I never really PVP‚Äôd in adventure because I don‚Äôt think I am good at it. I am hoping to get better by getting experience in survival. Starting on a new character, it has been really fun. I think the game is more interesting with that constant chance that someone can show up and kill me like a raider in any other Fallout game. I think it is important to let go of hoarding and know you may lose your stuff at any time. 
---
The only thing I don‚Äôt like is having high levels come after me when I am below level 10. I just think it is kinda scummy since I am undergeared and get blasted by explosive weapons. But it is okay, I learned to adapt to this possibility. 
---
Excited to see how this mode evolves over time!
---
Yes please it sucks trying to get the most usable land when placing a camp.
---
Uniformed.
---
Everything can kill in 1-2 shots but people only blame TSE stuff for some unknown reason.
---
A better way is to remove PVP.
---
The only logical solution I could come up with in my head was that they wanted an audience they didn't have and thought they could get with this kind of mode.
---
 Honestly I felt like I should have inserted my quarter somewhere. 
---
It felt that acade-like.
---
Bullets flying at you from all directions and then a Deathclaw Gauntlet or 8 ripping your face off.
---
If I were more Clever I would spend my time not on the Leaderboard creating a Death Trap Base and preparing for the inevitable &gt;:)
---
This is coming soon.  It's on the roadmap.
---
The Fermenter uses the system they are developing to display items from your Stash.
---
TSE weapons are significantly easier to land shots with on a distant target. 
---
Ok champ
---
Maybe instead of living with a horrible leveling system,they can instead implement a way to respec? That seems the more reasonable option of the two choices.
---
I guess as long as the first shot or swing didn't do any damage, so players would be more inclined to seek a good position rather than trying to one hit somebody since they could get in close.
---
This is an amazing idea that sounds awesome!!
---
We need a better way to get boiler water in our camp.
---
Give them to someone who needs them in adventure mode, while you play survival and pop back in every once in a while to grab more if you need them.  When you die you loose aid I don‚Äôt know how it can be much clearer.  Some means a percentage of availability. In this case and in my experience less than half of what the game picks out of my inventory.
---
So in your opinion people pointing out a problem or wanting to see the game improve is whining? I guess you would prefer the game stayed the same as it was at launch and have nothing change then? 
---
Awesome! Thanks for the heads up! 
---
Lol.
---
On a serious note i did manage to go semi-afk for a couple of hours without crashing. The crash only happened when i came back and tried to do something.
---
Vendor cap levels is fine. If it were raised getting caps would be way too easy essentially making them useless in trades to players.
---
That's why I specified that they wouldn't be able to do any damage during that time either. It would be a 120 second pacifist mode.
---
I doubt that very much. Me and the Mrs felt super burned at launch by the poor state of the game and lack of interesting content. I keep watch of the reddit hoping they will release something to pull me back in but nothing yet. Regardless even if the game did improve that drastically why not just launch the game when it was more feature complete? If I had launched today it would have dodged so much negative pr. I didn't want to sign up for a 2 year beta, I wanted at least a playable game.
---
I've had the same idea.
---
Pre built camps that are visually appealing with decorations, clutter and a specific style.  Maybe have all crafting stations be customized to look like part of the camp itself.
---
Since the camps would be bought you would have to balance it out by having it use the entire build budget and have no defenses other than just walls.  If necessary restrict crafting stations to the tinker station and cooking. 
---
Being level 295 would result in mazed specials.
---
This is why I continue to be confused at the reaction the game got. We were told EXACTLY what to expect. 
---
Forever in sneak mode!
---
Look forward to accidentally hitting "Scrap All Junk" and deleting those teddy bears you were gathering up to display on your shelf before actually getting back to your CAMP to put them away, though!
---
Haha! I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll happen! 
---
This is what we call a "Reverse Hobo" round these parts.
---
It's true that a large enough safe zone would be harder to camp, and the other measures would give people the ability to get away or behind cover.
---
Happened to me as well defending the power plant in the mire it ended up being radtoads 
---
The survival mode for this game is central around PVP.   That is why it was made.
---
You also sound contradictory...
---
" I'm not a PvPer, i usually suck at it, but damn i love the thrill of farming legendaries on survival. I have to pay attention to my surroundings, i have to listen for gunfire, for footsteps, then i can hide and try to find the source of the gun fire. I ll creep up behind him, so hard to detect, i'll bring out my rifle by the light of the stars and shove it inside of his big fuckin' arse\~. "
---
That's PVP right there.   
---
If you play on this mode, you are a PVP.   Period.  Regardless if you choose to attack back or not, the mode is intended for all players to be able to kill any other player.  Player-VS-Player.  
---
he/she said that they heard them but  if you read the next sentence will let you know that it was towards his actions not the sound.
---
It looks to me like you are overthinking (unless the person I replied too clarifies this and it was really about the sound and not the action of the dude), and you simply wanted to write something just to write. 
---
but what you are takling about and what im taking about are too different things.
---
P.S. nothing in this world is more annoying to me that someones that chews like a cow.
---
I feel the loss of aid and junk should be a set like, 10-20% or something. That way it'll punish slow learners, but not blindside you if you make a mistake.
---
Although after getting killed 2-3 times, I had lost about 30 stims, which is all I had. Then later when I was roaming - It felt much more "survivor-ish" than adventure mode. I was picking up almost everything to break into components and heal. Fighting that legendary mirelurk king would have gone a lot worse if my camp wasn't nearby...
---
If you can make 25k in 24 hours without trading with other players I would love to hear your process. 
---
[This is the definition of some.](https://imgur.com/gallery/sVU4SDe)  I know it‚Äôs hard to swallow but words mean things and when you read something you should understand the meaning of the word you are stuck on before you get upset about it.
---
I should have a small window to get on today around 430p Pacific Standard Time and i sell the recipes for 1250 
---
You can not vats a person if they are crouching and you have not initiated pvp (hit them with a bullet). Once the fight starts you can vats them if they crouch.
---
Well that‚Äôs all I can think of. I guess just the flamer then
---
If you‚Äôre on pc I can paint your armor with paladin for free.
---
true that, but it doesnt have to be a huge area, just where the vendor is. or just even when you interact with them. 
---
I dont even know if it is possible to get killed while seeling something, but it would suck and I dont mind dying but I would if it was like that.
---
They could even make a quest out if it. 
---
Something to do with us setting up turrets and robots at the stations to start making Appalachia safer for rebuilding. 
---
Resupplying after a stint in Survival is not that serious.
---
Pharma Farmer, and Can Do just got way more useful as one trip through Whitespring completely restored what I'd lost.
---
I went into it knowing I was going to lose stuff - i lost prolly 75 Stimpaks, 60 Overdrive, 60 Calmex all my canned food and water...
---
Kinda made me realize how complacent I'd become gathering all of this.
---
I'm Level 190 and I decided to become a Mini Boss because everything I lost including the 4kish Caps is easily replaced because I have done my homework and prepared.
---
Anything I lost was just incentive to rebuild.
---
Me too! And I realize being your average adult with the responsibilities that come with it, hunting 25 legendaries before the end of the week is going to be a tall order! 
---
I went hunting yesterday, and realized Legendary Monsters that have 0 Stars in their name don't count to your total, so even though I killed probably 10 Legendaries yesterday, I only got like, 3.
---
Uphill battle, I think I may just have to accept I wont get all them weapons...just work REALLY hard for the ones I want.
---
It's not central around PvP.
---
Overwatch, PubG, Fortnite and all of those games are focused on PvP and currently people are trying to play fallout in that way. This only causes pain and grief.
---
Arma2 Epoch, maybe Rust, Ark and so on are survival games, you can kill on sight but the main goal of the game is to do whatever you want. Not to chase people around the map. If you play this new mode in that way you'll have a lot of fun. The name of the mode is also **survival** 
---
If bethesda wanted a pvp only mode they would have created battle royale in fo76, or some other silly thing like that.
---
I'm sill not a pvper at heart. I won't go out of my way to chase people around the map, i won't look for trouble, but if i do encounter someone i will make a move. 
---
No FUCKING LEADER BOARD. I mean honestly. If a mini map isn't falloutish then a leaderboards showing survivors isn't either Tod. Fuck. 
---
Is there a reason that people shouldn't have the ability to run away during the spawn timer? I was thinking that time to run would help to stop camping since it could help eliminate the ambush component. I'm thinking in terms of other games I've played where after spawn, we might leave in one direction, but then circle back from a different direction so everyone has to watch their backs. I am thinking that if you have to walk slowly upright for 120 seconds, that any camper can just easily follow you and keep shooting until the timer runs out. Maybe I misunderstand what you meant.
---
Huh. When he asked us to help them no quest ever popped. I wonder if it's a bug?
---
Camping has been a thing since the first PvP game. They could negate camping by something like if you're in the same area (x number of yards) for longer than x time, you take 50 rads a second, unfiltered by radiation blocking items. Only place this would not happen is at your own camp or a team mate's camp. 
---
isnt there a debuff of you get killed with no caps? just like adventure mode? if you have no caps you get nerfed for a period of time
---
Cool
---
This is false. TSE make it so both shots will land roughly where you're aiming, but virtually never where they would land if you didn't have the Two-shot prefix. Your accuracy takes a massive hit on a lot of weapons with the two-shot and on a sniper I think it's worthless. 
---
It‚Äôs not that bad, the few times I‚Äôve played pvp I ended up maxing out my caps... and if caps are a problem for ya just put them on a second character before you log in. 
---
Ok that is an idea, turrets and robots at spawn points that fire at spawn campers with great ferocity.
---
Does anyone read the roadmap or inside the vaults anymore?
---
Agreed. Most people don‚Äôt like to admit they‚Äôre noobs lol 
---
Well.....it may depend on how close your weapon is to the pvp damage reduction that we know nothing about. If your weapon is close to it, TSE may be a way to squeeze more damage out because the extra damage is a separate bullet that would be treated separately.
---
It does not
---
THIS. I‚Äôm making a second char trying to get him to 50 but this would be ideal 
---
Hee Hee!
---
I‚Äôve seen this happen with scorched while farming for mats.
---
I‚Äôll hear this loud boom as soon I enter and can‚Äôt loot corpses for crap
---
TSE have always been powerful, but they were grossly OP before the super nerf. They can still kill in a few shots depending on the other players build (yours matters a lot less then theirs). Bloodied at the moment can do a hell of a lot more damage, but comes with significant drawbacks. AA to me is a bit of a mystery since I've never tested it out compared to TS, but I imagine those three are the best effects so people just blame the one that was for the longest time the most powerful. 
---
Hey there. Sorry to hijack the post. Have you also passed back all of the comments about the survival mode? Manyatruenerd has a great summary of pretty much the same comments most people have made.
---
It needs some changes basically.
---
Yeah, it's what i was trying to say :D
---
Thats not a normal use case, though. 
---
Which one of the domes holds the alien blaster?
---
Oh god yes 
---
I'm assuming it's a camera that you arm like a weapon so that you can whip it out and take a quick picture instead of going through the sort of clunky camera mode. 
---
Well, you were warned. People were complaining about the game since its announcement. Yet you bought it. I have zero sympathy. 
---
You know what they say about assuming?
---
I'm level 182 but I've been running around with some friends, one is an actual new player we stumbled across who is now like level 20 and the other is a veteran player who is playing an alt from scratch as well at level 22.  They get just as many kills as I do with their damn level 20 pipe rifles and shit lol  (I just lose 364 caps every time I die and they lose 40)
---
I'm sure they have mate, 99% of the sub rn is 'survival this survival that'. Plus it's in beta so they'll be looking here for feedback. 
---
Yes camping has long been a problem, but some games do a great job at making it impractical or risky.
---
Here's another thought, if the leader board is changed to factor most kills instead of longest life, another factor to raise someone's score greatly could be how quickly after spawn that they kill other players.
---
Spawn campers would rise to the top of the leader boards and be constantly hunted, making that behavior the most attention getting.
---
40% swing speed on a hunting rifle?
---
One clarification for you about chameleon effects.
---
Chameleon armor activates when you crouch, whether your weapon is sheathed or drawn.
---
Chameleon mutation activates when you draw your weapon, whether you are standing or crouched.
---
Either one deactivates when you move.
---
So if you see a standing player go into chameleon, they are either chameleon mutation or stealthboy.  If they stay hidden while moving, they are using a stealthboy or are visually glitched for you.
---
That‚Äôs correct
---
The logic being that most players have a coherent build established by level 80. So a level 80 player isn‚Äôt really that much different to a level 130. Thus they should drop a similar amount of caps
---
Hey I do have the donut plans! Are you available today?
---
Beth has been very responsive to the community and seems to always be listening to the fans.
---
I lost like 150 stimpacks, 50 super ones, 20 nuka cola, 15 nuka quantum, and most of my drugs.
---
Oh. Ha. I will give you some plans still. Free. Message me if you want them.
---
No but a similar rifle with instigating:) maybe I was a bit unclear 
---
You can still bring things indoors on rugs.
---
Crops, water purifiers, water pumps, decontamination showers, pressure plates, Brahmin pen.
---
ahhhh.... This is exactly what people said about the base game huh? Give it a rest.. It's a live game, of course it will get adjustments over time and be better in the future. 
---
Everyones entitled to an opinion but you're wrong. For a while, players Expected completed games that ran pretty good, and if there was  minor glitch or bug in it,  that affected players significantly enough, the company would release a "patch" to fix that issue as soon as they troubleshot the issue and resolved it. I find it disturbing that companies now find it ok to release games as "Betas" and "Early access" but still charge me full price for their items for a game that is basically incomplete.
---
Can you explain what you mean? It sounds like you‚Äôre very wrong here, because lowbies aren‚Äôt losing 200-400 caps per death. 
---
thnx but i already have all the civil war era plans...spent a fair bit of time server hopping and using all 5 characters to get them lol
---
I like this idea the most so far
---
Yeah it's so funny how clueless the slappers tend to be. I had one that was on a team and figured my level high 60s alt would be an easy target. Of course the other team members were hidden.
---
Unarmed/unyielding/bolstering mix with every perk for killing or survival. I killed the team multiple times before they gave up. Their level 177 was shocked, I'm sure, as he was the last to give up. Thanks for the caps suckers.
---
Shame you can only use them for T-60, while ALL dead bodies of BoS wear T-51bs. I really like to use it on T-51b too...
---
After some research I found that there is no plan for it. You can put it on your weapon if you have the mod for it. The only way to craft it is by scraping the mod itself not the weapon. It is not a guaranteed unlock so you might have to scrap a few mods to unlock it.
---
The roof piece is supporting the wall piece and I \*think\* the wall piece is supporting the roof, so neither one can be removed.  The simple solution is to build a wall up to the roof to support it, then take out the little wall piece above the roof and then remove the roof and then the wall you just built.
---
hi i will buy if you put it on my t60 i will pay 800 caps
---
Such a fantastic idea. It's always a struggle to figure out if you've got both that resource point and a bit of water in the circle.
---
My point is that there should be clear visual distinction between the behavior of the players that can't be damaged and those who can, and it should be obvious by looking on player behavior of what you can expect. The proper procedure, the way I see it, is that by entering the spawn and casually walking away, you are forcing some of the guys camping the place to go after you, making the occupation itself harder. And when they do go after you, its still you that can define the exact moment where the violence starts, which is advantage in itself, but it has to be countered by the small period in which you take your gun out.  
---
My goal is that I'd like people to be able to live long enough to move away out of the spawn, while simultaneously denying anybody possibility of trolling the shit out of people by controlling the moment at which the protection ends.  
---
The preferred playstyle I'd like to see in such situation is that you lure the enemies out of the spawn, then break line of sight and commence violence mode as soon as you broke that line of sight, while simultaneously having your friends port into the location when you are actively distracting the camping fuckers. I'd love to be way to troll the trollers, but I'd hate it to become yet another mechanism abused by griefer bastards.
---
Mine too
---
Sounds like they‚Äôre talking about killing people in survival for caps while partied up with friends so no trading involved. Simple process, really. 
---
What serum recipes?
---
Are you ps4?
---
Not 100% sure on floating foundations or floors. But one new funny ‚Äúglitch‚Äù since the Fasnacht parade involves the confetti. If you place that on a floor it‚Äôs like a carpet, covers a square area and you can still put stuff on top of it. Including more confetti. So if you have a floor piece or foundation, you can keep putting confetti everywhere to expand the area you can place other things on, without a foundation under that confetti. And there isn‚Äôt a texture for the underneath of confetti so if you‚Äôre standing on it and it‚Äôs elevated, it looks like you‚Äôre standing on thin air. And object you place on it look like they‚Äôre floating. You can‚Äôt jump through the confetti if it‚Äôs above you so it makes for some great invisible barriers too. I haven‚Äôt seen much about this but it‚Äôs something I want to experiment with a lot more on my next camp 
---
This "surviva"l mode is a nightmare. When players asked for a more hardcore mode this isn't what they meant. Bethesda, we know you like to do things the "Bethesda" way but when over half of the player base that wanted a survival mode suggests something you really need to consider it and take it seriously. 
---
If you go into third person and then try to place it down you can rotate your camera. The camera rotation won't move your camp so you can truly see the radius of it. And you can also jump (if you have marsupial) to see the full extent of your camp radius without moving it.
---
You can always move it in this mode so you can get a perfect view of where it will go.
---
Generally two shot and explosive are better on automatic weapons and anti armor is better on slow high damage per hit weapons. The one exception is explosive on shotguns is really powerful as each pellet in a shot does the explosive damage. 
---
Its' meant to be a side wall where a slanted roof is next to a non-slanted section (like the side of a dormer on a house).  If you used a square wall section, the wall would protrude inside the structure.
---
Yeah. That's why I have so many extras and duplicates. 
---
I had 50 stimpacks and I died once and lost all but 9
---
While you're idea is good in theory it just wouldn't work unless it was a very simple design because the house has to be built to the terrain it is placed on there is not much flat ground in 76 
---
Cameleon rules
---
I play my main crouched 90% of the time.  This change would break the deathmatch mechanic.
---
Not going anywhere near pvp until they sort the near enough a minute of lag everytime you spawn in. Not losing a single cap because of lag...
---
It's my fault for expecting that the product I bought for full AAA list price would be fully functional? What if I'd only seen the advertising campaigns and didn't spend any time on reddit or other online communities? Would it be my fault then too? Give me a break.
---
Stop tying your emotional identity to a video game. 
---
honestly just take it , emote them and pass it on later if it bothers you.
---
That's what I suspected and I value such work, the complete list of these drinks will at least make sure you won't miss any of them :)
---
They shouldn‚Äôt need ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù to realize this was a dumb system to implement,Some small balance things,yes.HUGE glaring oversights? Nah come on,This is alpha at best,lol.
---
Cool, thanks. Keeping that in mind, I‚Äôve seen 0 stealth boys, 2 visually glitched, and the rest are chameleon armor, with no mutation. I‚Äôve seen nobody invisible while standing, and tbh that sounds scary if you could get a whole set of weightless sentinel armor.
---
Without sifting through all the responses and not knowing if this has been suggested or not, perhaps they should consider a system similar to GTAV open world. Basically, you can 'secure' your caps in a stash/'bank' to prevent any loss. Any caps you don't secure and carry on you though is fair game to loss. 
---
With the upcoming player vending system, they're going to have some kind of 'bank' anyway in place. Unless the caps they give me at my vending station teleport to my inventory wherever I am on the map. They could tie the caps stash to this system.
---
Critical on the 12 ball
---
Completely agreed
---
Would you rather be charged for every bit of additional content? Sure, you paid the full price, but you will receive all DLC content **for free** when it releases.
---
Kudos for the approach to the problem. The guy you met was not a PvPer but a bully. I myself too lost all my caps and aid on survival mode, but I'm disinterested in farming regulars, I'm looking for the worst possible mofos instead and ohboi worst possible mofos are really the worst. I'm loving them and I'd like to give a big shootout to every clever bastard that took me down. Keep up the good work!
---
I am on PC and that would be awesome. When are you available? And I'll have materials if you need.
---
I stopped caring about losing aid items after the second death, losing most of what I had on me actually made the food and water mechanics challenging and losing so many stimpacks actually made me take combat against players or the AI more serious and careful. Only thing I would change is the caps lost on death, because unlike the aid items you can‚Äôt store caps anywhere and I‚Äôm losing 270+ caps per death but only getting 70-100 per kill on average, it‚Äôs a little annoying, death should be a flat 100 cap loss and kills a 100 cap gain, unless there‚Äôs a bounty 
---
Thx :)
---
The modifiers are a little underwhelming, aren't they? I wasn't expecting it to be a grenade launcher though. Well done, regardless! 
---
No. 
---
Being cap poor is the perfect time to go in for pvp. It‚Äôs not going to get you the debuff if you can‚Äôt afford to drop whatever maximum it would be based on your level. You‚Äôd just lose nothing (gotta be mindful of aid, though) and have so much to potentially gain. 
---
I don't think you can get weightless with Sentinel in the same piece (like you can't get an instigating + 2-shot anything).  So don't worry too much about that.  
---
I can be on within 30 minutes my ign is XxHyperiusxX
---
Building camps properly takes a lot of getting used to. It‚Äôs good to look up tips and tricks videos to get ideas on what all is actually possible. Some tricks I use frequently are making round buildings, placing wires through doors or windows, pylons on rugs to run electricity anywhere, removing foundations from walls using doors, using windows in various ways (like my player vendor setup), etc. But it all takes research and practice. Pre-built camp‚Äôs would be tough in this game because the terrain varies so much all throughout the map. With some practice I was able to build camps like [The Mad Hog](https://youtu.be/-R8RE1_b0Mg) and [Helvetia Market](https://youtu.be/1y3ONQo0l5w) within a couple hours (decorating makes it take a little longer). 
---
I don't know why this wasn't obvious at the planning stage honestly. It seems many of us saw it coming a mile off
---
Thanks! I may add in the names and just leave the description blank until I find them 
---
As OP said, maybe you need headphones but it's actually really easy to use sound to find them
---
Would also be cool if we could join factions, like raiders BoS etc. And then face eachother in que matches and we launch into a town or something and go HAM, like deathmatch in ESO, and get rewards like caps, chems, armor, weapons that is designed for pvp 
---
I didnt realize there were so many of them. 
---
Great idea. Fits perfectly with what I assume was the intentional design of the meat piles
---
Omfg yes!! I've wasted so many caps readjusting because something I do/don't want isn't centered
---
because a TSE chameleon is going to be able to get the drop on you and kill you faster than you can spot him 
---
You definitely have the right ideas. What I would really like to see is nobody camping, since spawning and fast travel are artificial, so players should only ever find each other out in the game world and decide what to do. 
---
Another possibility is that after spawning, a player is invisible, and all other players are invisible to them until the timer runs out and neither is in anyone's field of view. Only then would everyone become visible to each other and only when someone turns in the appropriate direction. Again, everyone always being vigilant.
---
Another idea, any of the locations of the map could be spawn points, but when you die, or selects 10 at random for you to choose from. Fixed spawn points like train stations or vault 76 are a bad idea.
---
There are a lot of ways they could do it programming wise, and I hope they test some ideas while in beta because they apparently didn't in alpha. As is, I will not play survival mode again.
---
Hands down, it has to be the people. When I first heard that the new Fallout was going to be online, I was really worried that I would hate it. I don't play games online or with other people because I just enjoy doing my own thing. I figured I would still give it a try and just not talk to anyone else. I did the lone wanderer thing until about level 20 or so, and I started to get a little bored and felt like I was missing out on something in the game. I started to approach other players and I ended up finding a great group. It completely changed the feel of the game and made it so much more enjoyable. I still like going solo sometimes to just wander and explore the wasteland, but without the other people, I don't think I would have over 200 hours in the game.  
---
Can we also have "flying mode" while building CAMP please?
---
Week 4 weapon (instigating mirv fatman with + limb damage) seemed interesting. Week 5 is actually fairly strong (TS +25% fire rate +15% reload .50cal) enough that I might grind it out for my heavy weapons toon if I remember that week... but its over a month away and I might forget because I've found out real quick that survival kind of sucks. I'm not even that casual, it's just frustrating and poorly designed. Though in its defense, this was clearly and repeatedly stated as a beta. Hopefully by week 5 it'll be better.
---
I am as well horrible but just a suggestion look in here or google their are some crazy ass builds, i have seen duck and pigs for base. some really unique stuff out there. 
---
Having the list in the original post, containing all the names and only some of the effects, would make the people who read that post and who know the effect instantly aware of what information they can provide you.
---
Try milking Graham next time. You might get a better deal....
---
I might be in a minority of low level players but I don't want any gift from others. Not that I don't appreciate the kindness or think they are threatening me, I just want to play at my own pace without any kind of "boost", making/finding my own stuff =) 
---
That said, thanks a lot to those who are helping! It's always appreciated! (But I guess a "no thanks i'm fine" emote could be useful for a minority of us).
---
I feel if they traded it for raw flux that would be fair
---
I love this sub
---
"I have an idea"
---
*Doesnt check to see if its already been discussed  thoroughly*
---
Use search next time
---
I would consider the value of the anti-armor not making a laggy fireworks mess all over the walls when you shoot it.
---
Now that I am at lvl 98 I dont see the point in raising the cap limit. Im not a big trader and it seems that the 25K limit is just fine for all in game needs. I would like to see the vendors raised to something more than the 200 each as I spend a ton of time running around between them just to sell of the stuff I collect from events.
---
10x regular ammo
---
1x raw flux
---
= 10 ultracite ammo 
---
Pls bethesda
---
This was an odd bundle... So the chocolate chip PA skin was brand new, but all the other content (excluding the shotgun skin) in the woodland camp was available separately? 
---
I gather there isn't a desert skin for non PA as of yet? That might have sold the bundle for me!
---
Have you had Workshop or not?
---
100 caps maybe
---
Crouching still hides you on the map 
---
Fair. Didn‚Äôt need all the downvotes. 
---
Why do they all have the exact same hair cut? Is Vault 94 like 108 but able to clone 1 person and make both sexes?
---
As well as sugar and spices, because those are used in brewing.
---
Dont know about cameleon but i did manage to kill a 213 guy using a stealth boy while he was planting plasma mines by shooting one of them.
---
Thank you. 
---
nothing new people have been getting these and sheepsquatch hord notifications since the update was released
---
I don‚Äôt think flux is that difficult to get. I don‚Äôt farm it very hard and I‚Äôve still got 200+ of assorted stable flux in my inventory. 
---
Having said that, it‚Äôs supposed to be a challenge to get. Why does everything need to be easy to achieve?
---
It's fun hunting for the corpse it's like a treasure hunt. 
---
I'm right there with ya. I pick one game I know I'll probably play for years because I don't have time or money to spend on multiple games. I'm glad I chose 76 because I've been playing multiple times a week since beta and I think I've only hopped on BF4 once, and no other games... (besides that one night my friend was over and we kicked back, playing Road Rash on N64)
---
Yes, the caps loss is my main concern (and I'm only level 67 - yeah, I'm a miser). Perhaps have a system where you 'cap' the level of caps you're prepared to stake, but that will also be the maximum amount of caps you can take from another player.
---
I was thinking make a small area around train stations and directly outside the vault 76 door have the old slap damage setting and then once you exit the train station/vault 76 area it reverts to survival mode PvP 
---
E should work too
---
If they just forced people to make new characters I think that would be hardcore enough.  I was hoping for that, and I am a guy with awesome end game gear. 
---
I‚Äôm sort of lost, what does this mean?
---
That might be it.
---
Found a cave in the mountains waaaay up north in the mountains - I think it's by Bailey Family Cabin, because there's a fissure site relatively near the cave. As long as you're careful about the way you build you're safe from their attacks though and I otherwise only ever saw level 10-20 super mutants.
---
I did that too and Chally didnt like it one bit!
---
I thought it didn't. Good to know.
---
I can‚Äôt count the number of times I try and trade or I emote new players and they just start shooting. (Used to, now that survival and all that). 
---
I was wondering about this too!
---
Everything has a different value to different people. I probably would have paid up to 2k for that when I started a new character and was leveling it up. 
---
 Don't bother yourself with workshops now.  They are more of a liability than anything now.  That's the main thing that's changed that affects lower level folks.  
---
Wait, there's different weapons? Haven't followed the whole thing and only started yesterday after some months absence. Can you explain like im 5?
---
Oh shit, didn't notice the survival part. My bad.
---
In the new Survival mode all the players are invisible on the map, except for the three players who have survived on the map the longest. Their position is displayed on the map as it would be in the regular game. It just makes the leading players easier to hunt. But I agree that a search area surrounding the location of a top three player, rather than a pinpoint, would make it more interesting.
---
If someone probably without even bad intention shoots and kills my new sloth friend, is that it? Will he respawn at all or do I need a new one?
---
Have I had workshops? In the past, yes. At the time of attack? No. They're a waste of time and money in my opinion so I haven't bothered since BETA.
---
Not everyone wants that. You raise the limits and everything will just cost more. 
---
this is a pretty dope idea
---
I loved this game. Now I fucking hate that others can't seem to see how badly bethesda fucked all of this up.
---
Oh YES that's fantastic! Saved! Thank you SO much. Just what I needed. 
---
I don't bother with pvp for this reason... should be capped at 50 caps or something, that would be more reasonable. I'm level 225, I'm worth a small fortune but getting 100 or less caps a kill isn't worth it for me.
---
There is no "wrong" way to play.
---
 If you follow the overseers questline, you'll get the purpose; the holotapes and notes you find all over tell other parts of the story.  More of the story can be found on some of the terminals.
---
\&gt; Nothing to see or find?  
---
  There are hundreds of locations to explore.   &gt; 200 hours in, and haven't even been to the right side of the map.    And I'm sure there are a few locations on the west side I haven't found yet.
---
Unlike other versions, that I am aware, there's not a display map markers for all locations, even those I havent found perk..  So ya, early, the map looks empty.  
---
Dont fast travel, walk.  You'll find stuff, and don't limit youself to the roads - you'll find more stuff.
---
Here's a hint.  Whenever you find a map in some location, notice the thumbtacks? 
---
Hover over the thumbtacks, then press X (on PS4, anyway) Your map will be updated with a new location.
---
If you find a firetower or similar, goto the top, then pan around.  At some point, most will display "survey area" or similar.  Press X, more locations will pop up on your map. Blue for places you've benn, grey for ones you haven't.
---
That said, yes, some things, especially at the lower levels are tedious - unlike easy and normal mode in earlier FO iterations, 76 makes you eat/drink, so you wlll have to spend time taking care of yourself.   Inventory space (your stash) is also limited, so you will eventially have to manage that as well.    
---
You are still in the build your character and levels so you can survive on the right side of the map type mode.  There are several locations/events on that side that wil tie in with things you are familiar with from earlier versions of FO. 
---
What No Man's Sky did was actually a lot worse... Bethesda never blatently lied about their game. OP makes this point pretty clear in his post. Bethesda told us multiple times it was going to have bugs. You can hear the paranoia in Todds voice when he talks about how  ‚ÄúEvidentially, online games are hard, they have a few nasty issues... and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt always just work.‚Äù 
---
However NMS has evolved into an awesome game, a real success story. I'm glad I never requested a refund. Hello Games has also done this with no more income at all since launch. Bethesda is a lot bigger than Hello Games, AND they have a business model that will fund future development. People that were afraid of Fallout 76 on launch will be singing praises when they actually decide to get it a couple years down the road. 
---
Hell, you already see it all the time on this sub now. Everyday I see a post here saying " IDK why everyone said this game is bad, I just bougt it last night. Level 5 and having a blast!" 
---
**BECAUSE THE PEOPLE SAYING IT'S BAD ACTUALLY NEVER PLAYED IT AND THEY'RE PAROTING THEIR FAVORITE YOUTUBER**
---
Mine's thorofasgard, I should be on within 30, I'm finishing up something then heading home.
---
I've actually missed a photo of one too, I'll add that later. Here's the list of locations if you'd like to find them all . [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault\_dweller\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_dweller_(Fallout_76)) 
---
In the spring there's a lot of these little flowers around and I always have the impulse to get those red/purple /blue mountain flowers. 
---
I said algorithms not amount 
---
It‚Äôs math, the proportion of caps lost. 10-15% of current cap stash is applied to all users who die ingame in survival.
---
You may have not understood that +20 xp bonus and caps comes with a cost.
---
Or maybe bethesda just hates you and you get assigned a higher rate. Simply bc you‚Äôre special üëç
---
And given your hostility I would concur lolz 
---
Finally you don‚Äôt have to understand or agree anymore then they have to care lolz 
---
Ah okay. I haven‚Äôt played survival yet. This makes sense now. Thank you!
---
I fully support this suggestion :o
---
That would be a great game quest. Once you've picked up a token from each one the game gives you a prize.
---
Literally not a single mention of Nuka Grenades or Nuke Mines. I'm 1 shotting people with both.
---
What's your definition of playable? Because it was playable.... I played BETA and have kept every second of progression I've made. While I may have had my fair share of disconnects, I and many others were able to play the game... It just had bugs. And still does...
---
Sounds good I‚Äôll send you a friend request when I get on.
---
Then feel free to do so. Walk away if you want. But throwing a tantrum because others still enjoy it won't make them hate it too.
---
Most of the 'better PvP' post are whiny bullshit that wants the game restarted because at some point in time people though that gear thats perfect to troll slap damage environment where positioning means nothing is actually the best gear in game.
---
This post, on the other hand, is all about making an interesting arenas for engaging PvP encounters and you are getting my upvote.
---
Excellent write up, learned a lot about why I couldn‚Äôt seem to kill certain people. It does make me sad I don‚Äôt have assassin or sentinel stuff though. Hope bethesda looks at this and take a lot of info from it. 
---
Why are you even subbed here?
---
I'm glad someone said it.   I need at least another 200 lbs.
---
I completely agree. The terminal outside the vault refers to a key card that is carried by the Vault Ambassadors. So I'm assuming when it does open we'll have to find one of these keys on any one of these guys and gals to gain access. 
---
It‚Äôs just like any other item bud. You can switch to adventure and trade/sell/use it on other characters. 
---
I know right? Theres a mod that does that, but only you can see it. Still cool though. Hopefully they do thos at some point. Maybe the bags were just easier on the game, but as things get more stable we should see more improvements. 
---
I see, thank you very much
---
You mean "crash a server by duping" 
---
*I see who you are... 900 hours guy!*
---
As long as it gets the griefers out of adventure mode im game
---
Is it not theoretically possible that OP was killing mid-range players that are intentionally or unintentionally bankrupt? I'm assuming OP is a level 150, since cap rewards are doubled.
---
It actually looks pretty classy.
---
Did you check to see if the pieces were broken? Restart?
---
Someone tried hiding in gauley mine as #1. They chose to hide right at the end of the mine giving them no way out. I smashed thier skull with my fireaxe. It was a fun scavenger hunt I felt like a serial killer tracking my prey deep through the mine tunnels
---
As long as drinking beer improves my pool playing, immersion will be attained
---
I'm not chasing a weapon with Instigating in PVP mode... No one is ever at full health thanks to radiation...
---
But yeah, something is up with the legendaries
---
did it cost you $30? /s
---
I hope someone gets this
---
I think it had to do with the fact the US in the fallout combined many states together forming 13 commonwealths similar to the original 13 colonies and why the flags have 13 stars on them
---
so the free states being super anti government wanted to fractal off and be their own state which didnt exist at the time and why their logo is a star (representing states on the us flag) surrounded by chains (the government) and the chain is broken (meaning they're free)
---
Best suggestion yet. I'd give you platinum but have no coins. Have my upvote. 
---
I would say he was already probably a dick and the weed had little impact on that. Nice to know you judge people based off drugs though. As if you know for a fact the weed is what made him an angry guy.
---
THIS COMMENT RIGHT HERE 1000 TIMES
---
this is the exact fucking problem, this stupid fucking mentality that its okay to release incomplete games and pretend its fine. It should not take 4 months of LIVE SERVERS to make the game be in a playable state. This last 4 months needed to be entirely beta time. It effectively was, except we all paid money for it.
---
I would if that's what he had wrote. I think the other comments also disagreeing with his prejudice would also agree.
---
New faction?
---
I have seen the same!
---
Whaaahhh, that's horrific.
---
Saying that what's this Halloween candy and how did you get 500lol
---
 is it like meds?
---
Thanks for the info. I noticed yesterday I was unable to fix the KidSecure ID, despite having the resources and using various tinker's workbenches in the area. Looks like this bug may be have manifested in a recent patch.
---
Was the broken KidSecure ID removed from your inventory after the quest completed?
---
Maybe while they're at it, they can make it where you can loot your own paper bag when you are within proximity instead of having to click on it directly.  I still run into issues where the bag drops into the terrain/plants and I cannot click to pick my stuff up.
---
I do feel for the higher level players I've just farmed 14000 caps in just over an hour. I'm level 100 and it only took me Hunting the top 3 and locating there bases.
---
As I said it's nice having all these caps and being able to replenish them so rapidly but I do think it's unfair. 
---
Having quests be completable, not disconnecting twice a session, having graphics and textures load properly... Basic stuff I guess? I'm legitimately happy for you that you could grind through and have a good time but I wasn't. I didn't want to come home and be frustrated after a frustrating day of work.
---
I wasn‚Äôt aggressive. You‚Äôre the one that decided to be cunty in your response. A response that makes you seem quite young and/or immature, at that. 
---
You mentioned algorithms and subsequently made the claim that lowbies lose ‚Äúthe same amount‚Äù which is false because as you may know, 400 != 20. 
---
I don‚Äôt play survival because it‚Äôs a shitshow, as expected. Perhaps they‚Äôll balance things and figure a way to prevent people from getting murdered while they‚Äôre loading in etc. but until then it‚Äôs just not a mode that interests me personally. 
---
I can only give 1. The rest might be other people that disagree with waht you said. Enough to feel you deserve a loss of fake internet points.
---
Naw I mean like an Enclave version of combat or marine armor
---
It would be nice if there was a vendor that would sell stable flux randomly.
---
I started playing a new character for survival and it's so much more fun when I'm not risking the aid items and the caps I've saved up over time. The world is still big and dangerous and another player could be around any corner but regular enemies are more dangerous now as well and I don't carry the aid items to just power through a tough encounter any more. I don't think this should have been the default experience but I'm having a lot more fun with it this way. 
---
All good! Personally that mode just isn‚Äôt worth the stress for me at the moment. It‚Äôs definitely lucrative for some, though. 
---
I understood that reference...
---
1000 caps.  The rewards are did commensurate with the effort and risk.  
---
They are shitty because it takes a bit of work to get a legendary weapon? Shouldn't it take some effort? Do you feel entitled to get it for taking a picture drunk and naked or collecting 100 wood or scraping to get 10 copper?
---
Couldn't agree more
---
 this is old world sort of behaviour that needs to go and dissapear already.
---
This judge mental nonsense ruins lives. And what because he's smoking weed so he's an auto dick lol. Yeah come on...
---
Exactly.  I agree with current system in place.  Do not make them mods or you trivalize the drops.
---
However, I would prefer if it was even more grindy.   Yes I know, are you nutz?!
---
Take for instance, LOTRO, has Legendary weapons that gain xp on their own as you fight and slowly get better.   You can convert them into gems which can be slotted into other Legendary weapons as well.  So you can level them up and when you find a better one, change it into a gem and get some bonus on the new weapon.   Each legendary does come with different base stats and effects randomly as well.
---
Played about 10 hours so far, played with a team usually though not always co-located, maybe engaged about 30 players total and this all seems about accurate to me.
---
Everybody knows you never go full Reverse Hobo
---
I'd love to give a fun reason, but it's simply because Bethesda really really suck at making hair and this is fine as a default for ghouls I guess.
---
Is there an equivalent challenge in adventure mode for a legendary?
---
Can they do this via Xbox party?
---
Making them glow slightly would be nice, too
---
That's sounds interesting. Upvoted
---
Very curious how that happened then, because currently they way people kill others is usually activating pvp through workshops.
---
No one was making you come home and play it... Just because you bought it didn't mean you HAD to play it. All the updates have been free and will continue to be free forever. So I'm not sure what you have to complain about.
---
Sent/Ass isn't for trolling slap damage. And still waiting for you to release this meta changing build.
---
Unless it's a fever dream.
---
Also wanting fresh characters isn't being whiny it's actually being realistic, in past survival games when duping was found out to be on a large scale servers were completely wiped. Ark for a major example, after a year and a half of major duping a brand new cluster of servers came out after duping was mostly fixed and 90% of the server based moved to the new servers.
---
Bethesda can't wipe the Adventure servers the damage is done, but they could've just required a new character for the new servers.
---
You can't be naive enough to say that duping didn't have an impact on both the economy and the amount of legendary weapons and armor. 
---
You've made claims that you are testing a better meta shifting build how ever until your claims are proven to be true it's nothing but talk.
---
So much this!!!  I have felt the same way from the beginning, they told us exactly what to expect, flaws and all.  If everyone actually paid attention and listened it was right there in front of them.  I expected this game to have problems and slowly grow.  I have not been disappointed in the least bit.
---
I still drop Nukashine for them
---
So he smoked too much weed which made him angry lol?
---
Is that how weed works?
---
I agree.  I will never use prime receivers for this reason.  
---
Oh wow, that's something I absolutely can't understand.
---
Not trying to offend you. I'm just curious, because for me camp building is the only late game content lol. I think half of my playtime I have spent in my camp.
---
To be fair. More complex structures are a pain in the ass sometimes and it's frustrating how many dumb restrictions there are. But some basic little shacks are super easy! I would say after 15 min learning the basics, you could build better stuff than they could offer in the atom shop and after 2 hours practising you could build really cool basic structures.
---
You should watch a few guides on YouTube. Maybe you will lern to love the settlement system.
---
If you really just want a pre set structure, you could build something with a small foundation after a guide and store it as a blueprint.
---
Should be renamed PvP Survival or PvEvP since you ARE surviving the environment. Environment includes creatures and the need to eat and drink.
---
Ok. I can only explain the second part, but what happens is when a person is crouched, you can NOT VATS them until you hit them normally. This is why you‚Äôll see a lot of people crouching everywhere across the map.
---
Vault Lunchboxes we‚Äôre going to be loot boxes before EA got in trouble for it.
---
Fair. 
---
Those are aid items. They don‚Äôt scrap when you ‚Äúscrap all‚Äù junk at a bench like it does cooking oil
---
Pretty obnoxious of them to do that AND include daily challenges to craft like 50 of them. Not super difficult still since you can just run to that farm in the southwestern area of the map and enough grab corn/razorgrain to choke a dozen Brahmin in one pass...but still, if it‚Äôs considered crafting an item then it should count. 
---
How much for fried Jacket and BoS jumpsuit ? I would like to buy them as a package deal ? 
---
Yeah exactly. I've never been that bothered by they're textures and art style over all. I think their games are actually really beautiful in their own way. But, the one thing that always gets to me is how bad the hair is!
---
I  wouldn't worry about it too much. We make up the rules and the points don't matter
---
I suspect the player vending machines will share the stash space the way the Fermentor does so I hope there‚Äôs an increase because my excess melee weapons, and aid items weigh more in the stash than in my character and I‚Äôm going to need extra stash space just to run my future weapon, armour and aid empire lol
---
Not sure but it clearly needs to be fixed because it's impacting people that aren't initiating PVP. If I wanted to deal with PVP and losing my caps, I'd go run around in survival mode.
---
Like the Hunter/Hunted event. Been saying this for three days.
---
I agree with increasing the vendor's cap inventory - I think limiting it was fine before now and I get that the point was to limit our ability to just exist by buying supplies. With the introduction of survival mode though we've got people potentially dropping hundreds of caps per death and picking them up on kills - it makes sense to re-evaluate the games economy with that in mind (not to mention player stores are going to affect this too). 
---
I like the idea; but please for the love of god quit trying to push this agenda of forcing new characters for survival mode.
---
If anything, make it where you can copy a character over without items or anything. Just the levels remain.
---
The prospects of leveling 1-50 again; let alone dealing with the awfulness that is the perk card system and quality of life perks that you're practically required to equip but come at odd levels makes leveling a chore. 
---
The EXP bonus on survival would have to be about 75% for it to be worthwhile with everyone being forced to make a new character. 
---
There were people claiming that this did not effect First/Second/Third markers though, have you seen this work that way?
---
No. Nobody wants the game to be like it was when the game started. But people keep complaining about the same problem with the stash limit. Just get rid of some stuff you‚Äôre not using, or I assume you like to carry a lot of stimpacks on you, so sell some to some lower level players who will probably be in need.
---
tryed to give this lvl 2 fresh outta the vault some excavator power armour in overseers C.A.M.P. and a super sledge he didnt pick it up even though i did thumbs up and follow me he still thought it was a threat i think i gotta had to take of my xo-1 with red lights.
---
All for this. It is a deathmatch, fortnite meets call of duty, shits gay. I like it but it isn't survival mode. No one can hide or utilise stealth properly and a good sniper build.
---
I hope this post gets noticed. You have my vote. 
---
I think the main problem with the vendors is that everything costs too much. If they were to make the barter rates better, vendors would be more worth our time.
---
Wholesome fallout moments.
---
The blaster is not in a dome. It‚Äôs in the toxic valley, and a key you find with it starts you on the way to finding the dome key. 
---
I‚Äôll be there. If I see you I‚Äôll say hello
---
Then good on them for perfecting their build and using it properly
---
Personally, I think there is enough storage now for loot items, but I would like to see dedicated space for base crafting materials and stacking aid items such as stimpaks and radaway that don't count against the weight limit.  Also a way to transfer items between characters on the same account.
---
From the trailer it appears to be a first person camera mode of some kind.
---
Yeah but honestly afk farming sounds more like a chore than actually playing the game, worrying about the crashing/players destroying your base and the server time-outs. If someone actually tried to abuse this i honestly think it would just be lower levels trying to rush to 50. 
---
I'm all for a free fire zone lol. Those campers are annoying but I've figured out how to bypass them. All for it though. 
---
You can scrap blueprints (which are automatically made when you move your camp) and all the items will be placed in your storage, allowing you to place them individually.
---
Bug seems to happen with certain camp items in the build being flagged as floating or interfering with some other item, etc.
---
I will likely never move my camp due to this.  Max budget huge building with many decorations... would be way too much effort to do it.
---
Good for you. 
---
They must be good weapons to build yourself such a high horse.
---
Its not your job to tell other people the proper way to entertain themselves by playing the game your way- which is apparently the only correct way. 
---
Anyone here on PS4 with the paladin paint?
---
When i first tried and it didn‚Äôt work i was in morgantown around really low level ghouls which i would normally one hit. The time i actually got it to work was near top of the world against high level super mutants that a crit shot wouldn‚Äôt kill right away.
---
I believe it showed up with Patch 7 a few weeks back.  No fix that I am aware of.
---
üòÄ
---
Cranberry Relish is +10% XP, I presume you don't have the recipe yet
---
Stash limit of 400 was not a problem.
---
Duping was a problem.
---
Server disconnects were a problem.
---
Everyone one-shotting legendaries with TSE was a problem.
---
"I guess you would prefer the game stayed the same as it was at launch and have nothing change then?"
---
In many ways, Yes.   I would have preferred that the stash limit remained the same.  I would prefer the state of the economy at the beginning where there was no TSE on every single account.   I prefer the community where it was when released were there was virtually no griefers and most people had trouble finding people to PVP because vast majority just liked doing quests and exploring.
---
Its the players that exploited and ruined the game.  Its the rampant griefers now that push some away from the game.  I played it about 3 hours per day on average, every single day... Until I started getting griefed at camp and people trying to PVP.  I do not play PVP and when I dont fight back, dont take that as invitation to annoy me for 30 minutes following me around shooting/meleeing me everywhere.
---
Is it fortune finder, perceptibobble, or panapictagraphist?
---
Lol what is this, the judge mental guys alt account or something. You have replied to nearly every comment saying the same thing.
---
If this was your original comment you should have just said edit and apologized rather than trying to persuade everyone you were correct to judge him.
---
This doesn't bother me as much as Party Boy not working with the new alcohols. 
---
I mean I can understand some cases (even if they disappointment) such as the Rad Ant Lager base being 50 weight and if it worked that'd be 150 weight. But at the same time; why not change Party Boy to increase the duration of alcohol as well. That way at the very least the new alcohols could benefit from additional buff time.
---
In the case of rad ant lager +50 weight for 2 minutes is practically only good for fast traveling when you'd otherwise be encumbered. 
---
Check your anti-virus quarantine. Apparantly the exe is sometimes seen as a virus. When I checked mine there were four copies of it.
---
That's not intended.  Didn't they reduced slap damage to 0 last patch? One of you must have owned a workshop or contested one lol
---
I can do a 3 star Furious/something/something Cultist dagger. It's a good knife. 
---
Are you trying to find a weapon for the new skin? 
---
I guess this wouldn't help. 
---
My teammate just broke his Excavator leg the other day in a nuke zone and was wondering why he was so low on weight.  Didn't realize it was because it was a broken leg piece that caused it for a good 3 minutes.
---
You know you laughed. Admit it. 
---
I would think that you have hit the nail in the head with your comment.
---
They did this BECAUSE they were planning to include booze-crafting challenges.
---
150 copper please - gt KnowledgeHound 
---
Ok, I‚Äôm glad people are able to joke on this subreddit.
---
.50 Refined has the highest damage of all .50 receiver for Hunting Rifle, but it still 1-2 points shy of Hardened .308. I think it's done to compensate difficulty with ammo - you can craft .50 cal ammo with bigger amounts than .308. I used .50 because of that (and the sound of un-surpresed shots of .50 cal)
---
Nope. That is only if you have a bounty that you can‚Äôt afford to pay off in Adventure mode. In Survival, bounties work differently - someone else pays the caps to place the bounty on your head. 
---
Go to a river, spam your collect water button about 100 times. Walk through any wooded area and collect fallen wood for like 5 minutes. Go back to your campfire and you can have 50+ bottles water and some exp for 5 minutes total work. 
---
No ive had my sugar and spices scrapped when I dont want them.
---
Slightly unrelate but I have stopped using rad ant lager because upon fast travel the +50 carry weight becomes -50 carry weight.
---
Has anyone else experienced this behaviour?
---
Doesn't it show that on your status screen already? I don't think the UI needs more clutter. 
---
They really dont spawn for you?
---
I'm getting close to lvl 90 and find it crazy annoying that every 10 or so Whitesprings run I do is populated with the golfer fuckers. 
---
Only lvl 9. Total waste of time. 
---
Many thanks my friend. Greatly appreciate it!
---
**(breaks after slighly going off the sweet spot in only one lock)**
---
Np happy to help :)
---
You forgot about all the skill it takes to repeatedly tap the jump button while doing this! Seriously though whatever. If they have fun with *literally* not moving and doing this barebones pvp more power to them I guess.
---
Please check the screenshots. The basic .50 cal receiver deals more damage than the refined one. It's also why i made this thread.
---
Yes something like frost or dust would be amazing 
---
Yeah sure it's simple too bypass such players, and you still can trade in adventure mode and all that, but as someone who loves the concept of survival i dont like this ''cheaty'' way. I could just stay in adventure mode for good and ignore every player, but this is exactly why this game is most of the time boring as hell :D I don't care about campers, one shot builds and getting killed over and over again for no reason or heck ''Balance'' (whatever that means in a Survival Genre). Would just be nice to see some people cry, because they can't abuse simple game mechanics anymore. And why not with some Lore-fancy and funny explanation like simple placeable turrets that protects everyone.
---
Unfortunately there isn't one for adventure mode.
---
my stash box i full of legendaries and materials and im already at 789 i need to have my power armour to have some weapons on me to eliminate some storage of the stash box  
---
I put unwanted stuff in the Overseer's chest. My username checks out.
---
Hahhaha get it because the username is relevant to the comment!!!11!!!!!!1!
---
Apparently this is a side effect according to folks.
---
I didn't notice if when I drank it. But I also crashed I believe, and I haven't drank it since lol.
---
That‚Äôs bullshit
---
Sure I can see that.  
---
What about all the junk i have in my stash and i have some weapons and armour that i need and need to put in my stash because of the over encumbrance 
---
I can't, I'm at work and imgur is blocked. If what you wrote is right it's strange - on previous account I've learned all possible .50 cal receivers and Refined had the highest damage.
---
I spent the last while killing legendaries at West Tek and Watoga, not a single kill went towards the 25 needed.
---
If the damage was scaled up for PVE both for and against the player, I would actually prefer this and consider switching over once the other kinks are worked out for survival mode.
---
Everyone should basically have what is currently about 30-40% legendary bloodied health and damage as default, and then no legendary effects.
---
I was just about to jump into survival Ailey for the legendary. Did the counter actually show 25/25. I‚Äôve read if you don‚Äôt do most if not all of the damage it won‚Äôt count. 
---
I did the run at level 6 after I lost my blade. Find some high levels farming WS and do the follow me emote to ask for help.
---
Yeah, there are a couple 'fetch' object encounters. The other variation is just a brown suitcase laying by itself with a note inside. Don't waste your time. It's usually a 'lealther left leg' or a 'pipe' or some other piece of trash item. You don't get any xp or caps for finding it.
---
The counter didnt go up at all. I was solo killing them.
---
Thanks for the post I thought they were other 76‚Äôers that didn‚Äôt make it. Never noticed they were from another vault, and there‚Äôs about double the amount out there vs ones I‚Äôve found.
---
They can‚Äôt make a limited time challenge for a limited time item unless they got it all worked out. 
---
If you use it consistently, then yes, keep it. But if you find a legendary that you don‚Äôt use often, then sell it or give it away. And as for the junk, of anything you don‚Äôt need 700 steel/ wood do you? It is really common anyways.
---
200√ó7 isn't 7000, LoL.
---
Shame Bethesda 
---
When you have no skills you start calling farming legendaries or caps a skill.
---
I've heard they have to be the legendary enemies that have a * in the name.
---
Plenty of enemies in those areas spawn with just a Legendary prefix but no stars. 
---
I belived that too, i was really excited when i found the refined today, but for some reason the basic 50 cal deals 146 damage, the refined 50 cal 144 damage. Hardened 308 deals 146.
---
Did the counter actually reach 25/25?
---
I guess now we gotta record our challenges and submit a ticket. 
---
It would be nice if they specify that since the devs clearly know that zero star legendaries spawn
---
On all day gamer tag TLF VileNeptun6
---
Since Survival BETA has been active I personally have had a couple of occasions where an aggressive player was repeatably hitting me or shooting me and probably wanted me to retaliate and then do their best to kill me, but they can't hurt me anymore, which is hilarious, and I will usually stand there do the help emote to be sarcastic, which is like laughing at someone trying to insult you.   
---
Thank You BGS for this addition to an already awesome game.
---
I guess it only serves the purpose of letting you fast travel to a vendor location and then limp all the way to the shop :P
---
**+10 Rads**
---
agreed
---
The limits placed in the game keep the illusion of scarcity, which is kind of important for a post-apocalyptic game. I'd be happy with vendors caps be equal to what you've sold, kind of silly that I sell something for 300 and the vendor only gets 40 caps back.
---
I was on the fence about survival mode but as soon as I saw the patch notes I decided to nope out of it. Too much bullshit for little to no reward. Just look at the state of the 'rewards' for the weekly challenges. Im still a bit confused as to what they were testing in house when they announced it tbh
---
I feel like giving away a players exact position in a survival mode defeats the purpose. This would be a positive change imo.
---
I feel really  bad for you but this is why it‚Äôs so vital to read the patch notes before logging in after an update especially with a completely new game mode, the patch notes always come out during maintenance so they are available to read before the game comes back online. A link is posted here on reddit and over on Twitter shortly after the game is pulled down for an update. Thank you for sharing as others will now be able to learn from your experience.
---
And it shouldn't be a small radius. Maybe make it as big as a nuclear blast radius. Give it a little challenge. 
---
a free roaming camera option would be nice
---
Yeah you‚Äôre almost certainly right, I just hope that they figure out more engaging/fun ways to motivate people to play more going forward. Disabling a perk in this manner frustrates me because it disregards the existing rules and implementations of said rules. How is cooking considered crafting yet brewing isn‚Äôt? They should at the very least update the verbiage of the super super perk so that it‚Äôs clear what does and doesn‚Äôt count as crafting. 
---
Yeah, it's a bug.  Go into the exchange menu with your stash box and you'll be able to see it.
---
Is it too late for me to pick this game up? I've put like 200 hours in Fo4 and I tried 76 when it first came out but it felt so grindy and bland 
---
the hardest part about getting (most) stable flux varieties is not the flux, its the hardened mass - drop rate on that has been very low last couple WS runs I've done.
---
At least intert flux can be used as water..and for my build, intert flux weighs less than purified water.
---
I love your idea but hear me out. How about a server that the only outfit is a dress and the only weapon is a rolling pin? 
---
Mad house wife server if you will.
---
Apparently you didn't read what I wrote. Storing the new rewards is an issue. What is the point of winning rewards if you can't keep them?
---
Dodgy confirmed doesn‚Äôt work. Check my other post.
---
Also, Nuka grenades and mines can be shot easily in vats. Skeet shooting is super easy if you have a vats oriented handmade or an explosive gun.
---
Unconventional strategies like yours only work in specific situations, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be using mines on a scarecrow, and they can shoot your grenades out of the air or you first.
---
Not to mention that those grenades are tough to find and make.
---
Could you be a darling and not use "gay" as a derogatory term? Thanks.
---
Oh ok, thank you for your contribution.
---
Ok, thank you for your contribution.
---
By trolling the slap damage I mean that the majority of tactical and positioning advantages achievable in adventure mode was to slap person, stand still, wait for them to try shooting you back while standing still and then shoot em. This is the playstyle that has driven the sentinel pieces upwards, and its useless now.
---
I obliterate sentinel/assassin/tse guys with zero problems. I am obliteraded by builds that I have serious troubles fighting with. I met hundreds of enemies that I can take on with ease, I was entering a traps where three guys tried to spawn kill me and I was able to load, gain position and kill them all despite being shot before I loaded, so I assume that I know my stuff. I seen three guys total that sported the new meta and I seen their gameplay. They were moving in a way that prevented sentinel and cavalier effects to give them any bonuses yet somehow they could 1v4 guys fully decked in such gear.
---
The fact you disbelief my words is irrelevant for their accuracy, and while you might now doubt this, three weeks from now you will agree with me.
---
I'm not denying that duping had great influence over the player market. But part of this influence was to arbitrarily select some specific item combinations and to duplicate these in batch, flooding the market, I agree. My point is none of the effects that made these items desirable and hence duped are necessary for the builds I fought, as their movement prevent them from using cavalier or sentinel, and as their shots are not explosive.
---
My build - my source of accomplishment, my proud creation - made sentinel-assassin build obsolete, and every sentinel I met would attest for that, and it was not even an anti-sentinel build but an all-purpose one. The new meta I am talking about, which I haven't achieved yet, makes my build obsolete and irrelevant besides to farm on those sentinel weaklings or the people who thinks they are actually strong.
---
If I were after caps, not after a challenge, I'd rather go 1v3 against three guys with old meta than 1v1 with one of these new meta fuckers. If there are some full assassin-sentinel PC guys that want to donate me caps, I am always open for a dance.
---
If on the other hand there are guys who know what I am talking about, then sorry I must git gud before I'll go after them, I learned my lessons.
---
I apologise. Sorry dude. You asked nicely so I'll remove it, meant not offence. 
---
There is enough room now, but won't be if you want to complete quests and keep what you win.
---
Actually, I'm wrong.  They can exist together.
---

---
Explosive combat shotguns were a major mistake IMO. I laughed and said oh hell no the first time I saw someone with one. This is going to be bad
---
Well what‚Äôs the point in keeping a crap ton of legendaries if you rarely use them? All I‚Äôm saying is, you don‚Äôt need everything that is in you‚Äôre stash box. Get rid some junk that is pretty common, get rid of legendaries you don‚Äôt use. If you clear up the space, then you‚Äôll have the room for those weekly legendaries.
---
Survival mode weekly challenge gives a Legendary named weapon.
---
I was wrong
---
Dude, it's a joke. 
---
I think there is a bug right now where it only counts three star legendaries.
---
Sounds like you're whining.
---
What he‚Äôs saying is that your ‚Äúreasonable price‚Äù will have to continue to rise if the amount of available caps rises here, you have to be able to see that‚Äôs how an economy works. 
---
Right, I agree on that problem of the opposite extreme.  If people Stimpack like crazy, a battle could go on forever.  You don't want that either, and I think that limiting it to one active Stimpack at a time helps.  But the paper thing was an issue long before Survival Mode even existed, which is why I question if that's what Bethesda actually wanted.
---
What is fundamentally comes down to is a question of how long should an average confrontation last, and then figure out how to tweak the mechanics to get there.  Right now, anywhere from 0-2 seconds doesn't really cut it.  I feel it really shortchanges the fun possibilities an open world offers to have it be over so quickly.
---
Go back and look at Scorchbeasts.  When you're low-level, Scorchbeasts are terrifying.  But, they also don't kill you in one hit.  You get a moment to think.  Do I run?  Do I hide?  And often, there is a way out of it if you're careful.  To me, PvP should be similar.  If you confront someone, use your best weapon, and realize this was a horrible mistake, perhaps there should be enough time to get out of there.  But right now, all of this is moved to the front.  By the time attacks are launched, the battle has already been decided.  Often whoever saw their opponent first wins.
---
Cap rewards should largely be generated from the game itsself, rather than players caps pool. I always empty my caps out at vendors before logging into survival. I imagine most everyone else does the same. 
---
So why do quests to win items if you aren't going to keep the items?
---
Lots of nice dresses in fallout and legendary rolling pins drop from everything so yes, sounds like plan üíÉüèΩ
---
I mean, every npc exept the robots attacks you on sight.
---
Reinstall fallout 76? The mod may have permanently altered some of the setting.
---
Well, there are people posting about how they died 5 times to a spawn camp at Whitesprings, apparently unable to figure out they should stop spawning there after kill #2......so yeah, a whole lot of people trying PVP without doing much thinking.
---
You‚Äôre reaching. You took my original comment out of context to make such a dramatic statement. 
---
Can I get some of that Black titanium? I need to finish excavator quest. Gamertag - rhynoplaz
---
the Email took that long becuase you have AT&amp;T as a privider LMAO
---
ye and make environment more hostile, aggressive and stronger, i mean a punch from a  supermutant should at least break someone's neck, they're like minihulks.
---
They have to have at least 1 star....and from my experience you have to have made the kill shot. 
---
Ive killed probably 30 legendarys since the start of this.....i hunt them all day in survival.....and only 12 have registered so far.
---
Im not positive. But it seems like the ones i killed with other people in events and such didnt count, when i let someone else get im shots or the kill shot so the loot was shared
---
I agree, or at the very least, make it an option to toggle on or off. It does get annoying when I return to camp and hear my turrets going off and can only target my turret going berzerk.
---
No problem at all! I enjoyed doing it.
---
What heavy gun
---
Scarecrows is excellent. About the only time I had fun with playing was by not engaging pvp except in the case of stalking wanted players and likewise being stalked. Though I am one of the invisible people. The scarecrows can go down really quick with a vats headshot followed by gamma gun burst while they sit there spamming vats. So there is a rather specific counter but the mode is just boring as shit to me.
---
I agree with our cap limit. There's really no reason why we should have a limit on how many caps we can have. When, and if, that update for players to place vending machines at their CAMPs ever gets released, a cap limit will make no sense and would render the vending machine and selling of items useless. ESO, another Bethesda game, doesn't have a currency limit (that I'm aware of) so why does Fallout 76? The ESO vendors also don't have a limit. I don't really see a problem with having too much currency. If it is a problem, then give us something to spend it on like ESO does with prebuilt CAMPs (just an example, but that'd be awesome), or make mods more readily available for purchase.
---
Because maybe they aren‚Äôt useful to you, or you an feel good about yourself when you donate it to another player. I‚Äôm more than willing to give away or sell some of the weak unique legendaries that I don‚Äôt use. They usually don‚Äôt benifit me and I have a normal weapon that is easily better than it.
---
So, just gonna walk by that first sentence from the comment you were replying to when you're "not sure what there was to complain about"?
---
Other opinions are allowed here. His are aggressively wrong but his opinion is welcome. 
---
I didn't even know the game had sentinel or cavalier pieces until this post. I'm about 180 hours in and I too have never seen one off those effects.
---
Yeah and then they casually slip in the question ‚Äúshould we kill the humans?‚Äù üòê
---
At least that‚Äôs what I thought I heard...
---
Yeah, I'm pretty much resigned to *this* character never doing Survival, because of the Aid problem.  Stimpacks are so heavy without Traveling Pharmacy, and yet, I want to keep several on me in Adventure because bottoming out on them is quite possible with Born Survivor, and the perk won't take anything other than standard Stimpacks (not Diluted, not Super).
---
Nobody ever said it was, he‚Äôs saying you spend 200+ caps fast traveling, and that comes out of your 7 vendors... 
---
So you are saying that there are 2 mice inside and driving that Mr. Handy...
---
Would be awesome but i doubt that anything like this will ever come to this game. Also there would have to be two different kind of armors for diluted and normal
---
Why remove it from the store if you're going to make sure people who purchase it receive the shotgun skin anyway? Seems like you could just notify the player about not having immediate access to the shotgun skin when they purchase it.
---
I think the non feral ghouls got the same treatment as humans: either dies to the scorched plague or turned into scorched themselves. Some of the corpses you find are ghoul corpses for example.
---
Yup. They died too
---
How does cloning work in Falloutiverse that you have a genetic haircut?
---
I think it might be multiplicative, because for melee there is a skill that ignores 75% of armor (Incistor, if I remember correctly) so with 50% on weapon it would result with 125% reduction with additive calculation, which doesn't make sense...
---
Also having this issue on PC. Got to this stage of the quest yesterday and having no luck repairing the Bracelet.
---
Submitted a response to Bethesda via ticket, hopefully they will pick up on this.
---
Starting a new character is almost mandatory for a survival type server. You can't call it survival if you can import a character that leveled up past Max level.
---
 What would be your point besides killing other players to play on a server at Max level?
---
 You now have a death mode that you can import your God character to.
---
I'm not doubting that a new meta can be created nor am I saying the current meta is undefeatable as even without Sent/Ass just rocking unyielding I can kill them it's all about how you play and how they do or do not react.
---
But again how the real world works is proof of concept. It is on you to show the world that what you say is true. Be it today or in three weeks it doesn't matter but in the mean while just know no one will change their mind until you prove your new meta shift.
---
Also personally I never really thought Sent/Ass was all that broken it was just a huge annoyance you had to go out of your way to get around like carrying grenades or certain weapons.
---
Lol. 
---
All the Garys had the exact same haircut
---
I wondered that myself. There was a video of someone using two pieces of armour that had 50% fall reduction on them and they proceeded to jump off one of the monorail pylons, landing hundreds of feet below with NO damage whatsoever.
---
If the game just adds up percentages and then applies them at the end (which that fall reduction effect must have done) then - 95%? No idea if it applies to weapons though. I'd be interested to find out using the Incisor perk with a 50% armour piercing power fist I have...
---
Appalachian molerats have starfish DNA, turn 'em to bits and they all regrow into new molerats...
---
How about they just get rid of the icons? They're fucking silly imo
---
Shame, feels like a bit of a kick to those of us with over 500 hours not playing survival mode lol. Oh well, that‚Äôs me out then. 
---
Try telling that to his 1/10 scale Taj Mahal built with caps and wonder glue!
---
I‚Äôve never hit the +1500 player limit so there is this theoretical amount of unused space that Bethesda has allowed that I‚Äôm not really using. 
---
Why not let me allocate +1000 to my stash and make my player limit be +500?
---
That's because 
---
A) you've used up all your plastic bulking things
---
B) you've bulked lead or aluminum, which weigh half as much when bulked.
---
Yep joining an sbq fight then getting iced after the encounter is not a pleasant surprise ...
---
Also just fyi, to show you tiny pieces of the puzzle I gathered, there is a new tier of godroll items completely neglected. Got several items of this type for caps lately.
---
Regenerating. Regenerating activates during fights when in PvP, as long as your opponent is far away enough from you. If you have one regenerating/sentinel piece on yourself, then you should be able to live through the loading period if the opponents there aren't the bastard meta build I referred to.
---
The distance it starts healing you from is about the maximum distance that you can sprint-jump and vats-melee your target without touching the ground, about 20 meters I suppose. With healing factor, this negates all damage that is not able to take you down within four seconds. So if you have no enemy players within 20 meter radius, yet you are being shot by four different players that stay 30 meters from you, you keep regenerating mid-fight.
---
This infomation is enough to redefine market once its made common knowledge, and you've just been given an extremely valuable tip, but the truth is that this new meta build is so much better than mine that I can still share this "secret".
---
They don't weigh more. Never have. Acid used to gain weight, but that was because a bulk gave 15 acid, and only took 10 to make. It weighed as much as 15 acid.
---
I was going to load up and save on spoiled food and bones just going into die... thought that would be funny as hell...lol
---
Glad someone did it! Ha!
---
When you go to the Blueprints tab, if there is a blueprint of your CAMP, you are normally able to Scrap it and break it into its constituent parts.  If that blueprint is missing, I don't know what to tell you.
---
Yes, the system sucks.  Bethesda should provide significantly more leeway when it comes to foundation placement.  That's why you see the floating CAMPs built around a single foundation.  It won't guarantee that you won't have placement headaches, but at least with respect to the ground, you'll generally be okay.
---
Again, what is the point of competing for awards if you aren't going to be able to keep those rewards?
---
\[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/3LXXotA.jpg?1](https://i.imgur.com/3LXXotA.jpg?1))
---
Hell yes. I'd take a complete game where I have to purchase the DLC if I want it later over a bugfest with free DLC any day
---
That is the best idea I've heard in a while. Hopefully Bethesda reads this.
---
Any
---
They were hunted down and killed off by crazy people in and around the Mire. There's various stories all around the area, with the conclusion under the chemical plant (You go there during the Radshield quest).
---
FYI, Ghouls, feral or not, are somehow immune to the Scorched Plague.
---
Gift emote would be great, but like a lot of things it could be misused to bait you in, but I do feel it would be a great addition.  
---
I used to gift all my known plans to a "new" player ( Under Lvl 10 ), but I'm collecting them for now and might put them in my vending machine when it's added.
---
Yeah the big gamer tag really ruins it for me..you should just see another person in the game world when you come across them, if you are looking everywhere carefully. Having the ui locate and identify other players is not immersive.
---
Yeah it feels like they could have communicated the ramifications a lot more effectively. Managing player expectations better would have lowered the amount of people who are seemingly blindsided by how much they‚Äôre actually dropping. 
---
Basically, they need to stop using vague language and just tell people what the rules and ramifications are exactly. 
---
Then go play those games, then.
---
lol Greetings!
---
Str15 already - so you are going for a melee build?
---
Do path of the winds...one of the critters there may drop a nice melee weapon.  This one spawns high mutants if a high level has been through recently - if you find them, go back later - you'll likely get low level scorched.
---
Since you'll be there already, explore toxic valley.  
---
Be careful @ grafton dam, though.
---
The overseers quest line will take you towards the ash heap, so will a Mystery of the veil questline.   While you are down there, hop over and  start the excavator quest, just don't build the armor until L45.   The start point for the excavator quest also spawns enemies relative to nearby players - you may have to go back later.  Ditto Lewiston.  
---
Meantime, start collecting screws and gears - you'll need them.  
---
(@20, the mole miners may be a problem.)
---
Top of the world may take you to places you dont want to be quite yet.
---
Fallout is super fun.  Works fine for me since day one. I play other online games so I‚Äôm used to crashes and glitches.  I don‚Äôt mind too much in any of them,  just a video game after all!
---
I dwell under the bridges near the abandoned waste dump.
---
There have been a ton of patches.  You have to download them all to run the game at all, so what they include is a moot point.  Hopefully they will be rolled up for you to minimize downloading.
---
Wouldnt the shield only add to the pistol meta? Besides most weapons are like 3 shot kills in Survival so firerate is king.
---
I see what you mean about the fall damage. I'm wanting to assumed Bethesda didn't over complicate everything and everything would be the same when it comes to percentages like this but not sure if I can lol
---
Eco, ammo, plans, materials, food and water. Stuff like that. But, if you want to keep yourself at the limit, then keep that level 5 somerset special. Since you can‚Äôt show them off to anyone in like a display case, then it‚Äôs pointless to keep it.
---
I‚Äôve killed players with bounties and didn‚Äôt get the caps that was marked. 
---
I saw a post about dumping caps onto extra characters before going in. 
---
Do you have a hangover? I noticed this when doing the Biv missions that I'd be overweight while doing them because of the Hangover effect which gives -50 carry weight. 
---
I completely agree, level past 50 means nothing so why have so many things tied to it?
---
Bethesda needs to be very careful here. They're already skating on thin ice as it is with this game. What's the problem with this mask situation? It's called fraud. If a company advertises something will be available in their advertising materials, but we come to find that it actually wasn't available, that's false and deceptive advertising (a form of fraud). Bethesda could legitimately have screwed up the drop rate, but based on comments from Bethesda staff that I've read, they didn't. It was intentional.
---
Apparently, Bethesda programmers pulled in (or reused) the same drop rates as the super rare items used in other parts of the game. While that's fine for ongoing events that don't ever end, that doesn't work for a 7 day event. If even one person intentionally bought Fallout 76 with the intent of getting one of those masks during the 7 day Fasnacht event, yet those masks never dropped for anyone (i.e., zero drop rate), then that person who bought the game was defrauded out of their money by false and deceptive advertising.
---
Promo materials have very strict rules on how you can advertise items within your product. Bethesda might want to be careful here or they could have yet another class action lawsuit on their hands.
---
*Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and this is not intended as legal advice.*
---
I can make a bunch of additional accounts and get around the daily cap limit, i can make additional characters to get around the daily cap limit.
---
its just stupid to be honest because its a hold over from previous fallouts. 
---
The Fasnatch event was annoying when I kept targeting the robots as well.  Let us turn off friendlies in VATS.
---
There's a note indicating that at least a group of them went to what would eventually become Underworld. The rest I would assume were afflicted with the the Scorch.
---
Very nice!
---
All hail bolsey :) 
---
While you‚Äôre right, Bethesda should be more clearly communicating to the players, avoiding vague language that isn‚Äôt properly setting expectations. 
---
So you're thinking 50% then 50% off that previous 50%. Not just 100%?
---
If you think that sent/ass was never actually broken then you just gained my respect because what you say is true. Btw read my other comment regarding regenerating armor piece.
---
If you say its all about how you play it then I agree even more because thats crucial and more effective than simply set, which I can attest to as my powerful mofo was repeatedly killed by a guy in hazmat suit, and just the day before we confirmed that my character can take 120 max-pure-damage BE .50 bullets before he died and I've been killed in less than seconds.
---
Its hard for me to share all I know when there's mayem out there I'd love to dominate but cant, but the more you dive deep into the changes in PvP group dynamics the less obstructed my points will be.
---
I'm ok with them only holding 200 caps but what annoys me the most is if at 0 and I buy 150 caps worth of stuff they should now have 150 caps not 45...
---
Yep I‚Äôve said this many times too. They don‚Äôt even need dedicated pvp servers. When PvP all legendary effects don‚Äôt count and weapon level difference canceled, so a new player‚Äôs level 1 weapon is as effective as a veteran‚Äôs level 50 weapon. All other shooter franchise work this way and are successful, nobody ever complained about unfair and griefing. And no magic armor can protect you when you stand still in a gun fight (which was a retarded idea from the start). No slap damage (already done), PVPers appear on map and crosshair in red color, others green. Within certain range PvPers can‚Äôt see other PVPers on the map, so they have to use their senses. Hardcore PvPers and PVE players can play on the same server just fine. 
---
Yes! With a radius based on your perception!
---
I guess thats true but i feel like they might not use the bethesda launcher for the steam release as other games exclusive to it prior dont require it. Have they made a statement at all about having it for they steam release?
---
I have received so many 1* legendary heavy Combat pieces.  I gave one of my new friends a full set of exterminator‚Äôs BOS with deep pockets.  Not great but good for a new level 50 with no legendary. 
---
But I mean, other than that and aid, you get so many of the outfits you end up dropping them.
---
Paint is the only real valuable thing.  Those seem to be about a 2-5% chance based on my results.  
---
Carnivore
---
Chameleon
---
Egg Head
---
Healing Factor
---
Herbivore
---
Herd mentality
---
Unstableisotope
---
Isn't that all you ever get? I've never gotten so much as a plan from doing them around 50 times now. 
---
Because there‚Äôs nothing to suggest that cash registers are coming to the game and you said they‚Äôd be here in a couple weeks. 
---
The topic isn‚Äôt about player vending machines but decorative cash registers. 
---
It's never too late! I've seen tons of people trying the game or again and giving it a second chance.
---
I think the way it is now is kind of bad anyways. The risk/reward ratio is way off. If I'm in a team I can kill like 10 people and get caps but then get killed once and loss more caps then I just got not to mention a stupid amount of aid items. As it is currently i dont like survival mode much lol
---
Were doing one on saturday morning about 11am uktime if thats any help?
---
Bump for curiously. Found an AA pole hook, and put the anti armor mod on it, and have incisor equipped.
---
THIS 100%! Holy crap, that drove me nuts. Who thought of that? They'd be behind me too, radtoad pop out in front of me, I vats and my character spins around and tries to shoot robots behind him. Geez. Remove friendlies or make some sort of priority system where hostiles are always tippy-top and friendlies get targeted last.
---
Could be a legendary ability, similar to Auto-Stim.
---
I saw someone mention selling CAMPS to other players and that sounds like the best solution :) build a CAMP, list it for sale thru vending, and sell for caps :) 
---
No more absurd than being able to stand like a statue and take no damage...
---
exactly
---
I have the original XBox One, and I never had half the issues that people were complaining about at launch.  
---
They did so in the update notes. But I see your point. 
---
My support for toggles.
---
That's...Hell, that might be enough of a troll to get me to actually pop my Level 159 ass into Survival Mode for ten minutes.
---
Haha yup. And then they follow it up with asking if they were born or made. It's lovely
---
I noticed once survival servers came up that Healing Factor was healing even in the middle of PvP fights, Though personally never thought of Regen doing the same. 
---
I'm personally not a meta builder, as I have always hated "META" as a thing, I'd rather do what I want than use the optimal path. That's why I've steered clear of Sent/Ass. I felt Unyielding gave me everything I needed and in most cases more, for a melee build that is.
---
You know you're on shaky ground when your response is "love it or leave it" to how the game's release *could have been implemented*. 
---
But then, you opened with the premise that you have to choose between quality-on-release or continued updates, so I guess you kinda started out there.
---
No, I'm jangles the moon monkey 
---
The fact is Bethesda botched their release of fo76, whether or not there is something worse is besides the point. I mentioned this in another post on this same thread.   
---
Bethesda could easily avoid all the problems so far by just releasing the game later than they did, allow beta to run longer than it was and get most of the major problems faced during release date to be fixed. They knew about the problems they would face, yet they released it anyway. This says something about how much they care about delivering quality.   
---
Majority of the people saying the game was bad, was describing the state of the game at release, not what it could potentially become(ignoring those trolling, saying the game is bad just for the sake of it and on the flip side, those who blindly defend the Bethesda without mind for facts). And the fact is the game is full of problems on release date. You don't really need to play the game to know the full extent of the problems plaguing the game at release when there were video evidence explaining the said flaws of the game. Albeit there were sure to be exaggerations here and there(the media do this quite commonly but that doesn't discredit everything that they have to say).   
---
With that being said, the game has indeed improved and Bethesda should be credited with it. However it puzzles me when i see posts saying why they don't get the 'hate' surrounding this game, because the game has improved since release with bug fixes and new content. If they were to play the game as it is on release, i'm sure they would perfectly understand why the game got such a bad reception on release and as a result a tarnished reputation now.   
---
i never get anything other than aid and ammo...
---
Sucks a donkey
---
Thanks for responding. I don't have many issues, just seems my loading time takes about 20-30 secs longer than those I play with and about once a day or two I crash back to home screen.
---
Getting another xbox for a different room and wondering if its worth the price difference to get the X over the S.
---
I know how you feel.  I thought about how hard it would be to carry this home on the bus...
---

---
I personally think that the areas you are able to fast travel to should have an area in which you cant pvp. As it is currently I see 90% of fighting happening at the fast travel points. Good luck trying to use a vender or the work benches.  
---
I would agree if there was a GM to watch over us (or a dungeon master like in D&amp;D) but I feel that would lead to people just killing their friends for caps.  Any idea how they could implement that but avoid the exploit? I genuinely want to know if you do have any ideas 
---
You know, we make a lot of global gameplay demands based around the Whitesprings, but perhaps the more appropriate answer is to fix the damn Whitesprings.  As in no CAMPs there.  None.  Period.
---
I agree.  They are very vague on the amount droped so yes when I die and drop 100 stims I'm a little shocked. That is way to many to drop in one death 
---
So far I have gotten a few scribe outfits, the initiate paint, and a bomber jacket. PLEASE GIVE ME THE OTHER PAINTS!!!!
---
In August 2016, if someone said that No Mans Sky would be thought of positively 2 years after release, you probably would have said the exact same thing you‚Äôre saying now 
---
Yeah I've had that myself.  I'm level 182 now but I've been partied with guys level 10-20 lol.  Even if they are not near me in the map they get a third of the caps from my kills.
---
Bro your fabrication skills are on point! 
---
Yeah, ‚Äúa random amount‚Äù could have been supplemented with ‚Äúbetween 0-100%‚Äù to make it clearer for folks that don‚Äôt understand. We‚Äôd obviously still have people who don‚Äôt bother reading and make complaint posts, but that can‚Äôt be helped no matter how clear the language. 
---
What would be the point? Enjoying the game as it should have been from the start; without having to deal with the chore that is leveling, let alone getting your perk cards for your build again.
---
I agree that to an extent gear transferring is a problem. I wouldn't want to transfer my main character into the current survival mode because it'd be a waste of caps and medical supplies. 
---
But if you want a true survival mode; even one requiring fresh characters. Then they need to take the time and iron out the problems first. Such as things like power armor not having legendary perks to make PA worthwhile in PvP encounters. The issue of assassins-sentinel armor pieces. Energy weapons not having an energy-resistance penetration perk/Anti-Armor prefix not working for energy weapons. So on and so forth.
---
I play a medic support build. 90% of my stims go to healing team members so I need to carry 100s of them and also they weigh to much in the stash box
---
I welcome our overlord sky liberators.
---
I on the other hand have my greatest fun when I spot somebody that outmatches me in every regard and then when I evolve to the point where I take them down. This is why instead of farming easy caps on loading travleres, I jump servers until I find a mofo with 1h+ time alive and go after him. This makes understanding, redefining and creating the meta the crucial part of this playstyle.
---
I dont think I'll play survival mode until they tweak it some. I dont like it much as it is.
---
People who are saying that they shouldn‚Äôt allow character transfer from adventure mode to survival aren‚Äôt making a good point. They are just delaying the same issue. Yeah for a few days or a week there will be no high levels with op guns but after a week the no life‚Äôs who don‚Äôt have a job or don‚Äôt participate in anything school related will be level 100 again and they will be finding all the new duping glitches and there will be high levels with op guns in survival mode again. There‚Äôs nothing u can do. Leung is transfer our characters is just saving us time because in the end the result is the same. 
---
Bulking saves weight.  Not a lot, but enough that you can fit the bulk stuff into your stash when you're done.
---
Or fast traveling to your camp to scrap, store, etc. 
---
I'd like this as well as leveled servers for adventure. I'd like to go back through with higher level enemies instead of whitesprings, Harper's Ferry and Westek over and over
---
Thats an evil move to do to a low lvl but i like it lol
---
Nobody who was informed on the game expected a ‚Äúpolished stone‚Äù. First, let‚Äôs remember what company we‚Äôre talking about here. Second, they made it very clear that the game and the BETA would have an absolutely massive amount of issues. Is it acceptable that they released it in that state? No. It‚Äôs even baffling. But don‚Äôt act like they didn‚Äôt give us a warning about what we were getting into. 
---
I learned it
---
This may help. There are a bunch of previous threads discussing the AA effect.  Search for "Anti Armor"

STRANGER DANGER!
---
Dude that was me!!! and my friend Archangel! I woke up in the Mire lol got murdered by a level 21 legendary glowing mole rat too.
---
You were my first interaction with anyone in this game after my friend told me how hed met really cool people - and you proved it.
---
You rule dude. And thanks for opening that safe. Still using the gun I got out of that haha
---
Why not make different stash containers hold different things? For example, dressers and armoires hold appeal only. That makes sense to me. Coolers for food and drinks (which should also keep them from spoiling or at least slow the spoiling process down), ammo boxes for ammo, (even though I don't think there is an ammo box stash container, that or I haven't found it yet), footlockers for junk, etc., etc.. This was (kindda) done in Fallout 3 (items in dressers weren't found in other stash boxes you actually had to get items you stored in your dresser out of the dresser, and I never played 4 so dunno if it was done there), so why was that option taken out of FO76? Even if you don't make different stash containers hold specific items at least make them separate stashes. If you put that legendary shotgun in your cooler for whatever reason, you have to retrieve it from the cooler (or any in-world cooler). Or keep the stash box as is and any items you want to be able to retrieve from other stash boxes you have to make sure you put it in a stash box. This is just an idea, so I realize it would need some tweaking, but it'd be a start (such as working out the issue between ammo box storage and ammo boxes with random ammo).
---
Good things come to those who wait 
---
Nice try Todd 
---
To each his own, I love figuring out how things work and what's the best. But I like to do it on my own terms what I want. I.E even if Melee was sub optimal I would find out how to best make it viable. But just equipping what makes things easiest isn't my cup of tea unless it aligns with what I want regardless.
---
Sure, why not both. But I feel like it might make it harder for lower level players to level without the white springs lvl60 enemies that give those sweet exp.
---
Maybe just divide it in 2. Lvl1-100 and lvl 100+ or something along those lines. No need to make it that closely divided as for survival I think 
---
Epic job. I was curious, do all characters on your account get the reward, or does the character completing the challenge get it? 
---
&gt; how the game's release *could have been implemented* 
---
Which of the previous replies was the constructive criticism you're referring to?
---
I have seen multiple in the bunker but i'm not sure that we carry more then one at a time since we can't see the count because of the quest diamond. I have gotten the lvl 3, lvl 4 paints, and the bomber jacket from inserting one to finish the quest. 
---
Dude I‚Äôm struggling to keep my cap count about 3000 lmao 
---
They were supposed to release woodland warrior today anyway. The have temporarily taken down the wasteland walker paints to include the shotgun. 
---
This information comes from the Bethesda.net page and official comments made on other posts üëçüèº
---
And so the true raider gangs were born
---
You mean the bomber jacket?  Because I've gotten two... &gt;.&gt;
---
I'll try it later and let you know how I get on.
---
There would be a lot of things they would have to work out before A true survival server came to fruition.
---
 What they just threw on us is absolute trash.
---
This is all hopes and dreams anyway none of this will ever come to be because Bethesda is Bethesda they do what they want.
---
 I have to seriously question their leadership though. I don't know what they were thinking or even if they did think.
---
 I just wanted an adventure mode with unrestricted PVP and a few other rules and place.  Not necessarily a PVP server that's what the new death mode can be for.
---
 I just wanted the added danger of other players being raiders.  Which means they would also have to re vamp the bounty system.
---
 One example would be when you die as a wanted person half of the stuff you drop gets deleted from the game therefore you can't have a friend come kill you and pick up your stuff.
---
 So many rules and weapons and armor that need restructured its never going to happen
---
I agree with you on reading terminals and listening to holo tapes. in my experience of 300+ hours so far the story kind of fills out when you actually take the time to read and analyze or listen to the holotapes. 
---
I wanted to see how to go about acquiring some of these legendary weapons in Survival Mode.  Unless you are equipped to the max in terms of armor, weapons, and perks, you can forget about trying to do a quest or event.  There was someone getting their check cashed almost every 20 seconds.  How could you possibly do an event and watch your back at the same time?
---
I heard that items built in camp occupied a different amount of budget, the higher your level the lower the amount, so people could get maxed out budget because they had "old" camp elements.
---
That was a few patches ago though. 
---
Also include a way to craft Cooking Oil too from Corn and Wood for the cooking and Plastic for the container.
---
Sugar should be included in the recipe for Fasnaucht Donuts instead of Salt. It just makes better sense. Also fix Royal Jelly that drops from Honey Beasts.
---
... And then had to wait until level 25 to use the Blade of Bastat
---
Also, a full bubble or cylinder view of bounds would be nice. Sometimes I wanna know if that monorail pylon is within range to build on top of it. 
---
My point exactly... pillaging, looting, backstabbing... Rose is sitting pretty high up on her horse at the Top of the World.  Why should she get to enjoy that and not us...?  
---
I wish we could at least have other storage boxes separate from the stash. Those could even have a smaller weight limit. 
---
I assume you‚Äôre responding to the wrong guy but hell yeah, that Bull Acid glitch was dope for a while. 
---
Seems like a lot of loading and hassle just for caps
---
I've plaved for about 6 hours never even  seen another person (I did mostly stay away from spawn points like scrapping in the wild instead of at train stations completely avoiding anywhere even remotely close to V76 doing more stuff closer to my camp ect) and the few times I was in the top 3 and being shown on the map I'd finish what I was doing and server hop
---
To me this just seems like putting a huge target on yourself to save caps but end up losing more caps than if you had just played...
---
But you do you man
---
Why? I level 150 has no combat advantage above a level 50. At that point it comes down to perks and gear.
---
Amateur hour, he should be building in a 1:1 scale
---
Derp. Wrong button. üëç
---
I‚Äôll check it out!
---
Both, but it is random.
---
Very curious and interesting. 
---
I built a combat shotgun to begin with, used it for damn near 70 levels. I usually some in and go for head shots up close, or vats if they are too close for comfort to ensure the head comes flying off.
---
My path to the ultimate shotgun changed with a Mutant Explosive, and I loved, still love it. I keep that shotgun in my inventory for when my primary shotgun, double explosive breaks. That 30% buff to mutants makes an amazing difference. I use the double as my primary simply due to less reloading.
---
Personally I have been interested in the idea of an AA combat shotgun should I ever come across it.  For a long while I was sold on the idea of a TSE, after having had two other explosive shotguns, I cant help but wonder if the AA is the way as opposed to the TSE.
---
I enjoyed your post, as it gives me some thoughts for the morning.  Cheers.
---
I use 2 x 2handers - one Instigating+Swing Speed sledgehammer fully modded for regular enemies up to 68 LVL mutant warlords (one swing - one death) and Vampire+Swing Speed+1STR Super-sledge for tough bastards - deathclaws, mirelurk queens, scorchbeasts etc. I also have Furious+swing speed+90% weight Fire-axe, but as a backup, since it's damage bonus from furious won't get to maximum before enemy is death and damage on weapon between supersledge and fire axe is quite large (in my situation 421 vs 328). I don't like one-handers, they look ridiculous in the hands of big guy ;)
---
So jumping in place doesn't disable sentinel either?
---
Also was watching a video last night and (unless I was really tired) I could swear the guy said you need Wasteland Whisperer AND Animal Friend in order to tame.   This doesn‚Äôt make sense.   One says it‚Äôs for creatures and the other says it‚Äôs for animals.  You‚Äôd just need the one applied that applicable, correct?   Assuming there is actually a difference between and Animal and a Creature?  
---
Since it covers down to peek cards for the build, start with one handed, and then move to two once you hit 50. The builds for both have the same special, right?
---
I am currently running both, My Main character is running on a new One X, and I run my vendor characters on a 4 year old One Elite.
---
The Old Elite starts up and loads faster than the One X, (5-10 seconds faster), and the Elite always loads my friends list in the social menu, where the One X will only load it occasionally when restarting after not logging completely out.
---
I have seen no difference in Lag, that seems to be server related and affect both sometimes. (I'm running both hardwired to a 1000+ mbps connection)
---
I don't have a 4K display, so I am seeing no difference in the graphics between the two.
---
I've got 300+ hours in this game and at times yes it does lag, however there are some things to consider: This is not FO4, it is it's own game, yes its part of the series, but for all other purposes it is unique so you  have to take it at face value. 
---
I found the game to be really fun when you take the time to read terminals and listen to holotapes. It fills in a little more of the story (not completely) but way more than if you just speed through. Tales from the WV hills is one of my favorites There are some very interesting locations hidden throughout you just have to find them. I personally like to hunt for the cryptids. I did grow up in WV and while the backstory in the game on some of these creatures isn't exactly the same or in some cases at all the same as what our grandparents would tell us as kids, it's still great fun.
---
I'm on an old xbox as well and I do load considerably longer than our newer xbox. Also the rendering of buildings and enemies takes about 10 to 20 seconds longer. But that's about it. 
---
Oh man.  I'm pushing 10, the leather coat comes from events in the Mire with a sad .02% drop rate üò≠
---
Thanks!  Guess I‚Äôll have to make a trip to the Mire sometime soon. 
---
Players are afraid to get banned.  That or no global chat.  One of the many stellar design decisions by Bethseda.
---
This is only a temp solution unless they force level base matchmaking. 
---
Person plays a week late will get absolutely creamed. Just because he played a week late.
---
Or at least put my name on it with a heart like mom does.

There are a few problems with the simulation theory. First, we know that the Brotherhood and Enclave are real world organizations within the Fallout universe. I can understand knowing about the existence of the Enclave, but the simulation was probably developed pre-war, so how would they be able to put the BoS inside? 
---
no. this is a major inconvenience, when lvl 50s have little disadvantage over higher levels. I could maybe understand lvl 1-50 servers, but then people would just load up a lvl45 account with legendaries to farm caps
---
I bought the game this week, came out of the vault and there was a dude waiting with a paper bag of goodies, was a great little starter for me. Was a fine way to start my F76 adventure. Didn't realise I was in someone's base later on so blasted a turrent and got a bounty and got smashed to pieces by a dude in power amror üòÇ 
---
On the contrary, the WANTED status actually protected me from any real loss.  10 caps versus 134 caps...just to ‚Äútry it out‚Äù?  I‚Äôll take that any day.  And I got to stick it to an adrenaline jockey with all the insulting junk possible I‚Äôve read on Reddit.  A bag of bones, spoiled food, and a salt shaker?  That‚Äôs all they got because I planned ahead.  The perceived expression on their face...PRICELESS.
---
I had this issue as well, but only on a new character.  I think the top 3 are treated like event markers.  If you haven't discovered a region, it doesn't show you event markers for that region.  So I could see the top guys if they were in the forest only, but anywhere else and it didn't show them.  It did show their loot bags though.  Did u start a new character or no?  Not sure if my theory is right
---
It's a Beta man, what's with people?
---
I‚Äôve noticed a lot, and I mean a lot of people doing these tech data dumps. So much so that 7-8 out of 10 times all the enemy are dead even if you jump servers. 
---
Tech data hasn‚Äôt been respawning as much or just a lot of players are doing it. 
---
Just like the Nuka XO-1 paint were you have countless players server hopping and no plans or players constantly farming plan spawns to the point they‚Äôre no longer there and moved. 
---
Pretty sure Beth will change this or make rewards more rare.
---
I hear you. I have only gotten ammo, aid, and the occasional science scribe uniform since Wild Appalachia dropped. Oh Holy RNG, why have you foresaken me? I needs me some paladin paint!
---
Instigating + executioners lever is my combo. Anything that doesn‚Äôt die in the first hit, switch to executioners and they are not long for this world :)
---
Yeah, you raise a good point. Every solution I can think of has a potential alternative workaround strat. I guess /maybe/ introducing a new currency? But that seems overly complicated, and probably just as easy to work around. 
---
Which perk affects inert weight?
---
I bought the game just for the chance to explore another BGS open world.
---
I knew it was going to be a bag of bugs since they used FO4 stuff which was buggy for me on console so I guessed that throwing it in multi-player would be...interesting. And I played ESO when it first came it which was also a mess.
---
I respect your approach a lot. It was actually the same thing that pushed me forward. I mean, everybody heralded sentinel as best thing ever yet I am ADHD, I hate standing, I hate waiting, and I even have health condition that makes standing IRL painful. How am I supposed to play sentinel if the single thing I dislike the most is standing still? :D
---
There is no way to build a new meta without disagreeing to play the current one. Again, weight have started from the wrong foot yet now you gained my respect. If I came out as arrogant prick to you, my apologies.
---
Not if the body is somewhere and you just haven't found it.  I killed one behind Phoenix's place and couldn't find the body.  Eventually I found it on the roof of the building with the burned magazines.
---
Have you tried building the generator where you can attach the wires then moving it
---
Theyre just nothing compared to AA or bloodied. AA is actually mainly good against other players because bloodied simply does more damage to most npcs, but against other players they're basically the only option for cutting through 300+ DR with sentinels or cavalier legendaries. On the other hand, bloodied just does more damage than any other legendary (up to 200%), and synergises with other low health effects like unyielding legendaries or nerd rage/serendepity.
---
Theres 0 chance people would be 120 already. The only reason people were able to get to that level so fast on release was the trap dismantle xp exploit. 
---
Appreciate the reply. I'm hardwired and 4k graphics isn't a big deal. Do you know if other players can see your character while you are still just seeing the loading screen? Apparently I am visible in game about 20 seconds while my screen still shows loading.
---
Agree. I've heard people complain that they won't be able to 'play the game' (i.e. do quests, builds etc) in Survival because it's too dangerous! But Survival mode is meant to be a bloodbath. Play the game in Adventure; go to Survival for PVP combat.
---
Check the roofs nearby.  Sometimes they go up when they explode.
---
I try to watch which way they go when they explode, but I'm shooting them from a distance so it's easier to see.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
I would be careful not sure that is allowed based on the ToS
---
Only place that would be is outside, maybe I will try that tho 
---
That's simply not true.  You can't scrap aid items dude.  What did it scrap into exactly?  If you find some sugar, go to the nearest bench and try to scrap it manually.  U cant.
---
I like this idea.  You could turn them in for PvP specific cosmetics or something like monster mash where you turn them in for legendary gear.
---
Learn something new every day lol 
---
No penalty PvP losses would work towards removing a ton of the complaints.
---
I'd be more willing to hop on Survival if deaths were a gameplay annoyance rather than a mechanics annoyance. Though I can see alt accounts exploiting it if it's not properly.
---
I haven‚Äôt run into your specific situation, but since you were able to get the genny in there, see if you can do this: place the generator outside of the tunnel and connect it to something close by. Then, pick up the generator and try to put it under the bridge. Hopefully, the connection will stay intact. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
Maybe try putting the fusion generator on a rug then move the rug
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gona try it, I built in there once before and had it connected in there but it seems they patched some things 
---
I am a fan of PvP currency.  If you die you lose some of it but the more you carry gives you a multiplier or something.  Eso cyrodiil does that with telvar, though the multiplier only counts towards mobs you kill there not the players (to avoid killing friends for profit I think) aion had an ap system that was tied to rank.  So you wouldn't want your friend to kill you or you would lose rank and rank was tied to what gear you could equip.   Very complicated solutions for a game already launched though lol
---
You can buy them here, just select Xbox from drop down. Takes about 10 minutes and they meet you at train station after sending you a message via Xbox messages: 
---

---
Gona try all of the above 
---
Ohhhh, so one prefix but any number of major or minor effects, thankyou :)
---
I‚Äôd be willing to run with you. The earliest I could do it is probably around 2:00 PM EST. 
---
If you need to ask that on reddit, before you even tried the mode, you probably should stick to adventure :D
---
From what i understand there is no advantage to picking up more than one at a time. 
---
So what i do is travel to the bunker and only loot one desk if it has a Technical data then fast travel and finish quest.
---
I do this until there are no more left in any desk.
---
Then i change servers and as long as you didnt take anything from the other desks they still have a chance to spawn more data. (you can look but if you pull anything from it it starts a 20-24 hour counter till new things will spawn)
---
Repeat until you cant loot any desks.
---
I do about 12-14 data quests a day.
---
TBH i only get a plan maybe once every 2-3 days
---
But i got the shielded lining  plan recently
---
Looking for the BOS combat amour mod plans
---
On a side note in camp venture the upper part has 5 areas to spawn plans.
---
one on a shelf in the back in the bunk room by the kitchen.
---
one on the shelf just past the door with the terminal
---
Three in the armory room. one on the table to the left of the workbench the second on the bottom shelf of the medical cart, and lastly the level 3 safe open it and check for a plan if there is none or you know the plan dont loot it change servers and try again.
---
The same for world spawn plans if you dont touch them aka you know them or dont want that plan dont loot them. when you hop servers it has the chance to spawn again and be different. 
---
Doing this every day i get about 2-3 new plans i dont know a day.
---
(i have bought every vendor plan but there are many that are not sold via vendor)
---
You are welcome 
---
They likely get a free location discovery out of it :)
---
Probably...
---
I've been saying this for days.  I think it's a win win
---
Yes shoot everything and everyone you see every moment you can
---
With skill.
---
So far...every person I have met just opens fire immediately. I don‚Äôt think you will have time to be friendly.
---
They need to do some serious work on survival. Cause right now its pretty horrid.
---
Yes the weapons can have one prefix, on major effect and one minor effect
---
yes, but on a very high rate-of-fire weapon, you are able to land shots over a much larger area.
---
So far I dont really find this to be a "survival mode".  A lot of players seem to have low lev alts, dumping their aid in their stash, switch to survival, and since low levels can hold their own against high levels - pvp with no consequence. I am sure thats fun for them, but that doesnt really seem to be the point Bethesda was going for and if I am polaying survival as my main form of gameplay, I am at a huge disadvantage.
---
Perhaps add arena pvp for people to bring their mains into.  1v1, 2v2, whatever - but create arena maps for them.  Then make survival a little more hardcore - aid drops include your stash items. Or perhaps dying gives you a chance to lose your weapon or armor or whatever, or increase the exp gain by playing on survival, but you lose some exp if you die.  
---
I personally hope survival turns into what my original hope for fo76 was - which is I had to account for other players - not just go buck wild and pvp against them.  In the stock game i can ignore everyone and it doesnt effect anything.  In survival currently everyone seems to be there strictly for pvp.  I want to have a survival game where I have to account for someone i see in the distance - are they going to attack me? Is it worth attacking them? Should I hide and move on? Should I offer to team up, do I help them if they are killing something or having trouble?   - I DO NOT want to be forced into pvp because of some leaderboard or rightfully assume everyone i see is just going to attack me.
---
 Vats slowed down time. Not possible in online game. This isn't fallout 5.
---
No offense, but stuff like this could be really annoying if i just want to create an alt for something.
---
It‚Äôs like taking a walk in da hoodz in Baltimore with stacks of cash strapped all over yourself then come back and complain about the robbery. 
---
Let us know how it goes 
---
I knew that I needed this because that circumference has been critical to me on more than a few camp placements.  (Can I fit in that junk resource AND the water resource?)
---
But I didn't \*KNOW* that I needed it until I heard you say it out loud.  
---
I fucking need this.
---
Yes, they can see you, and your camp spawns in well ahead of you, since I'm running both at the same time I get to see this first hand.
---
I regularly sit on the porch of my vendor character camps while waiting for them to finish loading.
---
Let me know when you earn one of those legendary weapons in Survival Mode...
---
I don't fully understand the point of having a Cap, but as of right now it's 200 x 7 vendors for $1,400 caps. You'd spend 50 caps travelling between them smartly. That's 1350 a day.
---
I like how limited the vendors are. It keeps the daily earnings low and with the rate of finding/earning caps makes it feel meaningful when you find them. It weighs on my decision when to fast travel and again makes the caps system mean something. 
---
Personally, at the moment, I'm all against this. 
---
yes please!
---
This should just be vanilla:  
---

---
With a weapon put away or holstered you show up as yellow on the map and when looked at, with a weapon out you are red.
---
If your weapon is out I‚Äôm gunna assume your here to fight, I have to. If your weapon is away I might give you a shout in voice chat.
---
Add my vote for toggles! So irritating! Yeah of course I wanna target this busted turret, oh that super mutant? That's just Larry, leave him be. Yes I know he's shooting at you, don't draw attention to him he's special. 
---
No worries at all! Glad that's cleared up :)
---
At some point we wake up and find reality to be more interesting and engaging than the Sim (am not meaning to imply lacking at this point)...that would be an interesting twist and continue the story into another chapter of the game.
---
Thanks fine I never seriously doubted that a new meta was being developed I was just stating that until that point the current meta is going to be king. Even if you can kill them the greater portion of the player base is using it.
---
Just have to adapt and push on.
---
noice
---
All that, and it makes your pee glow!
---
Good trade. Thanks!
---
Then tell me the purpose of nuking whitesprings at all in a newly created pvp mode.  If it's not greed for shiny things then I guess it's to make yourself an easy target.  Good strategy 
---
Is there an update for the latest release?
---
But they certainly have an advantage over a level 10.  So it should be separate.  All I see is you fighting against this concept in every thread but you always fail to give a good counter argument.  What's the problem with doing like, 1 to 25, 26 to 50, then 51 and up on separate servers
---
I feel you. I do like it myself, and I like that im not invincible to a level 40 character.  My level 20 friends are still able to kill level 50+ and 200+ (essentially the same thing as 50+) characters too.   I run a cavalier build so I'm able to close the distance but I become vulnerable while attacking and I appreciate that I can't really one shot people even with a 2k damage power fist and penetration.  So it gives everyone a fighting chance.   Sentinel seems a bit over powered because they can attack and the buff stays the entire fight butt maybe I have a bias lol.   All in all I'm having fun but I do appreciate being able to hop back to adventure mode and do my biv daily quest in peace every day lol

*     Raider power armor - 15, 25, 35, &amp; 45.
---
*     T-45 power armor - 25, 35, &amp; 45.
---
*     T-51 power armor - 30, 40 &amp; 50.
---
*     T-60 power armor - 40 &amp; 50. 
---
The level of the armor pieces you find/take are spawned in the range of the location in which you find them. To guarantee you get the highest level pieces you must go and find them in the zone of the map that itself is the highest level. In FO76's case, this means the Cranberry Bog.
---
Figured.  Thx.  see u guys in hell then
---
There is:  I can't fast travel, I can't join events, and I cant buy a damn thing, including Radaway for my extensive radiation poisoning that makes me killable by a strong breeze.
---
Go kill somebody else and let me Netflix and Chelate for a while. 
---
PA spawns at different levels so collecting a set at the highest level is a quest in itself. Unless you‚Äôre able to craft it, then of course you have the choice of which level to craft. 
---
I love that people that previously called players who complained about getting cap farmed are so butthurt about getting cap farmed. 
---
Suck it up, carebears.
---
Great breakdown on how damage works in survival,
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5zo2o/survival_damage_testing_results_and_personal?sort=confidence
---
When I don't have enough mass to make stable I just sell the raw to a vendor
---
Its actually pretty fun tbh I had it uninstalled for a while but tried it back out after the patches and enjoyed it a bunch
---
Can you repost the link?  That one doesn't work.
---
PA components spawn (T-45, T-51, T-60) or are crafted (Excavator, X-01, Ultracite) at specific levels. If you want a higher level component, you either need to find or craft it.
---
Oh bet. Thanks for checking that.
---
Yeah. If those morons let the people who weren't feral alone or worked with them, the scorched plague might not have killed everyone...
---
This is excellent feedback! Very detailed and very well thought out. Thanks for the tag and thank you OP for posting!
---
Add darts and maybe weaponized darts for combat
---
Well I don't downvote people I disagree with, however, I do not think those are strong enough penalties especially if the individuals intent is to build a camp at a high traffic area such as whitesprings and keep stealing peoples caps and transferring to an alt.  I'd be inclined to say they should only do slap damage, or take their asses back to adventure and get some caps.  Lol
---
Adapt and push on is my only endgame.
---
Thru Hiker
---
It sucks, I know, but it happens. The servers don't care if you launched a nuke or not, but launching them is easy after the first one.
---
When you die and drop your loot it will stay there no matter how many times you die as long as you don't pick anything else up. If you pick up something else and die again the original loot bag disappears and all you get is a loot bag with what you had the second time you died.
---
I learned this the hard way early on in the game and it sounds like you did too. just follow the Golden rule if you die and you wanted the loot you dropped never pick anything else up until you get that bag back. when I was low level I died 20-30 times trying to kill a mirelurk queen to get my original loot bag and it was still there because I hadn't picked anything else up.
---
Bummer... I don‚Äôt use that one unless I‚Äôm specifically farming. Thanks for the info though
---
There are some weird combos in there.  I just found a piece that is PERFECT for stealth builds.  It's a Chameleon with +1 agility and sneak.  I've never seen a chameleon with sneak before.
---
I know where you are building and now that you mention it is a very good place for a camp in Survival mode
---
Ooh, I like this idea. I could imagine a version of this system working in 76. Or alternatively, pvp kills count toward a reimagined karma system. Though you‚Äôd probably need the introduction of player faction alliances to really make that work. Kill enemy faction, karma goes up. Kill someone of the same faction, karma goes down. The higher or lower your score unlocks various buffs, and even make it so having crazy low karma is viable, but marks you as more dangerous to your own faction. 
---
You‚Äôve got my brain flowing with ideas now haha
---
I am a pistol build. I carry 2 Western revolvers. Most engagements are over before i finish a clip,  I will head shot you to Oblivion. Either you see me or you don't. I crit every couple of shots. I don't use damage resistance perks on my pal character and i don't want a shield. I use speed, drugs and vats. If i cant outrun you then i die and it's my fault. Evasion is my only deterrent. I'm enjoying survival. See you out there.
---
came here to say this. Holstering that weapon while traveling may not mean that you wont get killed, but you're less likely to get killed if you holster your weapon
---
Yeah, this was with taking one at a time, and going back and forth. If you could just carry a bunch at a time, it wouldn't be a big deal at all.
---
I agree. Releasing the game as it was, was a grave mistake on Bethesda's part, and the fact that they knew what they were going to release, makes it worse. However, Bethesda did introduce improvements and new content so they should be credited where it's due, although that doesn't mean their shoddy release can be excused. I can only hope that consumers would allow themselves to be more informed and for game companies to not focus on just short term profits.  
---
What did they scrap into?
---
They just do
---
Interesting idea! I'll include that in our report. Thank you!
---
So I'm at 9/25 and have killed like 7 legendaries since then. None of those have counted for me. Those kills did count for my friends however. So I just can't complete the challange. 
---
Just play call of duty.
---
From the quote? Literally my first reply to you. In a way, your comment that I replied to was even alluding to it
---
No, you shouldnt shoot first.  
---
I've played only survival mode since its release, my tip is store your aid and junk as frequently as possible as a safe measure, now as far as my experience with people goes, the only ones that will suit you are the "raiders", scope the individual out, i can always read who is going to go ham on me so i guess if you observe they way they carry themselves you'll be able to decide if you should interact or avoid.  
---
Either case, without failing you wont learn how to judge people, so just store your stuff or even make a survival character and actively seek encounters with people so you can see how they act.  
---
Also one last tip i experienced between my launch-day character and my new one. Never look like youre geared to the max. Most of the raiders i've dealt with weigh their targets by the gear they have on them, so look plain and some wont even bother with you as long as they dont feel threathened.
---
I didn‚Äôt want to give too much away but once I get set up right it‚Äôs just a waiting game.
---
Coincidentally, if you build there, apparently rugs are indestructible . . . Just sayin . . .
---
I look forward to meeting you in-game.
---
The authors of the 2 mods that I use have decided to start using 'sResourceArchiveMisc' instead of the previous ' sResourceArchive2List '.  Archive2List seems to change every patch, while ArchiveMisc has only changed once since launch.
---
I complete removed  sResourceArchive2List= from my fallout76custom.ini and added this:
---
sResourceArchiveMisc = SeventySix - MiscClient.ba2, BetterInventory.ba2, PerkLoadoutManager.ba2
---
Just add a comma and any other mod file names that you use.
---
I have a full sent assassin set and it hasn't done much. I'm level 171 and a level 50 with a full auto handmade was somehow killing me with one bullet.  I have an anti armor explosive lever action and it was takeing me 3 to 4 head shots to drop him. Seemed kind of off. I dont want to be a god but I dont think one bullet from a full auto weapon should be able to kill me where my simi auto was taking multiple shots
---
Play style has something to do with the choice as well. If you tend to sneak up on enemies and land a head shot with sneak bonus, a solid rifleman build with an Instigating Gauss or Lever means you‚Äôre taking most PvE enemies down in one shot. 
---
We've shared this before but I'll be sure to bring it up again.
---
I 100% agree.  But VATS is a bigger problem from a skill based gameplay standpoint.  Even with no legendary effects most 1 on 1 encounters come down to who can VATS spam first.
---
If PvP is going to be skill based then you shouldn‚Äôt be able to target other players in VATS in Survival mode.
---
I mostly wanted the gun that heals your team. My partner and I just get wrecked by everything in this game it feels like and any thing that helps a tiny bit interests us
---
What if we were allowed to choose the level of our server each time we logged in?
---
Maybe you want to play the game on Easy Mode.  You can hop your Level 200 character into a Level 10 server and breeze through it, enjoying the experience without stress/drama.
---
Maybe you want Hardcore Mode without all of the Survival Mode madness.  Fine, start a fresh character and venture out into Level 80 land.  Have fun.
---
If your planning on getting murdered a lot its useful. Here i removed everything thats useless for you.
---
Thank me later. [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1c11133&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2pp2a72la2&amp;w=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1c11133&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2pp2a72la2&amp;w=&amp;n=)

---
The through wall connectors have to be placed on a floor, then you will have to add a connector on the top of the conduit
---
Yes, makes perfect sense, doesnt it. Im planning on doing the same with shotguns. Just havent found the executioner one yet. 
---
‚ÄúAll the lead and aluminum‚Äù 
---
So there‚Äôs a ton of unused material in your stash taking up space. There‚Äôs problem number 1. I run an Bloodied Explo 10mm SMG, and need ammo all the time. I have 35 bulk lead, 700 Gunpoweder, and about 400 Steel on hand at all times. This crafts me 2000 or so rounds, and I run out of steel. That‚Äôs fine, I don‚Äôt need to Horde more, I‚Äôll just go to Garrahan the next time I need Ore and grab it. I still have 698 out of 800 stash. 
---
I also, much like literally everyone else, keep a ton of outfits and misc things. I also keep 150 Stims and 100 Diluted in my stash, as well as 100 Purified Water. Again, only 698 out of 800. 
---
It‚Äôs not as efficient as it can get if you still don‚Äôt have space. 
---
Guess I have never done this quest because I didnt know to even pick up the tech data....
---
You shouldn't even ask questions at anytime tbh. Shoot first, and shoot often!
---
I didnt realize Thanks for the pro tip
---
Taking all this feedback in, thank you for posting.
---
There are a bunch of issues with some mods; if you go to PerkLoadoutManager's downloads page and pull his Fallout76Custom.ini file he's got the 7 or 8 .ba2 files you should be calling before you call any mods that will fix texture issues. Whoops, no longer 7 or 8. He's got it down to one with today's update.  
---
&gt; IMPORTANT INFO FOR THOSE MISSING TEXTURES:  
---
Today's (March 26) update, again, makes changes to sResourceArchive2List. I am going to be following registrator2000's lead in an attempt to minimize future conflicts and switch to a new list, sResourceArchiveMisc, which has not seen any major changes since the game's launch.

They might be thinking snap tails or turning sugar into syrup?
---
What would sugar even scrap to?  Carbon (12) was added.
---
Hydrogen (22) was added.
---
Oxygen (11) was added. 
---
I would probably build a 2x1 foundation with walls and a roof and put the generator in that building. This way you can put pylons on floor mats, connect them to the generator, then move the mats with pylons wherever you want underground. It‚Äôll be way less cluttered. Same if you just wanna use conduits, place them on small signs, connect them to the generator, and move the sign and conduit below. Keep in mind if you do this glitch, you need to move the mats/signs once while connected to another doable point before moving them underground. Hope that helps 
---
What pistol meta? If there‚Äôs a legit thing going on there I haven‚Äôt heard or seen anything about it.
---
Oh ok, im also confused why other bag disappeared after picking one up
---
Ok, thats interesting.    That part of thr road perhaps is s trigger for that.  
---
Part of the real story of FO76 -- it wasn't the scorched plague that killed everyone, it was the inability to cooperate.
---
Im sure AA is good on a shotgun, but I get a headache when trying to convert the AA effect to % damage. I have owned several two-shot shotguns, including TSE, but sold them pretty fast. The accuracy is a huge issue and eats up the damage boost and more, I believe. 
---
Someone on this sub was saying you get a -50% damage to other players debuff if you have no caps in survival. 
---
&gt;Hell yes. I'd take a complete game where I have to purchase the DLC if I want it later over a bugfest with free DLC any day
---
That one? Not constructive but fair enough. 
---
Kill or be killed.  If someone can nuke Whitesprings then farm the mobs while handling PvP encounters, why take that away from them?
---
Choices.  Consequences.  Risk.  Reward.
---
I agree with the idea, my best bet would be programming. There is already a way to rack player location on the map, so they turned it on for those three. I don't know of tracking player area is any different
---
No idea, still annoyed that preference gear is being awarded to pvp players and not the pve players that have been loyal since launch, my faith in Bethesda is rapidly depleting.
---
I should have to travel back in time for that.
---
It affects the weight of all food &amp; drinks, I don't know how anyone could get by without it.
---
My character gains 100+ weight when I take it off, same with Travelling Pharmacy and Chem weight.
---
Because plastic bags are not environmentally friendly. üòã
---
lmao this is in direct odds with my deep seeded trust issues
---
What's the point of this?
---
Im sure bloodied is superior for raw damage, but myself and many others who are not interested in PvP, have no interest of running around with such low health. My point was the executioner and mutant prefixes has few drawbacks. 
---
That worked in 4 does it still work in 76?
---
ugh that is painful to think about, sorry that happened to you
---
I understand there are LOTS of bugs in this game to fix, but the #1 thing HAS to be server stability
---
what good is it if they fix other bugs if we cant even stay online to play the game to experience the bug fixes?
---
without rock solid servers this game will just go down the drain as people get sick of it and leave the game
---
the most basic, most important thing for an online game is it is able to be played online...
---
Yeah there are definitely builds that can defeat sentinel.  But they defeat cavalier just as easily.  High stagger chance weapons and vats crits seem to still bypass all the damage reduction enough to one shot still.  Kinda nuts how they work lol.  They did nerf my ability to one shot but apparently not so much vats crit builds.  I guess I could vats crit with my power fist.  Might have to see how that might work if they don't make changes to it lol
---
There's some sort of zone border at work. I don't fully understand it, but crossing certain boundaries and loading into places triggers enemy spawns, and typically this happens when things are spawned near me, by someone else.
---
Yes, but different perk cards that total 9 perk points (i.e. Slugger, expert slugger, master slugger - same with gladiator).
---
wow, thanks for that, wasn't going to join on my main because I like my camp and have no room in my stash for aid, so thanks for the heads up...
---
I've been about 5/1 ratio of shoot/talk.
---
When I talk, someone helped me retake a workshop and gave me some aid, and another gave me a lvl 50 instigating shotgun. 
---
It can be worth it to talk. 
---
Ok I will give it a solid shot. 
---
I thought that this was maybe to much of seeing servers. Since this was something God Howard specifically said before release "you're never gonna see another server". Also it would he another menu you had to click through which makes server hopping more painful 
---
T-45, T-51b, and T-60 can be crafted as well.  The plans drop rarely from Treasure maps.  And unlike regular armor plans, they limbs are split between left/right.  So there are 5 plans you have to collect for each of the Power Armors to be able to create a full set, not just 3 like regular armor.
---
there is a rule for no click bait post
---
Someone will show up eventually with one of them.  And they will have used the above process.  Someone incredible stubborn and willing to find, kill, exit, reload and repeat.
---
Realtime minigames would be awesome!
---
true.
---
Absolutely. I have a 1\* instigating pump and it is probably the shotgun I have fired most. However, it's just not as good on the big monsters..
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_dweller_(Fallout_76)
---
did you even read the post?
---
I've heard you get that in adventure too but that's if you killed someone. Not just for walking around with no caps. Not sure, can't confirm cuz I'm at work.   But that would still mean they had a no risk fight and got 400 caps and THEN get the debuff and can transfer the caps to an alt.   Not sure though I've never killed someone while not carrying caps, my theory is, you really shouldn't be able to lol
---
They‚Äôre immune to the scorch
---
I heard that you have to give finishing blow, not just tag them and get credit for it
---
Yeah. It would also protect you from running into mobs that are 20-40 Levels above yourself 
---
7 different T-60 Paint Plans can drop from them (prior to Patch 7, it was just one).
---
Outfits can drop, (like the scribe outfits, bomber jacket, etc).
---
And you can receive a random piece of 1* Legendary Heavy Combat Armor.  Torso, Legs, Arms.  Always is Heavy, which is nice for gearing up fresh at level 50.
---
I know all the counters I just dont understand what someone would be using to kill me at full hp with a full auto with 1 bullet lol
---
I hate to keep harkening back to the good ol' days, but Star Wars Galaxies had this very thing.. when you went to place a building it would give you a radius (green wall - like we have now) of where you could place it and showed red for any obstacles.
---
Yes there will be a differential nut at least it's a fresh start.  Farming perfect sentinel assassin gear in survival would be much harder and take much longer than it did in adventure.  Eventually it would happen but to say days or weeks seems like an underestimation
---
I‚Äôd like to see them removed from the game entirely. Magical weapons and armor don‚Äôt make any sense in the Fallout universe in the first place. 
---
I swear this feels like a social experiment.  Something like in the dark knight.  Do we blow each other up?
---
So what do you recommend to put in the place of things you removed from the perks? 
---
Thought last laugh with the demo perks etc.. would've been effective
---
I'm on PS, I didn't know it was different for Xbox and PC.
---
There was nothing in my post that was mean or sarcastic or rude. 
---
So you felt you had to be a dick?
---
Makes sense, basically what Honor Tokens (or whatever PVP currency they had) were in WoW, but in WoW did anyone think about kill trading with each other in PVP just to farm Honor? I feel this is going to be a thing here.
---
Well if people are so much against Top 3 being visible and as one before mentioned, why not then build this idea around Hunter and Hunted? Means, Top 3 are hidden, H/H only being visible to each other and only those players earning tokens from kill. Even better make global ques and trow people into random matches, this way friends can't farm each other tokens.
---
I'm not him.  Just trying to point out a different perspective. You all ganged up on him so I thought I would try to have you all look at it differently. 
---
Trust your instincts in every situation, people dont like a bloodthirsty maniac but you dont have to be their pushover either.
---
Right.  Sugar broke down into scrap carbohydrates I guess
---
Looks like some of them found "Raiders".    Poor bastards.    I can't wait till the faction wars start.   i'm gonna kill every goddamn Raider i see.
---
He's on a butthurt crusade. Expect more of the same from him.
---
I mean, why wouldn't you? I thought of that as the new survival mode was still downloading. Why should I bother giving up 150 caps when I die if I can avoid it? I've read posts saying a commendation system would be better and I agree. And penalties for spending your own money? Seriously? What are you my bank? "Oh yes sir, wed love to let you play survival mode, but you have to have a minimum balance in your account, you can't overspend, and if you don't have enough money to die in survival, you have to leave." That's such a crock. I spend all my money in 76 every other day. I regularly have 0 to 100 caps on me at a time, but you're gonna get butthurt that killing me isn't giving you enough rewards? Tough titties yo! Maybe spend your money so you have less to lose. 
---
Only thing collecting more Tech Data before turning it in seems to do is increase the reward exp.  Before Patch 7, 1 Tech Data = 350 exp.  2+ = 400 exp.
---
After Patch 7, I seem to be getting 460 and 530 exp per turn in (1 and 2+ respectively).  Either they increased EXP reward for the quest, or once I hit level 113 the exp jumped.  113 would be an odd level to increase at, so I'm thinking exp was boosted in Patch 7 or in the Survival update just the other day.
---
There‚Äôs some in the mire as well
---
The other comments are just a bunch of upset pot heads hanging up on op.
---
there is no way to glitch it. You need to find a spot in the cave with a little more space for the tip of the antenna.
---
-source (does a lot of glitching with builds)
---
Don't have enough caps? Right to jail!
---
I mean, if you don't enough caps, lock players out from Survival Mode for 30 minutes, let them go play Adventure Mode to earn some caps or be Afk and wait timer out.
---
I'm not saying opt out but rather set a different leader board as a default and having the top three on a player's map be the top three of his selected leader board. 
---
For instance, you switch to players killed leader board and the top three on *your* map change.  But you still exist in the longest survived. 
---
I think the major problem is the lack of knowledge of the different leader boards by the players and how the default is currently set to prioritize longest survived
---
It'd be cool if there was some sort of darts/pool mini game that you could actually compete with people and have the option to put some caps on the line. 
---
60 isn't low level.  You should be on a server with other 51+ players and not level 5 players.  
---
It‚Äôs so sad isn‚Äôt it! These guys were sent out to explore and get a feel for the new world and all met a pretty grim ending. I‚Äôm with you all the way there! üëäüèº
---
Yep same. Idk what to do with my caps are midnight since no one I know or my serum sellers are on so I just buy plans before I get fucked. Which ends up happening 90% of the time I travel.
---
lets be optimistic.  I mean the final product might not be perfect but I'm sure its going to be way better
---
Yes... Yes please.
---
I feel acquiring Prime recievers should be a real challenge to get but not the ammo. Do you use Prime weapons regularly? 200 fluxes in your inventory must be pretty heavy.
---
It should. the spikes stick in walls and people use them to create make shift platforms to get up to places
---
I don't like how may caps you can lose and I'm not sure I like cap loss at all and commendation system sounds interesting to me also.   However, I can't force their hand, so if they remain with this system, they should have a penalty for those trying to avoid it.  Just my opinion lol.
---
Not even nearly on your last point. Nuka grenades are insanely easy to make. And you can literally ambush anyone. People do not expect you to chuck 2 grenades at them. Almost no one uses grenades.
---
Agreed. 
---
As a solution for now though, I've walked off the area where I want to place my CAMP, and had team members stand in the key locations so I could see when the green build zone boundary wall passes through them. It allowed me to visualize from ground level whether or not I had encapsulated the resource and the water, or both resources in a few locations. It also requires helpful friends. 
---
If an emote is out of the question for some reason, how about a gifting mode?  Like trading, but no caps.  You can initiate it in person or through the social menu like team invites.  Then the player can ignore your gift or accept it.  No dropped bags.  No fears of disconnecting before they or you can pick it up.  No drive by bag nappings.  The mechanics are already in place too.
---
I was just trying to show everyone a different perspective. Not writing something just to write. Get off of your high horse, no pun intended. You are not special because you smoke weed, but you are the typical pot head who feels they have to get upset and jump to weeds defense.  Yoy don't and nobody cares that you smoke.
---
The refuse to disengage or spawn elsewhere 
---
It really does feel like it and it wont go away any time soon, i've played Arma 2 DayZ, DayZ standalone and Rust in the past but honestly the experience in 76 is so much more nerve-wracking, partly because of bloodthirsty people and partly bc the PVP mechanics and punishments for death are not the best.
---
They are shitty because they don't work/track properly. 
---
Different camo.
---
(self)Perception: 15/10. 
---
It only counts starred legendaries. The ones you come by that have no stars at all don‚Äôt get counted. 
---
I think pvp belongs in the game but the all or nothing approach isn't for me. I don't think people should be safe at all times and stuff but also that the risk and reward is well balanced and that there are other motivations encouraging people to only kill other players when it makes sense to. 
---
Rewarding people for helping strangers and stuff sounds more akin to the story/spirit of the game though too. 
---
Thats on you to figure out my friend i already helped you alot, just read the perkcards carfully and im sure youll figure out what to put in there ;-)
---
Mutants is meh. First of all if you're NOT mutated, it does nothing. If you ARE, it's only an extra 10%. Executioners is brilliant, but mutants is... I dunno, oddly useless.
---
Feel sorry for you girl friend or boyfriend.
---
You might have found that bomb at the Palace of the Whining Prat. I saw one when I was hanging out there the other day trying attain Satori by killing big green fuckers.
---
whoa, chill the fuck out, how was I being a dick for asking a question?  the post clearly states the circumstances so your experience on PS has little bearing on your comprehension of the post.
---
Explosives are fairly common right now.  If you don‚Äôt have a dense mod on your armor, run Fireproof instead of life giver.  The grenade thing is hilarious, go get those spawn killers!
---
Easy solution to people wanting to play pvp vs just go play a different game, solid
---
So when you are in adventure mode and a friend of yours is playing in survival mode, if you click his name and choose to join, will you be thrown into a survival server automatically without warning? 
---
Quick question: if you attack someone‚Äôs camp do they get notified and are you made visible to them on the map?
---
Or, ya know... make them *ACTUALLY LEGENDARY*‚Ä¶ as in... "Fasnacht Mask Rare".
---
As it stands, the prior duping issue makes legendaries 100% ridiculous.
---
Guess I know where I will be spending the next few session then :)
---
Thank you for tagging, I didn't even think about it.
---
TSE has always been good, even after the nerf, provided you have the perks for that weapon, you are getting a 25% buff on every shot.
---
Instigating is better for one-shotting, unless your aiming at a bloodied build, and Furious is great on High ROF weapons.
---
AAE weapons will do better damage on the Sentinels &amp; Cavaliers armor builds, but for those you are better off with a good Gamma gun or Radium Rifle.
---
AAE also does a little better on the high damage resistant enemies, like SBs &amp; Mirelurks.
---
Thank you for reading!
---
Thanks for listening. We appreciate the work y'all are doing. 
---
Ok I think I got some inspiration from this, I can‚Äôt put a building outside as its destroyable in survival, but I can use your glitch with the pylons and mats and the signs too I think, thanks üëç
---
ItS JuSt a BeTa
---
I finally got the sword after enough server hopping to get level appropriate enemies.  I‚Äôm doing a sniper build with sneak with armor that helps with sneaking,l.  That helped me take care of everyone outside.  Thanks for responding 
---
Ok then my math was wrong 300 head and 150 for body something like that so you need the amount of tokens to show the price 
---
Bases can still be damaged until next patch :(
---
I'm having ups and downs on being optimistic.  I love the fact we are going in the right direction but at times I still have that bit of doubt because of all that has happened. 
---
There is no info about this, but we believe it is the speed that it generates food and water. No limits on how much food or water you can plant outside of resources to build and fit in the workshop, so it is limited, but nothing to do with the numbers. Only 1 has a rebuilt purifier as far as I know.
---
I‚Äôm not sure.  My CAMP wasn‚Äôt attacked.  And I found a spawn campers CAMP and destroyed it and he never came back to defend it.  Does anyone else know?
---
I think just cut down the legendarie effects on armor and weapons can work fine on Survival server.
---
See I agree, the "Idea" of Fallout 76 is great, the first ones outta the vault, go set things up for the future, I even like the lack of NPC's at first(I think they should trickle in once the other vaults are opened or word is spread to other places)
---
Its the little things like the grinding crafting stuff  that add up to a boring game, that and the bugs really
---
I love this idea!
---
I'd like to see it as a toggle.  While in "Place camp mode" you can press and hold (some key....'V' Would actually make sense in the given context) to get an aerial view of the map and the camp bounds.
---
I see a mixed bag in the comments.  I think if I do have the drop on someone I will take the time to evaluate their angle.  I guess its worth taking an extra moment or two.  Looks like an added feature
---
Most were murdered by nutjobs, a few made it to DC and helped found Underworld. It seems odd you don't find at least ONE. I mean, I love how empty and lonely the game is, I think it works to the game's favour.
---
But a few more friendly faces wouldn't hurt (even friendly faces that look like rotten, ground up brahmin meat...)
---
Same with workshop defense.  I don't want to shoot my vertibot, I want to shoot at the dogs trying to tear my doors down.
---
I never thought of it but you're spot on.  If you disable VATs in the "survivor" world, that'd bring a whole new skill level to play in the game.  I've never used it in the past games, but have just recently started using it a lot more and it's pretty crazy what it brings to even a melee build like myself.  Jump over a target then "teleport" to it through the air to nail it.  Not much skill in that besides push the buttons just right.
---
Really just build a 2x2 box with crafting stations and a bed. Water purifiers, and farm outside. Generator with a wire going through a window to power the generators. 
---
Takes no talent at all. What pisses me of is this "talentless" crap is what makes devs try to stupid proof building, making it harder for builders to make anything nice.
---
I've only ever been a casual fallout player. What's the deal with lunchboxes that make them so wanted?
---
Honestly stuff like this is part of why I don't play MMOs.  I much prefer the other Fallout games as far as being able to mod them goes.  If I want to replace all of the Scorchbeasts with My Little Ponies, or all of the mole rats to Level 200 with back-mounted TSE missile launchers, in my own game I'm not hurting anyone else.  But we have to consider what the community will accept, and that just kinda kills the potential of the game from a personalization standpoint.
---
Hopefully private servers will give us a little more variety at some point.
---
I don't think vats crits SHOULD one hit you but that's probably what's doing it. They didn't seem to have nerf that enough in comparison to other methods that were nerfed.  It's basically an auto aim which is generally frowned upon in PvP to begin with lol
---
How should Bethesda have handled it though? ESO can easily gate paid DLC content through zones. But the Wastlanders content coming to 76 (and likely most of the content thereafter) takes place in the same world space. Will you be able to pick up and use items that were introduced through the DLC? How will the game handle new mobs for players who didn't purchase it? What about new/modified overworld spaces? You also can't have different servers for each DLC to circumvent these issues because it would prevent you from playing with your friend who has different DLCs. The devs also can't force you to purchase the DLC if it modifies the base game. 
---
Most people will shoot you 
---
No, get rid of the positioning. Yesterday I was playing a new character, progressed to level 4 after two hours when it suddenly appeared on the leaderboard. a few minutes later I hear then see a level 200+ running towards me.
---
Get rid of that fucking board.
---
Dont see any problems with launching a server with no legendarys at all were u have to make a new character ü§ò would love that!
---
I like the cap loss and reward for pvp. Jus play adventure mode
---
That's an odd thing to say
---
It adds a really easy repeatable form of pvp into the game that people could jump into without much hassle, there could be alternate rewards and I don't see why people would be forced to use customization they don't want to, such as the outfit scenario
---
However you're not really wrong about where Bethesda should be steering the game now, need to fix the mess that is survival and add some actual content to the base, the reason for me wanting deathmatch is because they could tweak it as much they want without adhering to the foundation of the base game, and everyone that is in deathmatch went there because they want to fight people, survival is just a hunting ground for griefers and while that has it's own appeal it isn't really the most applicable form of pvp content
---
I use vats crits and it wasn't killing this guy lol no idea what he was using 
---
Don't feel bad, I never get anything worthwhile either.
---
I love it actually. Those robots were way too slow and easy in the past it was like free handouts designed for the skill-challenged players. Now finally they added a little challenge to make them more interesting. 
---
I call bs
---
Well, the Scorched did its part too. 
---
Similar to Fallout 4. My settlement is under attack, I don‚Äôt want to target my settlers in VATS while dog meat is being walloped by a super mutant 
---
Lol jeez you're using everything aren't you 
---
Possibly the dodgy perk or serendipity was kicking in?
---
Jesus why carry so much? I literally sell any stimpacks, radaway, or rad-x I have beyond 25 because there's no point in keeping them. Every quest and event grants you more as a reward, and if you've got photosynthetic and a decontamination shower, you pretty much don't need them in any kind of abundance. I think the game is set up to make you drop between 25% to 75% of the specific aid item you're carrying. Ie: if you have 200, you can lose up to 150 of them, or as little as 50, but if you only had 10 on you while in  battle, it becomes anywhere between 2 and 7 that you drop instead. Sell your extras, and only carry what you need. Besides, you can't stack stimpack effects so there's no reason to being so many. Bring yourself 10 of each diluted, regular and super stimpacks to help keep your health up. (Hitting your quick aid button will automatically use which ever stimpack type is currently available too so that helps)
---
It seems like it would have been better to open all fast travel locations. They are trying to force conflict by limiting spawn locations instead of letting players explore the world for hours then maybe find another player and decide what to do then. They apparently never played any multi player game with spawn camping before or they would have recognized that few and fixed spawn locations are a bad idea.
---
I use use lvl 2 traveling pharmacy because I hoard stimpacks. For food and water I usually just have a couple cans of dog food (w/good doggy perk) and a few bottles of water. I have an endgame build so I‚Äôm REALLY working on cutting down weight, keeping it lean. 
---
dude, "jut for caps"?  double your level, that adds up, not to mention I think it's stupid that you lose any caps when someone else kills you, let alone double what it is otherwise.
---
That's an interesting solution. Maybe 
---
"That's a nice ship you got there."  
---
"Thanks, it's my new mining barge.  I spent all my savings on it!"   
---
"Sweet, mind if my friends come see it?"  
---
"Sure!"   
---
\*five catalysts jump into local space\*
---
Vault 76 was a social experiment. They wanted to see how a group of survivors would react if and when they learned that they have access to nukes. Would they make sure they never get used again, or would they use them themselves? Guess you know the answer to that.
---
I bought a lvl 45 3* TSE handmade from a player I found in game for 4000 caps.
---
Also bought a lvl 45 2* TSE dragon off another player in the same scenario.
---
Pro Tip = look for groups of high level players gathered in a single location. Approach and request to buy some things. Usually if you buy a syrum or two they‚Äôll realize you mean business and will offer up a nice gun or two.
---
Gotta have the caps tho. 
---
Whoops, I overlooked that... Then we keep waiting \^\^'
---
I think 800 is a very fine/realistic size.  It takes managing, as it should, but I now have enough room for all the mats I need and a good amount of space for keeping the gear I don't want to trash.  There will always be a battle between what I want to keep and throw away, but I see that as part of the game.  I'm trying to save several things for the legendary vendor, but sometimes you gotta make the hard choice to throw away a few things.  
---
I've definitely heard/seen multiple people say the words I said, but even if I was wrong I seriously don't care, dude.
---
Good, good.
---
50% + (45% \* 50%) = 72.5%
---
Basically the 2nd, 3rd etc effect is done against the remainder.  50% from AA leaves 50%, the remaining 50% is then multiplied by Stabilized 45% so in effect you a 72.5% reduction.  There's also a cap to most things in game at 90%, but you can't hit that even with Incisor 3 and an AA melee weapon (87.5% reduction combined).
---
So basically everyone on here is saying survival is too harsh??? 
---
I remember I found like 5 technical data when I was lower level and didn‚Äôt understand what it was for and I dropped them...
---
&gt;It's a game mechanic that Bethesda is currently testing, possibly for potential abuse, 
---
Well, this is survival mode.  "Abuse" really shouldn't even be a consideration because it's supposed to be ruthless.   That means you should have the ability to easily kill people for caps if you have smartly invested in the right perks and the right gear.   
---
It also means you should have the ability to fuck over people that kill you by leaving them with zero caps. 
---
You can't have it both ways.  You can't lecture people about how "it's survival get over it" as long as you make a profit, and then cry about it when you don't.
---
Yeah my build is a vats stealth sniper and I have full sent assassin with a chameleon arm I swap on when I'm not being shot at. My weapon is a aae lever action with 15% more crit meter gain. I'm use to being able to kill people pretty easy even if they have sent or cav gear but not sure what this guy used. I'm more annoyed at how fast I was dying to him considering usaly the full auto weapons dont deal so much per shot 
---
Bless you for this. I‚Äôm having to start from scratch for the third time and couldnt figure out why. I‚Äôm a big decorator so this checks out üòÇ
---
I read about this but every white spring bot I kill has an empty inventory. What am I doing differently here?
---
Hey! I‚Äôll take the healing factor and herd mentality for a friend. Discount on two? If not I‚Äôll survive
---
Diminishing returns. They stack but you will not be over 100% Armor penetration. I‚Äôm not sure for the heavy weapon completely, but melee with insisor and AA caps at about 90%.
---
What's a GOOD use for honey, btw?  I've hung onto 4 or 5, but never noticed a good recipe to use it with.  
---
Yeah right now its almost impossible to play the game in survival unless you just want to pvp because that's what people are doing. 
---
Even if they‚Äôre cheap to make, you can shoot them easily and farm up a good vats critical, and mines can be spotted from miles away, and both of these things have indicators, so no, you can‚Äôt ambush people with those. 
---
Not to mention, why in the hell would you use grenades that can be at the very least 45 percent resisted instead of a handmade that kills much faster?
---
I think that lvl 1-50 is too much of a difference, would prefer something like 1-25, 26-50, 51+
---
I would constantly create new characters just for the low lvl pvp experience, everyone with pipe weapons, low damage(no one shooting)
---
The 51+ tier might need adjustments, it is actually worse for higher lvl characters because of the caps lost on death.
---
/thirded for a toggle  
---
The enclave robot event features attacking mobs that sometimes start as non-hostile.
---
Sure 500 caps off each. Can you wait for a few hours though?
---
Oooh good question! I recently joined my friend - in the SBQ fight. Unprepared. :(
---
I made it, but it was tense as I didn‚Äôt have my best SB weapons or power armor on or even the right perks equipped. (I had been finishing off some easy challenges.)
---
Learned my lesson.
---
No but not because of the ammo. I don‚Äôt use them because I use rifles so it‚Äôs weight prohibitive to have a regular gun and a prime gun. I also don‚Äôt want to constantly be switching receiver mods. 
---
I feel the prime weapons/ammo were supposed to be endgame weapons... I feel like Bethesda thought the SBQ would end up being a bigger portion of the endgame than it happened to be.  If all I were doing was SBQ runs it would make sense for me to have that equipped but now, not as much. 
---
I‚Äôll be on, let me know. Any IE Hunting/Lever? 
---
It has more in common with an FPS deathmatch than an mmorpg pvp mode. There are serious differences in play and longetivity.
---
true, I forgot about that. 
---
Where can one start this search? How do you know how many there are, where to look, and if you've found them all? I've seen a couple of them in game because I recognize the location/body from the picture. 
---
This sounds cool for my wife and I to do tonight, but where should we start? Are there holotapes?
---
I've only gotten combat armor once dropping technical data. Is there some secret to get the armor/outfits?
---
Not really tho, when we knew it may happen. Its foolish to carry 100 stimpacks anyway
---
It was pretty much the clean-up crew by the end of things.
---
I love this idea. I never see anybody inside the shopping area in Top of the World, and there's not much loot or lore in there. That place could be further Raider-ised to be an arena or something.
---
Definitely worth it! Play in a party and you dont have to worry about the community, although I havent had many issues. Now that you can essentially turn pvp off in adventure mode, you guys should really enjoy it!
---
Play adventure, and stay in a party, you'll be fine!
---
Hmm yeah that is odd.  We're your shots connecting and not doing much damage or we're they just being dodged maybe?
---
also I don't run sentinel myself and I don't want to insult your intelligence and you probably already know this if it's true but I've read sentinel does no reduction when you're crouched or moving, so you weren't doing either of those things?  
---
Happy to see some love for one of my favorite events. It was a nice surprise finding Beckham after reading Edna's terminal entries in Berkeley
---
I did too - just found out today in another thread. Bummed me out, but after a huge spike in CAMP griefing this past weekend, it seems quieted down now. 
---
Most of those best and brightest were most likely to be middle aged or older when they closed the door.
---
But some players don't want to belong to a faction. Lone Survivor gives them perks and equipment that is beneficial to a person on their own. The most beneficial one would be the knowing where the travelling merchants are at all times. Also a Lone Survivor CAMP that is cheap and placeable anywhere. 
---
But solo and group Faction perks are a good idea also. Also, you have to figure Factions like BoS and Enclave as well as Raiders would have scouts and snipers who work better alone. 
---
Maybe a subset of each faction where you have a job title or designation.
---
the legendary system in this game is so weird, how can a creature be legendary and not even have a star?
---
If your car had a problem after you purchased it brand new, the problem would have been fixed for free under warranty... THE UPDATES ARE FREE FOR LIFE. I'm not sure what you have to complain about...
---
Commendations would work, but unfortunately no matter what they do, people's first reaction is to try to exploit it. It's what they do. However, it would be much easier to use a point or currency system that isn't tied to caps because it's so easy to exploit. Perhaps they should make this the penalty:
---
If you don't have enough caps to reward a player for killing you, then you will not receive caps from any player that you have killed until you reach the mandatory minimum based on your level. 
---
So if I was lvl 100, I'd need a minimum of 200 caps on me to be able to collects cap rewards for killing another player. In addition this works the other way around. If you get killed by a player who does not have the funding, you won't lose your caps to that individual either. 
---
PS so cool to see another Desta around. Hope you've been enjoying the game. 
---
You're right, so I stoped. I doubt the devs feel the same way as you though. No one sets out to launch a game to get negetive pr and critical reception. In a flooded looty, shooty, crafty, market they needed a strong launch to secure a good market for the atom shop, and in that regard it probably failed. Fo76 will always have diehard fans who stuck through the poor launch, but I don't ever see it making a massive resurgence. If were being honest to the game do anything amazingly well to compete with other games? Story? Gunplay? Basebuilding? Looting? Role playing? Character progression? It does most of those things ok at best. Unless one or multiple of those elements gets a massive overhaul I think the game is stuck being niche at best.    
---
Inb4 if you dont like it don't play.
---
^------ Name checks out. 
---
There is a game chat that people can use to talk to nearby players. But you won‚Äôt hear them and they won‚Äôt hear you if your in some sort of party or chat room (I‚Äôm on Xbox so I‚Äôm not sure what the PS4 equivalent is)
---
I hidden 20k caps. And keep 2k on my main. Got zero now, even tho i killed more people than i died. Being level 200 is pain.
---
pistols can tear through an enemy with vats crits
---
This really depends on your internal corporate cultural
---
Look for the campfire by their name in the social menu.. campfire =survival as bgs has said
---
I'm melee and have a few mutant's that I love and are often goto weapons.  When you add 10% damage to 400 base damage, that's a noticeable affect.  
---
I've had this thought as well, but I really think the pinpoint of the top 3 should be removed altogether.  I think it creates what everyone is calling 'deathmatch' mode, which can be a fun and exciting play style, but sometimes I prefer to sneak around the map doing quests or farming for legendaries, but the current implementation there is a sort of ticking time bomb to where I can do that, and then once i'm exposed I have to either logout, suicide myself, or go hole up and wait for the party.  I would keep the leaderboards and stats because that part is great.  I think the only player markers should be for wanted players, and maybe make the since of the search ring proportional to the size of the bounty.....so if you put a 10 cap bounty there is only a vague location (ie - large circle).  If you put a 1000 cap bounty, you get a much smaller circle.  
---
You can still whisper?
---
I would pay about 400-650 for one.
---
Awesome, hope it helps! 
---
I heard someone using the Tinker‚Äôs bench in Watoga station, while I was getting near the crashed vertibird in the middle of town. 
---
Gotta give them a good woopin in pvp. 
---
Oh I meant like in the bottom corner for people with keyboards or something.  Thanks
---
I wonder if that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll encounter in the underground exploration addition mentioned in the 2019 roadmap.
---
Moving its doesnt but I usually crouch and it works unless they change something 
---
I would like to see a priority system, where if you change targets it can go to the last one to damage you. I'm taking hits, I'd like to fight back, not kill that radroach minding its own business two counties over.
---
I'm almost positive our characters are in a memory lounger in vault 76 right now, we were told to rebuild, maybe it was all another experiment...
---
That's probably the best idea I've read yet actually lol.  I could still see it being exploited somehow in a team situation, unless they made the whole team not get caps for kills if one party member does not have enough caps.  Less easily exploited at least. 
---
But at least we don't have to be suspicious about player encounters in general. Only about random team invites. 
---
idk about you. But, I'm happy to play earlier with bugs rather than later without. Just saying. Also if it was too buggy for you on release. The updates are free and no one's making you play it. So, I'm not sure that's a very good argument. 
---
I think you guys would have a. lot of fun especially if you play together. I ran into this very young kid yesterday and helped him build a basic settlement and gave him a run thru of what he needed to do. He was braving the world by himself. He was pretty mature considering and quite normal for a young kid, not sure his age, but my guess 7-10 .. if you play in a team, lots of people will help you out .. if you like shooting things, then this game is for you .. been playing since the beta and still play daily and love it. I actually play two characters at a time and two xboxes .. I am not sure what PK means, so hopefully someone else can help you out ..  not sure it is better, it is pretty much the same but with a lot of nerf's .. still tons of fun to be had, many mechanics to figure out, food and water are the probably the hardest
---
Got it, thanks! üëçüèª
---
Okay I'm not sure cuz I don't use it but that's what I read on reddit.  Maybe test out and see if that is why
---
My hubby and I got a second xbox and play together.  It's a blast.
---
if we are still in the vault, as I think we are, there very well could be NPCs when we surface for real...
---
Totally agree about friendly turrets and robots, but the Brahmin can stay. I don't trust them at all and want to keep them in my sights, there's a reason they have survived this long. Beware of the watching Brahmin!
---
Or you know, we did play it, had a bad time and don't like the thought of waiting a few years in the hope it gets good...
---
I got a T-60 BOS Paint skin from it a few days ago.  I was stunned.
---
I've taken to making mule characters, of course I have 3 characters who have 800 pounds of Legendaries now, lol
---
It literally is though..
---
At the very least, friendlies shouldn't be able to be targeted while there are enemies around. 
---
No, not the 90% weight reduction - it's missing the addition of the concrete block on the end that always signals the obvious weight reduction. üòâ
---
This is awesome.
---
they have a long term plan for this game, at the very least being in a simulation offers them a reset button, one day we wake up in a memory lounger still in the vault and when we surface it could be anything, even full of life...
---
Are you on over the weekend?
---
Play adventure mode like the others said. Being in a party is good, and soloing is also good, having a few decent people on your friends list is a plus.
---
So there's a use for them ? I kept around 20 of them (no weight so why not) but i still don't know what they do :/ (and i didn't want to spoil myself)
---
Hey there! 
---
I read about them on the terminal just outside the Vault itself. But, didn‚Äôt know they were in the game. Then I stumbled across two naturally in Sunny Top Sky Resort. So, I did some googling and found this: 
---
I just followed all the locations in that article.
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware there are only 12 and that‚Äôs confirmed through data mining. No holotapes as of yet. But I bet they‚Äôll be added when the vault opens.
---
I hope you and your wife enjoy this! I‚Äôd love to see your screen shots!
---
If I need it to go to work tmrw and they told me it would be running in 2 years, even if it was free I wouldn't be happy...
---
or we are in a memory lounger
---
Honestly this is probably one of the best ways to enjoy it, I found early on that playing solo just wasnt that rewarding to me, but grouping up with friends or helping lower level players was a blast. 
---
Can we please get the option to change pip boy light colors and HUD colors like the previous games? Please guys. I‚Äôm not even sure why this feature was removed. 
---
Ya that makes more sense. Keep the lone survivors faction but having titles/positions/jobs meant for solo play as well as group in the other factions
---
Looks fantastic as it is, anyway!  Please don't take my comment as criticism.
---
You could also data mine the torch audio and pipe that from it.  ;)
---
Yeah I am only speculating but have yet to confirm. Perhaps later I‚Äôll run some tests to confirm my suspicion. In any case, powering up Monogah takes bout 10 minutes these days and usually gets me at least 600 xp, one 3* ghoul, and some technical data (usually spawns in the reactor control room). Well worth it even if it doesn‚Äôt boost ammo production imo, but even more so if it does.
---
Star Wars Galaxies was amazing 
---
With the amount of people waiting at train stations and good Legendaries being used in survival, it‚Äôs kind of hard to keep Caps to being with. I always grind out a bit of dough before I hop to survival and usually have left with nothing, not that I care really as it‚Äôs fairly easy to work them back up. I‚Äôm sure something will be done in the future once things even out, but as it stands a debuff will be kind of unfair, especially if you get spawn killed. This dosent touch on random encounters as I have rarely found anyone beyond a train station, unless they are top three.
---
True. I haven‚Äôt been too suspicious - but after repeatedly seeing my CAMP get wrecked by roving bands of asshats, I was finally seeing the ugly side of 76. 
---
I‚Äôd previously only had 2 shitty encounters since beta. Now I‚Äôm really looking forward to safe CAMPs .
---
It does enviornmental story telling better than MOST games. It's formula is also unique to itself. The closest game in terms of big map with not many people on it at the same time is like GTAVO. There isn't a game that's like Fallout that's also online. Unless it's an MMO. FO76 is NOT an MMO though. You'll know this if you've ever played a single MMO in your life.  
---
I'll test it out. It isn't as invisible as you think lol I have been trying to find replacement gear anyway because I dont pvp much 
---
Cheers for the info I'll take it on board, tbh I play solo most times so doubtful anyone would stim me lol.
---
I don't mind my errors explained, it helps me to find better alternatives 
---
It's 40. Not that big of a deal.
---
hmm...  that is the one wrench in the theory, however it can be explained, either through straight up retconning or something like the AI that controls our simulation has access to the outside world and builds our world based on what it sees...
---
No legendaries.
---
Maybe if you're in a team on survival they could make a "cap pool" for your team. If your team puts in 3k, all members on that team have 3k to win/lose with. That way no teams can lure players with one of their teammates (who would have no caps themselves) into a death trap for their caps. Consequently once the team ran out of money in the pool, they could be prompted to either put in more money or disband the team. 
---
both fallout 4 and 76 are for 18+
---
Everything you have said is true right up until you end up number 3 on the leaderboard, and then it is objectively false.
---
I get frustrated not being able to see the brown bag in brown grass when I die. The bags should glow or something for the person who died. 
---
Can I ask, are you using a new player?  Crouch does NOT affect the top 3, but if they're in a region you haven't discovered yet they won't show up.  Probably only an issue for new players.  
---
They are there. I took a day tripper once to improve my luck and I landed the Knight paint. Have also landed the Knight Captain paint. Lots of farming though.... 
---
Can you inform me about the results?
---
Same with assassin's sentinel. Some rifles are killing me in 1 - 2 hits. Oh well though. I'm OP to some people and some people are OP to me. That's the way it goes! 
---
No that‚Äôs not a thing on PS4. Just proximity voice chat if you‚Äôre not in a party. And honestly the interactions I‚Äôve experienced in over 550+hrs on this game have all been generally friendly and very appropriate for young kids
---
I too use a rifle as a main. I really wish I could make a use of prime automatic handmade reciever and have fun with it. To me, ultracite 5.56 ammo are too precious to use it such a way so I just stick with a harden reciever. We don't get much SBQ fights nowadays, huh? Seems recent adrenal reaction nerf made it even rarer.
---
I will be after work.  I should be off around 6 or 7 PM Pacific time
---
Lol same, well I'm not at zero but ive lost about 1.3k despite having killed a lot more than I've died .  Hardly get any return.  It's even worse cuz I was partied with some level 10s to allow them to use the xp buff for team play so they get some of the caps too when I kill lol
---
Yeah I take one at a time a turn it in and repeat 
---
Damn. I was expecting some spray-painted crap made out of toilet rolls and old milk cartons. This is excellent!
---
Rofl!
---
Nah, fireproof perk neuters it like a cute puppy.
---
What about legendaries that aren't damage related? Like weightless or in my case a quad handmade. They aren't as game changing as bloodied or instigating imo 
---
Can't scrap legendaries yet bud :) check your stash!
---
Checked your storage? Cause you can‚Äôt scrap legendaries 
---
F
---
Seems random. I got two nifty outfits and random stuff. I treat it like a slot machine :)
---
Once in a while - it pays out!
---
I wouldn't go for one. With a tse handmade, full rifle perks and luck for crits mine does 100 dmg tse weapons aren't strong. You need a bloodied and good armor.
---
This type of sledge has only been around for 4 and 76
---
Skyrim?
---
If you are PS4 I can mod your combat armor to BOS if you‚Äôd like
---
Ha maybe, my cavalier is near invincible until I stop sprinting or run out of AP and forced to stop sprinting or attack and forced to stop sprinting.  I just imagine sentinel is the same lol
---
It is fun running through fully auto explosive fire from one tree to the next to close in on a target lol
---
I have the exact same setup as Medieval_Paul. With my main account being used on my One X and my Trading/Vendor being on my old Elite Xbox One. Everything he said is 100% correct. 
---
I just want to add that I did a Scorchbeast Queen right at Fissure Prime on my old Elite Xbox and it ran wel under 20 FPS. It got in the single digit FPS when I started firing faster fire rate guns too. So my experience tells me to get the One X if you can afford it and want as smooth an experience as possible. 
---
P.S. Paul I have the same weird friends list issue on my main character. Where my friends list will be blank until I switch servers. It works fine on my trader Xbox account on my old Xbox. From what I have gathered those of us that played the B.E.T.A., and during launch week, are the ones that have a chance of a screwed up blank friends list. 
---
I can't make a mule or alt. Not only do I feel it is a bit like cheating, but I am a loner and only have the one xbox. So this sounds like you need that sort of thing to do survival ( and player vending when that comes around, I suppose).
---
Ya I suppose good wasn't the best word I know they have still been decent weapons even after Nerf.  I keep seeing ppl talking about TSE in survival and I wasn't sure with the new PVP danage system maybe they were top tier again.
---
I have been running bloodied build which I feel the damage caps sorta ruined for PVP? I have not had a lot of time to test yet though.
---
Why show them on the map at all?
---
It's like Fortnite without all of the base building nonsense except aim bot is not only allowed it's encouraged and you don't drop your awesome legendary weapon when you die.
---
YES! I shot a teammate just yesterday and couldn‚Äôt get it across (on xbox1, so typing takes forever, so I usually only use emotes to communicate (no mic)) and didn‚Äôt have enough time to explain before vengeance was brought.
---
STOP playing that shitty mmo
---
I know I just like the handmade tse I had one accidentally dropped it somebody snagged it kind a want another one back
---
Anti armor, vats crits, staggering, and rads can all hurt you lol people with shotguns are a pain it's like all there shots stagger
---
A lvl 2 kill counts toward the leaderboard and the legendary rewards just the sames as a lvl 200 kill.
---
Yep, the board is what is going to kill the mode
---
did you accidentally put it in your stash while stashing junk? scrapping legendaries is impossible so you simply can‚Äôt have gotten rid of it that way. if not that, you might‚Äôve just dropped it by accident, the inventory sometimes lags and drops wrong items in that category while dropping other stuff
---
Did it. Is not there
---
If the mob is in combat with you or anything else he no longer gets the sneak attack bonus.
---
Already did it, i found all my other stuff, not him.
---
Oh, mightier than thou, who never complains about anything and always accepts whatever trash a company throws at them. Yeah, bud, you‚Äôre better than everyone.
---
Ahh gotcha. You could probably find one for like 4-6k
---
So, I figure it's better to run one handed until you get to the level where you can equip the Bette rtwo handers. At that point switch perk cards to slugger. 
---
Speaking doesn't seem hard and yet you can't.
---
You dont need to see them or have a directo line of sight if you have a quad autom√°tic tesla lol, even those using the chamaleon glitch arent harder to kill
---
Not gonna lie I like the new balance, some players went down fast but others didnt.. but really it seems like everyone but me is upset over survival mode and pvp, I'm totally diggin it. 
---
True it would be unfair but it is circumventable to just go to adventure travel somewhere, then swap back to survival.  Spawn killing should be fixed too though, should show up in a random location near your fast travel destination rather than always in the same spot lol
---
Can you suggest getting rid of the top three thing altogether as well? For many showing the top three on the map is what is killing the game mode altogether.
---
If you are not using PA I suggest unarmed weapons. Mole miners gauntlet, deathclaw gauntlet, powerfist.
---
They also spawn at a lower rate. I was in Watoga for over an hour without seeing a single legendary (usually I'll get 5 or 6) 
---
I had hoped it would be the same basic experience but without PvP restrictions, so any time you see another player, you don't know what will happen. Unfortunately it seems to encourage the worst parts of PvP imo. I also don't love losing tons of stimpacks and caps because I don't grind for those things. I didn't want deathmatch and I really hope it evolves into something better than a bad copy of other PvP games.
---
Urgh this used to make me shout at the screen every single time. That and targeting squirrels. 
---
I just leave stuff in the overseer's stash at her camp.  New players always go the place and look in that stash, so I just drop all known plans I have into the box, along with aid items and lower level legendaries I find. 
---
Paint and the shielded lining armor. 
---
Can confirm at least the first part. I got the Boss t-60 paint plans prior to patch 7.
---
Are there actually people who don't build on cliff edges?
---
Agreed... I have the same issue the handmade but mostly because of the weight. I killed my first queen in about a month yesterday. I used to see these on practically every other server but now you can hop forever (looking for xo1 mods) and not come across any. 
---
Yeah same, but the staggering shot of a shotgun seems to be reduced still and the rate if fire is slow enough that I can Sprint again before the next connects.  Not sure how sentinel works, maybe a way to shorten stagger duration
---
Indeed, something will be done eventually, still a beta after all.
---
Yes but Fallout 76 isn't unplayable like a car being undrivable. It's more like your paint is fucked up from the factory, maybe your seat won't adjust or your CD player is broken. If I bought a car and it had all those problem right after I bought it, I'd be upset too. This is understandable. But the point is it's not unplayable/ undrivable because your CD Player doesn't work. All the updates and DLC are forever free. Be patient and it will all be fixed some time. They've actually fixed most of the glaring issues. Most of the problem with it are "under the hood" now. Pun intended. You get what I'm saying?
---
I agree.  It's all just a pvp free for all currently. If they wanted that they should have just made a pvp mode that you just que for matches and then have a deathmatch 
---
Be glad you don't lose more. In a real situation your armor, weapons, ammo and ALL of your aid would be theirs to take.
---
Kill All Squirrels
---
He was probably still on adventure server. Imagine yourself facing a bunch of players all want to kill and rob you repeatedly for your belongings. Dimwit players are much more annoying than molerats. 
---
i think theres also one in a port-o-potty at dolly sods
---
I'm sure cav has a better time against shotguns. I usaly just start loving around it's harder for them to hit me with shotguns if I'm moving so my armor doesnt matter 
---
Maybe you vendored it on accident. I did that with my all rise once, luckily I bought it back.
---
Is it just me or do they spawn a lot less frequently lately? I can usually get one every server in the Whitespring bunker, but now I may have to hop 5-10 times before finding a single one. 
---
Then you should have people protecting you right?
---
I'm not new to the game and I'm not a moron, I know which mode I'm playing in (and using your logic, if I was in survival mode then their friend shooting me would've killed me or at least initiated PVP) and I know whether or not I have owned or contested a workshop. My teammate also knows what he's doing. Neither of us owned or contested a workshop nor were we in survival mode. Why can't people accept that there are still errors in the game without assuming people don't know what they're talking about?
---
I used it until basically i got to the bench, i found a few molerats attacking my crops.
---
Definitely cheaper if you find the right person :) I think I bought mine for 2k months ago. I would assume they're cheaper now
---
Are you making sure that it says hidden when you do it?  
---
I noticed every time I thought I was hidden it was caution. I just went down the street hopped on a roof and shot a ghoul.
---
I mean, I (and many others) enjoy them as a system.  I think they add some necessary life to the current weapons system.  Games are all about compromising realism for fun, so I‚Äôm okay with it, unrealistic as it may be.
---
I guess you gotta ask to what extent the game should be realistic.  In a wasteland filled with aliens, Deathclaws, mythical creatures, and literal superpowers, it‚Äôs not that crazy.  It does lack an in-universe explanation as far as I know, which sucks for immersion, but I think a lot of the game would be missing without it.
---
Not at all. It is more arcade action than immersive  survival game as it is now 
---
And Shielded Lining for BoS underarmor is valuable too. Been trying to get it forever. Have gotten all the outfits so far, none of the paints and not the plans for Lining...
---
Toughen up, and stop acting like a little bitch.  If you quit a game forever because someone killed you one time in your first attempt, it wasn't for you anyway.
---
The risk/reward ratio is way off in my opinion so I have no incentive to want to play survival.  Kill someone 5 times then loss all I got from them by dying once just because I'm a higher level despite levels not meaning a thing after level 50.
---
Where do you get the plans for the .50 cal receiver? 
---
Its the default rotting body model they have, not ghouls
---
I agree with all of this, though I don‚Äôt think the aid drops as they stand are an issue. It‚Äôs more that people are carrying ludicrous amounts of meds on them for some reason, imo
---
I am right there with you 100%
---
I play with my wife and son who is 10 and he loves it. You know your kids the best, but we have had great fun playing together.
---
Pick any spawn point besides watoga and white springs.. yes ppl are spawn camping so my camp ain't far off the road so I can SPAWN IN SAFETY which gets me back to where I need to be without spawn dying.. I wait 10 20 min for ppl to clear out of busy pvp areas and go looting bags, idk what to now as I'm over weight with aid which I'm guessing ima lose soon lol.. 
---
There is indeed! I've just noticed I didn't upload that one. Thanks for reminding me. I'll make a little edit after work :)
---
Same time zone... I'm usually on between 4p-8p most nights. Weekends most of the day. I can pop-on at just about anytime for a 'quickie' outside of my working hours of 6a-4p. If you have a time today outside of the 6a-4p, let me know, I'll be there.
---
I like this idea.  Like making them really feel legendary, instead of me selling five Stalker‚Äôs Rolling Pins a day.
---
You would think so wouldn't you but that's not always the case. Have you played healers in any game befor. People dont think about protecting them half the time lol
---
Much like most guns that aren't pistols do the same.
---
If you cant hang, you don't belong.
---
it‚Äôs a crushing blow when the reward is an instigating 40mm launcher üòÇ
---
I just got it last Friday, already put in well over 60 in game hours, loving every second. Long-time Fallout fan and this one is tied for my favorite due to the multiplayer.
---
2k
---
How about a Fortress?
---
I am actually disgusted that they spent all those dev hours making this and the game continues tk crash
---
I don‚Äôt think this will ever happen. It‚Äôs a step too far I think. Unless they create some sort of pvp battle arena in the world. Where players can opt in to risk their shit in a 1v1 or something 
---
A beta shouldn't make you lose actual items on a live environment though. 
---
If a teammate shoots you in survival you don't take damage.  You keep referring to him as your teammate so I'm not sure what you mean.  I don't have to help you figure out what happened but slap damage is 0 now so figure it out yourself if you're going to get offended over it lol bye
---
I believe that haircut is called the Radiation, or something in that manner please correct me. I know this style is very popular with children of atom in fallout history and it‚Äôs kinda displayed as if their hair was falling out due to radiation. Maybe 94 is undergoing some kind of low dose radiation inside their vault.  
---
You're saying it's more hardcore to level up on easy mode and switch a character over to survival? This makes sense to you how?
---
Hopefully in future content. 
---
I think "running away" is every bit as much a part of a survival mode as is "fight".  
---
Me too, this mode is an arcade game, and a bad one at that. 
---
I like finding those and the Mistress of Mysteries agents. If you read the computer logs and listen to the holo tapes from the mansion, you'll find just about every agent that comes up listed / missing in those recordings is dead somewhere in the world and you'll find their bodies. I've only found a couple that had any loot on them, would be cool if they had any of their spy gear with them.
---
have you used a nuka grenade to kill someone yet?
---
That part I agree with. Maybe you loose far less.
---
Yes, he was on adventure - just saying that joining a friend blind can be risky. I‚Äôm curious to know if you can join friends jumping from one type server to the other.
---
If those morons didn't nuke the whole planet, there wouldn't be Fallout 76.
---
Are technical data now stacking?
---
thanks for the info, is that intended? it sure sound like a bug to me
---
what should i do about it?
---
Yep, literally just treat other players as extra enemies. People can't PvP for shit it seems. Try a game like Dark Souls lol
---
You are a more patient man than I, I cannot stand trying to communicate through a mic when the other doesnt have one. I will try a few yes no questions but by the 3rd of 4th crouch jump in front of me, I am ready to bug out.
---
I actually did that before. but didnt take any pictures of it. I can do another one.
---
Yes, I would recommend it. I meet many families playing together and they all seem to love it.
---
I don't want an easy mode switch over I want true survival. You start a character on survival you stay on survival. None of this Pansy switch in over crap.
---
I would totally support Bethesda patching the game so you lose your armor and weapons upon your death.
---
The issue isn't having to watch your back, but rather the difficulty of finding three star legendary enemies.
---
i mean live sercurity camericnas in camps would be cool, if it's to much for the servers even just an object you connect to your terminal that tells you if a player entered your camp while you ever away that would ping your pip boy
---
I agree! I started a brand new character but was very apprehensive about it. Turns out to be a blast! I have killed 2 people and only been killed 3 times! One of the dudes I got was 40 levels higher than me! Start g the game fresh with all the knowledge I have gained in my OG character combined with the stress and added junk /aid management makes it for a much different and fun experience! I'm sticking to it :) 
---
You mentioned you carry over 200 fluxes... that should weigh a lot and I suppose you used a Pack Rat perk. Weight related perks I use are 2 bandolier, 2 Thru Hiker and 1 Traveling Pharmacy. I carry around a handmade, a hunting rifle and a double-barrel shotty and an assaultron blade. I try to carry about 30 of each aid items. Still, rifles are pretty heavy and I feel we need weight reduction effect on one of rifle related perks.
---
Just another tally on the side of their gun.
---
I completely agree, I‚Äôm all for pvp when it‚Äôs necessary and it‚Äôs a lot of fun but it‚Äôs not what the main focus should be lol. 
---
Regarding helping other players, I‚Äôve always enjoyed doing exactly that. Whether it‚Äôs a goodie bag, starter items or help on specific quest. Recently though I‚Äôve found it really difficult and literally can‚Äôt give stuff away atm. It‚Äôs quite odd lol.
---
Every time I've gotten this quest, I've had to server hop to get it to complete. 
---
Yes me too, I'm tired of pve I've waited months for this
---
oh you THICC thicc üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©
---
As you point out, in PvE, most things don't live long enough for Executioners to really matter, outside of Scorchbeasts and the Mirelurk Queen.
---
I actually have an Executioner's Power Fist that I've been itching to try on the Scorchbeast Queen.  It hovers around 580 base damage for me, and gets clear up to 980 if I'm low health, and then a 40% bonus on top of that?  That's awesome.  If I had Nerd Rage fully decked out and a few more bits of Unyielding, I could get it higher.  But, unfortunately, it's Unarmed and I don't stand a chance against the SBQ at close range without Power Armor simply due to the immense Rads.  There are ways you could get around this with Rad Sponge and a teammate, but that's not always an option.
---
Mutants is just forgettable.  It would be kind of interesting if it stacked with the number of Mutations you had.
---
Where do you get these from the bunker i never seem to walk out that place with any
---
Power armor absolutely needs legendary effects 
---
Another player I play with said after a crash he had lost his powerfist and all rise. SO be careful out there.
---
Give a mouse a cookie...
---
Hmm also could work.  We will see if Bethesda takes note of anything in the next update
---
Also executioner's is useless on anything capable of one shotting.
---
Bring salt. Much funnier.
---
I was just thinking, why isn't this posted on /fo76.. lol  
---
I like that they update the turrets!
---
This reminded me of an experience I had the other day. I asked a low level in Flatwoods if they wanted some spare crafting recipes I had. They ran away and looted a government supply drop I‚Äôd just spawned. They became wanted so me in my bathrobe smashed them with a super sledge.
---
It isn't crazy, it is the most sane suggestion
---
The only reason I'm not putting mine straight into the garbage is because someone will buy it for a stupid price because it's a named weapon.
---
&gt;By the time you reach lvl 70 you should have your build completely put together and corrected any perk mistakes  
---
I mean, this is bullshit but I do agree that the max caps we should lose should be 50, since after that we just become more of a target
---
Don't think it's a bug, there's really nothing you can do tbh, stealth builds only suit solo play unfortunately.  If it wasn't like this then scorched queen would be a roflstomp.
---
Item renaming, all venderbots but Enclave in Whitesprings, up to a 1400 cap limit for a vendor...
---
I will go touch myself now
---
How fucking dumb are you that you DON'T KNOW A STANDARD SPOILER FEATURE THE ENTIRE FUCKING INTERNET HAS USED SINCE 1997?!!!!
---
I always figured it was a done by a robot with that haircut as default. 
---
I was just thinking it would be great for spawn point and stash areas to be non pvp 
---
Holy shit, renaming and centralized vendors are going to be amazing. This will also create a hub to trade with others more often! 
---
How are people carrying over 800 pounds of shit? Every since the increased it to 800 I've never had a problem with stash
---
No kidding? I checked my effects and it didn‚Äôt say anything. Hmm. Well; time to sleep it off I guess. üòÅ
---
Then lose gear, at the total amount of caps you would have lost... value calculated based on in-game vendor purchasing, without perk or charisma bonuses applied. Gear vanishes from the victim, and is transferred to the victor in Caps.
---
They'll start carrying caps, once they start losing their armour and weapons.
---
Yeah, I was sure someone would have posted it first, so I was refreshing a bit just in case, I didn't want to be posting it if it was already here.
---
But yeah, I'm really excited for the vendor changes. It'll be so much more convenient.
---
And the renames will be so convenient for sorting my inventory and getting all the "keep these" type items grouped together.
---
Or here is another option. Build a power plant on the small dam near Harpers Ferry. (Its to the north east of Harpers and is close to the road going over the water. Im not talking about Crevasse Dam)
---
I had no idea about this! I just assumed it was the one in Flatwoods. Perhaps this will be my next personal quest. Thanks for this!
---
I‚Äôll check on that for sure. It was in my T-51, so it might have broken faster.
---
But points mean prizes
---
[Also my reaction](https://media.giphy.com/media/l4JyV4nyvJj834IZW/giphy.gif)
---
How do you fix your perk mistakes? I thought once you spent 15 points in that categories you can‚Äôt buy anymore??
---
Ha wow, I'm not prepared to make such a bold statement myself xD lol
---
No and no. The economy is good right now, raising the cap limit is going to make player selling absolutely terrible and it‚Äôs bad enough that it is now since a lot of items now go for 25k because they can. Just Bethesda raising the sell limit from 5k to 25k has destroyed the market. Now add on the ease of getting more caps from a vendor run, this shoots the demand for anything now gun ands items that are selling from 7k-10k will be 16k-20k, ammo will then now longer be 2 or 3 from 1 cap but now 1 for 1 or 1 for 2 caps, typical goods like purified water and flux will raise and don‚Äôt even ask to buy legendary armor sets from vendors, as of right now you‚Äôll need two maybe even three characters max caps to buy Sentinel assassin armor, don‚Äôt even want to know if cap space is doubled. Probably looking at 100-200k, especially with duper‚Äôs stocks getting low.
---
Yeah, restarted many times. I will check if things are broken... or I have a hangover; which seems likelyZ üòÑ
---
Now now now, this is just speculation... but the Wastelanders DLC coming in autumn looks like it might be adding in NPCs to the game.  
---
Take that with a pinch of salt though
---
No penalty in Survival. I believe adventure is still the same.
---
Yeah that to
---
Awesome. Love all of it
---
Yes, shoot first. If you don‚Äôt do that, 85% of cases, you just signed your death wish
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Alien_blaster_(Fallout_76)
---
This seems to indicate otherwise. Maybe you can learn some from scrapping
---
It's fine how it is really, it is a random amount too as I've lost alot or none of important items.  If you suck and keep dyin you deserve to lose everything, stop spawning in the same area repeatedly. At least we dont lose our ENTIRE INVENTORY like other games..
---
It totally sucks, and happens way too much. My only advice is to make sure you are on a team when you launch so if you disconnect you can rejoin the server easily.
---
They wrecked your camp, which now marks them as wanted and enemies, so they killed you. It's a weird thing but it happens
---
Then let the ones with more money than brains buy thier early access. Game should RELEASE in a playable state. Fo76 was not playable for a massive amount of people.
---
I was lucky. I could play around an hour before each crash. A friend never got to play the first week. And others was able to play ever now and then. The release was complete and utter garbage. The way Bethesda has handled nearly anything about the game has been garbage. Every single thing around fo76 has been about grabbing money except the new pvp mode.
---
Telling me to get the fuck over it shows how much you dont care. So, I have a car I wanna sell you. It runs....sometimes. It looks cool. It's fun. But the car just shifts into whatever gear it feels like. Up, down....it doesn't even matter. 
---
I'd prefer it to be annual, but to have more similar events.
---
Nice!  I‚Äôm excited for renaming mostly lol.  When does this drop in April?
---
Wow - I don't care what else they do with the patch. The vendors and turret changes are painting me a bright shade of happy :D
---
There not equal because if you haven‚Äôt got marsupial and a two shot explosive or Tesla (don‚Äôt bother aiming) rifle, then I wouldn‚Äôt even bother playing 
---
Go play adventure mode and stop complaining
---
I think you are missing one big weakness to these Sentinel/Cav Assassin sets: VATs Crits. Chews right through the armor.
---
Craftable cooking oil would be great, hope it happens sometime.
---
I didn't play during Beta, I bought the new One X for myself after Christmas because the Old Elite would sometimes randomly reboot due to Overheating, I have since added an external cooling fan and solved that issue, but I have had lots of issues adding friends on the One X from the in game social menu, it works fine in the XBL menu, but the Old Elite works on either.
---
Make it a set of Survival Mode exclusive quests where you talk to an NPC, then have to collect a certain number of tokens from killing other players, then turn them in for a reward.
---
**Questgivers and Rewards:**
---
* Rose, Top of the World: "I'm bored. Kill some people and bring me their **Ears.**"  
---
* MODUS, Whitespring Bunker: "We're detecting a lot of... interesting... activity. Please acquire some... combat data for us and we'll grant you... access to the 'special reserve' in exchange for... **Commendations.**"  
---
* BOS Terminal at Fort Defiance: "There are a lot of high-powered pre-war artifacts in the wrong hands. Go out there, reclaim those **Artifacts**, and bring them back to us."
---
For adventure mode sure, why not. For Survial Mode no. Play first 50 levels in adventure mode, simple as that. Instead in survival mode they should hard limit the caps you drop.
---
Arn't all the Fallout games consider simulations though?
---
This is a terrible suggestion. When you can be 2-3 shotted by a pipe wileding enemy or just plain one-shotted by an explosive legendary, it's already high risk.
---
The last image is it valt 94 or different? Looks like 
---
Working with a team or buddy DEFINITELY makes this process easier.  
---
Now I think we just need a  universal  restock time, so I don't  need to wait  for the hour I sold  stuff to  vendors on the next  real-life day,  so  that  they  can  finally  restock their  caps.
---
Even better, if players could choose a faction for that character commendations could both go towards a faction ranking (instead of just an individual ranking) as well as get you faction aligned rewards like enclave paint or BOS flag plans.
---
It might even change up the atmosphere in Survival mode, maybe instasupermurdering everyone that spawns at The White Springs with a rocket turret base next to the train station might not be the best idea if you are costing yourself the chance to trade in murder tokens for that sweet cutthroat graffiti logo decal for your base.
---
Ok thanks 
---
April 9th
---
I love survival mode and all I've lost and gained with it!!!!
---
You aren't Bethesda so I wasn't looking to you for an explanation to begin with. I was simply letting someone know that even if you don't engage in PVP, you can still be killed without provoking the other person or retaliating. If you read back in the thread, I clearly said my friend and I were being killed with one hit by someone else - the other player also had a friend with them who was not doing damage to us. I'm not offended, I'm just sick of people circle jerking Bethesda and chalking it up to 'well slap damage is 0, you must be in the wrong somehow!' instead of recognizing that there are issues that could potentially be investigated and/or resolved. 
---
Based on the screenshot, and mentioning the sheepsquatch and stuff, I would guess it's going to be on the 9th, but I could be wrong.
---
That's covered in the other post.
---
I ZERO percent of the time want to VATS the grenade I just through.
---
Wasn't aware there was one
---
Ahh the suitcase one is my curse! It seems like I get that, or nothing, about 70% of the time. Feels like the game is trolling me at times.
---
I have never had any issues with this. I never even had to go off the same street as the parlor. I went out the door and sat on the other side of the road where the ghouls spawn. I crouched so it showed hidden, and boom, shot the ghoul.....mission over.
---
I hope your problems solves them self, and that life puts you in a better mood.
---
In the meanwhile, you can lick what is under my shoes.
---
To me, it's partially going to depend on Legendary drops.  At least, that's how it was for me.  I started off two-handed, but the first god-tier Legendary I got was one-handed, so I floated in that direction.  And it just kind of flowed from there, into Unarmed as well.
---
I just went where the game took me.  Obviously, if you're going to go to the aftermarket and by Legendaries, you get to pick-and-choose exactly what you want. üòÇ
---
When it comes to the damage perk cards (Gladiator, Slugger, etc), don't bother ranking them all up.  It costs 9 SPECIAL points for a 60% boost, versus 3 SPECIAL points for a 30% boost.  You don't really need 60% in PvE, and it's an option you can always take in the long run, but you should also consider perks like Martial Artist which reduce melee weapon weight and increase swing speed.  A Super Sledge with Martial Artist 3 and the +40% Swing Speed effect is a truly comical sight to behold.
---
What's your username could always use more friends in the wasteland
---
Also don't go to a area that you're underleveled for 
---
What do they mean that they are going to pool the caps? Does it mean that I can just trade with one vendor to get all the caps from the others? Someone please explain I don't seem to understand it :(
---
Yes, and I've seen them in action. They aren't close to 1 hit K.O, and they give away your position. Sentinel must be countered by something that cannot be detected.
---
I tried to type this before but lost it, so I'll try again:
---
I have two suggestions, what do you think?
---
First: A true deathmatch PVP style game.
---
\- Remove all legendary effects from armour and weapons.
---
\- Only the top three scoring players on a server are shown on the map
---
\- Each spawn point at a train station or around the vault has a safe zone, can't be harmed in that area. Makes a safe area for players to meet, re-equip, trade etc. without constant attacks and lets players spawn without being instantly killed.
---
\- either you drop whatever you are carrying or drop what is equipped...you need to be a bit more careful about what weapons you carry or make sure you have a backup in the stash.
---
\- everyone starts from scratch, new characters only, doesn't completely even the playing field, but it's a start.
---
\- you receive xp and caps equal the the level of the character you killed, and half if they are less than half your level, or less than level 50 when you are higher than 50 (this just helps to push players to go after other players of closer level and leave the lower level players until they have a chance to level up a little through questing or PVP).
---
Second: A more RP based faction environment.
---
\- Allow players to create factions (similar to guilds etc. from other games)
---
\- While the faction can be any size, no more than 1/3 of a server can be players from a single faction
---
\- Players would have a mark or identifier on them as to what faction they belong to that's only visible within a certain distance...ie. once you get within 50 of a player their name and faction tag appear...outside of that distance there's nothing...this would help create tension when players encounter each other in the wilderness.
---
\- Allow shared bases...faction players can share their build sites to allow faction 'forts' to be built. This would allow for a safe base, but also allow other factions to plan raids. Scouts watch for a faction to mostly be out questing then call in the team to attack the base.
---
\- To allow for player raiding, have a 'faction stash box' that contains materials and caps gathered from players on that server in that session, when players log out they get a share of the pool (some formula of time on the server, material gathered etc. etc. to prevent abuse). When another team destroys or 'captures' that stash box, they receive half of whatever is in it to put in their box.
---
This would allow some RP aspects, but can also allow solo players to exist as they might be able to sell materials or items since they don't have a big base or faction to defend...maybe they can quest more...they can spy or give info on other factions they've seen in the server. It would be up to factions to decide how they act...are they just raiders that kill everyone (a reputation that might get around), or do they help others, or do they gladly allow others to be but want to be left alone? Maybe some players/factions develop as mercenaries working for who pays them. It allows a long list of options but allows for a more dangerous world that isn't quite as deathmatch as the straight PVP world.
---
So three gameplay options...Adventure, Faction, Survivor. Everyone gets what they want and it allows new players to come into a fairly big world.
---
No it's just so far outside what a fallout games should be it's a ridiculous arcade style free-for-all mess.
---
To counter spawn camping I've moved my camp  out of th he way near a spawn point but I'm far enough to be safe but close enough to get back into things 
---
Side note, I'm tired of being attacked instantly upon every log in and almost every fast travel before the world around me has even loaded in by enemies who would rather attack my fence than me. Stop it. The whole camp attack mechanic is annoying. 
---
I am ;(
---
yea but don't you think thats perpetuating a problem or is just what it is
---
Instead of 200 caps from the "Whitespring" Vendors, and 200 more from the Responders, and 200 more from Watoga, and so on. ANY vendor you go to will have 1400 caps, and the total will be shared between them.
---
So you could still get 200 caps from each faction, OR you could just sell 1400 caps worth of stuff to one guy.
---
Then new paints are elusive AF 
---
I just assumed people were farming the heck out of them for BoS paints.  I haven't seen one since this became a widely known thing.
---
Neat
---
&gt;Additionally, we‚Äôre combining the Cap totals from all seven vendor factions into total pool of 1,400 caps.
---
Basically all the vendors now draw out of one total cap pool. Not 1400 per vendor, 1400 across all vendors.  
---
Would photo mode work?
---
thar's sad. if i may ask one last thing, what would change a sniper build to? we're not gonna be able to deal with the queen by ourselves without some changes to the build
---
I agree, but the issue is that there are builds centered around the use of vats/crits and making them just not work in PvP would make those builds useless, we also have to lvl up in order change SPECIAL stats around(should cost caps instead) so it's not like they can just use their vats/crit build for Adventure mode and just quickswap to another one for Survival.
---
They could change some things like for example making it so that all weapons get X% increased damage from a primary stat, so shotguns/heavy weapons would benefit from strength, rifles from perception, pistols from agility then rework the base damage of those weapons to account for the increased % damage from special points. Use the old crit chance/weapon crit multiplier system from Fallout 3/New Vegas and rework the perk cards related to Critical Meter.
---
Basically taking out the Critical hit mechanic from VATS and giving it back to weapon crit multiplier+luck like it worked in Fallout 3/New Vegas so they can take VATS away from Survival without screwing those builds up. 
---
Everybody's dead because it was easier that way for Bethesda. 
---
Not really. I mean the death penalty aint that harsh even if you dont attack on sight and die. I always let others do the first damage and then I'll see what I am going to do. Makes situations more interesting and their death more harsh, because they chose to attack, not me.
---
1 - just because.
---
2 - this topic is about a gift option that does not require social interaction.
---
Before any sociopath jumps to whatever logic he is able to expand, some of us have no social life and some simply have too much of it, through their work, and simply just don't want more in a game unless for a friend.
---
I believe the reset is always ~20 hours after selling to them on a given day. So if you start selling stuff today at 10PM, tomorrow at 6PM they'll have full caps again.
---
I'm not sure, but that is how I perceived it. I wonder if Phoenix and the Harper's Ferry vendor will still remain in their locations. Any clarification u/ladydevann 
---
But this isn't a traditional single player game, this is def different and I think alot of ppl need to return to adventure mode tbh.  Fallout games dont have to fallow any pattern or trend. How do things evolve otherwise??
---
This is oddly specific and I completely agree with you
---
Each level past 50 you can choose to reallocate a SPECIAL point instead of getting a new PERK card.
---
My idea has been that each time you start you come out of the vault with no gear and have a 20 minute grace period to find gear before you‚Äôre opened to PVP
---
I disagree because there is no number of caps that you should have for your level. There are types of players who just keep spending and never have any wealth. No rule against that. Kill em and take their junk and aid. Doesn't matter if they don't have caps. 
---
I'm definitely not a math guy, I like the idea especially after getting killed instantly with a combat rifle 10x over. I feel like it should scale to each weapon hit. Like said combat rifle maxs at a cap that's different then a fat man. A flat cap would make a lot of weapons more useless then they are now.
---
"So in your opinion people pointing out a problem or wanting to see the game improve is whining?"
---
But being real though the stash is fine right now as is all you got to do is get rid of legendary weapons you don't need, sell some of the aid you never use, scrap all your scrap (its easy to store stuff that isn't scrapped), and sell the armor you never use. This is just my opinion though.
---
They are just normal legendaries right? They don't have a unique look do they?
---
Ofc it aint. If you didn't bother sleeping, grouping up and doing "feed the people" everytime it was up just for the exp boost, this 20% is nothing.
---
It was bound to happen. That's what I plan to do for Action Hero week. I want that gun. I don't want to lose any resources. So why not. 
---
That's exactly what I pointed out in my feedback thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b66p7z/survival\_beta\_observations\_and\_constructive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b66p7z/survival_beta_observations_and_constructive/)
---
I mean...I entered that mode at level 220 with high end weapons because otherwise I would insta die. And I insta die anyway. It‚Äôs a circular thing. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll die. If you‚Äôll die, after some time you adapt and kos yourself. (Unfortunately)
---
You dont have to wait for the exact hour, it's a 20 hour timer
---
Also; Press ‚Äòdrink‚Äô once on a water pump or sink faucet and then you can spam press ‚Äòcollect‚Äô just like at a river.
---
Integrated vendor cap pools will save so much time.  
---
The ammo is absurd to craft 
---
There's nothing I hate more than mole rats, seeing one instantly ruins my day. Doubly so if they're munching on everything in my camp with that obnoxious chewing sound they make.
---
Forget the scorchbeasts, mole rats deserve our nukes 100%
---
Glad you're happy about those changes! One note, now that the cap pool is being combined, that means it's 1,400 shared across all vendor factions, rather than 200 shared by each individual factions.
---
Not on that character. At that point 5% is kinda a drop in the bucket for how casually I farm.
---
Ah heavy gun builds are fun but you'll chew thru ur ammo alot more so I suggest you find a lead deposit to build your camp next to
---
Not true, watoga and whitesprings are hotspots tho so those spawns aren't safe.. but all others are for me so far
---
I was joyed to get a BoS Knight paint plan this morning. Pretty cool to have since I never gotten anything else useful so far. Too bad my X-01 is my go-to PA since it has the jet pack and calibrated shocks mods. My T-60 only has the calibrated shocks.
---
I wonder how the factions will be implemented at whitesprings, like their own little areas?
---
The question I've got. Will my turrets now be able to shoot the scorched who snipe my base while they a fair distance away.
---
Damn, maybe when mods come out. Thanks!
---
Lol cry much
---
Please for the love of Atom is the a fix for anti armor effects and energy weapons?
---
I will be able to name my stuff. Nothing else is necessary in Patch 8.
---
Making both ALL vendors share caps pools and also putting all of them in the one location makes things a bit too convenient. Surely just allowing all vendors to share a caps pool is enough? Part of the fun of the game is finding all the vendor locations if you want to buy different factions wares. Centralising them kind of feels like making 1 giant portal room in World of Warcraft...
---
But it's nothing like any survival fallout.
---
 I want adventure mode but with open non restricted PVP. Its as simple as that.
---
 I say its arcade like because when somebody dies I get this weird arcade type ding on my screen with a name that pops up.
---
 The leader board is also very arcade like.
---
 Leveling up your characters on easy mode then having to switch over to survival is not survival nor hardcore, it's less than soft core.
---
 They built a spawn campers wet dream which is basically all it is right now. Nobody wants a fair fight they want to camp spawn spots.
---
Most of you people saying we should go back to adventure mode wouldn't be able to handle leveling up in a real survival mode world. 
---
 Everybody cries and wants their God mode characters on a survival server, it's a freaking joke.
---
I found a Mutant's 40% more power attack fire axe the other day. I already have two insanely good fire axes, but if I didn't I think that's an excellent roll. Gave it to a friend in need. She's loving it!
---
You get an insult from him. That's pretty special!
---
OMG YES
---
üíØ üíØ üíØ 
---
It's possible to make a build for it. But flamed fuel isn't found often and crafting it is a pain.
---
no unique look, ill update the OP
---
I dunno
---
I'm getting 412xp at level 230 for 1 Data now with no modifiers running in Adventure.  So not sure what the formula is.  Because if it was the 20% increase it would be 420.
---
And in regards to the RNG on the paints.  I got Knight, Knight Cpt, Knight Sgt, Officer (in that order) in 2 days.  And haven't had a sniff of Paladin or Elder since.  I turned in 20 TD the other day... :/
---
Yeah accidentally started the mission on my new character, have like 80 TD in my stash can I take a few out at a time or is it all or nothing now?
---
I disagree, because fuck that Radroach in particular. 
---
I find it can be fun to both play alone and play with some one else the community is great and as bad as it was at the start I think people give it too much shit Bethesda is putting a lot into it to make it what they promised
---
The Lying Lowe/sheepsquatch stuff sounds friggin sweet.
---
 Love that all the vendors are in one spot too, it was such a chore fast traveling all around the map just to get caps.
---
And damn am I happy about renaming weapons! They really thought that through too, cause I was worried I would have no clue what I was getting in trades. I can't wait for this patch
---
I dont have caps for fast travel, because i am level 200 so i kill you 5times you kill me once and i have zero caps. 
---
It‚Äôs also great if you buy an expensive item. More than 200 caps can go back into the pool. 
---
Never got the plans, just mods from harper's ferry. It's where i get all of my 50cal receivers. 
---
Sadly they're pretty damn rare
---
God damn. This man could tell you how to take over the world with a toothpick and a napkin
---
Great post! I love the lore aspect.
---
quick question: with the new patch, are the renamed items able to be locked so we dont accidentally scrap or sell them yet?
---
Yup it can definitely be a great time for those that are not being spawn-camped or killed repeatedly at low levels. ;)
---
You can do something with those? Lol. I have a crap load of them in my stash.
---
Yea, those all weapons are inferior to top weapons on market. Even the TSE, that was heavily nerfed beats them all....wait, even the single TS beats most of those weapons and TS isnt something that hard to get hands on. One player told that he is going to get those weapons, because of unique name, I don't see point in that. And yes, skins would been better, at least then you could show that you took part in this event and it wouldn't be that useless.
---
But that cant be the solution. "Oh if you want to actually have fun with pvp please go through the boring process of leveling a normal character in adventure first by camping whitesprings...
---
I always thought that was a really cool little things feature in GTA V
---
In a real situation you would be dead and not really caring about what happened to all of your stuff.
---
/u/Ladydevann is it known Workshop PVP flaw that workshop owners outside of workshop are attackable by team who start workshop claiming process?
---
Team of two players, on goes to location of workshop owner,
---
second stays at workshop and starts workshop claim.
---
Workshop owner is immediately PVP flagged for that team regardless if he is in workshop or not, and team player can immediately kill unsuspecting workshop owner and his team, practically no one sees workshop claim message when they are busy (with Fasnacht event for example).
---
Logical process would be that workshop owner is only PVP engaged while near Workshop that is being claimed and now anywhere on the map.
---
I placed my camp close to WS train station. It succeeded, but you can be killed easily there as well. If they find your camp, they will spawn camp it and keep a teammate at the train station. 
---
That happened to me more than the chain train station death. Minimum of 3 deaths until I realize that there's no shot, and I'm about 1000 caps in the hole.
---
You can't pick and choose battles effectively enough to eliminate an untimely death; players will seek and find you if you live too long and will trap you. 
---
Sure you can leave servers, but you've died by then, and losing 360 caps each time I log on is ludicrous if I know they could tweak the combat and avoid this situation altogether. 
---
In the desks.
---
There are a handful of extra registers around they could populate, or like, make each room a different vendor or something.
---
I doubt it'll be like a whole new area for them.
---
Nope, had to do them one at a time.
---
No, I‚Äôm level 119. 
---
You needed to have ran those 5 Technical Data over one at a time to maximize your rewards.  The quest only recognizes if you turn in 1, or 2+.  And turning in 2+ only slightly increases the xp and caps.  So while more expensive to fast-travel 5 times, you'll get a lot more rewards, including some of the more rare ones as the quest starts giving those out with the more turn-ins per session you have.
---
You filthy Argonian. 
---
Never to late to join the party. The story is told through haplotypes, notes and terminals. If you check those out there are some good stories lines.
---
And that is false and fake news so im letting them know also.  Submit a bug report or provide proof at least.
---
Haha, I feel sorry for the poor sap who hits the vendor after me. If I can now sell 1400c worth of union caps at 13 each to one vendor, someone will have to scroll through 100+ "union caps" to get to the bottom of the apparel list.
---
Yessssss item naming and all the vendors together is great! Not to mention I get to go squatchin‚Äô?! Hello yeah!
---
How many have you built? Not sure if you already know but more purifiers do not generate water faster, they give you more storage, filling each purifier in turn until all have 5. 
---
So if IWP make 1 water a minute it will take 15 min to fill 3 or 20 min to fill 4, the 1 a min is shared across all of those purifiers. It often makes it seem as if they fill slower when you have more built.
---
that's what i was converting my own melee guy in order to fight the queen :( might as well do two then
---
or maybe just maybe let them go in negative caps 
---
i want to see them try to buy something with -3000 caps 
---
I just checked mine. 5 total.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
Don't you mean Techncial Data?
---
Time to relocate, if ppl camp spawn you then your fucked.  I'm off in the woods kind ra hard to get to unless your lookin for me
---
Yes to both of those! No more placing all my PA to find my xo1! also...squatchin sounds fun!!!!
---
But is the Lying Lowe quest REPEATABLE or just a one and done thing?
---
This is going to be really nice for recovering more of your investment on expensive items. I don't want all my caps to vanish into the ether after buying a weapon plan when I've got a hundred grenades to trade.
---
Renaming items, awesome! Finally we can differentiate which power armor we get out! 
---
All of this is amazing. Item naming, grouped vendors, and squatchin‚Äô. 
---
Full screen unless I‚Äôm role playing 
---
That would fit the "high risk, highest reward scenario". Afraid to loose your uber-cannon? Then don't bring it along. Grab some junk and go for it!
---
PvPing for caps and xp has does not appeal to me.
---
I didn't even think of that!  This will make buying things a little more lenient. 
---
It wont fix the problem, the way damage is applied in PvP needs to differ from PvE, the special effects on weapons are great and gimmicky in PvE, but completely put PvP out of whack.  
---
The only longterm solution is for Bethesda to give each weapon separate PvP and PvE stats, as to balance it out so it becomes an engaging affair.  
---
What we have right now is rapid killfests unless your character is built specifically for PvP in one of a handful of options that are workable to survive more than a couple of seconds. The way guns tear through "walking tank" PA is hilariously bad too.
---
I ran into him but no insult. That might have been a insult?
---
The big question - when you rename an item, will it be sold/dropped like other items or will there be an extra prompt so you don't accidentally drop or sell?
---
They don't mention that, but my idea is to name all of them with either a pair of brackets or a - or something for every item I don't want to remove, and then I can have them all right next to each other in my inventory.
---
That way I can at least spam delete or whatever for everything else and they're out of the way.
---
Nope it's fine, 1 person can kill you fast so 3 should be very fast!!
---
Exactly... I used to play a lot of Arma 2 Epoch, and it's not fun at all when you literally lose everything. In fallout people would riot if they could lose weapons/armor pieces...
---
Here we just lose caps and some easily replaceable chems. Not hard at all to farm bloodpacks for stimpacks and doing a couple of loops in whitesprings will surely give plenty of rad-x/radaway.
---
In real life I've been to Afghanistan and Iraq and most other players have not.  Why does real life matter in any game?  Since when was fallout s reality simulator?  Go to ranger school
---
My all white ones do that as well. 
---
And it helps with regular selling, too. Usually, I have to switch to a cheaper, filler item to sell when the vendor has a few caps left. 
---
Full screen
---
That's a good idea! I was thinking if I couldn't do an actual pulpit, I'd use one of the smaller dining tables and scatter candles over it
---
Yeah that was one of the most frustrating things for me when buying expensive items, so many caps that would be lost because of the 200 cap.
---
What i do is target the fusion cores in VATS, then leave VATS. Then you quickly go into VATS and shoot immediately since when you first enter VATS you have a 95% chance for less than a second, and the fusion cores are already targeted so they explode immediately snd drop a fusion core, ammo, etc
---
We already have something. The better question is how does the current cap work?
---
Not excited to hear that the spawn "invincibility" isn't working. 
---
I don't mind the camping as much as players bringing over their uber geared Adventure characters. Whatever you earn in Survival, you use to survive. 
---
I hope so! Part of the fun is in building things for other people to find
---
I tend to agree. However, sometimes if I'm in Flatwoods and some level 5 is following me around I'll normally drop him a bag of something.  
---
ITEM RENAMING. :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Ah so nothing special? I was going to grind legends today. I'm sure someone on the market might buy it.
---
Happy cake day
---
The last image is a vault 94 dweller in Sunnytop Ski Lanes! There's two of them in this location.
---
Well, the Underworld that I'm referring to is a [settlement in the Capital wasteland.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Underworld) It's possible, though.

---
Bet you the do something to change the crafting cost of top hats with all the vendors grouped up now. 
---
I am really not trying to sound like a dick, promise, but if you are getting wrecked in the game, then likely the healing gun won't help a ton.  There are very few things in the game (save pvp) that are challenging to a proper build (really any build as long as it's got a good direction and synergy).  To use a healing gun effectively you are going to have to be crit spec PLUS what ever spec the gun is.  Basically you want to be able to crit every 3 or 4 shots, optimal builds will crit every 2 shots.  If you can't hit that crit ratio, then the healing effect is not going to be anything more than a gimmick for you.  And if you can hit that crit ratio, then staying healed shouldn't be a problem (things should be dying before they can hurt you).
---
There are lots of folks out there that would love to help you with you and your partners builds.  I love theory crafting stuff, but if that's not your thing, enjoy at your own pace and have fun!
---
Thanks a lot. It's definitely one of my favorite bits of lore so far. I'm very interested in finding out if they expand on it when 94 opens. 
---
Default unless I'm an invisible chameleon
---
Would a Filthy Argonian be preferable to a Lusty Argonian? Asking for a friend? :)
---
Go get a job with Bethesda and make it happen.
---
Good advice, it gets annoying having to go through all of my Civil War Era Top Hats to see my gear.
---
thank goodness...makes less maintenance to get my daily allowance and more time i can spend exploring/killing/building stuff :D
---
I'd  rather it be a set  time  like  8PM EST,  or whenever daily challenges reset.  So, if  you sell something  at  like 7:59PM as an example, and the reset time is 8PM,  in  a minute that vendor will have full stock of caps again.    Would feel  more  consistent that way to  me.
---
Would you care to elaborate?
---
Do you have a problem with me voicing an honest opinion about the disparity between the rewards on different game modes? Do you have a counterpoint? Did you disagree with what I posted? Or are you just being a dick for the sake of it?
---
For role playing reasons? Or do you just like it?
---
Crafting cost of top hats? Explain 
---
Do we really need working toilets? I'd just go in the bush. Although the risks of mole rats popping out to eat my junk is always a risk. 
---
Any toilet is fine,  a bucket even. If you live with a large family and only one bathroom you learn to improvise and so would in a survival situation. 
---
Thank you! I had heard discussion on that, but didn't have details on how plans dropped. I know what I'll be doing now - I've got piles of treasure maps, but never thought much of them.
---
Default pip boy? It's easier on my eyes
---
I just don't complete them anymore.  Was fun for like 2 days.
---
I don‚Äôt carry them on me, they are clogging up room in my stash atm. The only thing I carry more than 10 of at any given time are stimpacks... I get low and then all of a sudden I have 80 again somehow. I just can‚Äôt leave them on the ground when I see them. I use a gauss so I have batteries included 2 (helps with my fusion cores as well). For ammo I try to stay around 400 5.56 at any given time and 300 or so 2mm, although with batteries I can get away with carrying quite a bit more if I choose to. Sometimes i craft a bunch of that to use up lead and steel. 
---
True, but I 100% of the time want to shoot the grenade the enemy just threw before it reaches me.
---
Ya.  It‚Äôs a low chance to get the paint.  But they are always received in order.
---
I got up to Officer very quickly.  Within a few days of tech data hunting.  But then it took a dozen plus tries to get Paladin and I have done about 25 more and not received Elder yet. 
---
The civil war top hat plan everyone is using to make caps. They cost 1 cloth to make and vendor for almost 40 caps. 
---
How it can't be? Take world of warcraft-"Ohh, you want to do this high level raid, go play these boring normal dungeons first", "Want to play arena? Go play first battleground and earn honor gear" (think this they removed and now everyone mad about it), League of Legends:"Want to play ranked? go first play 30 levels of normal", ESO:"Want to actually survive in PVP, either stay in PVP and die or go PVE earn money and buy yourself gear". This isn't competitive arena, where players should matched based on MMR...this is no mans land.
---
Yeah, that is my problem, I can one-shot most mobs and anything that takes a second hit Executioner's would not help me.
---
This is false
---
&gt;  I was longest alive on their server so everyone knew where I was  
---
I don't think I'm going to play this mode until they get rid of this. It's absolutely ridiculous. No one should be able to deduce your location on the map. Not ever. For any reason.
---
I can see that place being turned into a slaughter house in survival if they do not make the area a safe zone. 
---
the CAMP would work better with an entirely different camera system.
---
Great, now I need this plan ASAP!
---
Will renaming stuff give us - or come along with - a way to make items without Atom Shop skins unsellable/unscrappable? Because that'd be awesome. (I'm terrified of accidentally selling/scrapping my Fire Breather outfit and Prototype Hazmat since they can't be replaced...)
---
These are all really good additions.  Naming items is something we've wanted for a long time, and it's going to help a lot with the whole "Power Armor Chassis" confusion.  Having each vendor represented at Whitesprings will offer a lot more flexibility in where I place my CAMP, because now being centrally located isn't an objective advantage.  If I want to be clear up in Grafton, all I need to do is travel to Whitesprings.
---
I only have a couple suggestions.
---
1. I think you should look into having the vendor caps timer happen a bit more frequently, even if the number of overall caps doesn't change.  What I would suggest is having 700 caps (100 for each vendor) replenish every 10 hours instead of 1,400 every 20 hours.  The reason is because the current timer presents an oddity if you play the game in the evening and then login the following day.  The caps won't have replenished.  On the weekend especially, I always have to be mindful of not exhausting their cap supply too early or too late.
---
2. One of the things about the Nuka-Shine quest is that the "mystery" was sort of undermined by other players.  As fun as it is to look at clues and try to figure out what I'm supposed to do, when you see a bunch of players swarming around one location, it kind of gives it away.  I don't know how Sheepsquatch will work, but it would be cool if there was a bit of randomness to the locations involved (or, let this be a consideration for any future quests that rely on a mystery element).
---
It's just hard to read number thought maybe said 81 or something else.
---
I agree with pretty much everything you said. Build will work with said gun but probably not enough. 
---
I just wish the game was a little more flexible. Choosing between combat and other passive perks is a drag and I wish they had separate slots for non combat stuff tbh.  Being funnelled into certain playstyles is tiresome but so is not being able to kill a basic scorch beast. 
---
Thanks for the pep talk. 
---
I'd prefer a Lusty Argonian, I'm terribly allergic to Khajit
---
I don‚Äôt think any pre-existing vendors are being moved, just that additional vacation vendors are being added.
---
Wow that's awesome indeed
---
Lol you're letting them know that I'm reporting "false and fake news" without any proof of your own? Cool. I already submitted a bug report at the time of incident. "Lol bye".
---
Sounds cool, but pretty sure this will not be implemented. 
---
Ah I understand. I'll try get a clearer photo later :)
---
Yes, deadlier turrets yessssssss, thank you.
---
Well there‚Äôs a reason it‚Äôs selling for a couple thousand caps lol. 
---
Very nice. I actually like that
---
Honestly an addition to the base shop would be nice too. I personally dont think that every new item should be introduced through the atom shop.
---
It actually makes us more money too, because less is spent on travelling!
---
Interested in a response to this but I submitted a ticket last night, Ladydevann can PM me for a support number if needed. I sent a follow-up email detailing what happened on the off chance someone actually cares to investigate.
---
Also a great place to kill others in survival if it is not a safe zone
---
Or after completing a ‚Äòturn in‚Äô go back to your stash, take out one or two more technical data, quit the game completely, log back in and the quest should activate again
---
Gaaarrrryyyyy!
---
You know there are people that play pretty much all day right? By Farming SBQs (Also easy with proper CAMP placement, expecially if you have a team) and that sweet 30% XP bonus certain people would certainly get there in only a week. 
---
  I sometimes get a little too happy with the back button on my PS4, especially when I'm trying decide if I want to swap weapons.  
---
Last time I did it, I accidentally dropped my executioners combat rifle.  
---
Fortunately, I realized it immediately and retrieved it from the bag (before other players around me spotted the bag)
---
Perhaps thats what happened with your sledge?
---
Ok I‚Äôll give that a shot, thanks!
---
Oh ur good just thought maybe u stumbled accross a new Vault number in the 76 wastes.
---
That seems to be the issuing with the enter game, with the exception of Whitesprings. (Pre-Nerf)
---
Ah haha ha, Garyyyy!
---
I thought the grouped vendors was great also.  Although curious how it will effect Whitesprings if it is nuked and people show up just to cap trade and not join the battle. 
---
Do these posters replace the party posters? How will new users begin the party posters if they're replaced? Or are the train station posters the only ones to be replaced?
---
Don't mind the downvotes, non-PvPers cry about PvP a lot unfortunately. 
---
You're taking steps to improve your game, which is admirable. 
---
Most exited about the Sheepsquatch coming, but not sure if it's the full thing or is it just an introductory quest til April? If so I'd rather get in the full thing in one hit, rather than complete half a storyline then just, stop, doing it. Not sure on the context though so maybe there's a plausable reason for this.
---
The vendor changes will make the selling run so much less of a chore as well, and since the Whitesprings vendors and train station were made to share cap pools I've found myself going in there a lot less which is a shame as it's one my favourite locations - when I first discovered what it was like inside I knew it was special.
---
All in all very good and interesting patch, thanks Bethesda. 
---
Problem with that is what we got similar now- if you don't want to lose anything don't have caps. People create alt level it to 50 with no problem, transfer gear from PVE character to PVP and still play care free. Just in PVP character they don't bother getting caps.
---
I've noticed mine filling slower since the patch, but they do go up to five. 
---
oh absolutely....also when i spend more than 1k caps on something, i'll be able to recoup more of them back afterwards :)
---
Are you expecting not to do against three players? What is your expectation here? Two shots seems reasonable to me if they are specced for pvp and you are in power armor. Power armor is junk for pvp. 
---
I get paid tonight, so I think I'll buy it again :) I always buy a game used from gamestop so I can try it out for a week, if I do I'll usually just return it and buy it digitally lol 
---
No. Or my game is bugged. I logged on last night. Put on all my perks and Bam. Tse handmade at 101 dmg what can I do to fix this cause apparently it's false. Not arguing legit asking for help
---
Haha, I feel the same about picking up stimpaks and radaways even I wouldn't use that much and end up putting the excess in the blue suitcase in Watoga Station. Thanks for hanging around with me for a long time, bro!
---
Worst part is, you will get on the top 3 if you stay alive for literally only 20 minutes.
---
Not to mention the hairball issue... just gross.
---
&gt;I'm level 134 and in the middle of respecing my character because I spent so much time playing a Power Armor single-shot rifle user, which isn't an effective PvP build 
---
Your build isn't the problem, but the fact that only a handful of builds seem effective.  And entire classes of other builds are useless.   
---
Seems bloodied/ stealth builds are wrecking everyone else. 
---
That' s unacceptable and I don't see how it can continue.  I expect re-balancing down the road which is why I am holding off for a least a few months before even touching survival mode. 
---
little bit of A, little bit of B....depends on what strikes your fancy that day
---
I found a post relating to this, hope it helps!
---
Apparently setting up Spotlights help out all turrets‚Äô targeting systems, I can‚Äôt confirm yet but going to give it a try.
---
Thanks for the comment!
---
I am not new to modding but it's been a long while since not using a mod manager hehe.
---
If it is not too much to ask, could you help me with the \[archive\] ? I have 7 mods I think atm, not sure what order the commands should be in the Fallout76Custom.ini.
---
[This is what it looks like now](https://justpaste.it/1vged), if you could help with this could you rearrange these to the correct order and paste the text on a website so I can copy it?
---
Where can I read up on what the different sResource do? That way I could understand and fix it in the future my self.
---
Maxson HATES it!
---
I thought it was a specific restock time? It's seemed to me like everyday at 2PM UTC it resets.
---
I am guessing it is a speed thing. I was used to getting 5 each day when I login after work, and play a couple of hours. Just havent seen it since the patch.
---
This happened when the brewing and distilling dlc went live. I think they used the nuka cola cast light on the new lamp in that guys bedroom, which I guess we‚Äôll be able to unlock somehow. It‚Äôs probably a "merging error" and just affects all cast light now. I‚Äôm just waiting for them to quietly fix it.
---
I'm a rifle build same gun.. I get 129..I'll post my perks later 
---
I have 4
---
Yep.  It's been like that since Patch 7.  Probably had to do with adding that lamp in one of the fraternity rooms.
---
hopefully it will be like the Biv questline, once you are finished there are dailies you can do to attain more recipes/plans.  Nobody likes a one-pump-chump
---
No need for me, I didn't even make it to the end of the post.
---
GLORY AND HALLELUJAH!!!!!! 
---
VENDOR FACTION UPDATES
---
It‚Äôs no secret that vendors are some of the busiest bots in Appalachia, and we‚Äôre planning to make a pair of adjustments that should make it even more convenient to make those crucial trades with various vendor factions. With our next update, we‚Äôre adding a vendor from every faction except the Enclave to the shops at the Whitespring Resort. This will help reduce the need to fast travel all around the Wasteland to visit vendors from multiple factions. Additionally, we‚Äôre combining the Cap totals from all seven vendor factions into total pool of 1,400 Caps, which should offer you more flexibility in the trades you make with specific factions.
---
You can go grab Prototype Hazmat suits in one of the nuclear dump sites.
---
Fire Breather suit I'm not sure about, but I'd be surprised if there wasn't a way to just get another one.
---
"are you sure you want to sell cockblaster9000?"
---
I also don't hear much love for the Junkie's weapons. I have been playing around with a Junkie's handmade rifle the past two days and it's great. With three addictions it does more damage than my explosive handmade (even with full demo expert). So far I've only managed three addictions. I thought it would be difficult to stay addicted to a bunch of stuff at once but it's pretty easy to maintain. It seems to add 7% damage per addiction but I wonder if it has an upper limit.
---
They do indeed, I have a camp with a bar, diner, hostel, workshop, lab etc with neons, streamers and flashing lights everywhere lol. It‚Äôs bright, it‚Äôs garish and I love it.
---
I am assuming that is precisely what is being addressed
---
hey all buy it
---
Mutations are a random thing. You have just as much of a chance of this being your Fallout 76 experience.
---

---
Also more expensive items can be sold to vendors now, like all of my super duper spare serums taking up soace in my stash. 
---
I imagine it will be like the Nukashine questline in that the story will play out once per character but may have repeatable elements once you‚Äôre done. 
---
This. This mode should be DAYZ in a Fallout skin. Real danger, real loss, real stress, real reward.
---
im not on now but ill check my alt later
---
Crafting 50 alcohol in 24 hours is crazy.
---
lol I wasn't going to even bother to go in but now I think I have to.
---
You must be super lucky or running a critical build. All the power to you.
---
Fact is that most players are have neither, but players sure do have Sentinel armor.
---
These changes were neither fair nor necessary.
---
This isn't true balance, this somebody sitting in a chair, high off their ass saying that all weapons should have the same damage and saying ‚ÄùWell, its technically balanced‚Äù
---
You might like it if you hate running or are the Falmer. Scarecrows might like it too!
---
That isn't 95 percent of people.
---
Who knows what‚Äôs going to come out of the vaults when they finally open man. Maybe we will get some new humans! I would imagine it‚Äôs not just normal people in the vaults anymore though with all the crazy ones in the fallout series. 
---
Seems silly that they managed to kill all the friendly ghouls but left so many ferals laying around, if indeed the point was to wipe them out. 
---
inside Whitespring would be a fucking sweet battleground
---
I think making the Whitesprings Hotel a safe zone is a must and we should also make it a free fast travel location to encourage more CAMP's to be spread out among the wasteland 
---
I'd add, allow me to upgrade a Legendary I like to its maximum level, for a price related to however many levels the increase is.
---
I can't remember exact locations but these are the ones I remember:
---
There is one in Camden Park out by the small train track bridge
---
One in Lewisburg
---
One in Berkly Springs
---
Think there's one in Valley Galleria
---
There's more I just don't remember where.
---
I hope player vending machines do not share their carryweight with stash boxes like the fermenting machine does.
---
Thanks for the trick but that sounds painful. I was really hoping you had a trick that let me plop my camp outside of Camp Venture and unload my stack of 30 in quick time. Not a solution that has me spending a bunch of caps and time to fast travel back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and you get the point. Hopefully this will get patched.
---
THIS!!!!!!
---
I'm a little confused. If the legs had atom shop paint on them he should not have been able to trade them at all. Painted items do not show up in inventory when the trade window is open.
---
Thanks like paying $35,000 for a car that is basically a frame and an engine and expecting the buyer to give input on upgrades they might want (like tires, or doors).
---
"Sheepsquatch"! I saw this some days ago. I got informed they were attacking my workbench!.
---
I was battling the Schorched Queen so my forehead wrinckled and when I had the time to look into the matter - The workshop had been taken over.  
---
I had never heard of the sheepsquatch, but thought I was "out of knowledge/lore" and didn't think more of it. But now I really wish I had investigated it further!  
---
Looking forward to this update - A lot!
---
Yea it‚Äôs too much
---
Agreed.  Very good update!
---
Yes pleaseeeeeeee!
---
Nice :-) I've seen people complain about the addictions going away, for some reason. I've also seen more people posting about buying junkies lately. Wondered if they'd been buffed somehow.
---
A Shaped Charge. Only found one. Cant remember where. It looks like A tin Can.
---
Hey yeah so I did a PSA on this yesterday and I put in some more time with Survival last night with a focus on hunting down legendary mobs and I've finally figured out what's going on (or at least I think I have).
---
So the short answer is that only STARRED legendaries count toward this achievement. Unstarred vanilla legendaries do NOT count toward this achievement. 
---
In addition you can't just tag the the Starred legendary and let someone else take it down. You've got to put the final bullet in it yourself for it to count.
---
Now is that fair? Is that right? Is that working as intended? I have no idea.
---
But if you want to complete the 'Kill 25 legendary enemies for a cool unique weapon' weekly survival reward you need to hunt down the much rarer 2\* and 3\* legendaries (I cannot yet confirm that 1\* legendaries count but I would suspect so.) AND you NEED to kill it yourself. Taking it down with a team or having your hard work taken advantage of by someone else will not work _unless_ you get the last shot in. (So don't expect the SBQ fight to count toward this achievement unless you're the lucky bastard who got the silver bullet.) 
---
good point!
---
Yeah but it has taken me a long time to hold a steady cap count even this low
---
Nope... Every single person alive plays exactly how you play. Weird, I know.
---
I mean an extra 28 dmg is nothing... I used to do like 265. The explosive Nerf fucked the game for me. I don't want to have to waste every single perk slot to max my dmg to even kill stuff. That's stupid. You literally need. Bloodied, unyeilding to have dmg or be melee. That's my issue. I can't even play the game. I die to super mutants  and I'm lvl 135 and have a bunch of good weapons. 
---
I will try to help low levels if I can - and I have found some of the most appreciative players I've met sounded like they were low teens or earlier.
---
They also seem to have no fear - I asked one (L29, IIRC) if by any chance he had a clown outfit - he said hang on - he FT to (wherever) fought a wendigo, came back, then sold it to me for all of 10 caps.  
---
After some 200 hours in, there has been one case where I was addressed very impolitely over area chat.  
---
Occasionally, I hear other player use some 4 letters when fighting a particularly tough critter.  
---
99% of the time, though, most are muted or in team chat, so no issues with hearing too much.
---
Not most people, but some people.
---
We need to stop pretending that reddit is the majority of the player base as well as the voice of the player base.
---
Massive, massive difference. My wife and I play side-by-side, me on a first-gen xbone and she on the xbonex. Not only is her picture quality obscenely better than mine, she has fewer lag spikes, disconnects, and faster load times. They both have hard connections to the same gig switch; the only difference is the console version. 
---
I could move it, but then I couldn't have my 10 turrets dropping people for the juicy stimpaks.
---
Big bend tunnel at lower levels. Scorch are easy to kill. You get a lot of ammo. You can sell all the items at the train stations at either end. Best for quick caps.
---
The Whitespring at higher levels allows farming chems, good junk, and legendaries and you can sell. Best for junk and chem farming.
---
Watoga at higher levels. You can avoid assaultrons and kill the easier mobs. It is a good place to farm so more specific tech junk, lead, aluminum, and other scrap. 
---
Hmm...... i play only PVE and i sit between 10-20 % health all the time. My Bloodied gatling gun does 490 dmg each hit. With fireproof, lone wanderer, emergency protocol torsoed T51b PA i pretty much only take significant damage from assaultrons and colonel gutsies? (the version that does balistic damage). I never die and with the healing mutation i rarely use stimpacks.  You can both stack damage and be invincible....This build its cheap to boot, you just need PA and trade for a 1 star bloodied weapon of your chooice. Bloodied gatling kills level 68 level mutant warlord in almost one hit. TSE gatling takes 3, possible cause of no armor pen with explosions?
---
I hope this is the plan for Nuclear Winter, along with other far more hardcore survival changes.
---
Oh, well that's a bit shit
---
Did not know that. Thanks for the info.
---
Appreciate the reply. Probably go with the X
---
When you get something tho, it'll feel special. If it were too easy, the next month would be like "why are these even in the game?"
---
Join a team. Just spam some invites to people on the map. Someone will join. Then if you are booted, you can easily rejoin the same server. 
---
I believe it showing up in the messages right now is a bug, or teaser for what's to come. I've seen a few posts about the workshop being under attack by them, but then it's actually something else attacking.
---
12 mins.......... when the mode first started.
---
He was legendary? The insult bot will follow you around and watch you play and will come up with an insult tailored to you. 
---
Can we get about another 5 million upvotes on this one?
---
Eastern regional penitentiary, then whitesprings golf course. 
---
Use a melee weapon to conserve ammo 
---
We need a hardcore mode. Where enemies are just as hard in the Forest as they are in the Cran.
---
Not to be a dick, launch players have been gettin gear since day one, the new mode is supposed to be harder and more rewarding so why should pvp players get some new stuff?? Are pve players entitled to anything or are you owed anything?? Ppl complained that the first new content was pvp related and it didnt even happen in that order. Jus let the new mode have its day in the sun and be what it is supposed to be.. MORE REWARDING.. and with all the future content planned how can anyone complain on pvp or pve side that cool shit ain't comin?? 
---
Will we ever get new trophies? 
---
yeah i was thinking the same thing, a name to group them all at the top of the list for easier access
---
Is this the April 9 Wild Appalachia update or just a regular weekly patch? I do not see player vending included.
---
Have you read today‚Äôs inside the vault? There‚Äôs a new quest coming that involves mystery and tragedy next month. Personally I can‚Äôt wait to get my teeth into it
---
Full screen, because it loads faster ^^ 
---
The additions of vendorbots and the ability to rename weapons and armor are wonderful, and of course I am very excited to see what mysteries await us on the new questline! Appalachia‚Äôs cryptids have always been an interesting part of Fallout76 and I‚Äôm looking forward to discovering more!
---
Ok. I should try it. Sometines i get headaches and maybe the default greenish would help 
---
&gt;Additionally, we‚Äôre combining the Cap totals from all seven vendor factions into total pool of 1,400 Caps...
---
Welp, guess I better get all my excess junk bulked and ready to sell...
---
KABOOOSHHHH "rEEEEEE"
---
Ah, renaming items, not only will that help Power Armor storage but I can do the old FO4 trick of naming everything with a ! at the start so the armor and weapons I use appear above what I'm going to sell.
---
Very true, but I'd really quite like to be a velociraptor instead :)
---
this sounds like a person trying to nuke golf club and have his camp do the killing.
---
"You can rename items as many times as you like, but **your custom names will not transfer** with the item **when viewed by**, or transferred to, another player." So it‚Äôs only really useful for organisation purposes it seems. No one else will see Lucille in your inventory, just wrapped baseball bat.
---
Hopefully this could lead to maybe a cap increase for vendors to say 2K in the foreseeable future
---
they may be easy to kill.. but their main power is the psychological drain it brings to the enemy..
---
yup, killed my own brahmin last night accidently :(
---
Ya but how would they know?  Does it announce who claimed the bounty?
---
true haha, but i mainly eat their meat RAWWW cause I dont have to cook lol
---
That would be a cool skin but Fallout really needs cronenbergs.
---
Whatever.  It's a total mess.  Good for you if you like it.  I'm seriously glad they didn't ruin the rest the entire game with this nonsense.  Also keep in mind I dont care.  I was offering a suggestion not for my own benefit.  I'm just fine in adventure mode.  Just posting my opinions.  You guys are extremely sensitive on this matter i can see.  No ones taking it away from you.  Someone just doesn't like it and is voicing their opinion.  Itll be ok.
---
Is this...sarcasm?!?  How dare you?!
---
Take my upvote sir! Looking forward to finally clearing out my stash of all that Technical Data.
---
Isn't this going to push some people to RMT? 
---
Give a cap farmer a few bucks to cover your pvp for the weekend.
---
lol. Sounds very powerful. I wonder what my shotgun damage would be like.. Maybe I'll try it one day :-)
---
Not many quests are bugged. I am not sure what you are talking about there. Quests are individual. The team leaders quest shows up to other members. Completing those quests gives a little bit of xp to other members. Each party member has to complete their own quests to get credit. New quests are individual and not party. 
---
oh my god i thought that was just me! I literally have full weightless with the chest and arms ultra light build, and the legs muffled and while for all other enemies I stay in hidden or caution, mole rats seem to have wall hacks and can [ Danger ] me from half a light year away.
---
8/10 times the person at the top of the board has the most kills. Now I don't know about you but I find it more of a challenge Hunting down the guy who's been alive for 4 hours then popping his head and taking all he's scrounged together than killing some camper wihh 20 kills or some fortnite jump shot artist.
---
It's more satiafying to me, and they get very salty. Someone who's just killing doesn't. Ind getting hit back. Someone hiding and trying to survive the deathmatch get really upset when they think there good and no one cares what there doing, then blam. 
---
You realize this means you only have to visit a single vendor instead of seven?
---
I have a picture on my phone but idk how to post it here.. it was a legendary insult bot but he said he was done for the day and wouldn‚Äôt insult me so I killed him and picked up the legendary armor he dropped but it was nothing special.
---
I agree with the free travel, but maybe only after you first discover it or have a quest involved that you have to do in order to make it a free travel spot.
---
haha! 200:1 sounds a bit right, 25:1 was a bit generous
---
ahhhhhhhhhhhh ok, i have never gotten the bot to actually insult me
---
So the premise is that a vault of about 500 emptied its people into the wasteland with no weapons or supplies to speak of, but with a camp device, with the notion, not even a developed idea, of rebuilding America.  Now (in survival mode) suddenly its everyone for themselves because reasons.  If that does not sound like a VT experiment I don't know what does.  The reality being that unlike the folks from the vault most of us do not know one another or have worked for years with one another, and the rewards for successfully murdering other players has gone up and there is no established trust, except among those groups that have played together.  It will be interesting to see the impact of durable factions forming to prey upon non-members and how they will clash with other factions.  Me being primarily a solo player who is horrible in pvp, I will avoid survival mode altogether.  I tip my hat those of you who engage and thrive.
---
 Signing into survival is you agreeing to take part in pvp. Why are you even in survival mode?
---
That‚Äôs true I just felt like the exspolive shotgun was a little over powered. He didn‚Äôt even direct hit me with one of the shots and it took out a third of my health. But oh well PVP is PVP no biggie 
---
If you don't want to participate in PvP then go build in adventure mode. You shouldn't get an experience boost for minding your own business. No risk, no reward.
---
My guess is, like the different train stations, they will only have certain (maybe the less rare more basic) items and not everything.
---
This is the list that I ended up following :)
---
Yeeeeaaaahhhh, I don't consider hunting the Sheepsquach and "Sheepsquach ate my Brother" posters on the same level as Dead Money, or what happened to the Responder recruits, but I look forward to Bethesda changing my mind.
---
Thank you!!!! Here have a silver!!!
---
Curious, any chance you know how their inventories will work? For example the BoS vendor in Watoga sells a ton of power armor plans, will his Whitespring counterpart have the same inventory?
---
Was this always a max of 5? I swear a couple months ago they were 8? 
---
Maybe now when a player draws the Summersville mutants toward my camp my turrets will actually shoot the mutants instead of deciding they're too far away to bother with despite them putting holes in my stuff.
---
If they're merging the cap pool into one giant fund that's shared by all 7 vendors, there's no need to visit Whitesprings. You can just pick an out of the way location like Sunny Top or Welch instead.
---
For daily‚Äôs like this go to billings homestead, there‚Äôs razorgrain and there‚Äôs corn at the building behind where project beanstalk happens. I picked over 100 razorgrain and corn in less than 10 min and spammed the collect water button in the river across the road, then it was back to base to boil all the dirty water and then craft 50 beers as fast as the buttons will let me lol
---
Yeah, less fast travel cost, less ligering caps on vendors, its a great change!
---
Snallygasters aren't a kick in the pants away from cronenbergs! Those things just give me the creeps :)
---
I'm using Junkies weapons since launch. Addictions add 10% more damage but they cap at 5.
---
But last patch added a bug that makes addictions disappear on death, that makes Junkies unusable.
---
Quick question u/valseek, does the item renaming apply to power armor chassis as well?  Also, if I rename an item and put it in my stash will that remove the name or is the name only removed when transferring between players?
---
Not a bad idea.  Because I saw that challenge and immediately said nope.
---
It might be that each of the shopkeepers already there now counts as belonging to a different faction. Not that that would make sense, but this is pretty much a purely mechanical change for convenience anyway. 
---
Loving the vendor update, Gods be praised.
---
Potentially, but I've wondered the same about my camp.... If somebody drops a nuke nearby, is it just gone? 
---
Two of them could of had exspolive shotguns too, idk it happened so far but PVP is PVP oh well haha
---
Cool I‚Äôve never seen him legendary! Maybe he said the insult when you had other stuff going on and you missed it. 
---
Youre welcome \^\^ Last tip: Dont use Power Armor !
---
but now, everyone and their mothers will have their camp at whitsprings to make traveling there almost free.
---
The legendary vendor will allow us to trade in legendaries for tokens based upon stars which we can then use to gamble for other legendaries. 
---
Ha seriously! The distant "pew pew" then "ding ding" was always bothersome
---
If they could do new quest lines or new creatures/hard minibossses in each patch, that would be really nice 
---
Yep, don't care, still happy about it. I'd be naming them for myself anyway. Means you can rename PA frames as well, and I can name my favorites. 
---
Instead of pulling out my "Bloodied Explosive Hardened Lever Action Rifle", I'll be pulling out my "Ol' Bloody Bastard", etc..
---
I imagine they had to make it this way, otherwise the number of racial/sexual monikers would probably get out of hand.
---
&gt;  I get the leaderboard and top 3 player map pips; 
---
I don't. No one should ever be able to find you on the map by following a dot. Not ever. For any reason. As long as this exists I'm not playing in  this mode. 
---
I mean, they're not just gonna let players set astronomical prices to basically use the machines as extra stash boxes. They will certainly be tied to the stash
---
Hoping next week they talk about the player vending.  i got a megaton of Plans to toss in there for selling.
---
Thank you so much for the quick reply! Definitely doesn't seem right, hopefully they can address this soon!
---
If you add pocketed or deep pocketed mods to your armor you gain extra carry weight 
---
Or a point system based on both time and kills? 
---
I would like to see both of those either way for the top 3 and your character so everyone knows that you have been alive for 6 hours without killing anyone/killed 30 players in the 30 min you have been online.
---
Glad they dont show lvl and hope they don't in the future, gives it a bit of mystery about the top.
---
Someone said something about a balloon. Could have balloon only the person who died. But originally was just about dropped items for others
---
So you murdered a level 5? *golf clap.
---
I didnt murder anyone. Just because you are in survival does not mean you have proactively kill other players. I played like I always do just checked out what other players are doing. Some are friendly, some are not. Those that are not friendly are either killed or kill. That all depends on the gear and perks they have compared to mine. 
---
I like starting with a MAP approach...mutually assured protection unless they are just agro. 
---
Its funner to play with randos in survival
---
This argument is flawed as well, at level 50 you barely unlocked the Adrenaline perk, which provides up to a 60% damage increase, but the perk needs to be leveled up, which cannot be done until at least level 55. Other higher quality perks are the same way. 
---
Not to mention the level 200 prob has crafting perks limiting the amount of time required to farm mats and more time spent farming higher end gear. 
---
Level 200s have a huge advantage over level 50s imo. 
---
When it says adding it makes me think additional stalls somewhere. 
---
I really like this next update. So frustrating to places down a bunch of PA just to finde the one you need in the middle of a SB fight. Now make the quick perk card builds switch happen.
---
This. And let us clean debris inside buildings we claim. And cut it off with the lame placement limitations. Nobody cares if a roof needs a wall. Let the roof float if we want it to float. This is annoying and not fun.
---
Maybe! I‚Äôm gonna keep an eye out for him again üëÄ
---
I'm not going to go back and forth between modes to do different things. That's not what a game mode should be. I should be able to jump in to unrestricted PVP in survival for a bit, then head off to my C.A.M.P to manage my inventory or repair stuff. I shouldn't be made a target for spending time doing that.
---
You're comparing a video game to a car? Games must be real serious stuff for you.
---
The addictions do inexplicably go away after you leave a server but if you take those chems or drink alcohol right away when you log back on you immediately get notice that you're addicted again. Also, it seems like you don't need to be in actual withdrawl like the description says but just have an addiction (even if it's currently sated) to get the bonus.
---
Rad storm
---
Arguably people inclined to do RMT are already doing it for gear.  So I don't believe it adds an additional problem.  People buy entire accounts as it is lol
---
As much as I love Biv the bartender I‚Äôm just looking forward to a proper quest rather than a repeatable fetch task lol, fingers crossed this new one has some depth
---
you can nuke anywhere. just not on map markers. just place it where your camp is outside the zone yet the club is inside. thats how people nuke the queen. just enough to spawn her, yet fight her radiation free.
---
This article has pics and stats of all 6 rewards weapons week-by-week:
---
[https://www.vgr.com/six-fallout-76-survival-mode-legendary-weapons/](https://www.vgr.com/six-fallout-76-survival-mode-legendary-weapons/)
---
The .50 cal looks like a god-roll if you're a heavy gunner IMO, but the rest are \~meh\~ to me.
---
rad storms are green, this sounds like a nuke site
---
&gt; Additionally, turret attack ranges will now match those of players‚Äô weapons.
---
Havent played in a long time, so this might be already fixed, but does this mean there wont be any more supermutants shooting my base outside ot my turrents range?
---
*** legendary sheepsquatch!!! 
---
The game need text chat, on PC at least.
---
So renaming makes it useless to hunt down those challenge legendary weapons? Sweet :D
---
Like when my friend killed me it told us on the screen that we got the caps.  Not sure what you're asking exactly sorry
---
I'm not saying it's the best way to encourage PVP. That is clearly the devs' intentions. I think a broader area would be a better idea, so more of a hunt is involved.
---
Unless it's a bloodied build PvPer.
---
Good News!
---
Thanks for copy 'n paste and not just putting the link to Bethesda's website!
---
Yes!!! I'll sometimes jump into whatever just so I don't get torched.
---
Also, maybe when we become legendary there will be improvements to that
---
Oh, so you can basically just keep drinking/ snorting / shooting to get the benefits, with no drawback? Neato! Involves some micro managing, though?
---
When repairing, do not go out for the things where the pipes are, apparently it does heat damage. 
---
Next to the increase in stash weight, this is the best QoL improvement I've seen from you guys yet. Please make implementing QoL improvements as important as rolling out new content!
---
ah man im sorry this epic story ended with a fuck up on Bethesda's part
---
Im also getting frustrated with the server crashes, they are far too frequent nowadays
---
in an online game, the most basic, most important thing is to be able to play online
---
usually when im invested in a deep quest/workshop/nuke run and the servers disconnect, it makes me sour on the game for a few days
---
I want this game to succeed, but im afraid other players will just leave the game forever if it keeps crashing as often as it does now
---
Those people are in the minority though and it would still take them longer than that, the xp exploits were so easy to use a ton of ppl did it. Not everyone will no life to speed level. No matter which way you look at it survival is a wet fart because of character transfers whether people admit it or not.
---
Very excited about these changes! Will be nice not having to travel all over the map to check venders. 
---
ceramic I believe, i never scrap just those it scraps in the scrap all.
---
&gt;If I want to be clear up in Grafton, all I need to do is travel to Whitesprings.
---
You don't have to go to Whitesprings at all anymore if you're just looking to sell stuff. Since the caps are now pooled you can just got to Sunny Top or Morgantown instead.
---
No problem! I know sometimes mobile doesn't play friendly with links 
---
I‚Äôve only seen him once but I wish you the best of luck! He‚Äôs out there somewhere lol. 
---
Then why whenever I pick up sugar, then scrap everything almost immediately after its gone?
---
28.5 % damage increase from AA. Until you max out you armor pen at 99%.
---
The current is percentage based and completely ignores damage resistance. Most semi-auto and smgs do 34% flat damage disregarding health, level, perks, or equipment. The only thing that actually does affect damage are percent bonuses/reductions like sentinel armor, and these arent capped or reduced at all for PvP.
---
I was actually thinking about this in relation to the "Wastelanders" update - what if \_we\_ are the Wastelanders? Like a new Vault opens and the humans inside are rabidly anti-mutation, anti-wastelander, puritan types who see us and immediately try to blow us to hell?
---
They could have been sealed up with shed loads of heavy weaponry with orders to cleanse the world in case of things going wrong? :)
---
Well, they should at least have a separate limit based on how many different items you can have for sale. I think a limit of at least 50 different items would be manageable. Max price will be 25k caps since that's the max amount of caps a single character can hold.
---
i finished all repairing
---
If its 1400 shared for all then you don't need to go to the Whitespring l, just go to whatever vendor you want and take all those from him and done. And you don't even need the CAMP near one of them six fast travel to vault76 is free and the Grafton Station is like 6 caps away from it.
---
I think things will get darker as we go along.   Wild Appalachia seems to be about enjoying the sights and sounds of the world with other players.   We do have vault raids coming too, and with any luck, that'll be where some of the darker stuff will be.   
---
Especially if it's Vault 94, since I'm very interested to find out what exactly transpired in there given the aftermath.
---
i thought it might be a nuke site too, since i had to go repair the nuclear reactor and then start something 
---
Unless they just wanted to say ‚Äúhi‚Äù. In that case the paranoid became the murderer
---
Fake news go away
---
Nah, I like my mountain overlook, even if it is far away from everything. That's part of why I like it.
---
Mid-levels I farm the DMV quite a bit. When it's a Super Mutant spawn it's a fun little gauntlet, decent XP, tons of ammo and caps, and weapons to sell
---
Thats specifically why the cap is based on dps and not raw damage. Under this formula the fatman would still hit MUCH harder than a combat rifle because it fires less than one bullet a second
---
All of those changes sound AWESOME!  Especially turrets finally being a real threat to griefers.
---
So you can't aim 
---
Lmao you can tell a story ! 
---
ahh ok, thanks
---
No, it's agreeing to the fact that I can be doing anything and be attacked by a player, which I like. But I should't have nearly every player coming after me for the 30 mins I decide to do something other than PVP.
---
I agree, plus make sneaking remove you from the map like normal
---
I made it to 1st and it wasn't until I was running naked through the fields that someone hunted me down I didn't ask if they couldn't see me until I stood up so I could be wrong seeing as from what I can tell we do not have a clear answer from the devs I guess either could be true
---
Where did you get this from. I have not seen any posts on the new pvp adjustments in terms of actual mechanics.
---
Now we will be able to rename weapons a step farther would be in pvp it would say killed by "your name" using "get good bat".
---
I so hated putting all my PA's to find the one I wanted to use at that moment!!!
---
Sorry but I'm better with totally eradicating leaderboards. Apart from "fairness" issues, I'm playing fallout not fortnite.
---
I just got AA flamer. Worth using it???
---
That may be true but I'm at work and while Reddit isn't blocked,  any game website is.
---
It is the same with the Traveling Pharmacy perk, which made it a complete bitch trying to lighten the load before joining Survival mode. I had 120 stimpacks which on my weighed a total of 10kg and in the stash weigh 120kg
---
One strength adds 5 carry weight i think and when you run low health build you can get easily to 30 str with Unyielding and radicool that brings it up to around 300 and then when you add deep pocketed you get even more
---
I'm comparing how one company does business to how another company does business. I could have easily said "that's like buying a board game for $20 and it just being a board and some pawns, and they want feedback on what kind of upgrades they should add, like dice and cards."
---
To me, the whole point of survival is never knowing when or if you will run into a hostile player.  With this mechanic, everyone knows where the marked guy is, and the marked guy knows that everyone is out to get him.  The sense of uncertainty is gone. 
---
And how many people will just leave the server once they realize that they are now marked? Probably quite a few. It just feels very pointless. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait to rename my PA sets!!
---
you can just take one out, log out and back in and the quest will trigger, takes about as long and no caps spent on fast travel or the data
---
Finally, I can name my incendiary shotgun 'Fireball'
---
Thankfully I could care less about that. Dont have to worry about it if you don't play the crap mode to begin with :)
---
Make them rank up a bounty based on the missing caps. Until that bounty is paid with their caps they drop the sell price of all aid in inventory. 
---
Still not enough they drop one random armor piece? Idk just a thought. 
---
plop your camp next to camp venture and take one out, then log out and back in, quest will trigger, turn in date, rinse and repeat, no fast travel
---
That is what is nice about the tweaks to the pvp systhem they have made. It will weed out these type of people. In the long run they will only weed out/expose them selves. I hope those type of people quit and leave the game out of frustration. Their type does not fit the fallout 76 community.
---
Welcome, level 2!  Enjoy the Mire!
---
All right, what about one month then? Most people would have already gotten to very high levels by that time and this would still be happening. When you think of a gamemode you have to think it long term, and the only viable solution I see to this problem is level caps per session really. 
---
I hope so
---
Same that's all I've ever wanted üò≠
---
LOVE that I'm not going to fast travel every where for my cap's run!!!!  
---
 we‚Äôre adding a vendor from every faction except the Enclave to the shops at the Whitespring Resort. This will help reduce the need to fast travel all around the Wasteland to visit vendors from multiple factions. Additionally, we‚Äôre combining the Cap totals from all seven vendor factions into total pool of 1,400 Caps, which should offer you more flexibility in the trades you make with specific factions 
---
way too many "lolz"
---
Just to ask, does the effect actually appear on the pip-boy? 
---
It's likely a nuke site. the Red Dust description threw me for a second, but the others commenting are correct.
---
I once had the same thing happen, Fast Traveled to Poseidon for Powering Up, got disconnected, and on reloading in, I was in a Nuke Zone.
---
Repairing the reactor did not cause it however, someone likely dropped a nuke on the area as opposed to Whitespring or Fissure Prime, which is in The Bog of Cranberries.
---
I answered my own question after posting this. I tamed a level 20 sluggish sloth and he started heading back to CAMP. I needed to use different perks so I swapped them out and when I returned back to CAMP later, Mr. Sloth was there waiting for me. Unfortunately a few days later my CAMP had gotten attacked and Hodd Toward (the sloth) was a casualty of war. RIP, though I'm glad to discover that you only need the perks equipped at the time of taming. 
---
For  me it did. But I've known lots of people have trouble with the pip boy displaying said effects. 
---
It only lasted for 10 minutes I think though.
---
I thought of this but I don't want the hassle of having my camp not spawn. It's only 7 caps to fast travel from my super isolated camp, that's not too bad.
---
I like this idea.
---
Why do you say that?  I've seen another commenter saying unarmed doesn't really work in PA?  Not sure why it's the case either way.
---
It does in survival 
---
You guys are the most responsive group I‚Äôve seen on a video game sub. I feel for you guys with the hate that came at the beginning but thanks for sticking in there!
---
I totally feel for anyone that works on Anthem, the people in that sub are super toxic.
---
Oh, hadn't even considered that! Bonus!
---
I don't get whats the point behind putting all vendors same place if you are going to give all them one big shared cap pool. I mean, I'd understood if you'd put all faction vendors into same place and still had separated pools, then it would be convenient to go and sell stuff, but if they all are sharing same pool, I'll just go into closest vendor near my camp and sell to that. 
---
Thank you! 
---
You can still respawn anywhere else, defend your poor decision to keep respawning where you're being camped all you want 
---
A very good tip, thanks :)
---
Well you never show up on the map unless too 3 or wanted. And sneaking shouldn‚Äôt remove top 3
---
Didn't think about this, will do stranger!
---
Good idea
---
Okay, but, I do trade the Nuka T-51b, and the game doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúrefuse‚Äù to let that happen. Actually, your method sounds awfully like a scam to me. ‚ÄúYeah man, just drop that Nuka-Cola jetpack right there and lemme take a quick look at it. Naw, I won‚Äôt snatch it up and leave...promise.‚Äù
---
I don't know how you die of old age looking for other players cuz in my experience all you need to do is survive for a whole half an hour and you'll be at #3 on the leaderboard and THEY will come looking for YOU.
---
Also, you CAN fast travel in Survival -- and not just to train stations and 76. You just have to cheat a bit. I'm gonna be an ass and not tell you tho (cuz I don't really want anyone ruining my little micro exploit). Also there's other stupid simple ways to be anywhere you want to be in survival even if they slightly violate the spirit of Survival (not sharing -- see my previous statement).
---
Also walking is good for you! Set your camp up nearish to the places you like to go and WALK there. It doesn't take THAT long and that's how you run into cool little events you never see unless you Walk there. 
---
If you have an issue with people playing since release the you should have bought it sooner. Survival is already more rewarding without additional gear that is ONLY AVAILABLE IN ONE GAME MODE. I have no issues with pvp and survival other than the aforementioned disparity between challenge rewards. 
---
Maybe a Tuefortress? 
---
Glad renaming is coming. Even happier with the centralized cap pool. It was so annoying having to travel all around to offload unneeded items.
---
Really curious on how big that Lying Lowe quest line will be.
---
just sort by weight, it helps a lot
---
Not sure.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing anything different.  I am averaging 15-20% legendary heavy combat armor rewards though.  So many I end up dropping and giving them away.  
---
Complete all the quests and events and keep your rewards, your stash will be full.
---
Perhaps people get what you're doing, but don't want the stuff. I just started the game a few days ago and at level 3 in the starting town some level 100 tried to drop me a ton of ammo, guns, armor, and junk. Why would I take any of that and break the progression for myself? I'd rather level and collect things myself than have it just all dropped for me. The guy seemed like he had no idea why I wouldn't take all the stuff.
---
Likewise, every Fasnacht robot should he dead now x10 with how my VATS favors them.
---
Yup, I trade plans and am always looking for plans I don‚Äôt know while my customers are looking through my plans. And this drives me crazy too. Especially when I get to the bottom of their long list, find what I want, then they accidentally close out of the trade screen. So yeah, good advice! 
---
Somewhat of a solution.  They could still end up having their friend give them the caps and then get the bounty.   I'm having trouble thinking of any solution that isn't exploitable besides just debuffing the person to the ground.
---
The entire premise of survival mode is just pointless when you're allowed to bring high level characters over from adventure mode, a solid idea turned to shit because of bad decisions. 
---
Im a little unclear on this, isn't the pool already 1400? Do they mean that you can get 1400  from just 1 vendor. 
---
Keeping everything you find in a game like this is nonsensical
---
You can still sell or drop the items you rename, but this is good feedback, thank you!
---
Ya.  Forgot the shielded lining.  Actually received that 6 times.  I have 3 extra in my stash.  I ended up giving two away to my teammates.  
---
Someone most likely launched a nuke. Power plants don't add those kind of effects, however the white steam by the cooling towers does hurt you.
---
Yes but OP had his trick using a vender to reset the quest. That would have required travel back and forth between the camp and probably Watoga.
---
I much prefer your trick.
---
Keeping everything you find in a game like this is nonsensical.
---
Downside is server stability. Within an hour you would have people equipping perks to store stuff, then unequipping leaving their stash at 1600/800
---
I'd bet that the 'Nuclear Winter" update scheduled for this summer adds a cold/warm system
---
I never understood why they have your gamer tag rather than your character's name above your head. What is the point of naming your character in this game? 
---
You should've seen a pop up saying that Death from Above had started and heard an audible alert. When that happens, always open the map to see where the nuke is being targeted; it will be a red circle on the map (you may have to pan the map around to see it). There's no other way to know if someone's about to drop a nuke on your head (although much, but not all, of the Forest is off limits to nukes).
---
Yeah...
---
Perhaps make it so you cannot kill someone on your friends list? 
---
They couldn‚Äôt auto hop to server with them if not on friends list and if they are friend they could pay off bounty just as you stated
---
Wait incendiary since when's that in the game 
---
Ya I know but there is apparently a way to do it, it happened to me. I will not lie I am a returning player so I do not know all the new stuff (I just came back after several months of not playing) but I can assure you it was some sort of scam.
---
I did not drop the item, did not scrap the item etc. His armor had some weird purple/blue color scheme on it when he traded it to me. I am not 100% sure if the paint is part of the exploit but I figured if there is even a chance of it then I should mention it.
---
Yes it shows in your status, but when you are inside the combat, one can't just-"Oy mate, take a break, I need to check what effects are on". And the screen UI doesn't show you what things are on. 
---
I believe that the "Diseased" qualifier in a name can overwrite the "Legendary" title.
---
I've gotten multiple legendaries off of a single legendary enemy before, it's super rare, but it happens.
---
ah. good point.  thanks =)
---
I'm stumped.
---
It‚Äôs a fair point, but I‚Äôm also not wrong in this context. I‚Äôm talking on Reddit, in the subreddit for this game. 
---
Any comment I‚Äôve seen about survival has so far mentioned very specific problems. Nobody has called it utter shite, but there are specific problems.
---
Therefore I think it‚Äôs perfectly justified to say most people (in this sub) have the same view on the new mode.
---
I can understand why you might think I was speaking for the entire player base but I was not. However it‚Äôs also worth noting that Reddit, YouTube, discord, appear to have an agreement on what these problems are. 
---
I can‚Äôt talk about comments that aren‚Äôt made obviously. I mean, if you have seen any comments that think the leaderboard, the transfer of characters, and a couple of other items are fit for purpose then point them out, I‚Äôd like to see other points of view.
---
Agreed. I've been doing that because I hated scrolling my own inventory to find new plans. Lol. 
---
One person I traded with at a railroad station made a comment about why I never pick up notes. I didn't have my mic on but jumped onto the stash box. Took out a "few" notes (maybe 50 or so random ones) and opened trade again. The next comment heard was "I never realized those could be put there."  Lol 
---
I did find out recently that even though the notes say they weigh 0.00 if your stash box is full you will get a message when trying to add the notes in. Take something out and stash away. I was trying to stash a map when that happened. 
---
That doesn't make a lot of sense, since those items are in the Aid window they wouldn't scrap and they are in some kind of metal conisters.
---
I thought there was for dying without caps.
---
I heard from a streamer that it is a damage penalty.
---
I do not sell stuff I am simply trying to provide as much information to help others as I can. I am no coding expert or anything so I am just trying my best. I have no interest in selling anything to anyone but I do understand your point, if you have any other suggestions on how to prevent this exploit scam I would love to hear it! (not sarcasm btw genuinely asking)
---
But a level 130 is going to have a LOT more caps, one would think. At level 80 I was still hoarding caps to buy plans and stuff. 
---
Does it? That's a good tip then for those with long lists.
---
So you want Fortnite.
---
I would like to know what "player PVP damage rules" *actually are*.
---
Idk, every time I kill legendary monsters my counter has gone up.
---
There was a massive post comparing a bunch of weapons and armor sets and recording the new damage values. Hopefully someone reading this can remember the name of it and link it for me 
---
Yeah, those are my two most common ones as well. Kora is up there too. Then probably crashed satellite. I will say, a couple times there has been nothing there and I screwed around for a few minutes and something spawned. It never does it when I'm looking at the spawn point. I literally turned around in a circle one time and it spawned while my back was turned. This is especially true if you just joined the server or you sprinted to it after fast traveling. Sometimes the server just can't load things in fast enough or keep up with you if you're moving fast through an area. One time I got to the spawn point and there was nothing there but I started taking rad damage. Turn around and the ghouls and grave spawned in and they started attacking me. Was disorienting for sure.
---
Awesome!  we get to rename out power armor and weapons!  Yes!  This will keep me from accidentally selling them or having to figure out which power armor is which..  Rock On!  Bethesda is doing a great job on these new patches.  I can't wait until the new content comes out either.   
---
That's great news. Thanks guys for doing an awesome job. I love the game and series and i really appreciate and love how you respond and interact on what is an amazing community.
---
Looking forward to all the future updates
---
Also add back the BOS combat armor mod please 
---
Interested in the tse ar
---
I see the bundle is back up - thank you!
---
Like tick blood tequila?
---
I didn't know that. This was the first time I found a legendary item in a "diseased" enemy. I'll have to see if it happens again. 
---
I'd like to solve the puzzle.
---
Haha my thoughts too, good luck to whoever goes there to sell.
---
I got sausages, both times I played.  Can you post what donuts do for you?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
same here.. and ammo :-)
---
You can only have 1 of each kind working at once...why keep more?
---
you are going to see a lot of steam coming out, if you go in, it will take you out very fast 
---
That's a good point.  They could make it a lot harder to team up with someone to exploit.  I'm a thinker though and I can already imagine that I would join my friend, communicate via discord, and delete from my friends list after I joined.  However, to counter this abuse, they could make it so u can't delete friends except from the main menu.   
---
People aren't stacking bobble heads or chems as often as you'd think. I only occasionally stack phycotats/explosive bobble heads when i'm fight a team of 4, that are all particularly high level. I haven't lost a pvp fight in survival, the closest i've gotten to losing was against a bloody vats build and his very high level friends, we tied and i gained caps. No legendary effects is iffy, people spend a ton of time looking for legendaries, and a person's legendary gear can make or break their build. If everyone had the same gear, i do agree it would rely on skill more, but those legendaries you bought/farmed for would all be useless. And if people honed their builds like they do now, it would still be a one shot fest without specialized legendary gear. If you cant pvp, don't do survival.
---
Aaaah, yea on that i agree 100%
---
if looking for plans but people hoard weightless notes, when you sort by weight all of them will be pushed to the top
---
If you get staggered, you are a dead boi.
---
do you want to trade with gear you have or caps? please offer
---
Hmm I will have to test this out as well, I haven't been in Survival yet.
---
You don‚Äôt. Just make a new character and use that in survival
---
everything I don't want dropped or sold is going to start with z
---
Pool playing ability: Special Effects:  
---
INT: Get a line (similar to the Fire in the hole grenade effect) for where the Cue is going to go (probably, see other special)  
---
STR: How hard you can hit it  
---
PER: Line will bounce off of other balls  
---
AGL: Affects size of the aim crosshairs.  May strongly affect angle of the strike with low AGL  
---
LCK: Hidden crosshairs.  High luck might give you a VERY precise strike, where low AGL would have otherwise failed.  Size of hidden crosshair slow expands to match AGL crosshairs during turn.  "Lucky Strike" means barely aiming at all and hitting it dead on.  The longer you take to aim, the less you rely on luck to hit it square.  
---
CHR:  Why the heck would CHR affect pool.  Maybe some alcohol related affect or something....
---
Exactly!
---
ikr
---
It's working great for me but the down side is when you attack you're no longer sprinting.  So if you don't kill them fast you are as good as dead.  Since they nerfed melee one shotting (vats crits still seem capable) it's kinda more likely than not you'll die if you don't take them out in 2 hits lol
---
oh okay thank you, when we played together we would do a quest together, but out of probably 10 quests only 2 or 3 were completed and finalised, the rest would show all obj's complete but quest wouldnt finish.
---
Sure, then they could use the "no" emote.
---
I totally understand you, and would do the same.
---
But most of the people say they loved to receive early gift, and it is good to give and to receive :)
---
My though is it  has to do with turrets only attacking a flagged/hostile player. On Survival, if a player has their weapon holstered, they appear neutral.... If they draw their gun they become hostile.
---
I didn‚Äôt lose any serums. I‚Äôm not carrying any. Got the mutations I want already. And a ‚Äúrandom amount‚Äù ended up costing me pretty much all my stuff. Which is not okay. I expected to lose maybe a little bit of everything at worst, not 9/10‚Äôs of my aid items.
---
I would say combat is solid and one of the best, after combat i would say marine 
---
And if the body glitches you fail the event?
---
I'm able to see if a player has his weapon drawn or not, no need for the red overhead thingy. remove it asap or give us a harder survival mode. i wonder who is responsible for this. someone who has just completed his exam and has no idea about games? its not allways about money and casual gamers.
---
the games are played not only by beginners but also by old hardcore fans. even if its only 5%. see that you get something decent with the next patch or your next games. think about the pro gamers. ffs.
---
I was given the shotgun by a friend who found it a couple months ago. She only does unarmed/melee weapons and I only do shotgun/melee. So I got a sweet legendary shotgun. But if I stand too close to my team and shoot, I blow myself up lol
---
what's with the "yes but"?  I am aware of what OP said, I was suggesting an alternative...  and you're welcome?
---
30
---
Enough with the fucking beer hat challenges already
---
Yes, pool is already 1400.
---
All vendors will share the same pool for a total of 1400.
---
So yes, you can get 1400 from just 1 vendor and the rest would show 0.
---
I would have preferred a cap level of 1400 for each vendor, but that is not what they are doing.
---
My hangup is making the margarita version, needs corpse seeds...from an event only reward lol.   I've seen/done it twice now in 9 days
---
Just filter the notes. Absolutely any filter you filter by will generally put the notes, known or unknown, at the top. They're the heaviest most expensive notes you can have. It's quick. Just hit R3. Hope this helps!
---
With out looking like a bad guy in the process
---
I find myself with two toothpicks and three napkins. It is time.
---
Did they fix the shotgun issue?
---
How OP does your build need to be to enjoy the mode?
---
No prob, what Im curious to know is, would the person you killed, who placed a bounty on you, know that the person who claimed it (your friend in this case) were working together?
---
this
---
doesnt help with the faction specific items that they sell.
---
Essentially, High INT/PER will give you a really good preview of where the ball should go (long line, multiple bounces), but the Low AGL/LCK means you might not be able to hit it right, even if the line is square on.   High AGL/LCK means it always goes where you wanted it to, but you wont have nearly as clear a preview of where that will be.  High STR would be needed for longer trick shots.
---
Having all faction vendors in one place is going to very bloody in survival. That hallway is going to be a massive arena.
---
I'm getting dropped in a dead sprint. From a distance. I do enough damage to one hit kill. But I'm not even getting close. 
---
stayed alive for 5-10 mins and got a 37 kill streak, eventually died due to being teamed by 6+ after gaining a 1300 cap bounty
---
I try to team up with people who build at whitespring, so i can build them some walls blocking the turrets 
---
It does thanks
---
Waiting half hour to get to the leaderboard??  My vital life signs would be so low that even the bacteria living on my body would die of old age too!  And sometimes you need to wait longer, sometimes way longer, than half hour.  
---
Your exploits aren't solutions.  
---
And many events are glitched and can't be fast-travelled to, the same way they have always been
---
BOS Combat Armour is by far the best. The best legendary effects would be Sentinels/Cavaliers, Assassins/Unyielding/Bolstering, and then something like Powered/*+1 Stat
---
extra xp
---
Bloody indeed.... Hopefully it gets made a "safe zone" to prevent total chaos.
---
That URL's blocked at work, and taking forever to pull up on my phone. Basically, it should look like this more or less now (replacing &lt;mod with graphicsx&gt; with the actual names of the mod files you've pulled:
---
\[archive\] 
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2, &lt;mod with graphics1&gt;.ba2, &lt;mod with graphics2&gt;.ba2  
---
sResourceArchiveMisc = SeventySix - MiscClient.ba2, PerkLoadoutManager.ba2, &lt;mod without graphics1&gt;.ba2, &lt;mod without graphics2&gt;.ba2 
---
The guidance now is that anything with textures (like reskins, glow mods, etc) should stay in sResourceArchive2List after the forced reload of game textures (SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2 through SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2). Any other gameplay stuff (Perk Loadout Manager, Better Inventory, etc) should be placed in sResourceArchiveMisc after SeventySix - MiscClient.ba2. 
---
You can do a lot of other tweaks in this file as well - auto-login, etc, but I've never seen a comprehensive guide to all the options available. Here are a couple of articles on tweaking visual settings:

No problem buddy! 
---
I was. I‚Äôll admit that. I didn‚Äôt expect it to drop all of that. But the caps thing didn‚Äôt happen right. I‚Äôm level 93. But I went from 2500+ caps to 2012 caps. So that‚Äôs a warning too. Because if it‚Äôs dropping just however many caps, then other players should know and be even more wary.
---
In FO4 I just prefixed my favourite weapons with ‚ÄúMY‚Äù but I‚Äôm going to try and come up with some cool names this time lol, well.... with one exception though...... I think I‚Äôm going to call my Bloodied rolling pin Gordon Ramsey üòÇ
---
My camp is only a short walk from a train station and I reckon that those vendors will also have the 1400 cap limit, so I don't see the need to move. And I'm guessing I'm not alone in that. 
---
I'm guessing I'm not getting staggered, simply because my character does a forward tumble from dying mid sprint and going limp.
---
That paint sounds like it might be the Quantum paint for the X01, which, like the Nuka Cola paint for the T51b, is not an atom shop purchase. Power armor with this paint can be freely traded between players.
---
I and several of my friends have experienced the sudden loss of one or two pieces of our power armor, usually the legs or the helmet. I've wondered if this is related to the glitch, which has been a nuisance since the beta, that spontaneously deequips those pieces 
---
There are certainly some dishonest players in the game, but they don't have magical powers. Your experience sounds like an unfortunate, infuriating, and unjust glitch--not a cheater.
---
found the griefer
---
Not to mention finally knowing what power armor has which pieces. 
---
It absolutely should. Stash your aid, nuke your stuff, or don‚Äôt bring a super high level account with 150 stimpacks into survival.
---
Oh so you mean explosive not incendiary 
---
I'm choosing to imagine you in ritual robes and a rusty gas mask, kicking all the bottles you see so they can hear them clink.
---
Hmm it could just be those vats critters or you're missing something in your build.  Do you have the dense armor modification in your chest armor? 
---
I‚Äôd assume the sane ones would give up or try to be friendly at some point, Ferrals are animals, and don‚Äôt give up and run by instinct
---
No, I want to hear specifics about how turret damage is being reconfigured *to match "player PVP damage rules"* to disallow one-shots by powerful players and increase the damage of weaker players.
---
Uarmed does not work in PA. I was wondering if you use PA, because if you don't unarmed is another melee option.
---
ESPECIALLY if player vending it going to be like how the fermenter works. i.e. you select things already in your stash to display and for sale in the vending machine.
---
I‚Äôm looking to maybe make up for the carry weight loss if/when I stop living in my excavator armor. That‚Äôs why I wondered if I was understanding correctly how things work, since the various weight reduction perks would make a big difference.
---
I don't have Dense, but I'm always rocking fireproof. 
---
Rumors of sheepsquatch you say?! Sounds like a teaser to me
---
there IS a kills leader board...
---
I think what might benefit the game is setting this as a default.
---
If you die, you start from scratch
---
200% xp bonus
---
Thank you.
---
Well the community is kind of it‚Äôs own thing of RNG. You may find someone who is extremely nice and gives you stuff, or you‚Äôll find an ass that constantly fights people and shouts racial slurs over the mic, but you can just mute those people.
---
There is. Server issues! Caps are items just like everything else. And also, dupers - I am sure there are still some out there - would dupe caps indefinitely without any weight issues.
---
That‚Äôs not correct.
---
I‚Äôd prefer an immersive storyline more than this repeating stuff, i visited biv like 1 or 2 times after the quest and bored out.
---
Wait, where?!
---
The centaurs from previous Fallouts would more closely fit that bill, I think.
---
Ahh I see, still thats a lot better than it currently is. Im pretty excited for all the vendor s to be in WS!
---
Oh nope, the bounty just disappears on the map.  I also put bounty on people playing together and it kept disappearing immediately so I'm assuming they were doing this also lol
---
I don't but I do rock max fireproof. 
---
what do you mean? did you forget to use your bartering perk card?
---
I drop people with cav while their sprinting, there's 3 reasons to this: 1. vats crits drops people in a heartbeat 2. Cavalier is glitchy af 3. legendary effects can be mean
---
can you provide pictures or atom amount?
---
Vats crits are a one shot that ignores armor. 
---
I wish I could upvote this 100 times. There is no role playing if you can't use your character's name.
---
I would prefer you head shot me to Morrowind...
---
Pump-Action. Always love the feel of a good pump shotgun 
---
Because different factions have different inventories that you may want to buy from.
---
Agreed, it sounds like quantum paint. I wonder if the legs transfered back to his on character inventory.
---
Ok so the Cav effects can be glitchy. That's something I've suspected.
---
That might be enough too.  I'm using dense and rank 2 fireproof.  Not sure which is stronger.  Maybe try dense and see if that changes things?  Explosive is still the most popular secondary modifier it seems 
---
r/Market76
---
That what that subreddit's made for
---
For armor, the enemy-specific prefixes reduce the damage you take from those enemies rather than increasing the damage you deal. Looks like you have the legendary modifier slots figured.
---
There's a valid argument that the best armor set is mostly heavy metal, because there are few dangerous sources of energy damage in the game. You can also throw in a piece or two of heavy leather if you want a better balance. Heavy combat is fine though, and Marine or Trapper if you want a bit of rad resistance.
---
I'll definitely try it. I appreciate your help.
---
I vendor all the stimpacks I get while farming for paint plans. It more than pays for itself. I just wish I could sell ammo. All that grenade launcher ammo just goes to waste for me.
---
True true, I do enjoy a longer quest/storyline over repeated dailies of course... Or better yet, both
---
Overall its has the greatest resistances but I prefer to use robot armor. It is MUCH cheaper to fix (if that's something you care about) and can be moded to have pretty great resistances on it's own. Also, combat armor pieces are more highly sought after so they are much more expensive than their robot armor counterparts. Just my 2 cents
---
&gt;Lolz I said algorithms not amount It‚Äôs math, the proportion of caps lost. 10-15% of current cap stash is applied to all users who die ingame in survival. 
---
There's no magic "algorithm" or "proportion of caps", you fucking moronic twat waffle. It's a simple formula: player level x 2 = # of caps lost. A level 10 player will lose 20 caps, a level 300 player will lose 600.
---
If you're able to switch voluntarily between them at this time, I'm not aware of how to do so. 
---
Scrap more hunting rifles :P
---
Soo... F*ck me then... 
---
I'm really hoping that the new legendary player system will be thier attempt at fixing this (having to pick combat vs non combat skills) .  Personally I think that if they give people combat advantage for going legendary it will just create even more of a player Gulf then they have now.  Imagine if when you hit 50 you can trade in you level to get 5 passive perk slots for things like lock pick / hacking / crafting / cooking skills.  That's going to give people incentive to trade in levels and it will keep the player base at an overall lower level.
---
I maybe could have. EXCEPT. I run a shop in the game. I sell things to other players, including ones I run into. I go out and give new players gear and items. And I didn‚Äôt want to spook him if he was friendly. I used to do this in GTA Online too. And normally when I did it in that game, I‚Äôd find most people were glad to know I wasn‚Äôt going to kill them as I drove past. So...previous experience told me this was the right course of action. I now know, painfully, it was not in this case.
---
Camp building
---
Ah 10-4.  Appreciated!
---
Idk how much Heavy Combat Armour weighs, but if you‚Äôre worried about carry weight there is an ultra light mod that decreases the armpits weight by a ton, or there‚Äôs also the deep pocketed mod that allows you to carry more stuff. If you have excess room in strength you could also equip the reduced Armour weight perk as either an alternative or to make your Armour weigh next to nothing.
---
what? wanted because lived long? lol wtf is this shit? 
---
Would love to have a "build mode" where you could leave your body to do the designing and building without having to worry about walking and whatnot. Perhaps building via a Mr. Handy?
---
You can also buy things in one place
---
Double barrel ... if only it were an over-under.
---
Something like that was my other guess.... It'd be nice for a low level to protect themselves from higher players while in their camp...
---
Xx_PU55Y_BOI_xX 
---
No prob, I also edited more details of my own experience into last comment.  I have put maybe 10-12 hours into survival so far.  So nobody can say for certain but it has been working so far for me
---
Good. I hate battle royale
---
Great stories and people like this make me really appreciate this game even with all its quirkiness. If you're on Xbox, I'd love to join you for a nuke launch sometime. Lvl 109 solo player and I've never launched a nuke - probably the only content I've yet to experience. FAQs:
---
1) No, I'm not a weirdo, unless you consider socially awkward gamer with no friends weird in which case, guilty as charged ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
2) No, I don't have a mic. No friends to play with = no reason to acquire a mic; I do have a keyboard I can respond using messages pretty quickly
---
3) Yes, I have plenty of nuclear keycards and looked up how to do it, just never attempted it solo
---
Spot on!

Survival Mode should be something ala FO:Frost.  So difficult that PvP is virtually necessary to have enough supplies to survive, but combat is dangerous enough that you avoid it until absolutely necessary.
---
For blood, gore, violence, smoking, and alcohol use, perhaps?  
---
That can be said for a large number of games - or targeted at kid cartoons, for that matter.
---
Other than a couple static poses with the bears, that I have found so far, there's no L, N, or SC programmed into 76....Not sure if the flirting/sleep scenario in FO4 counts as inappropriate....but OP says theyve already played that one.
---
Wait is that the desert camo pack?
---
The ammo may be a pain, but my god is it satisfying watching them roast as I lay fiery death down upon them (while healing my teammates).
---
I suppose that's true. I can't remember the last time I actually bought something other than a random legendary from a vendor, but I can see where having them all in once place would be handy for lower level players that are still buying plans and whatnot.
---
This is my secret, DELETE THIS NOW lol
---
You can snuggly fit a 3 x 5 camp under the larger viaduc sections next to Thunder Mountain power plant. 
---
The wall pieces can go up to the concrete "roof" of the bridge, which gives a nice warehouse look.
---
I challenge you to build a factory or a garage there.
---
Lying Lowe is a questline that's a bit longer than Nukashine. You can play through it with each of your characters once, and there are a few bonus quests along the way. There's also a repeatable element, but you'll just have to play through the new quests to uncover what that might be. ;)
---
Yes! This right here is what survival is supposed to be. 
---
Not some twisted battle royale where everyone fights at train stations. 
---
Agreed, it will be nice to be able to more easily navigate, and give your favourites a nickname. 
---
Well that is encouraging. I've been gaming since the mid 90's and can hold my own in most every PvP game I've ever played. But 76 is making me seem like a complete failure and it's driving me NUTZ!
---
Nope! The new posters will appear next to Party Posters in Train Stations.
---
Thanks for all your help! To add onto this, I have a lot of trouble finding those brown paper bags. Maybe something could be done about that too?
---
Yup i went out to die so i could respawn to see what its all about, its actually a white smoke coming from under the reactor, i believe its caused by the event, but does anyone know when will it go away? 
---
But your not talking on a post about your topic. You even admit to hijacking a thread.
---
Agreed.  The alcohol related dailies are too frequent.  
---
I agree.  I'm enjoying survival mode because it makes the game more realistic for me.  I'm not trying to PVP but the idea that I can run into another player and get into a skirmish at any moment is exciting. I'm way lower lvl than anyone else I've run into in survival so far (34) so I'm mostly sneaking and running thus far, but if that's what it takes to stay alive while I play the game then so be it. If I end up in the top 3 and get marked, it's just going to expedite my death. I'd rather see the top killers get marked, or a zone marker rather than a pinpoint.
---
I have straight caps.How much you askin?
---
Ha, same I'm 33 years old myself.  This game can be a bit frustrating.  There are counters to builds I'd like to try too (like stealth boy to avoid vats) but I've yet to put them into practice lol.  
---
I actually didn‚Äôt want to PVP. I was only in there to kill the legendary enemies to complete the Survival weekly to get that gun. It‚Äôs literally the only reason I‚Äôd hopped into Survival. I figured it would be bad if I went near any of common hubs where other players go, or the train stations apparently, so I went somewhere in Adventure where I knew enemies would spawn, including a chance at a legendary enemy for the weekly (that would count, as not all do, needs a star in the name), I then backed out to the main menu, and went back into Survival, server hopping that area to get them to spawn. 
---
What dies technical data do?
---
Yes, yes yes a$$hats could be made ‚ÄúExcomunicado‚Äù. Continental Whitesprings.... fantastic idea!
---
Slight tangent but do you know if you get a bounty placed on you in survival and then switch to adventure do the caps come off of your character as a normal adventure bounty would? Some dude place a 800 cap bounty on me (lol) but I also had a lot of aid I can't fit in my stash so I'd like to switch to adventure to sell but not if that 800 comes out of my pocket all of a sudden.
---
The double barrel has a really satisfying thud when you fire it. I have a quad so it doesn't really have any downsides.
---
The combat shotgun is objectively the best but I haven't picked up a good legendary yet.
---
Can u set that up? To play games?
---
Good to know, thank you. Any insight into my question on legendary effects? Do I have the way it works correct?
---
Game mode does exactly what Bethesda said it would.
---
Players: surprised Pikachu face.
---
I told myself I was going to refuse to use stealth boys as I think it's easy mode. But the way it is now, it's the only option it seems. I do think they should take away the ability to use vats when you are under the effects of a stealth boy.
---
I really don't think they should. Otherwise they would have done that instead of giving us another 400 lbs of stash by this point. The only reason we have a limit at all is for server stability. If the perks applied to stores items you would be able to put 10x as many items in storage and the servers would have that much more work per player to do and we would just get more crashes. So maybe someday they will, or they'll just give us more stash space. But for now it's a stability issue
---
What‚Äôs that got to do with what I‚Äôve just said? And frankly how many times do we see comments go off topic in a thread? Jesus it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve done anything out of the ordinary here. I‚Äôm still in the same sub. Literally the only reason I posted that Is because I found somebody who either works for Bethesda or appears to have contact with the dev team so I took the opportunity.
---
Scorched plague could have easily been stopped if everyone chilled tf out.
---
I'm generally a salty MFer, but I approve this message. You're saving me like an hour of tedious travel to collect caps and renaming my armor so I can quickly know what's what... Very nice.
---
"With our next update, we‚Äôre adding a vendor from every faction except the Enclave to the shops at the Whitespring Resort."
---
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
Holy crap, we got to give it to bethesda. They are doing a fantastic job listening to feedback and improving this game with every patch.
---
When you buy a new car,do you say....ah well,it‚Äôs the first year of this model,I‚Äôll give them feedback so they can improve it for next year,it doesn‚Äôt matter if it doesn‚Äôt even run.
---
You expect the fucking thing to get you from point a to point b.
---
This isn‚Äôt like small adjustments like the handling needs improvement or the seats need refined,the fucking thing doesn‚Äôt even run.
---
That‚Äôs survival mode,total and utter bullshit.
---
Lost my 3* aa lever action same way. Replaced it on the trade forums, I dont like trading but losing gear is totally unacceptable.
---
I disagree. Making top kills marked on the map would be a huge disincentive to engaging in pvp at all. If i kill someone defending myself suddenly I'm marked for pvp to the entire world? Absolutely not. 
---
It's tough. If there was a real rifle sized Blunderbuss, for sure. I love my Quad ammo explosive double barrel, but the bloodied explosive harpoon gun with flechettes is amazing. 
---
Why i disagree: 1. People have grinded/bought these legendaries, for them to be simply useless? 2. I drop unyielding/sentinel/assassins/cavalier with a handmade that has anti armor and explosive, but i can still do this with a upgrades handmade. 3. If you take out legendaries, it will still be a one shot fest, because melee builds in power armor will be op, and they will one shot every build (besides those with blocker, and othe DR resistances), and stealth rifle builds/vats commando builds will drug stack and drop everybody. So this is not the way to go if you want to balance things. Nerf some commonly known op effects, like sentinel, anti armor, bloodied, cavalier. If you are having a hard time in survival, team up with your friends, or don't play it.
---
It's a corpse plant. They're significant in events where you have to protect them from mobs.
---
Non-Ferals were probably hanging out in communities, trying to live their lives. Much easier to track down and exterminate than ferals, who might be hanging out under some random blown up overpass.
---
I actually just read that thread about players camping the golf course and have NO want to be toxic like that. You did have the nuke part right though, want to see if setting up a base close-ish to Fissure Prime with non-AoE turrets would help dps the Queen. 
---
I just drop a bag and do the "come here" emote and have never had an issue. 
---
how is that a challenge.  you said it can be done.
---
You don't get hairballs from a shaved........Khajiit.
---
The most important ~~side~~ intended effect
---
I did read the patch notes. It said a random amount, yeah. But I didn‚Äôt think it meant 9/10‚Äôs of my aid items could be dropped! And this was also to warn any who don‚Äôt think the scope would be that bad! 
---
Having those various weight reduction perks and combined with certain perk cards i.e. travelling pharmacy, thru hiker, pack rat, and so forth would greatly help to make up for carry weight loss IMO.
---
Ok, thanks. I‚Äôm also trying to think of reducing the weight of the guns and other stuff I carry. If I get the carry weight bonus of deep pocketed, while at the same time reducing the weight of the items themselves, then it‚Äôs a win-win it would seem.
---
Yeah vats is a bit odd at the moment.  I've tried to vats in melee and it does not work due to a pebble on the ground half the time lol.   The slightest obstruction makes it not work.   20% of the time it will work on stairs.  I'd say 90% of my deaths so far have been in vats, staring at my opponent for a good 4 seconds, spamming the "fucking attack already" button
---
Under attack, better shoot my cow.
---
Yes you are 100% correct and you can also use this post https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2n39c/this_spreadsheet_shows_which_legendary_effects/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553796400574000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFTYL91KYp5Na3BGxe7Ivx566z_MA which is a spreadsheet of ALL legendary effects and in what way they can all be combined.
---
Ok. Thanks for your time!
---
start at 11k could be negotiate.
---
Vats crits *Dont* ignore legendary effects, doesn't matter if you just got crit on or not, cavalier has problems just like sentinel, but I've had more problems with cav. Vats crits also dont seem to ignore that much armor
---
Ah thank you. That was going to be one of my guesses. Is that still not "fixed" like the Feed the People event and why I will randomly get 3 Corpse Flower stamens? 
---
Wait people thought it was a Battle Royale? LOL
---
I just loved the term, 'spring toilet paper' lol
---
I used to have a TSE LMG and i thought it was garbage, but since they buffed the LMG damage, I'm very curious to see what it's like now. 
---
what games or cartoons targeting kids have that blatantly out there?
---
Oh and that spreadsheet has all weapons and their legendaries as well. Cheers
---
I've ran into the same problem üòÇ Just one more thing that's driving me nuts about the Melee option in pvp... It feels like I just have to join the sentinel assassin's vats Crit rifle build and I don't really want to...
---
Currently yes.in a future update they will be fixing it so they cant.
---
Good post this is an issue and not intended. I put the lowest bounties on some players to keep them busy and so I can track them on the map I'll stop doing this now. Now if they can also increase the log in invincible timer at train stations survival will be about perfect. Heads up it works at vault 76 just no where else.
---
It's how it feels lol.
---
Just stop the camps springing up. Don't mind the Nuke zone - it's the only one that is centrally located. 
---
You can also drag the camp device as close to you as possible and pan the camera around to see the way the zone will set. If you end up panning around the camera and you camp device is farther away from you, it will change the orientation and placement if the camp site. 
---
I am slow. So please use small words.   
---
1 Vendor will have 1400?  
---
That 1 vendor will be connected to all other vendors? Raiders / Responders / Harper / BoS / Watango / White Springs  
---
So now I just need to fast travel to 2 places to do trade runs? Because Enclave will have its own stash?  
---
So am I understanding this correctly? 
---
You usually pay extra for that kind of service....
---
I'd be interested in either the TSE AR or the TS Handmade. I can trade in a Bloodied Handmade and/or a 3 Star AR (Mutant Slayer, Faster Fire Rate, Reduced VATS Cost). I have some other legendary gear I might be willing to trade but don't remember the effects of off the top of my head. 
---
Not everyone has a mule to stash their caps on, and there are still plenty of dopes running around survival. Sure, smart players only drop a couple purified waters and a stim, but many are still dropping 100+ stims and lots of drugs.  
---
I've also yet to encounter a player that has netted me no caps upon killing. Just because in theory it could be true does not make it the norm at all.
---
This, please this.
---
Thanks for chiming in my man. It helps knowing I'm not the only one.
---
Thanks.  That means that I do not want to leave my decontamination shower out yet.  We'd like to be able to leave it for the benefit of the intrepid explorer that happens upon my camp.  I can't afford to fix it yet, so its staying in lockup.
---
Yup.
---
Yes! I had this thought too, it would really help with the camp placements I think
---
That's... that's what I'm saying...
---
OP is acting as if super sledges in older Fallouts didn't  exist before 76... 4 had literally the exact same model, as you said.
---
I don't get your point. You're *literally* contradicting yourself then calling me stupid in the same exact post, while making the same point I made.
---
Thanks. My goal would be to try to build into the armor some of the things I am using perk cards for now. If i am understanding it correctly, then I can build weight reduction into the armor with legendary effects and then put my SPECIAL perk card slots such as Strong Back or whatever towards something else.
---
I hear ya! Twice mine has been smashed to pieces by people looking to get me to PVP. The update cant come soon enough. 
---
That does make sense. Hmmm what if your camp gets nuked, or is about to and you either repair it or move it to dodge the blast but want to put it back to help with fighting whatever spawns or the players that come to see the damage. Trying to think of everything...though probably best to just put the camp down outside the nuke zone.
---
Yeah it would be. The best combo for reduced carry weight would be:
---
Armour Weight Reducing Perk
---
Weapon Weight Reducing Perk
---
Deep Pocketed Armour
---
Possibly Ammo Reducing Weights Perks depending on what weapons you‚Äôre going to use.
---
Quad Combat Shotgun + Enforcer.
---
You know in 76 you stop sprinting any time you press the strafe keys? Might be a bit weird if you're used to other games.
---
So when i'll trade for a legendary,not only i won't be able to see the perks,but it will also be called frank or some unoriginal crap like XxdestroyerxX....great.
---
Same problem. Fast traveled back to Home, 4 turrets gone, C.A.M.P. budget maxed. Can‚Äôt protect 3/4 of my base now. üò¨
---
Because you only kill people under level 40?
---
This is awesome. Thanks! I will check it out in more detail.
---
Don't give up brother! Lol
---
how about an inventory sorter that sorts by stacked weight rather than individual weight.
---
so i can see that my msteel si taking up 80lbs and not hiding at the bottom as 0.01 lb each
---
Hmm. I'd fully agree if it wasn't so buggy.
---
i think its destroyed. i spawned into a nuked zone and my stuff was destroyed.
---
I'm aware. I can't stress enough how much testing I've done before I posted this. I wanted to give myself a fair chance before I posted publicly that I'm terrible...
---
I have a 30 second video from yesterday at V76 showing how broken it can be
---
I noticed a whole bunch of people were getting camped by 2 people yesterday so I called up some vigilante friends and we suited up on our mains and headed over
---
Well, worst mistake ever. My 30 second clip shows me spawning (for the 50th time), pumping my shotgun full of shells and unloading the entire clip into her head from maybe 10 feet away. Her health just rebounds back after every shot and then she proceeds to one tap me and my crew no matter what we hit her with or had on
---
Really enjoyed survival until that moment
---
Techncially yes but actually no
---
No problem! They had me super curious before i had done that event too. Not exactly sure what issues the Feed the People was/is having!
---
Honestly what I thought/think Nuclear Winter is, is the map getting a snow texture applied from all the nuking we've been doing. Though that might be a crap ton of effort so probably not. Would be nice to explore in the white for a while though.
---
Why are you so upset and condescending. Get off the high horse  
---
TS HM for B HM is okay with you? I'd like to see your other gear too
---
Very good. Thanks for this info. Appreciate it.
---
Thanks man. I'm definitely keeping pacifist on for a bit.. I don't wanna spike my controller through my screen. But I'm far from quitting. Thanks for all your input.
---
I think even the enclave vendor will be part of that same pool, it‚Äôs just that the faction vendors in the resort will sell faction specific items, etc. 
---
That‚Äôs how I‚Äôm reading it anyway. 
---
Try putting your camera in 3rd person near the top of the water
---
None of the above.
---
They don't fit my sniper build.
---
Goodbye, power armor chassis, power armor chassis, power armor chassis, power armor chassis, power armor chassis, power armor chassis ‚öõÔ∏è, and power armor chassis ‚öõÔ∏è. Hello, grabbing the suit I want first try and getting to the SBQ on time!
---
It used to be when someone completed it, the whole server got free canned food. But they patched it out so only the people doing the event get that reward. But seeing as how I have seen a little pop up message of getting some stamens without doing any corpse flower events, seems like the same type of thing?
---
Other legendary suffixes exist. Two shot pistols have been a disappointment verses my anti armor one.
---
Two shot and explosive is 30% more base damage each? Is 60% more damage really better than reducing enemy armor by half?
---
I feel like 100 damage rating against 200 armor would deal more total damage than 160 damage rating against 400 armor.
---
By all means, show me the testing that has been done. I have heard about the debates between TSE and AAE, but never seen any posts about it.
---
Thanks I need some explanation. I read it multiple times now and I am just getting myself confused I think. 
---
Like a quest to become a resident or staff member of the hotel.
---
Did you try repairing anything to see if it takes more damage and breaks again? 
---
If that is the case then setting up again outside the zone is the only option.
---
Completely agree, I‚Äôm loving survival mode, there‚Äôs a few things that need tweaking, but you‚Äôve got some good ideas there! 
---
Have you tried using your mic? 
---
*cries in Gun-Fu*
---
Buy 1k shells for 1k caps?
---
Hold on...so with 1400 cap pool at a single vendor, does that mean you can finally sell mutation serums for caps?
---
I would like 4his. New challenges with weather, extreme cold would be interesting. 
---
Yep, no worries! I totally see how you read it the way you did though. 
---
Bizarre. I still wouldn't be able to damage them, correct? 
---
yay another ITV repost
---
That doesn't sound too far off! And in regards to Feed the People, that bug kinda makes sense. You're restarting the facility to "feed the people". Kind of a neat bug.
---
Honestly yeah it would. The mayhem caused by the bots joining in. 
---
Do we think Grahm / Responder Vendor Bot / Lemonade stand will still be distinct pools?
---
Big BIG YES yes, Got to have them utensils haning from my hip :)
---
The pool of available options is already so large that your odds of getting a weapon you want with the effect(s) you want are incredibly small, so I would only be in favor of adding more if they eliminated the useless ones like Nocturnal, exterminators, etc...
---
Double barrel is my favorite one to fire.
---
Yeah everyone complained when they patched it out. I agree.
---
No you wouldn't, unfortunately. If someone wrecks your camp, it automatically marks you as their enemy, and they are marked as yours. If you're in pacifist mode, you can't kill them, but they can kill you. It's so stupid
---
sure add me
---
Disappointing that you're going to buff turrets. They're already pretty good.
---
I wouldn't be that surprised if Cavalier was completely broken. My general principle with Fallout 76 is that I don't trust the text until I've tested it myself. PvP mechanics may also be completely different to PvE.
---
Sell those bad boys to other players!
---
Wow, that's a huge liability. I didn't know this. Thank you! 
---
Cool!
---
Can't wait to name my main and offhand weapon "Thoughts" and "Prayers" 
---
I guess it‚Äôs somewhat situational. It sounds like TSE is a bit more of an all rounder because a lot of targets don‚Äôt carry that much armour 
---
Source?
---
It seems to have been solved, I moved the " sResourceStartUpArchiveList" with it's commands to the top, that combined with your other advice seems to have solved it!
---
You must've accidently dropped it. Happend to me way too many times. Lost at least 5 legendarys that i used and it sux every time.
---
Yeah source ?
---
I wonder if a shaved Khajit would leave [butt puckers](https://imgur.com/gallery/GdK8P) as well.

It definitely seems that it is to me. I just want to explore every possibility before I claim it's not my lack of skill. 
---
Thanks for the offer but i am on PC.
---
I have friends who can craft it for me but it just sucks knowing you want to own every plan and there are some that just elude you. 
---
Are you running stealth boys?
---
The current price is *waving* at me. 
---
I'm liking the pump gun with maxed out enforcer at the moment. Them wendigo legs just crumple with it.
---
The worst part is you can be looking straight at an enemy, press VATS, and your character will literally spin around and go out of his way to target a friendly instead of the enemy.
---
Flamer, mini nuke, and power fist while in power armor :(
---
I want to use p90 and sgcqb on doc but the mp5 is soooo reliable
---
I should be. But I didn't want to depend on them as I feel they are easy mode. 
---
They all share a pool with Watoga right now so I imagine they‚Äôll join the big pool. But that‚Äôs a good question. 
---
no. i was on a noob character not meant for nuke zones. server hopped
---
Well then, I am glad I bought an additional set of atoms.  Keep positive changes like this coming and more money shall be flowing through
---
I see, well disclaimer was that I'm not a math guy so your totally right.
---
That's a solution for the current system sure, but is that a good solution for the game mode long term?
---
Fast travel is clearly meant to be a thing in survival.  Spawn camping is not.
---
One kill probably isn‚Äôt going to get you marked is it. But the player who has attempted to kill you and likely others will get kills and will be marked, helping other players kill that player.
---
Yup. "You want Excavator PA mods? Still gotta hike your happy ass to the boonies" would be my guess too. Raider Power armor stuff isn't available at all Raider vendors, only the one you have to fight to get to. Can't see that changing.
---
really awesome - very inspiring. my game is almost all build so this makes me want to log in and build and I haven't in a long while.
---
Yep lost now 4 legendary 3 star weapons over the last 3 months to this issue. Not happy at all that this issue is not fixed and no one seems to care! 
---
Don't know if it's possible, but a vertical radius would be nice too.  I built my base originally using that stacked foundation trick to make a sort of outpost that you had to jump too.  What I didn't know is that there was a vertical build limit. So now my outpost is stuck without a roof and I don't want to dismantle the base because I can't do that stacking trick any more.
---
I was in the even scarier clown outfit and fasnacht man mask lol
---
Ah that makes sense as yesterday I found Grahm, excitedly ran up to him only to be disappointed he had 0 caps and I couldn't sell anything to him.
---
\+karma
---
It works, I've been farming it whenever it comes up cuz corpse seeds are required for tick blood tequila margarita
---
Thanks for the trade!
---
Since the nerf I find my aa handmade to be more effective than my TSE handmade. Even though the TSE has around 30 higher damage, the anti armor effect seems to be more useful in practice. Also, no chance of splash damage from explosive rounds hurting you
---
I call it the pouchy mcpouches pouch jacket!
---
But if they died, possibly not even to you, you could get their explosive legendary
---
Well I mean you‚Äôre level 16 , don‚Äôt mean to sound like *that guy* but how do you manage to be that level with 30 hours , what are you doing in the game.
---
&gt;
---
With that level I‚Äôm not sure you should be pvping unless it‚Äôs people around your level, and I‚Äôd focus more on farming than doing the story because the story requires some level of level development to be able to kill the enemies in the different map zones etc.
---
Same on the flamer, ammo economy on that is busted. You can make oodles of .50 ammo (used to main a .50 MG and it was pretty easy to keep fed) but fuel is just way too low output and it hardly spawns anywhere.
---
"Nooooo I accidentally sold my cockblaster9000 instead of cockblaster9999!"
---
Heavy weapons, explosive weapons, alien blaster, etc. These either don‚Äôt do enough damage, break too easily, or their ammo weighs too much/costs too much to make.
---
&gt;why should I lose a crap ton of meds and food just because I died?
---
The better question is "Why are you carrying so much shit that can be lost on death?"
---
I didn't perfect my build until i was 130, and i'm still correcting screw ups i made. A level 70 isn't going to be as experienced as a 150
---
That's a --good-- REALLY GOOD IDEA
---
Though I propose a slightly different **Whitespring** than you do, essentially, the same Whitespring as we have now, but in order to access the player hub portion, players must go through a quest that requires them to gain an Assassin's Coin in order to gain entrance to the **Assassins Guild** or player's hub. This would lead to a few points around Appalachia, and finally back to The Whitespring itself, where the player has to insert the Assassin's Coin into a Nuka Cola machine, which leads to an area under Whitespring containing a laundry room that leads to another coin only door. Once the player gains access to this second door, they are in the player hub.
---
From the outside, the Whitespring is the same as always.
---
Have you looked at the leader board for top kills? Like two or three can easily land you top three or tied for top three on most servers
---
I‚Äôm also curious what do you consider to be a good legendary weapon for sniping? 
---
They can opt into the risk though. Use your god cannon and gimmicky shit for easy kills and rosk losing it vs stash it and use pedestrian items for more balanced play 
---
Heh... better the mire than the fallout 2 power armor welcome.
---
Besides, just like you can skip picking up your supplies, you could opt out of the nukashine and take your chances with the welcoming party.  Maybe even have a robot warning you "The last time you took a sip, you ended up waking up in a random room of the vault, but then again based on the noises I've been hearing outside that could be a good thing..."
---
So you would get to pick your poison.  I'd pick a small chance of the mire over the griefers.
---
That's what I normally carry, this happened on my first couple of deaths before I realized this happens
---
My advice if you cant enjoy Survival yet is go to Adventure mode and grind events continuously, they give you nice rewards and a fair amount of exp upon completion.
---
I met a non-feral Scorch beast, does that count?
---
I even fired on it (barely hurt it as usual). Stayed friendly. 
---
you should make the shop/toll booth have an in and an out powered door.. I would set up a booth/counter, and a pressure plate linked to the doors, which lock as soon as you step off (or set a timer). 
---
It‚Äôs a Nuclear Christmas in July!
---
u/mpstr1nger
---
Source is the new Inside the Vault, just went up today.
---
You gotta buy those rare plans, then you can sell to him! :D
---
I found the vendor bot last night and in my excitement server hopped a bunch of times to buy a ton of rare items. Then I realized that I had been wearing PA the whole time instead of using my unyielding (I keep that around just to buff charisma for vendors) and that I had forgotten about grape mentats. 
---
At least I got to sell him a lot of junk back :/
---
Main concern is making sure they aren't joining other peoples party chats. That's usually where the less civil discussions go on. So as others said, if you keep them in your own party chat, should be no issues with them playing.
---
nope.  I gave up and left the area.  when I left I didn't get any compleion
---
A way to push items in directions without having to walk it there would be nice. It's fun falling off an edge you can't see because the item you're trying to place takes up the entire camera. Totally haven't done that, just hypothetical.
---
Well im doing a lot of exploring and doing quests and events ad they come up. I really dont understand how im such a low level. I dont sneak around mobs either, if they are in my way i die. Also i play eso and i had no issue leveling on there. Thats why im asking for help. I cant seem to level up
---
This is an excellent list, however, it fails to list the weight of each of these, and how many screws they produce.  When farming, it's best to pick locations where you can find the most of the lightest.  For example, while Carlisle Typewriters each produce 2 screws (I think) they are VERY heavy, and just a few can push you into over encumbered.  But Handcuffs and Pepper Mills are the MOST efficient in terms of screws/weight.
---
I tend to avoid grabbing typewriters unless I am sure there is a crafting bench nearby, as they are simply too heavy to carry many before being over-weight.
---
Of course, if you are running in PA or are always over encumbered anyway, this doesn't apply....
---
Getting one shot in PvP isn‚Äôt your fault, it‚Äôs just the way things are. As far as help levelling, what is your planned character build? Do events for exp, caps, and stims 
---
Agreed, if you can't pvp with people who are actually trying/have good builds, dont play survival
---
You can craft beer now?!
---
Sounds pretty cool! Important it into the perk where it‚Äôs cheaper to build for rank two and for rank three you get a mr handy to do it instead! 
---
I'd go instigating
---
That'd be a fine trade, and sure. My discord username is DSJ#2788, and I should be available later tonight. 
---
he didn't have the plans I wanted--namely the disco ball!
---
Another! Another!!!!1!
---
You can stop stalking me 
---
That is a very good question, I would like to know too. 
---
Ah that one still eludes me too. 
---
Yes yes yes!
---
I have plenty of caps and stims, just cant seem to level. I do events also as they come up. I just cant seem to ever get any exp.
---
\&gt; as soon as I see I am in the top 3, I am stashing my junk and getting ready for the horde.
---
100%. The minute I see I'm in top 3 I get the fuck away from my CAMP and hightail it as far away from any train stations as possible.
---
Yeppp
---
When people make a trade emote I think it's some sort of scam I'm not hip to and only trade with trusted friends.
---
I been doing that but i still cant seem to level üòï
---
I don't agree with transfering so you dont lose caps, but i do agree that if you can't win pvp fights, dont fight at all
---
And a slowed down hunger/thirst. I always forget those, until I hear the indicator that I'm dying, when I get hyper-focused on building.
---
Shotgun paint fix confirmed here:

---
You on PC? We could adventure together for a bit and get you up some levels / finish some of your quests!
---
Like I said by one month the amount of people still willing to spawn camp would be a lot smaller, the people that just jumped in at a high level had nothing better to do. Level restricted instances would be nice though.
---
I just wish I could get plans to these as I‚Äôve been looking and server hopping and no success so far at the location close to the overseer‚Äôs camp.
---

---
pretty exciting to see that.. right now, then vendors down there are lacking. I'm wondering if you will still have to travel around to get certain things
---
It is a huge mistake to allow characters to move between Adventure mode and Survival mode freely. The wanted sound and icon in survival also flashes and makes gunfire sounds every time it disappears and reappears. Also, being able to die while your input is frozen after loading is pretty lame.
---
Survival camo bundle @ 1500 atoms
---
Ooo I like that idea. I front door opens/closes via a switch behind my sales booth, but pressure plates would be a great touch.
---
It also never occurred to me to make my main structure able to be passed through for some reason. It'll take some work since I'll have to re arrange the first floor, but that would allow me to have a much more functional shop/toll booth. Thanks!
---
Rail station safe zones won't work. You will have people abusing the safe border for kills by leaving right after you, or people waiting for you to cross the line to kill you. They just need to increase spawn invincible to a longer time period or until you press a button. Having more than 1 spawn spot at travel locations would help too.
---
Okay, that gives me at least one thing to try. Thank you!
---
I just want to point out that "Top Kills" is not the focus of the game mode. It's called "Survival" for a reason. The point is to do as well as possible *within that one life.* 
---
Given that, being alive the longest is the main goal of Survival.
---
Honestly don't like the alcohol part of the update. There was no need for. You could have done something more positive. You already have drugs. Not saying it is influencial (Don't know how to write it) but drinking a lot of alcohol isn't cool. 
---
I hope more group, social items come. Like I would like to make something in my camp others can use, or exchange items in my camp for stuff I don't need. Or something that different people (not in a group) need to do before we get access to a place or a nuka machine that give a bottle a day or something but only multiple people add something to the greater good. I don't know...
---
And like anyone smoked in RDR2...
---
Actually picking up 2 gives you a better reward. Anything more than 2 however doesn't add any additional bonus
---
So you are a deathclaw ?
---
Alright then, replace vault dweller model with deathclaw model.
---
This is spawn protection you speak of?
---
I'm level 200 and a naked guy killed me at one stroke 
---
Happy camper is a perk
---
Up vote visibility
---
Thank you but sadly im on xbox üò•
---
Ah damn you can‚Äôt replace the fire breather suit? Damn. I should have held onto that. I didn‚Äôt really care about the cosmetics until level 100ish and now I‚Äôm kicking myself. 
---
LMG. I have a level 40 AAE one, but it eats up .308 ammo way too fast and that stuff is annoying to get in large amounts so I don't try to use it in anything other than PVP. Wish they'd change the ammo type to something easier to get large amounts of, like 5.56.
---
What platform are you on? 
---
You can look through stats such as:
---
Player kills 
---
Experience Earned 
---
Events Completed
---
Enemies (NPCs) Killed
---
A few others as well. It'll display the stats for the week/for the current life of the players.
---
Don't turn in more than 2 at a time. 2 gives you enhanced rewards but anything more than that doesn't. 
---
I wish i could be that guy. This game is so hard for me and i cant figure it out.
---
Just let it be displayed I. Your camp. We have the shelves.
---
Xbox one
---
Depends what enemies you‚Äôre taking on , at level 16 I‚Äôd stick to the forest and the toxic valley ( maybe the ash heap but the enemies there are a pain )
---
The highest leveled guns and armour at your level would be level 15 right , so I‚Äôm pretty sure that level of guns are only going to be effective ( without perks ) in those two zones anyway.
---
For some tips , try using consumables that give you XP boosts and whenever you manage to kill enemies be sure to pick up all their weapons and armour and scrap them for mods and ez xp.
---
I remember at your level I found grinding the scorched at Morgantown airport gave me quick ez xp along with a bunch of guns to scrap , and also the scorched there are low level so they should be easy to kill.
---
Wow can‚Äôt believe they still haven‚Äôt fixed that :/
---
The only other consistent spawn for ants that I'm aware of is the substation just north of Watoga. Unfortunately a death claw spawns at the same spot, so it's a challenge to get a hit on the ants before he kills them all.
---
No prob! Your idea is great by the way! 
---
Use your stims to heal before you die. I dunno. You mostly level up by killing and if you struggle killing then use your stims.
---
Aww well good luck!
---
You can give me my shit you stole then lied about. Your story is crap and this post ( about the mutations i made you) is proof. Ill gladly warn everyone about you. 
---
&gt;8/10 times the person at the top of the board has the most kills. 
---
Total horseshit. The people engaging in PvP are *almost never* at the top of the leaderboard. The turn-over is high af for people actively seeking out fights.
---
No character can leave it's current mode or setting.
---
Adventure difficulties: Hard, Very Hard, Survival
---
Outlast = Permadeath, everybody is max level. Less about collecting good stuff and killing everybody, more about just surviving. Have a leaderboard on times, but no blips. Supply drops are made for people periodically. Never ending Hunger Games.
---
Competitive = different kinds of classic (Free-for-all, Team Deathmatch, Kill the King) and new (Battle Royale) competitive modes. Everyone is the same level, 20-40. BR Features random nukes dropping instead of just classic storm in-closing. Storm spreads from nuked zones.
---
But all of this would require Bethesda to become an actual AAA publisher/game studio. By the way, I still enjoy it. Just saying...
---
Probably a Berserker weapon.
---
Which makes some weird degree of sense.  I mean, if you're going to die anyway...
---
Hoping since they are tweaking the turrets more, we can get upgraded turrets versions.  Such as ones with exploding ammo as seen around.  I believe those are like the mark IVs?  Correct me if I am wrong please.  
---
Just get rid of markers except for bounties! 
---
Looking forward to naming the mr. handy buzz blade: 
---
‚ÄúThe Codsworth Tickler‚Äù 
---
;))
---
Vendor faction updates alone is MVP but I'll take the other changes as well. Very much needed.
---
You lucky ducky, what platform? I would love to join your world whenever you see them next lol
---
 I hope you update the post with progress, since I'll be keeping an eye out!
---
A few days ago, I got the plan for the T-60 BoS Knight paint. I didn't really want it so I sold it to a guy for 1k caps
---
I wouldn't mind if I got more unique recipes but i think i got Old Possum 3 times. I wanna make more vintage drinks.
---
Now those are the tips i was looking for! Thank you i will try that tonight!
---
It would be great to be able to colorize your throwing knives at the crafting bench (atom skins, but also basic ones so everyone can participate) so that you can differentiate between the players‚Äô knives on the dartboard. 
---
I would love this 
---
Youre not even smart enough to use them correctlyü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Can I help?  I will bring the moths.
---
That's awfully weird, i managed to reach 18 with my newest character in like 8 hours.
---
OK, cheers for sharing that! I presume that has no effect on how players are marked though right?
---
You actually do get better rewards from turning in 2 instead of one. Turning in more than 2 however doesn't give you anything more than turning in 2. It's in the data
---
You can still visit any of the existing vendors to get the specific item. You will have to make a choice between convenience and staying safe.
---
Alright thanks !
---
yeah but then they're gonna hit you with the RICO act
---
&gt;It should have no hud
---
That sounds like an awful fucking idea for a Fallout game.
---
I've only been playing for three days so I guess I haven't unlocked that one yet, or I haven't noticed it O.o
---
I just checked.  The Carlisle Typewriter produces 4 screws, but weighs 5 pounds.  So that's 1.25 pounds per screw.    Handcuffs produce only 1 screw, but only weigh 0.5 pounds.  So that's 2 screws per pound.  Office fans are middle-ground for screws/weight.
---
I think a "clean pepper mill" produces 2 screws and weighs around 0.38 pounds.  It's the most efficient, but they are NOT common finds.
---
If weight isn't an issue, just grab ANYTHING that has them.
---
wow you killed someone with a shotgun (TSE ?) you are so great, takes real skill killing people with weapons that are op and got duped.
---
Now go tell your boring story where someone is interested in them, no one here is interested in this "survival" bullshit mode where all the griefers hopefully find themself in griefing each other.
---
Awesome I‚Äôll try to jump on then, pretty sure that‚Äôs 10:30am for me 
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHJHJ
---
Ahh so am I bud. If you wanted to run together a bit over the weekend I can show you a few tips n tricks. Ways to level and not die. Some gear. Other things. U may rediscover some of the fun side. And I could be ur temp bodyguard haha. 
---
I‚Äôll admit, the cap transferring thing is slimy especially when people do it on the regular and you could get 10+ kills and gain no more than a few hundred caps. I‚Äôve never done it myself, but for players who are frequently low on caps, the current system definitely isn‚Äôt helping them if they‚Äôre a high lvl now that pvp is balanced for different levels. Even more so with sent ass gear 
---
You are basically describing teams, but with more people. I agree in PVP (which i don't play or have a horse in the race) that larger teams would theoretically be more fun. Almost like guilds would be in say ESO.
---
I prefer melee since my fo4 survival mode build was a badass melee build. How could i make that possible? I have the black diamond but if there are more than 2 mobs i get overwelmed
---
YYYESSSSS!!! RENAMING POWER ARMOR FRAMES!!!!
---
You‚Äôd have to remove mutations while you‚Äôre at it for this idea to really work. 
---
How do you join the BOS?
---
Robo-Barber can only do 1 style
---
I think it's for friend request purposes, but it's like, why not just show my username in Parenthesis or something, next to my character name?
---
Or when you‚Äôre doing the Surface To Air and Line In The Sand events. Why would I want to target the ASAM?
---
That'd be great! Now I want TSE turrets...
---
I farmed them a bit different.  I would spawn in at the Charleston Station, run to the east to the random event spot (it is by the stump in the grass), go kill the Grafton monster (20 caps, acid, oil, misc aid), then run back to Charleston for a random spawn to try and get the Vendor Bot.  Would also check the vendor there in case he had any good weapons/armor.  It is a bit longer but allowed me to farm a few things at once.
---
It'll be under charisma. 
---
The first star slows thirst and hunger by 40% while in a camp or workshop
---
this will make it so much easier. And also will encourage me to buy into those 5800cap power armor mod plans they sell because I'll be able to recoup more of that back immediately afterward.  Good job boys and girls. QoL improvements are the BEEEEEEST
---
Add me -itz LG97
---
Don't follow the main quest lines into Whitesprings and Pleasant Valley unless you have a very good plan about how to handle max-level enemies. Instead, explore the Forest area, then the Toxic Valley and then the Ash Heap once you need more of a challenge. There aren't many quests in those areas, but do all the events you run into. 
---
You can also take workshops for XP, but if you hang around there when it's not a defense event you're likely to get griefed.
---
Two hours per level is about average if you're playing solo and not specifically XP farming. Generally you'll level faster against level-appropriate enemies.
---
Yw ü§ó
---
Sorry to ask, I'm new to the game, but what benefit does having water in the circle offer? Or is it to avoid placing a pump/purifier?
---
no since the scorched plague also affects ghouls, they would not have been an immune faction to it but still died/succumbed to the plague just like the rest.
---
Some stuff is undoubtedly broken but all in all i somewhat i agree with you.
---
&gt;fortnite meets call of duty
---
It plays nothing like *either* of those games and this is the most crotchety "Get off my lawn" shit I have read today.
---
&gt;No one can hide or utilise stealth properly and a good sniper build
---
Crouching hides you, and snipers are probably the most OP build for survival right now. Also, stealth boys and chameleon are pretty much must-haves. 
---
I use the two spots north of Abbie's Bunker, the shack with the ticks usually spawns something, if not I run to the pond with the crashed vertibird, then if there's nothing I'll server hop.
---
It's not community it's deaf developers
---
wait I‚Äôm confused how does executioners help Bloodied builds? I thought the whole point of them was to 1 shot
---
You‚Äôre right. People don‚Äôt want to work around the meta, they want it to work around them.
---
I would suggest setting pacifist mode and adventuring through the quests, make lots of healing salve and keep it on a convenient button, and be patient with yourself. Grinding is not a lot of fun, and I find it best to level up along the way with other objectives. PvP is imbalanced due to problems with the game economy and bugs, so you may have to get to level 50 and have some pretty good gear to be able to stand against the heavy hitters out there. There is a lot of fun in exploring and quests, so I hope you'll enjoy that and maybe try the competitive parts later.
---
Just ran into this bot. I was traveling by road to Morgatown Airport for the quest. Saw a party of Super Mutants on the road, then veered off to the woods to avoid them. Then suddenly they were shooting in my direction. I still had the [Hidden] marker while crouched, so I was thinking how could they detect me ? That's when I saw the Insult Bot ner me. They were shooting at it and it blew my cover lol.
---
After, I beat the mutants, it then followed me all the way to the airport. I had to log out by then. Hope he's gone when I log in again tonight.
---
Thats nice to know. Can you explain how to xp farm solo and low level?
---
All faction vendors now in the whitespings...  People asked for a player hub, this is a good way to start this.
---
I hope that the new bots (I assume new) will get their own shops, not just lined up in some space in the corner.  With their own rooms they can bring proper representation of their factions with decorative items, banners and logos.  
---
I should probably edit to make more clear, you're still limited to only 4 people per team and one team per world, but we could make large persistent gangs that allow you to hop into a group and have a full team without trying to pull together 3 of your friends.
---
Also, the game booths at Wavy Willards Water Park have quite a few toy cars and toy trucks.  As do several of the Free-State Bunkers.
---
And the Newspaper offices on the outskirts of Charleston has quite a few typewriters and a few fans, too, IIRC.
---
I agree a few things need tweaking, but asking to ban legendarys from survival and stuff is just silly. That‚Äôs what inspired this post haha. 
---
He's seems a new addition. I checked the wiki and there's no entry on him yet.
---
better call them 'clubs' instead
---
It does not, but keep in mind that it's *survival* mode. The challenge/goal is surviving for as long as possible, not killing other players!
---
Personally, I don't think it's a flawless system, but I do like how it forces you to be more on-the-move than Adventure mode. It causes me to play the game much differently.
---
What is pacifist mode?
---
Thanks! I'll def post some updates once I get done re-modeling
---
you can msg me later it's 1 AM in my country gonna sleep now. I mainly available around 5.00PM-0.00AM (+7 GMT)
---
Ya, I mean guilds is basically it. I'm sure it's in their roadmap. I agree, it would be a positive addition to the game.
---
No reason to, you could go to any vendor and still enjoy the full pool. 
---
It doesnt really do anything. I dont even remember any reward at all. 
---
or having to be drunk all the time. no thanks.
---
It's just a "club" (-Every gang ever)
---
I like manyatruenerd but were his ideas actually decent ideas, or were they like his original "fix 76" video where his ideas were way too over the top and ambitious to actually be feasible?
---
Shhhhh I like being able to find them instantly
---
I honestly don‚Äôt care haha I just want that damn quest gone
---
same.
---
Daily mission: tea time: I've done the "tea time" event twice now trying to get ant meat. Both times the "waves" of enemies consisted of: 1 tick. 1 dog. 1 other enemy (bloatfly usually). The event was completed successfully, but the waves were woefully inadequate. 
---
We need more stories like these! 
---
Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have one yet. Made a new Char for Survival and only lvl 3 so far. Heard a lot of gunfire but didn‚Äôt run into any other players.
---
OMG this is such a gamer changer for me.  I keep my CAMP where it's at only because it's cheap for me to hit up all but 1 faction vender.  I can finally move my CAMP!
---
Is it a critical needed or is it a sneak attack? My boyfriend had the critical needed, and was using sneak attacks, and it wouldn‚Äôt work, but when he did a regular critical it completed
---
This is when mines start coming in handy.
---
Lost 3k In caps  since I‚Äôm level 140 and got spawn kill by a team
---
Everyday, some days are multiple times.... along with the b.s.o.d.'s, despite the supposed fixes to improve server stability!  Ha! (PS4pro)
---
Oh yes please! It can be especially tricky when using the mountain plateaus with trying to get areas to plant and your resources. 
---
Couldn‚Äôt have put it better myself
---
Omg. I didn't even think about that one for building. I def have it available but haven't unlocked it just because I go wander around so much and only stop by my camp to unload and get more necessities (or build for hours at a time *whistle*), so didn't feel it'd be too much use.
---
I'm an idiot. Hah. Haha.
---
Good lord, I am not into the idea of survival either but it‚Äôs pretty clear that many on the subreddit are. 
---
It‚Äôs also s huge jump from ‚ÄúI have a shotgun‚Äù to ‚Äúomg cheater duper scum!‚Äù
---
That's a very surprising change, but a very welcome one. I'd grown so accustomed to just spending the first hour of every gaming-day moving from vendor to vendor, suffering through one loading screen after another, taking care of this business. The idea of being able to do all of my selling in a single transaction and then getting on with the game sounds like a *very* positive change. 
---
They listen to the pve crowd because the pvp crowd is not vocal enough I think.
---
Yes and no.  I like the idea of studying them and learning a plan that you don't already know.  I'm also ok with having a powerful assault team dispatched to take me out.  I'm not ok with losing the plan if I die.  I mean, where's the barrier for that?  Does the killing blow have to be delivered by the assault team for me to lose the plan?  Or could that common mole rat that just happens to catch me naked half an hour later have the luxury of making me lose it?
---
That aside, as a developer, I wouldn't want to have to deal with the nightmare of coding those special circumstances for removing the plans.
---
At level 15 I felt a bit weak but just kind of grinded until 20. I ran routes through Charleston, did all the quests there (Motherlode, Firebreathers, etc.) as well as starting the Mistress of Mysteries. I'd go from the MoM mansion to the dam and kill all the scorched. Then I'd go to the fire station for lead and scrap. Then to the Capitol Building and take on all the super mutants and collect more junk. Then to the Charleston Herald and adjoining buildings. Then to Wade airport for more muties and scrap. Finally, head back to camp to craft more ammo and deal with inventory. Rinse repeat, making sure to upgrade my weapons as much as possible by scrapping those I picked up and learning the mods.
---
No reason to power level. Do you want to run out of things to do faster? By level 20, Toxic Valley is fairly easy (with a few exceptions). Get to 25 and go get that Excavator armor. All the scrapping/screw farming will help with that. Level 32 now and I'm having fun exploring the Ash Heap. I don't plan to go to the Top of the World to start Rose's quests until I'm level 40. I plan on dying a lot once I do.
---
Ah - yes, I use PA.  My build is melee tank/support, aggro enemies and take hits while my team takes pot shots, so damage resistance is a key part of my build as well.
---
No ots the community its the devs chooce what happens with the game not the community and if people accepted that this isnt their game its bethesdas then we wouldnt have half the issues
---
I said the same thing when I started seeing the dailies. I don't even use alcohol that much, I sure as heck ain't gonna craft that much. But, I got to thinking. I think the reason the brewing patch and the alcohol dailies all linked to the fact that March 17th is St. Patrick's Day
---
Will Dense plans and BoS plans be readded to the vendors now that they're being consolidated down to one location? They were removed inexplicably in patch 5 and it's noted as a bug in the tracked issue thread.
---
No this was on my 100+ character. People say couching hides them? That‚Äôs wack. 
---
The reason its the √≠tem list unique to each vendor, they share the same caps pool, but not √≠tem list, or at least its not stated as such. 
---
Complete quest up to last part on alt-&gt; turn in quest on survival -&gt; hop back to adventure
---
Only use for survival rn for me
---
if you have all of that stuff than the item to you is completely worthless anyways. you might aswell give it away for free.
---
some people like the idea of saving up caps. it is fun. I like to try and get rich when I play fallout games
---
I also wish the camp radius was a square. Buildings are square and it fucks with my OCD lol
---
you still remain friendly with everyone else doing the event, I can confirm
---
If you're facing mole miners at level 16, you're in [the wrong neighborhood](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-fallout-76-map-level-zones-5076), brother. They're in the Ash Heap and Savage Divide, which have enemies level 25-35 and 15-99 respectively. Seek out dailies and events in the Forest (1-15) and Toxic Valley (10-25) until you've leveled up a bit more. 
---
What platform? I haven't been disconnected for quite a while now, even during long sessions(on PC).
---
Yea I agree, the recipe rewards are too repetitive. I want the ones I haven‚Äôt got, not the same ones over and over 
---
As you said, you‚Äôre voicing your opinion on something that won‚Äôt apply to you, by your choice.  It‚Äôs clear you care.
---
It‚Äôs not a mess.  I find Survival mode much more fun than Adventure.
---
I'm not sure that that follows. If I'm reading this right, you should be able to go to any vendor, anywhere, and do 1,400 caps worth of sales. Whether that be Harper's Ferry, Sutton, or Watoga, you know? 
---
this. this this this. 
---
some people don't partake in drinking and can avoid in normal game play up to this point. it was a big part you could entirely avoid or partake once in awhile but now it feels like 24/7 must be drunk. it's very disappointing how glorified it feels.
---
Nah, I don't like it. When building a camp it's like you personally building it from your view point. Trial and error just like it would be.
---
It's my understanding that it does not.  That would make the whole system pointless.  I think it's likely just buggy 
---
no to doubt what you say, but do you have proof? or someone data mined it?
---
I would love to see more data. i would be happy to generate a table for a week of my results for single reward if someone else wants to make it for doing two.
---
To get any good amount of real data we would need around 500 or so samples.
---
some builds are slower to level than others due to damage output.. and build type can significantly slow your roll down.. i was lucky on two characters to have an easy time killing things way above my level first was a shotgun/sniper build pre tse nerf that could steam roll anything with her shotguns.   
---
my second character is currently lvl 90 and only 3 weeks old made her an unarmed melee and was 1 shotting lvl 60 ghouls at level 30 using plain non legendary weapons. i stayed in whitesprings server jumping the golf club for 15 then headed to watoga to finish out 45-50. using melee i would go in the side door, ring the can charms and fight things in the doorway so they couldnt surround me. 
---
my 3rd i am heading towards a vats pistol build, and shes 16 i think, but her damage output is alot lower than the other two were so i am having to move slower, plan engagements more, and keep escape routes in mind to back pedal if things got too tough.   
---
ive had to pay more attention to where i farm and areas i farm in. by the route plan bethesda has suggested you should be up in grafton area, maybe heading towards the ash heap if youre lucky enough to find it with lvl 14 mole miners.  i cant really offer suggestions since you dont really give details on what your build is or where you currently are, other than im 16 and i cant kill. are you 16 in grafton? 16 in ash heap? 16 in savage divide? 16 in watoga? what guns are you using? rifle/shotgun/pistol/heavy?  
---
you have to keep in mind that even though most areas are supposed to change mobs to match your levels, if a higher lvl had been through there prior to you, you going to whitesprings at 16 which would have been fine during beta means ya more than likely gonna find lvl 60 ghouls now and its not fine for a lvl 16 to be there now. but 76 does have a suggested area for certain levels and if your way out of bounds in higher level areas your gonna get alot of beat downs and not going to see much damage being done to enemies your fighting.   
---
I think there was an official Bethesda comment not long after release that they were looking at a guild system, but it didn't end up making the 2019 roadmap. Some of the features on the tail end are pretty vague though, so I suppose it's possible it wasn't dropped, just that it got a catchy feature name.
---
Yeah, that's it--they're dead permanently. I got really attached to my first and then some asshole blew him away with a TSE before I could say anything. Killed him just as fast, the fucker.
---
I used to live on the Whitespring golf course but I ended up moving to find somewhere safer and with much less traffic. Now my sloth lives in peace with his brahmin buddy.
---
I don‚Äôt wanna do your work for you but have a look at the strength perks. And max out strength as soon as you can. I personally don‚Äôt use melee but I know there are perks that increase damage, armour penetration, cripple chance, and stagger. All of these are good things to aim for. There‚Äôs also some perks somewhere that increase your Defense stats. And perks that make power armour more viable. Which is a great thing to wear for melee. Also, don‚Äôt forget to use your power attacks!!!!
---
Most likely but it needs to stop
---
If you're looking for T-51b a high levels, just check the 4 spawn points in Watoga and then travel to the firebases and forward stations scattered around the area. If you don't complete a full set just server hop a couple times. 
---
It took me less than an hour to gather a full set for my buddy, and the only reason it took that long was because one of the firebases was home to a level 80 and 2 level 65 scorchbeasts.
---
Yep
---
Yes it's in the games files themselves. I'm a dataminer. I'll post a picture of the conditions when I get back to my computer 
---
just like real life. I hope people are paying attention.
---
I'm gonna go grab my flamer stay right where you are.
---
Rose sent me into that neighborhood üò¨. But thanks for thelp man!
---
never said he was a cheater. Just said its no skill to kill people with those weapons up close lying in wait, especially when it is one of the weapons that gets the most insane damage boosts from the legendary effects. (due to explosive rounds overlapping with each other and stuff like this which makes the dmg scale crazy)
---
Its the same with those bloodied deathclaw gauntlet builds. If you brag about being able to kill people with these builds, thats nothing special. Its the same as bragging about being faster than a tractor with a sports car.
---
cap limits should and will most likely be raised in time. I would say, slowly increase it over time, then in about 1 or 2 years make it infinite. 
---
Again, what‚Äôs the point to that? 
---
You need to kill monsters and complete quests/events to level up, I'm not sure how it can be done faster. Sleep in a bed periodically to get bonus to experience points. Don't worry about the numbers or hours exactly. I'm level 120 with 300 hours. I have no idea if that is fast or slow. All that matters is having some fun out there.
---
If you are dying a lot then maybe load up on healing and change to a more cautious play style where you attack from a distance or draw out only one or two enemies at a time. It can be deadly to rush in and draw fire from 10 enemies at once.
---
I'm sitting on about 60 of those.  I should really change that.
---
I see. Sorry I don't have any 1 or 2 handed advice. I have not tried that yet.
---
Thanks for the info....now to work out where to find the recon sensor mod
---
They brought out a separate PVP mode because they listened to PVE players?
---
I guess so. I think a bigger problem is the map pips that pinpoint a marked player‚Äôs location; they should really be located in a fairly broad area, so there‚Äôs a bit more effort and perseverance involved for players that want to hunt them down.
---
Brilliant. Loved the ending. Had [this scene](https://youtu.be/0Ae6B7C05Nk) in my head as you described it.
---
I am rich
---
If you want to get rid of that armor let me know
---
I wonder where the new vendors in Whitesprings will be located. I hope they open up one of the previously-locked rooms and turn it into sort of a bazaar. 
---
ok add me at psn: frankwoods012
---
Most new players coming out of the vault that I‚Äôve run into are players on their second or third play through and they don‚Äôt even want help half the time... 
---
&gt; Or could that common mole rat that just happens to catch me naked half an hour later have the luxury of making me lose it?
---
It would basically be like starting an event. Defeat the assault team, you keep the plan. Die before they're defeated, you lose the plan.
---
BRUHHHHH these past couple of days had me dying reading all of these posts..i cant
---
Because you'd have to do facial animations and instancing which Beth clearly didn't want to pay for. 
---
It literally says on the road map Vault Raids. Why would anyone think it was A Battle Royale??
---
Correct. But u r acting like pvp mode is working as intended. Which it is not. üòÇüòÇ
---
It‚Äôs a cheap way to get a kill... it prevents trading, teaming up against one another, etc. there‚Äôs so much more than just PVP. There could be group PVP and more cosplay stuff. I mean it really prevents actual gameplay to have that mentality. 
---
Agreed, exact location is a bit rough.
---
Now that's a good solution. I like it. Also, please never throw out steel. I could use like 7000 so...
---
So the plan would be a guaranteed drop from the strongest member of the assault team.
---
This morning I finally got my dream weapon built: chainsaw with flame mod. Utterly useless except for show; it sits in my stash box next to my alien blaster. Maybe next fasnacht I'll use them for harvesting squirrel intestines.
---
Nice shots. I see you flexing in all that nice power armor
---
They even hinted in the trailers that your physical form would be different, but alas it was a lie
---
as far as the pvp side, your 16 your not goin to 1 shot anyone there, or prolly kill anyone unless they are afk..   
---
you still wanna go pvp at 16, take grenades, and take land mines, use them liberally.. youll get lucky, could also make a moveable camp, put up and artillery gun, find their houses move camp close, sneak in, drop a artillery smoke signal, and wait for fireworks.
---
Helps kill. Bloodied builds have less than 40% hp but have other damag mitigation. So the likelyhood is that you can actually get more than one shot on them before they die and thus executioner's is a great counter to anyone confident while running around at 20% hp.
---
No. It would just be awarded to you, like an event.
---
Phoenix has almost all of the plans, and I bought the actual mod for like 300 caps at the Watoga train station, so those are your best bets.
---
Im currently a 1 handed/rifle build. Didnt put much thought into and would like to do some sort of melee build but i get overwelmed pretty easy. Im toxic valley.
---
First thing is, could someone please provide a link to the debuff at zero caps on the survival server?
---
I understand that there is a debuff in adventure land if you **murder** someone and become wanted and cannot pay the fine, but there is no **murder** in Survival mode. How exactly does *that* work? 
---
Maybe, when you get killed, you need to put a bounty on someone and *that* will give them the debuff, if they have zero caps? Of course, that means you have to spend YOUR caps on them (200c  min), and more than likely their team mate will kill them and collect the caps.
---
I believe there can be a purpose for the zero cap PVP'er. If nothing else, bait. 
---
depending on the above information: I suggest increasing the debuff on PVP damage at zero caps. So the chance of getting killed by a zero cap player is greatly decreased. Or if it is based on murder/wanted status, remove that so it applies regardless of the wanted status.
---
This is no proof i reinstalled on Wednesday. I already said you aren't having my junk from my stash. Just leave me alone. If you're so bothered about your junk, as chrissy but otherwise piss off
---
OP something similar happened in my game. I'm a solo player, have 600+ hours. Done all of the quests, spend my time farming legendaries to sell. Go where I want, camp where I want.
---
But around the 50, maybe 100 hour mark I was considering starting over. All of my gear was broken, completely out of ammo, no food or water... Hell even my camp was just a tent with all the work benches.
---
Until I realized that this is an open world game that lets you go wherever you want. So I went back. Back all the way to the beginning. I began to go back to low level enemies, hopping for my junk needed to repair, farming for my ammo, grinding the vendors for my caps. It added a lot of time to the game honestly, but it is very possible to play yourself into a hole. Good thing is the game gives you the means to get out of it.
---
Take the workshops in the forest region. Don‚Äôt worry about building them up unless you want a specific resource they have. 
---
You get XP for taking them, then almost immediately a defend event comes up that gives you XP. After that you‚Äôll get another roughly every hour. While the enemies are low level, you can get big waves of them. Between that and the few hundred XP from the events themselves, you‚Äôll get quite a bit. 
---
Plus you get random plans, scraps and aid items by doing this‚Äîand the free fast travel points. 
---
If another player attempts to take them over, let them‚Äîor just jump servers. There‚Äôs no point in PvP at low levels (or high ones imho). 
---
Also don‚Äôt forget to sleep in a bed to get the well rested XP bonus. It adds up. 
---
Nah you're not.  I'm 300 hours in and still "find"new cards I overlooked
---
I feel like the time spent leaving syrvival, joining adventure, fast traveling, leaving adventure, and rejoining survival, could just as easily be spent walking to your destination. Costs less money, entails less waiting around, and gives you an opportunity to see random encounters and other cool things you might have missed 
---
I found that if you just play the game like normal, sooner or later, other players will find you. 
---
Instigating is love. Instigating is life. 
---
For me it will be 45 marine tactical helmets every morning! 
---
Let us select to disable limb selection in vats with concentrated fire. In pvp I don't ever wanna aim for the arms or legs. But with  console controllers and the way concentrated fire perk works with it all over the place during a fight with players.
---
I've received 1 outfit (brotherhood scribe) from turning in technical data since beta. it's worth trying when you find one, if you want the outfits or paint jobs bad enough.
---
I have players try to give my mini account gifts all the time and there‚Äôs no way to tell them my main is lvl 200 lol 
---
I hadn't even finished the main story at 100 hours. It's easy to get lost in the game the first time. Besides going afk
---
I've [said it before](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/b3qh7l/everything_is_to_high_level/ej1v3mn/), I'll say it again. Don't listen to that psycho. She's trying to get you killed. 
---
That's cool. Now leave me alone 
---
I mean they are easy mode but still counterable 
---
You sound like the person he killed probably üòÜ
---
Not when it wont let you spawn anywhere else soemtimes.
---
I love the tears from the people who enter survival mode unprepared. Thanks for all the aid and chem suckers!
---
So pretty much im doing ok i just need to grind a little more? Thats a little encouraging thank you
---
Christ almighty, that's a fantastic idea. Whitesprings bots with 100% armor penetration, 100% accuracy, and 0%tolerance for bullshit. Maybe make the building itself the "safe zone" so you get shenanigans like John Wick 2. 
---
Maybe add a sort of clandestine DIA club for "contractors" that deal in death that is only accessible past one of the hand scanners like at fort defiance after you've killed a certain number of players or completed an assassin themes quest. 
---
"So much room for activities!"
---
Someday for me. Someday....
---
Cool. Thanks!
---
You get a bit more exp at least. 
---
I assumed it would be a more difficult PvE mode. You‚Äôve got your vanilla experience in adventure mode, your PvP chaos in Survival, and your hardcore resource management in Nuclear Winter 
---
The main quest will push you toward it eventually. 
---
So, having a legitimate opinion based on experience is trolling?
---
You're funny, fuckboi.
---
I do enjoy the photo mode :) 
---
&gt;The modifiers are a little underwhelming, aren't they?
---
A bit, but that could be a good choice for an opening volley against larger enemies like mirelurk queens. One of those to the face ought to be enough to cripple her spitters, or shoot one at the ground in front of her and cripple the legs.
---
And if they do add a gift emote, make it reasonably priced
---
I never bothered personally, as I enjoy the early game and eventual progression is limited by caps rather than level. The old method was to get a PA frame (preferably with some level 15 raider on it, but even the frame is 60 DR) and run around areas with a high enemy density, smacking them with whatever melee weapons you picked up. This doesn't work so well now because the frames only come with 25% cores.
---
Workshops do still have a decent XP return for low levels, but it's risky. Otherwise you can pick target areas with enemies that are relatively easy to kill with your build and grind those, although you won't have much of a build at level 16.
---
Did you not read my previous comment?Or did you read it yet chose not to respond?
---
Thats cool thief. I wouldnt expect a thief to return what you stole. Youre a thief! Lol. Youre still a crap player and not matter what you steal you still suck at this game. Learn mutations. Look forward to seeing me more! 
---
Thanks for the help! Definitely going to make use of that card because of you.
---
I thought the same thing after awhile. I don't use a lot of alcohol, I sure as heck ain't gonna make a lot of it either. But I got to thinking. I think the brewing patch came out this month cause of St. Patrick's Day being in March. I also think that's why there's been so many of the alchol dailies. So, I'm hoping once March is over, they'll stop, or at least hopefully not as many.
---
Wow what time zone n country you in? 
---
You make it sound like a multimillion company had no interest in making a game that's a commercial success and instead was trying to create art for a small minority. If you want to believe that go ahead, but the fact remains that this game was and still is a commercial failure.  Trying to stifle other people's opinions of it through downvotes and sticking your fingers in your ears doesn't negate all the people who have this listed as the worse game in the franchise. I'm not saying it's bad myself, I kind of like it to be honest. But I recognize that most people don't, and the complaints most people have are my complaints as well. I buy a game because I want to enjoy the game. I don't want to buy a game to be a beta tester, which by all accounts of the definition, this game is still in beta. I made the analogy earlier, imagine walking into a store, buying a board game for $20, taking it home and opening it to see a cardboard square with fancy artwork, spaces around the edges, and a few plastic pawns. Then everyone playing the boardgame has to submit feedback to tell the company what upgrades they want. Do you want dice or a spinner? Do you want cards added? Should spaces on the board be nerfed and replaced with new spaces? Most people would be furious to pay $20 for that. I personally love the fallout series and this was the first time I was mildly disappointed in a fallout game. Saying I shouldn't be because of an E3 conference I didn't watch is not my fault. I'm reminded of "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" when the workmen are about to tear down the main character's house, and say "I don't know why you're so upset, the plans have been on display downtown, in a locked room in the basement."
---
Ahh.  I could see that working.
---
Damn it. I even knew that this would work, and yet I still scroll endlessly when trading. Why did I never put those two together?
---
Just one problem with your response.... this has been the case since way before survival. This is the case across the board. 
---
Australia lol (AEST)
---
Thanks for the tip! A lot of people been telling me to grind low level areas. Im going to try that
---
all ghouls are feral. Some just try hiding it by speaking. Just remember the only good ghoul is a dead ghoul. 
---
Yeah some things need adjusting, I agree with that
---
Fair point
---
Cool buddy. How's trying to get me banned at Bethesda going? 
---
I did too for the longest time, I was always curious if it was somebody I "knew" from the vault.
---
I've gotten a 2* and a 3* piece from one 3* legendary 
---
Honestly, you should probably do what my brother is doing and come back in the fall. They'll have fresh content by then and hopefully hit their stride as a developer. The only thing you'd be missing out on is workshop content, which frankly isn't worth it because it's cooler to show off rare in game cosmetics than *Bethesbucks* based attire. 
---
Honestly I just drop all non quest notes because they annoy me. In any other fallout game I‚Äôd have one stash box specific to notes but you can‚Äôt do that here. 
---
I would love to see this become a thing personally.
---
Do i work for bethesda? How do i have control over that? Jeez your really keep proving how smart you areü§£ü§î
---
You get nothing extra for turning in 3 compared to 2
---
Oh dang, now I'll have an even greater reason to explore the ass-end of Appalachia for unique places to camp! I've always been concerned about the cost of pioneering, but this will make things much easier and cheaper.
---
You are completely wrong about how many caps it takes from you. It had nothing at all to do with how many caos you have, it takes the same number of caps as your current lvl. Example: I'd you are lvl 205 then you lose 205 caps except in survival where this doubles do you would then lose 410.
---
This guy want bragging about killing with a shotgun though. He was bragging about leaving the guy into a perfect situation for his shotgun to do maximum damage. You miss the point of the post. 
---
Hahah, how did my level 3 terminal hacking cards not save me!
---
Did you comment get blocked by marketron bot? I didn't saw any comment there. may be some contain inappropriate word.
---
Yes I was agreeing with you. You get a little more experience for two instead of one. 
---
I don‚Äôt generally play PVP and I agree with you.  Super annoying that people think they should be badass without any effort. Possibly these are people that have become accustomed to crying as a solution to life‚Äôs hard issues. 
---
Well yeah, if I didn‚Äôt have work in the morning I would‚Äôve had a story: I was 3rd on the leaderboard right as I was going to log off so was definitely about to be hunted. There were kill notices going off every minute or less so I was on a very active server.
---
Lol the build you described is mine üòÇüòÇüòÇ but to be fair I don‚Äôt mess with pvp and have been looking at a stealth build for pvp. 
---
Also more caps and a better chance at the rarer stuff
---
Keep it. You suck at this game. You need all the help you can get
---
well since i dont play survival but am happy with my pacifist mode, that wont be the case buddy.
---
Survival has nothing to do with skill at this point, it's just people watching all spawnpoints on the map and killing people before they even load in.
---
IE lever gun will 1 shot anything from stealth. 
---
I would make TD into a new piece by piece design. 
---
Sure you can add a TD ‚Äúpage‚Äù to the secure storage at the camp. Or you can keep exploring and look for TD that fit the one you have making it complete. Once you have all the pieces you craft the full version and turn that in for a better reward that feels like it‚Äôs covers several turn ins.  
---
Combat shotgun with precise magazine and rank 3 Enforcer perk. (I don't have any fancy legendaries yet)
---
It quickly blows the legs off of anything, so i can finish them off with any weapon of my choosing.
---
How is that?!
---
you don't see the usefulness of that to elongate the life of the game and beyond that it can be used as a reset, the world topside could be anything when we get out of the memory loungers, it could even be full of npcs, or we thought we got out of the sim but are still in one, indefinitely, for as long as they want...
---
I‚Äôm looking for the mod that puts the pip above the player....server hopped a few times and it it the only one that doesn‚Äôt show up to buy.

You and the other 5 people who have dm'd me.

Considering I'm a higher lvl than you that makes no sense...but whatever makes you happy 
---
How much 5mm ammo do you want?

Selling item to a vendor isn't "abusing" the system. Please show an example of a way to "abuse" selling items to vendors.

Those who need a safe place to rest from all the gun fire. I have a fortified building across the pond from Site Alpha. Plenty of crops and water. Well stocked on food and stims. Stop by.
---
 Now on topic: only thing unfun is fast traveling to a train station and getting killed by 4 level 150+ people before my screen fully loads.
---
As much as you got.
---
No argument. But explosive bores me. I‚Äôll take Instigating with anything over it. But instigating is a must have. 
---
I was third too when I played last night, and when I loaded in this morning I was #1, so I think I must've loaded into the same server as before. 
---
I think it should just be capped at somewhere between 50-75
---
Melee needs no buffs or extra benefits because of how overpowered it is, ide suggest Bethesda Austin could Nerf melee and then add drinks that give buffs then all weapon builds would be fair.
---
Jesus, that was messed up. Reminds me of Vault 3. 
---
  When I first started, I didn't know what "legendary" weapon/armor was, so I was not concerned with that paritcular issue, and by and large, it hasn't really mattered.
---
  For example, when I got L15 perfect storm, I toyed with it, but I already had other weapons that were more effective, so I rarely used it.
---
I don't remember where I got L10 trail warden 1\*, but again, its usage was short, because the non legendary cloaking chest piece suited me better.
---
As I've progresses (L49 now) I've learned about legendaries.
---
  Even so, most of what I've picked up in WS, I've sold off b/c it doesn't suit either my needs or my build, or both.  
---
Notable exception is the L15 vampire machete - its my goto in PA, especially in a nuke zone.  out of PA, I still like the non-legendary L35 death tambo.
---
OTOH, I did keep a 1\* rifle I got from the sloth at the end of the parade, and bought another 1\* from the vendor @ the nearby train station.
---
That said, I'm currently just getting into the center/eastern side of the divide, and the machete is starting to show its age ... but I'm sure I'll pick up better stuff before long :)
---
That stays there constantly as long as the reactor is repaired bc it needs to vent and all. Just a game mechanic. 
---
There shouldn‚Äôt be anything you need in there, is there?
---
Nukashine travel.
---
A whole Donkey?
---
that's a fact, Cotton...
---
Hey man, different tools haha, I have nothing against a QOL build if that‚Äôs what you need for your playstyle, just don‚Äôt get why people don‚Äôt grasp that this won‚Äôt work in a fight against someone who‚Äôs species for pvp haha
---
Where is this note referencing Underworld? Always thought Underworld was more of a recent settlement in FO3 so its interesting if it dates back that far. 
---
That doesn't look like the Chinese Stealth Suit.
---
I'll save the rest of you the time, I'm not selling it trading it. 
---
I‚Äôve heard a lot of conflicting stuff about that. You said it‚Äôs in the data, what specifically is in the data?
---
Inside safe zone and outside the grounds is weapons free? I like that.
---
But yes, that is exactly how I see the security force: 100% lethal. No escape.
---
Lol. You use petty con tricks to steal your way through the game. Why am i lover level and have all the mutation plans? Why dont you have them??.... its because you suck! Lol the simple fact that you have no idea how to stack mutations correctly cracks me up. Why would you steal shit that you have no idea how to use? 
---
I completely agree with you on this, this needs to stop. The period of invulnerability need extending or looking at for sure.
---
Any suggestions? Just let the trade happen. The only items that can be painted but not tradeable are from the atomic shop, and those don‚Äôt even show up in the trade window, just like how legendary gear doesn‚Äôt show in the scrap menu. So even if people wanted to ‚Äúscam‚Äù say, a blackbird set of PA, they couldn‚Äôt. The game doesn‚Äôt allow it to happen. 
---
I‚Äôll be perfectly honest with you in my opinion on your method. It sounds just as scratchy as the scams on Steam where a ‚ÄúSteam admin‚Äù says your account will be banned for dupes and the only way to not get banned is give them all your unusuals and australiums (in the case of TF2) to check that they‚Äôre legit. That‚Äôs, honestly, how bad your method sounds. 
---
Ahh. I feel like given how rare they are, I could understand someone not understanding it's owned and just killing it. That's more what I'm afraid of. Thanks for the advice though.
---
I assume your budget comes back once they die?
---
You know, I'm kind of glad that survival mode was implemented: all the tryhards will spend all of their time there instead of clogging the adventure servers and all of the really cool players. :D
---
I didn't mean to say it should be long tetm solution, only that right now fast travel is dangerous. 
---
They need to increase invincibility time, or make a safe zone where people can respawn and not get killed. 
---
Tesla rifles for me specifically, fast fire rate weapons with stagger and situational awareness. High perception.
---
It is a menu setting that you can turn on so you can't accidentally attack, damage, or kill other players, and they can't kill you either. It is so you can play the game against the monsters and don't have to worry about fighting other players.  
---
The only exception is if you take over a workshop, in which case you are always vulnerable to any attack, so if you want to use workshops you may want to turn off Pacifist mode so you can at least fight back, but you can then turn it on again when you are finished with the workshop.
---
Just to be clear, I'm talking about things in Adventure game mode and not in Survival beta game mode. Survival mode is PvP focused so you can't use Pacifist to be safe from other players and you will lose caps and aid items every time another player kills you. Right now it seems to be very risky due to design problems, and it may not be a good place for anyone but very high level players.
---
You know, I'm kind of glad that survival mode was implemented: all the tryhards will spend all of their time there instead of clogging the adventure servers and all of the really casual players. :D
---
I believe what you have suggested is a great idea as well.
---
Any pump action feels great.
---
I just dump a bunch of stuff into the overseer's cache in Flatwoods anytime I'm there. 
---
I loved that vault. It made me hate raiders even more!
---
That is interesting! I will see if my time from last night carries over instead of restarting. That will change things.
---
That‚Äôs what we want 
---
1st you CAN already make 7k a day from vendors. 
---
2nd the vendors already serve little to no purpose what so ever for end game players anyway because they dont sell anything worth having in the late game. 
---
3rd. Caps will always be needed for fast travel, claiming workshops, paying bounties, setting bounties, buying aid, and yes player trades.
---
It should show up as "Power Armor Chasis" (it won't be labelled). It should also weigh 0 pounds until you deploy it for the first time. 
---
Judging by the downdoots I guess you all have not looked at the leader board for kills in many servers
---
My loot lol
---
That weapon is no where near A-tier
---
Youre like the idiot that steals a safe and its smart enough to crack it open one he gets it homeü§£ü§£
---
OK buddy that's nice i play the game how i want to and you play the game how you want 
---
I think this is a great idea. Means ppl still have to "hunt" u down
---
Awe hell no
---
u/Valseek will the overly high spoilage rate (that happened with Patch 7) be addressed soon?
---
Exactly haha win/win. I don‚Äôt think someone is necessarily a try hard for having good gear and enjoying the game enough to play a lot though. 
---
U can say the seat doesn't adjust and CD player not working arent a huge deal but to some people it might be a deal breaker. I'm lucky in that 120 bucks won't break my bank, so I'm just pissed and won't preorder anything from them again. However there are tons of people who can only afford a handle of games a year that it would be a massive deal to trust a franchise and get burned like this. It will be better later doesnt help when you pay the money now. Especially since the last few years have had some top notch games more worth someones time and money. I keep an eye on this game hoping something pulls me back in but in the meantime they just announced borderlands 3.
---
I couldn't find them in Morgantown High School, but apparently Candem Park's Vendor does sell them too. 
---
This means Whitesprings Vendors will pretty much be a player hub! 
---
I would love to see the answers to these questions
---
Maybe add a slight glow effect that shows un-looted bodies? That would help.
---
Previewing weapons and armor during trading should be fixed, or else people are going to be scamming by renaming weapons and trying to trade them.
---
A 2 star rifle called Anti Armor Hunting Rifle could be some shitty 2 star hunting rifle instead, and you wouldn't know until you buy it
---
I am of the mindset that the Whitespring should be free of 'hostility and business' similar to the Continental. In my eyes, it's the one thing that F076 is missing.
---
I think I've been playing too much ...I read your comment as:
---
 "Just stop the camps springing up. Don't mind the **Nuka** zone - it's the only one that is centrally located."
---
I don't do melee. More of a pick 'em off from a distance when I can, so can't speak to that, but yeah, leveling feels pretty slow for me because I make sure I'm at a point where I'm probably going to be more powerful than what I'm facing. Charleston had level 5-14 depending on my level. I'm not going to be getting huge amounts of XP killing at 15 taking on level 5s, nor at 30 taking on 14s but that's okay. I want to play the game to get the most out of it that I can. If/when I feel like there's nothing more for me to do, I'll just put the game down permanently. Why would I want to rush to the end?
---
Not at all. Even during the height of suping when many players had 25k on every character due to nuke cola and there was more wealth than ever in existence prices stayed fairly constant on everything. Do you have a counter example where an influx of caps made them "useless" in player trades? 
---
100% agree. I tend to drop the items and shoot the bag. Some see it some run
---
I just know there's going to be a hard character limit, but I've always wanted to name my handmade rifle 'rooty-tooty point-and-shooty'. Or, once I find a good legendary laser rifle, name it 'pew pew tew'; an even better one will be called 'pew pew thwee'. 
---
Pics are in atom shop.
---
I can get with this, I'm diggin survival right now for sure. Jus the open pvp and more loot gain/loss has been amazing!!!  Sadly we may be alone here as alot of posts about survival is that it's too harsh already... some ppl dont get open pvp and looting. I wish we could fully loot corpses of all gear aid and ammo..
---
Oooohhh...yeah you might as well go farm more. Even in my PA I barely survive running through that.
---
I wanna name my board "Fuckstick" but i doubt it will let me :(
---
That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that if 2 players are on completely equal playing grounds then why should one have to pay more than the other? 
---
Not even for Addictol?
---
Agree. Survival time and kills would be better. 
---
"The name you enter will be displayed in place of the item‚Äôs default name in your inventory. You can rename items as many times as you like, but your custom names will not transfer with the item when viewed by, or transferred to, another player."
---
üòÇüòÇ Thanks for the smile ü§ò
---
we need tactical combat emotes, for those w/o a mic, dancing emotes, and just better emotes all around, i really dont like the icon that pops up over players heads, total immersion. 
---
I‚Äôve been testing this. It seems that select descriptions on mobs over ride their legendary status. 
---
The best example I saw was last night. Took a trip into the golf club and downed a wendigo. The chap was a diseased scorched glowing wendigo. Based on that title the disease was greater than the other titles despite being a 3 Star.  
---
They ended up dropping the boss loot as per the golf club. And dropping a executioner‚Äôs lead pipe followed by a 3 Star armour piece.  Including the glowing meat and standard glowing mob loot. 
---
I got yelled at quite often in the parade event. Gary likes funny face. When it was over, Gary sad. Gary find new friends, make them have funny face with rolling pin.
---
Even with my camp on or next to a stream it‚Äôs time consuming. Lol. 
---
I also run around the forest gathering wood, blood leaf and soot flowers for heals. Always hit the wood pile in Helvetia. 
---
The problem is I‚Äôm more addicted to making whiskey than drinking it.  I loot the fields behind Billings and Silva homesteads and with green thumb that‚Äôs 100 some corn and well over 100 razorgrain. 
---
I just wish super duper worked on it, so then I could try and figure out what in my stash needs to go to make room for gallons &amp; gallons of whiskey. 
---
Ah I see thank you
---
No server hopping? I have 11/25 now but I've been hopping
---
Thanks ü§ò
---
I love that! Thank you for sharing this!
---
The amount that needs to be crafted is ridiculous. As well as the drinking dailies
---
This is one area where Bethesda could really learn a lot from RockStar. Invite Only Sessions. Solo Sessions. 
---
I realize that I‚Äôm sure this is not possible due to the engine and server setup that Bethesda utilizes versus GTAO, but being that even Todd Howard said ‚Äúof course you can play it solo‚Äù, why not allow us to play it solo in private lobbies? 
---
The "point" of raising the 25k limit is because you should be able to keep what you earn. No reason not to.
---
Watoga is best to see this happen. On a good day all the bots there are legendary. They may not show it. But they drop legendary items like candy. 
---
There's an empty green antifreeze bottle on the off ramp I take. It drives me nuts. LOL
---
As a thief that has no idea how to play... omg what a good plan!! 
---
What you said makes no sense. you keep saying "they cant this" but they DID. And the comparison you made is nonsense and foolish.
---
I‚Äôm a 327 an play with a 450 and have played with a 515. Why does Bethesda hate high levels?!? 
---
Wanted level in survival is essential for any high level 
---
Did you see the post?
---
&gt;The name you enter will be displayed in place of the item‚Äôs default name in your inventory. You can rename items as many times as you like, but your custom names will not transfer with the item when viewed by, or transferred to, another player.
---
This please Bethesda.
---
So you wanna look like Rodan?
---
But with a pouch 
---
Well the post was a bit tonguing in cheek.  I've run 300 levels in Whitesprings and when I can't take it anymore, I'll do a quest and really relish it to the max. Building is my favourite part, but let's be honest - its for masochists. Some dwellers here can't have a discussion and choose to dow nvote without comment, but that's widespread among redditors anyway. So, thanx for replying. Good hunting.
---
Ain't no nukashine age restrictions in post-war Appalachia! I'm glad your first interaction with other players was excellent, that's why I love this game. I mean, come on, we're all fellow vault dwellers from 76!
---
Not true. When nuka Cole was being duped and tons of people had 25k on all characters the prices of things still stayed fairly contant in player trading. Do you have a counter example that shows an influx of caps making thing cost more in player trading? 
---
I had this quest with fresh beer, maybe a week ago. I'm a stealth sniper build. I crafted 14 beers and went around one shotting things on multiple servers across 2 days and finally found a beer 'in the wild' and it worked with that first shot. I'm thinking on the beers for sure they have to be found, not crafted.
---
I had 12 technical data and I dropped them thinking it was a bugged item.
---
Turrets are getting upgraded, but... every time I log in all my turrets disappear. I've replaced my rocket turrets dozens of times, to the point I've literally given up trying to have turrets.
---
Are there are any fixes for the great disappearing turret bug?
---
you can only put the large water purifier in water :)
---
PC for me, i guess its the same for all!
---
Everyone will probably have their camp there now, 
---
reload to find another server...
---
I left there long ago, but I'm not too far away, this change is still extremely convenient and appreciated.
---
I do this about 3 times a week. Full pastors getup and the hat. Last time made little kid happier than fly eating poo. 
---
I'll be on about 1700 eastern time and check then. Thanks
---
PC, i guess its somewhat my connection too, but i got a comment where someoen also gets this quite often on ps4
---
most likely, i use ethernet too, i think its cause of a shit port
---
Nah. Go with Mix Tape. 
---
There are 20 spawns stop picking the same one over and over.
---
I really want to build one of these but I can't not camp on a resource deposit, and I haven't found one yet with a useful deposit close enough to do it.
---
What are they?
---
Looks great!
---
The British Tickler.
---
Why did you keep spawning in lol?? I use my camp to spawn or anywhere but watoga and whitesprings
---
Yeah, we wanted to get rid of slap damage.  Not a whole new server.  
---
Let me max my cash stack a couple times first then I'm all for this idea
---
Ok, of it still takes an hour to get 1000 caps (just an example) but the limit has been raised to 1,000,000 then those caps are still worth an hour of play time. It's just like the real world. I can save as much money as my heart desires and even if we all save up $500,000 we aren't going to give $1000 for a $500 product. The value of the cap and all money for that matter is determined by what it takes to get said money. The point is that just because we can all hold 1,000,000 caps now doesn't mean we will be willing to trade away more of our time for the same product. Je will have to sell for a "fair price" or not sell at all.
---
For real.
---
My poor character has alcohol poisoning...
---
He may not make it through the night unless he gets the caps to pay for treatment or levels up to gain a perk card because we don‚Äôt have healthcare in the wasteland.
---
I‚Äôm starting a petition for free healthcare for all in Appalachia 
---
Thought a few may find it funny.  
---
Gaaarrryyy...
---
I love the shared vendor caps concept, doesn't that make the addition of other faction vendors to Whitesprings redundant though? Unless they will also sell new stuff I guess more the merrier.
---
Is this the questline that will introduce backpacks?
---
Its to learn mods for the backpack isnt it
---
I‚Äôve used ‚Äúno‚Äù then ‚Äúheart‚Äù for a ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù on my lore exploration alt 
---
&gt;Some games incorperate some of these mechanics, but no game incorperates all these mechanics in a single game on a server with 24 other people.
---
That is correct as far as I'm aware. So I pick one of those mechanics and play a similar game that does it better. Fo76 wouldn't be my go too for any of those.
---
I got disconnected twice on Xbox this morning within about 20 minutes. Very frustrating.
---
Yeah but you're also advocating for more available caps at vendors *per day*. If you raise all the available caps and the available cap limit, you will get inflation. It's logical economics 101, dude. 
---
Except that there are tons of counter to it....
---
Gamma gun, radium rifle, plasma grenades, gatling plasma, all bloodied weapons, critical builds, ect...
---
They got scorched?
---
Pics are in the Atomic Shop. Be careful to not accidentally buy it when previewing it.
---
Stuck at 25k
---
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/20/venezuela-bolivars-hyperinflation-banknotes
---
Also PA gives 100 carry weight (or at least excavator does) so that might be it.
---
Haha well you got rid of slap damage tbf
---
I love this, and doesn't seem too hard to impliment with little repurcussions. 
---
You're more understanding than I am. The person absolutely did it on purpose, that much I can say.
---
I love the idea of rare trophies from creature kills that could place a minor permanent boost, lower than a magazine boost and certainly lower than a bobblehead, but for lesser skills you wouldn't immediately think about. Like, +1% health regen on a timed block, +5% faster walk/run speed out of combat, -5% food and water loss in clear weather, +5% additional production in ammunition crafting, or +1% chance to harvest double ore (x4 if in excavator). Makes me think of all of the prefixes in Diablo!
---
I see your point but me and thousands of other gamers have been trying to hammer the point home that you should NEVER preorder any games. It incentivizes developers to release an unfinished product.
---
They used to happen all the time, but at this point I don't think I've had an actual "Disconnected from server" issue in weeks. The only issue I've had recently is getting stuck in the crafting animation after trying to exit a workbench. Nothing seems to fix it other than exiting the game and restarting.
---
What does that have to do with the fact that you can be staggered?  
---
I'm not a thief. It's a god damn game and says something about sad you are still caring over a few mutations a week later. Get a life 
---
Yeah, blocked my first player last weekend after he blew up the workshop me and my friends were using and then followed us to our camps 
---
I like the leader board for the pvp incentive so that's where I disagree but safe zones at vendors and random spawn points will help a bit as well. I've lost and made alot in survival so far and I'm havin a blast!!
---
My alt is now ready to enter Survival suitably attired.  
---
For the love of Atom, do it. I'd rather burn all of my ammo in a running gun battle than get constantly one-shotted at spawn points (instantly, that 30s timer isn't working) before I've even loaded in.
---
They‚Äôve got the robots depth available from FO4 assets so shouldn‚Äôt be too challenging. I used to use the terminal to turn off gravity in FO4 to build vertically but always wanted a sort of close/top down view 
---
My Ulcite PA definitely doesn't. Lol. But I never noticed when I created the Excavator. Might have to pull it out again. Thanks!
---
Try ‚Äúno‚Äù followed by ‚Äúheart‚Äù, that usually works for me
---
Same man. I‚Äôm playing a commando build now and it‚Äôs hard to leave my lead node for the bullets. 
---
You are a pretty pretentious guy huh? The game was definitely NOT designed for the fast travel points to be spawn camped and have you killed before you even load in. The specifically tried not have this happen by giving you "temporary invulnerability" when spewing but ot doesn't work right at the moment. Shy dont you love along if you aren't smart enough to recognize this as a problem and think it makes you "cool" or something to go around calling people care bares like some kindif 1980s football jock from a shitty romcom.
---
My buddies started doing it at least once a play session, so far no ones gotten mad
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad or discouraged about your current state and experience in the game up to this point.  Don‚Äôt compare yourself to others either.  I‚Äôve been in the game since day 1 and I‚Äôm only a level 31, barely scraping by every day.  I‚Äôm probably playing the game ‚Äúvery wrong‚Äù or whatever, but I‚Äôve picked up some great tips here that help helped me at least stay alive and not be scrambling constantly.  
---
I‚Äôm just playing at my own pace and staying in the forest, sometimes going around the edge to see whats up and if I can venture further.  Server hopping is the most annoying thing about the game when it runs decently, but basically a necessity due to the game constantly adjusting to the level 4000 players everywhere.  Don‚Äôt bother with survival.  Just don‚Äôt ever.  Let others fill those servers up. 
---
I don‚Äôt know much, but I‚Äôd be happy to help in any way I can.  I play on pc.  As a West Virginian, it‚Äôs my duty help every other visiting mountaineer ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Thanks you! Nice to see we are being listened to.
---
Yeah, I'm a bit rude to bash on someone's preferred play style. I guess I mean with the addition of no slap damage, I can focus on the part of Fallout I prefer: PvE and cooperation. Not to say that can't happen in Survival, but I am more likely to get my head blown off and my caps and stimpacks stolen just for playing longer than anyone else on the server. Now there's a REAL reason to server hop.
---
Yup I agree with you! 
---
Datamining
---
I love my blackbird. I got quite a few messages about it while doing the parade lol. 
---
Exactly, this is how the game should be.  Slap damage was ruining the game.
---
Excomunicado and not welcome at the Whitespring... talk about a major Fallout 76 choice to make as a player!
---
Yeah I agree being on the leaderboard is currently pointless. If there was a notable benefit for being high on the board like caps per minute based on your rank then it would be fine, but currently it‚Äôs just a method of pointing out someone who is likely minding their own business.
---
I have an AAE Handmade I wouldn't trade it. Trash mobs be damned, big game and robots fall over fast. The difference between tse and aae is minimal when factoring enemy armor Vs raw output. 
---
Percentages from the same effect source do add.  So 5 pieces of Assassin armor is a 40% total damage reduction from players.  5 pieces of Sentinel would be 75% total damage reduction while standing still.  2 different pieces of Acrobatics would be 100% total falling damage reduction.  And as far as perks go, differenty ranked perks of the same type stack additively in the same way; so Gladiator 3 + Expert Gladiator 1 + Master Gladiator 2 would be a total damage increase of 45%.
---
Different effect soutces are compounded.  So if you have AA &amp; Incisor and are attacking a mob/player with 100 DR, that 100 will be multiplied by 0.25(incisor), then 0.5(AA) for 12(rounded down) DR.  For % reductions of Assassin/Sentinel, assuming a 5 piece set, incoming damage from players would be reduced by 40%(0.6 multiplier), then 75%(0.25).  With % damage increases the above Gladiator example + Twisted Muscle would be calculated as Base Damage \* 1.45 \* 1.5, not counting STR for simplicity sakes.
---
I'm unsure exactly how Dense + Fireproof works, but it's completely because I'm unsure how Dense works; I'm unsure if it's a stupidly high % reduction, or if it's a medium flat reduction based on a % of max incoming damage(before other reductions, but applied afterwards, since it wouldn't have the effect it does otherwise).
---
*couldnt care less
---
The tip I  have been waiting for!
---
You're not wrong. I should know that but sometimes the hype gets the better of me. That being said if a car dealer is selling a lemon he's still a liar.
---
heh hope that's true
---
I cannot confirm this yet, so if anyone can, please chime in...
---
In adventure mode, if you are wanted and do not have enough caps to pay the bounty, you have a 50% debuff. 
---
I believe survival works that same, but most people do not run around wanted. Which means they never encounter the debuff for having zero caps. So for them to get the debuff, when they kill you, we have to put a bounty on them, which, I believe, will put on the debuff. But then their team mates typically kill them and collect your bounty.
---
As typing this, I realized that they have to kill you before you can add the bounty, and at that point, they will be carrying your newly acquired caps, so they will not get hit with the debuff (of course that depends on how many they got from you and amount of the bounty)
---
After all the name calling towards anyone who even mentioned griefing in adventure mode, this is funny. The fact that pvp‚Äôers can dish it out but can‚Äôt take it is even funnier. Maybe the players camping at spawn points are just being raiders and taking advantage of intel. üòÇ
---
How is that BS? Of you know the build you are going for then at lvl 70 you absolutely should have the perks you need. Its possible to do it by lvl 50 but I said 70 because that gives a chance to fix 20 mistakes you may have made.
---
The big problem is 90% of TSE and sentinel/cavalier/assassin set users got them as duped items. I am getting close to 500 hours of play time and have gotten only TS or only E. Never both. Most people "got good" by paying for it. Real money or caps or fair trade.
---
The bigger problem is this anti one shot bologna. I build myself to try and counter the meta. That involves one shotting invincible players with a black powder pistol from stealth. Now I need to swap to automatic weapons for sustained burst damage. What seems to be the best for sustained burst damage is TSE...
---
Another concern is how defensive perks feel worthless. This is all anecdotal, but I feel an explosive shotgun should not be putting me at the max damage threshold per shot from long range against fireproof and other percentage damage reduction perks. I swear I went from dying to three explosive shots to two.
---
Why do you have all those? You make them and sell them?
---
I played pvp the last couple nights, and most people I met had no money, I made almost 1000 caps per night after I subtracted my deaths. To me that doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. 
---
I would rather go play the nice quiet douche free servers now instead.
---
Gotta have a jet pack mod so we can fly without power arnour
---
I was thinking you would go hunt one cryptid a day until you get all, say, seven of them
---
Just like the people saying fasnacht shouldve beebn a 10% drop rate. apparently everyone should have the rare stuff
---
Because theres people like me who dont minmax
---
Bit of a late reply but I also had this problem today. Searched all 4 locations and had the quest at 4/4 but the last location would not update.
---
I managed to fix this by fast travelling to the last location even though I was already there. As soon as I loaded back up, the quest updated and a new marker appeared showing me where the ‚Äòleader‚Äô was to kill.
---
Hope that helps
---
Yet u made this post. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I think the concept of PVP (survival) is pretty cool.  However, the leaderboard is just plain stupid.  Add in fhe fact that cap losses aren‚Äôt balanced (nor are weapons or armor) and I won‚Äôt be setting foot in that environment anytime soon. 
---
No, it makes perfect sense. But I‚Äôll try to spell it out for ya. Bethesda is a company. They want money. That‚Äôs why things from the atomic store disappear when you drop them. So only that person who bought it can use it. Likewise, that‚Äôs why things from the atomic store can‚Äôt be traded. The system doesn‚Äôt allow it. 
---
‚ÄúHave them drop the item in a bag to make sure it‚Äôs not a scam‚Äù sounds just like ‚Äúgive me your golden shotgun for free to make sure you don‚Äôt get banned.‚Äù In both cases, you‚Äôre having to put an immense amount of trust in the receiving party that they won‚Äôt just take it and disappear forever, fucking you out of money, real world or just caps. 
---
Glitch coming out with Patch 8.
---
I played since beta. And even back then, the game was hard.  It‚Äôs not an easy game starting out.  But you will appreciate it later on once you get high level and the game gets easy. 
---
I really hate that the balcony portion is unusable.
---
Says the game is shit, tells you to make a positive post...
---
No worries!
---
:mind blown:
---
1st off the market isn't "destroyed" so that's just a false claim all together. 
---
2nd any point to be made about more caps meaning things will be more expensive is false. Even when nuka cola where duped like crazy and everyone and 25k on every character the prices in player trading stayed constant. Do you have a counter example to mine where more caos meant higher prices? 
---
except that it did happen so your entire argument is invalid
---
cosigned 100%
---
It takes 1 cloth per hat, each one weighs .1, and I can sell them for up to 15 caps each (depending on if I feel like swapping cards). I can make 100+ at a time, and max my vendor caps out in a few minutes by selling them all. Saves me 45 minutes of bulking and hopping each play session. Now I just make sure to scrap cloth, and only what I need for crafting.
---
Yep. Or just show the character name only in game but when someone friends you it would link to your gamer tag then have the character name in parenthesis in the social menu.   
---
The way it is now is so weird, I've never seen another rpg handle character names like this. 
---
It says something about you. That you would accept items in a botched trade without making it right or atleast staying to fight. You are your coward friend zipped out. You know what you did. You are a sorry pos that is garbage. You didnt want to stay and face me because you know youd lose if you did. Im mad because you cowardly ran off without a chance of redemption. You were a scared little boy who knew you were robbing a superior and had to run in order to get away. Your butt buddy cheap shotted me in a corner and you all took off giggling like girls. You are garbage
---
But it doesn‚Äôt color right on top of the blue color that BOS mod adds.  Apparently it gets rid of the blue.  Another user posted yesterday complaining about it.  But they did not post pictures. 
---
Even tho the event leader of the pack gives terrible legendaries, all the wolves count towards the 25 legendaries so you can kill 3 legendaries every time you complete that, also uranium fever is good
---
Anyone lvl 50 can have both of those things so yes they are equal. What you are suggesting is that the amount you lose when killed should be based on your gear which is even worse because then having good gear is a bad thing and based in RNG.
---
Yea
---
Oh i haven't read all of it. That's ok then.
---
There is still going to be a new game mode called nuclear winter just like survival mode ins wild appalachia. The vault raids will be another release like the fasnacht event was or biv was.
---
Yeah that sounds cool (and don't get me wrong it kind of is) but unless they make The Whitespring a no PvP safe zone that's just gonna be a bloodbath for the Survival folks. (And frankly I'd love that. To just have one goddamn safe space where you don't have to worry about getting ganked outta nowhere and can actually remember the human for a minute and chill.)
---
I foresee an issue, i predict it will forget its name after you wesr it and collect it again
---
I think the audio was the best part
---
Nice. I'm looking forward to naming items - hopefully this includes power armour frames!
---
I would give you like 1500 caps for your serums but you've treated me like crap the whole time. 
---
Git gud, bruh.
---
Vault raids is separate from the nuclear winter game mode, so we still don't know if it is a battle royale mode or not.
---
Yeah, it's a feature.
---
I think it‚Äôs just the character you complete it on but I haven‚Äôt checked
---
Was just a bit disappointed as I thought they were getting 1400 each, can see now I was being like the people who really irritate me by moaning about an *improvement*. Sorry! 
---
For some reason it doesn‚Äôt show that it gives +100 in the description and if you try mixing in a part from another suit you lose the bonus, let me know if it does/doesn‚Äôt give it to you, might have found a glitch?? 
---
Speaking of glitches, sometimes upon entering the game I will actually have another +100 carry weight? For a total of over 400 and it seems it randomly goes away 5-15 minutes later or if I exit my PA. This happen to anyone else?
---
so, I did a little experimenting. Charisma does NOT have to be 5, and also appears to have no effect on ability to tame. I personally only have a 4 in Charisma. I captured a lvl 30 Mirelurk King and a level 21 Deathclaw. I have Animal Friend maxed (at lvl 3) and Wasteland Whisperer (lvl 1). That being said, I am level 108 at present, so I think the half your level thing still applies as far as I can tell (haven't really been able to find a higher level random to test). The area I farm for random spawns is the crashed Vertibird in a pond due north of Abbie's Bunker (kind of where the rocky terrain appears on the map). Once you find the Vertibird, drop a custom marker because you're going to want to find this place easy again (the spawn is on the west bank of the pond). There's not always a creature spawn, sometimes it's other events like the Miss Nanny who tells a story or the Mr. Handy who's going to explode. If it doesn't spawn a creature, exit to menu and hop right back in, you'll have a marker, it usually spawns you near Freddie Fear's, so watch out for the spawns there getting aggro'd as you spawn in, then it's pretty safe after that as you head back to the marker. So far I've come across and been able to tame: a megasloth, a mirelurk king, an attack dog, and a deathclaw. I stopped going after getting the deathclaw. As for getting them to your base, that's the hard part. It takes a long time for them to show up (they have to travel from capture point to your camp in real time), even if you server hop. Be aware of where the camp item is placed in your camp because that is where the creature will be directed to. If it is somewhere in your camp that is difficult to access, you will have problems with your creature potentially dying by glitching. Also, I mentioned logging out and back in didn't seem to help them teleport directly to my camp; this may only be because of the placement of my camp item, it wasn't until one of the creatures arrived that I noticed them being compelled towards it and moved it to a better spot outside my house. Also, It doesn't seem to matter if you swap out perk cards after taming.
---
Bullshit. Youre a liar. You have said shit like that multiple times to make yourself sound like youre going to do something. 
---
I want the music volume in the atomic shop lowered too. üòÇ
---
I stopped playing the game because of this. So sad. I still lurk at this sub. I couldn't bare the griefing..
---
melee is one of the easiest to build right now, shove a bunch of points into strength and agility, get the unarmed card put 3 points in it, get a secondary weapon choice like 1 handed for knives and stabby type things, or two handed for baseball bats and sledges, death tambo/mole miner gauntlet/powerfist are pretty overpowered right now for unarmed weapons. course baseball bat and sledge would be good right now until you can get leveled enough to get the unarmed weapons to drop (they dont become available till like 20 or 25). find someone on xbox who can mod ya up a couple baseball bats and a sledge or two and go beat the hell out of things in toxic valley.  
---
best advice i can give ya after that is keep killing, keep running, keep moving, if leveling is your goal, making your camp look pretty or searching every single crevice for a screw is wasting precious time to lvl. (sorry i personally get tunnel focused when having say a goal to get to 50. nothing else matters, currently that way with my melee wanting to get her to 120, and if im not killing something it feels like i am wasting my time.)  
---
theres a group on here r/fo76FilthyCasuals has quite a few xbox users, also has a discord channel. join em, get a couple xbox users to run with or who can mod out your melee weapons to keep them level viable for you. most of em would help ya for free or material cost, but atleast offer a small cap donation for their time/trouble just to be nice.. doubt many would accept the caps but offers are always appreciated by most everyone. sadly im ps4 or id help ya out. 
---
invest a few points into sneak, stay crouched, ya get good at it you can stand infront of mobs and they wont see ya. the sneak damage bonus, ups your chances to 1 or 2 shot kill things greatly. armor is not all that important since youll be outgrowing it fairly quickly so having bis in armor not all that important just make some regular level appropriate leather or something, if it requires ballistic fiber and breaks toss it make new. wouldnt worry about investing or repairing armor until you hit 45 and 50 and get the peices you will full time all the time.  
---
also flooping and tshk have good points get in trouble step back a bit resupply in a lower lever area then get back on the grind, resting for xp bonus, also cranberry relish for 10% xp bonus for a 15% boost total.  
---
if wanting to go melee drop the rifle your wasting points in per/rifle perks and your not doing much with a rifle other than pissing a mob off and alerting everything in the vacinity of where you are and what direction to go running at you enmass. 
---
Here's the thing. You CAN have your build perfect at lvl 70 if you aren't wasting points still at lvl 30. Just because you dodnt decide on a build until lvl 100+ doesn't mean it is plausible.
---
Red Dead Online does this. It seems like a recent trend.
---
Totally agree on the masochistic building aspect. Made a puzzle base, and having the codes for all the doors scramble each time I move the base (or not be placable at all and havign to redo that room) is quickly bcoming a pain. That's assuming I dont log into a 76 update blocking the camp location which was perfectly fine 2 hours ago when I placed it.
---
I just saw a youtube video yesterday that showed it. I'll see if I can find it
---
That‚Äôs how I read it too,  meaning We can sell to ONE vendor and get our daily sales done in a single transaction.
---
I‚Äôm level 98 and I don‚Äôt have either of those things, additionally, I‚Äôve never had that many caps to buy the mutations so I can get marsupial. What I‚Äôm suggesting is we don‚Äôt have two shot explosive as it‚Äôs ruining the game. 
---
I'm not one of the fools that would have done that. It was terribly flawed by design.
---
 The fact that it did happen is a joke.  The spawn  Camping scrubs have somewhere to play now which I'm all for that. I want a real survival server.
---
 Not his arcade style free-for-all death match pile of maneuver that they gave us.
---
That's your opinion. Some people like to keep their rewards. Since stash limit has no impact at on on how you play the game, any argument you make is more about you wanting to control how others play to suit your own desires.
---
Still looks nice tho to me 
---
I say debuff them so the chance of getting killed by a zero cap player is greatly decreased. 
---
They can still have a purpose in the game (bait)
---
Respect costs nothing 
---
2k caps for the serum if you want it 
---
Inside the Whitespring = player hub
---
Outside the Whitespring = Game on
---
That's been the purpose of games like this forever. That's why there are rewards.
---
Says the thief
---
*Techncial
---
Ok, thank you 
---
why are you in survival mode if you're not interested in pvping?
---
Yeah that basically sums it up haha.
---
There would have to be incentive though, they'd need a raider hub as an alternate.
---
Yes the vendors would have more caps... but you still have to work for things to sell to them. You are acting as though I am saying make the vendors give us 10k free caps a day. Have you seen what vendors pay out? There prices are so bad you would have to sell an entire stash box to get 3k from one.
---
This does exist. On PS4, you hold down the X. I don't know what it is for other platforms.
---
Basturd! Lol, I think I've been to Harper's/Watoga right after you...several times! üòÇüòÇ
---
Imagine they don't do solo lobbies because it negates the scavenging aspect of the game. Dont have ballistic fiber? Make your own server and run the loop. Want to level up fast, make your own server and have a monopoly on whitesprings. Etc.
---
You mean camping out at train stations and blasting fools as they spawn in (not being able to defend themselves) isn‚Äôt a good idea?  
---
It should bring it to 1, that was in a patch note, but it doesn't seem to work. just like empathy should see a reduction as well but does not as far as I can tell.
---
It'll probably work better than the healthcare in the US currently :'(
---
I got it doing leader of the pack playing new characters.  Didn't take too long
---
EXACTLY.
---
Awesome! I assumed so just wanted to make sure!
---
I remember them claiming pre-release that private servers (with mod support) are being worked on, but they won't be available until late 2019. 
---
A shotgun and an electrified sword
---
I‚Äôm a lvl 65 heavy gunner and honestly my main reliable gun is a lvl 50 gat, no stars or legendary effects. It does 83 damage to put it into perspective. I don‚Äôt even know what damage a TSE does because I‚Äôve never owned one, nor prime or ultracite weapons but I‚Äôm pretty sure they would wipe the floor with my gat. All of my perks are to do with weight management essentially, I don‚Äôt believe I chose any damage increasing perks. 
---
I‚Äôve never really been interested in pvp. I play in the evenings and build my camp, do quests etc. I just thought that I would clarify before thinking about venturing into survival as I assume that‚Äôs what most of it would consist of, people with TSE legendaries one shotting sub-level 100 players
---
In the patch notes, there should be something in place for this but there is a lot of talk that it is definitely not working. Hopefully this will be fixed soon üò¨
---
That was my assumption, as well.  The douchebags left us peaceful adventurers for the bloodbath servers.  The no slap damage has eliminated all the distasteful elements from the previous four months of gameplay.
---
In your logic im supposed to respect the cowardly asshat who stole my stuff in order to be compensated? 
---
Best thread on the subject yet.
---
Well you can at least call everything
---
***Awesome Itemname
---
And it would stay seperate from other items
---
Learning all sorts of shtuff today. Thank you :)
---
we also need to acknowledge that what Bethesda has created is "Fallout Hide and Seek"
---
Had you been less hot headed and rude in the first place we wouldn't stillbe talking 
---
damn didn't even cross my mind. by far the best effect of this.
---
Ah yeah I guess, if you are hunting blueprints. 
---
Lol yeah i highly doubt that. 
---
So you are cheating. Is this your argument?
---
As I said before inflation doesn't affect a game where there is already infinite currency. And Venezuela faild because of socialism which is an entirely different conversation. Inflation cant happen if there is already infinite money, there is nothing higher than infinite. 
---
Let's hope your prediction gets back to the developers and they introduce it as a test case before release!
---
That's why I second guessed taking my 190 into survival.  I built him around crafting, so obviously a bad idea LOL.  I'm going to take my alt in instead.
---
Does it feel like there‚Äôs less enemies? Running across the map seems almost empty. Maybe to create stability for pvp? But no enemies so what‚Äôs the point if 20+ xp. 
---
too bad I've already bought a lot of the expensive items, that would have been nice
---
No need to be ugly
---
It's only gamw why you have to be mad
---
I think the best way to play this current version is to go in as a lower level player.  You won‚Äôt draw a lot of attention and if you die it won‚Äôt cost you a fortune. 
---
My current lvl 150 may be able to compete, but losing 300 caps per death to someone much lower simply due to glitches doesn‚Äôt sound like much fun to me.  
---
Its a game mechanic.  Try dropping something, wait a sec, then drop something else 5‚Äô away.  The first bag will disappear and it will be joined in the second bag you dropped.
---
No,.that's on may 9th iirc
---
How is he a liar if he told you it was a lemon up front?
---
Im not the one losing out because i dont have respect for anyone 
---
You said its "no more absurd than being able to stand there like a statue and not take damage" but the difference is that there are counters to thay but not counters to weapons that infinitely stagger making it impossoble to fight back.
---
Ah. Thunderbolt and Lightning. Would be good too. Also you get a Queen reference. 
---
BECAUSE YOU FUCKING ROBBED ME ASSHOLE AM I SUPPOSED TO JUST BE COOL WITH IT? 
---
That was my immediate thought, PLEASE PA frames! 
---
Ive done the same myself and always wonder what the player was thinking after randomly appearing somewhere and figuring out wtf just happened lol
---
Can't wait to actually experience the event rather than glitches of it.
---
So distinction, are you referring to daily quests or challenges? For Challenges I agree, for Quests I disagree. I enjoy the exp and the plans that can be received. It's not just about for me, when I start getting duplicates I can sell those so I am not at a point where it's annoying or a grind yet. I have had the same quests but the rewards have been consistently different, which has been better in my experience then other daily quests.
---
Yooo! Im just north of morgantown my dude ü§ôüèª too bad im on xbox or i would run with a fellow mountaineer
---
I want all those mechanics though...
---
There's three movement modes in Fallout 76, Walking, Running and Sprinting (uses AP). Which one are you talking about?
---
Oh sorry, I didn't realize there were communists here.
---
I used Atoms I had collected freely too. It must be annoying as hell for someone who actually bought the Atoms to get it. It would be nice to get an official response on the issue from Bethesda, thoughüò©üò© It‚Äôs obvs not exactly a pressing issue, but hopefully it‚Äôll get fixed.
---
Thanks for the response!üòÉüòÉ
---
It‚Äôs been noted and is on Beth‚Äôs to do list 
---
They‚Äôve definitely been improving the game since launch. Really enjoying it so far and new content seems to be coming pretty often so far 
---
It's only game why you have to be mad
---
I know. You stole my shit and ran. Clearly you hav3 no respect for anyone
---
You do realize that the new trading meta is the Civil War Top Hat, which takes 1 cloth to make and sells for 30+ caps, right? It's incredibly easy to make as many as you want and sell them. People know how to sell those vendors out with absolutely zero effort. That's part of the reason the game's economy is so bad anyway. 
---
It really seems to me like you have zero handle on how the game's money system works now and all you're saying is "more caps please".
---
The system we have will get much worse very quickly if they raise those cap limits. Deal with it. 
---
thats not even remotely funny
---
Interesting that people's attitude is "\*I\* don't like this so take it away from everybody else"
---
It isn't even PvP at that point. You are obviously just trolling... unless you are really really really dumb. Bye.
---
Oh, yes, now you mention it...
---
This also works for me :)
---
Youre a coward. 
---
This is definitely the biggest flaw, I made a comment about it on another post. Train stations need a total re-work. They're absolute death traps.
---
Did I say anything about min maxing? I dont min max but i still have a build. Min/max isn't the only build. All build require the same amount of perk cards... 50.
---
Whatever you say, Arthur Maxson! 
---
I don't care anymore 
---
I WANT A BRIGHT NEON RED LUNCHBOX THAT PROJECTS NUKA COLA SILHOUETTES 
---
Ill give you 25000 caps if you can kill me
---
There are paths I have very obviously not walked, friend. You have seen much... done much... 0_0
---
but its not even announced yet 
---
I'm really glad I didn't get discouraged when I first started playing. Bethesda has turned it around bigtime. This game gets better by the day and I love it
---
I didn't run as i only installed the game on Wednesday 
---
I assume that it will return in another limited rotation eventually. Just my guess though. 
---
Nah i don't like pvp that much at the moment 
---
 I know a guy.
---
His price is 250 caps.
---
He's on PS4.
---
Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ayv1dt/ps4_selling_mutation_serums_250_each/
---
Dude thank you so much! These are A+ tips my guy
---
Oh boy! Are we going to have marshmallows? :D
---
TSE aren't even OP anymore after the nerf and that's besides the point. As far as lvl advantage goes there is none and that my point. Gear and lvl advantage are completely separate after lvl 50. Seems like you are saying that you should lose more caos if you have had good RNG which is just crazy.
---
Lol yeah i noticed. You run from a fight because you obviously suck at it
---
and...
---
What would you have preferred to see on an M79 to avoid you saying that? Genuinely curious. 
---
Username checks out
---
Wow you dont speak for the entire subreddit there champ. You only speak for your crusty ass.
---
Nope, for sure none of my power armor has ever given me +100 carry weight. Maybe my character is completely glitched. Lol   Oh, Bethesa... 
---
Je viens de passer 
---
I agree.  Let's you have fun with the ghouls and exploring the site, and gives you a nice safe zone.
---
Yes PLEASE!!!
---
Because the intent is not to have a single player standalone game. Solo and singleplayer are not the same thing. I play the game solo 90% of the time without any issue.
---
bethesda made the game un-fun by removing the dense plans from the game...
---
I have a feeling that once private servers are allowed, characters won't be portable between private servers and Bethesda's servers. It'd open itself up to too much abuse; spin up your own server, use console to give yourself everything you'd want in a dream character, then jump back onto the public servers...it'd have to be more like the minecraft model where each server (or server farm, in Bethesda's case) would have separate account saves.
---
That's why it's on the to do list when it is completed it will be on the done list. 
---
Sadly, I no longer live in the motherland.  I‚Äôm also sad that my home county or any major location in it doesn‚Äôt seem to appear in the game (Hampshire)
---
flare gun
---
i wish it did something worthwhile
---
Haha, Gary!
---
The more I think about, I happen to agree with you guys on this... with the exception of the courtyard at the front entrance. The flowers must be kept pristine, after all.
---
In general I agree with you but wow, you'll refuse to play unless they make it exactly how you think it should be? y i k e s
---
That is truly awesome.
---
Agreed. Top of the World? Or what do you have in mind?
---
 Not seeing the BOS emblem?   Maybe resolution is just too low?
---
I have to disagree, I think some system needed to be in place to protect those who just want a PvE experience from those who only want PvP. While slap damage wasn't the most elegant solution, it had to be done until they could separate the servers like they did with this patch 
---
That‚Äôs the Achilles heel of sentinel. It‚Äôs not something to be countered. 
---
That wasn‚Äôt even suggested, the issue is the previous mentioned mixture (a problem that was prolific due to duping) and the Survival uses an d damage model so two shot explosive isn‚Äôt merged in Survival so everyone with this weapon and marsupial just jumps around like it‚Äôs Fortnite and randomly spams attack!? Where is the tactical thought and exciting PvP in that encounter? 
---
Simply put, there isn‚Äôt...
---
Have you even played Survival?
---
I livestream and play daily and I am well aware of the issues in this current Beta of Survival...
---
Yeah, I remember that quest. What happened to those non-feral ghouls was messed up.
---
Dont you have to be standing still and have no armor?
---
That was never officially said, as far as I know. 
---
I‚Äôm talking about the daily challenges to get atoms 
---
I must have really pissed someone off because I got a bounty put on me of about 6,300 caps :(
---
&gt;VENDOR FACTION UPDATES It‚Äôs no secret that vendors are some of the busiest bots in Appalachia, and we‚Äôre planning to make a pair of adjustments that should make it even more convenient to make those crucial trades with various vendor factions. With our next update, we‚Äôre adding a vendor from every faction except the Enclave to the shops at the Whitespring Resort. This will help reduce the need to fast travel all around the Wasteland to visit vendors from multiple factions. Additionally, we‚Äôre combining the Cap totals from all seven vendor factions into total pool of 1,400 Caps, which should offer you more flexibility in the trades you make with specific factions.
---
I don't actually like that. Less people travelling to Watoga and Harpers in particular, less those legendaries to reset because a new player will enter the area to get some caps.
---
lmao!!
---
No i just don't enjoy fighting against duped op weapons and sentinel assassin armour 
---
That's actually a really good suggestion. Pretty much just as central as the Whitespring.
---
I know, was gonna say I‚Äôm joking immediately but got busy with work. For the record, I wouldn‚Äôt have ripped OP off like that!
---
A couple of days ago, I came back to my camp to find a 3 star legendary insult bot inside my "house". He gave me an insult, then I killed him (because he was a 3 star legendary). He insta blew up, killed me, and destroyed my whole house and everything in it. I couldn't find the body :(
---
But if younarent wareing sentinel then you just get melted without even being able to bring your gun up because you are "stun locked" in the staggering animation until you are dead... so it does need a counter.
---
Separate inventories, of course. But they don't even currently have separate cap pool. 
---
I wasn't, as I said they were just camping railroad stations
---
if damage worked like on fo4 survival it would be super fun.  
---
For the uninitiated, fo4 survival increase ALL damage by some huge amount, 200% iirc.  This means players can one shot most enemies with a headshot, but also the reverse.  At low levels a simple molotov is an immediate 1 shot kill, and you can maybe survive 2 shots from a pipe pistol or 3 tops if you had decent endurance.  
---
Only once you get to higher levels and have decent armor can you finally survive a bit but even then players are never bullet sponges like in fo76.
---
Vampire dagger thingy. 
---
Thank you for how vocal you are in the community and responding with us; it‚Äôs greatly appreciated! :-)
---
I'm such a noob, will check tonight (embarrassingly turning off the computer)
---
thanks
---
All I'm saying is that you lose way too much when you get killed
---
I love my blackbird as well, but I'd probably try to mix some of the paladin pieces in if I ever get it. 
---
Have to have no armor and weapon out. No movement.  Does not matter whether standing or crouching. 
---
All I have is a 1* quad handmade would u be interested in that at all?
---
&gt; Maybe make the building itself the "safe zone" so you get shenanigans like John Wick 2 just outside on the grounds.
---
You'd have to extend the safe zone to the courtyard where you spawn in, otherwise people will just spawn camp everyone.  Either that, or make the spawn point inside the hotel.

I got a really nice trove of goodies the first time I went there, myself, and I was like, "Damn, she's loaded." Now I know better! &lt;3
---
This is why I think the idea of letting us author notes of holotapes is interesting. It would've been cute to get a little message with the gift.
---
Just playing how i play. 
---
You know whats sad is if i browse your comments youre actually a decent trader. Why wont you make this right when you are obviously in the wrong? You hit your buddy and he killed us. Then you vanished. What the hell am i supposed to think? 
---
Thanks for the info
---
I have played survival a ton. I have only encountered maybe 1 or 2 people doing what you are saying but if you have fireproof 3 and use vats then you are good. Vats makes them jumping around useless and fireproof takes care of that pesky explosive damage. You being a streamer doesn't make you an expert my friend. 
---
Dont pick up loot until you regain your bag, dont die if you pick up loot before you regain your bag, no other way around it :(
---
Lol no. More like the opposite.
---
I made a new character for PvP.
---
Also, have you not been stashing your junk this entire time? I like that this mode risks your aid. You have to plan much more and be more careful.
---
100% agree lol
---
Anyone else have an issue with volume of holo tapes always being low?
---
Might as well delete all vendors and make one mega vendor. And make it accessible from pipboy. After all, it's convenient, right?
---
Translation: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt accept the fact that I‚Äôm a hypocrite and therefore i must remove myself from the conversation before I embarrass myself even more‚Äù
---
Have a friend kill you and split the caps.
---
Look at the roadmap. The vault raids and nuclear winter game mode are two separate items.
---
[Aha! found an old post for this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0ptgv/power_armor_carry_weight_bug/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) 
---
TSE isn't that bad. Yes its stronger than default weapons but explosive damage is easily countered, fireproof and a dense torso mod cripple it. The two shot is a substantial damage boost but not the highest you can get. 
---
Most of the resentment is from two shot and explosive were multitudes stronger than now. They got hard nerfed awhile back. 
---
Explosive weapons are common but not every explosive weapon is a two shot. There arw a lot circulating because of dupes, but in min/maxed PvP builds two shot explosive aren't ideal, most people prefer bloody or instigating, vicious is a better option for full auto weapons. 
---
Mutation recipes are cheaply bought from other players, or you could buy serums directly. I got all my mutations(7) for about 5000 caps.
---
Sentinel Assassin builds are way worse than TSE. But even they have counters, although theirs are less reliable than the explosive counters.
---
You can't hunt them because they are fixed. Only mods can be hunted.
---
Previously there would be no "other bag", the fact it now appeared periodically until disappeared is actually an improvement to previous situation :&lt;
---

---
i tought they said them Maybe do one but not said them do? or did i missed something
---
My bad, I heard him say it was combat armor. I completely missed that your were asking specifically for the BOS combat armor.
---
Wrong. I dont mind PvP but when you are killed beofr you even load in pints an exploit not PvP. You have made 0 valid points and are therefore not worth conversing with.
---
Why do people want this mutation? It‚Äôs virtually useless. You‚Äôd be better off with a single piece of stealth armor and staying crouched. Why do I need to be invisible standing upright with my weapon out? I don‚Äôt see the point after trying it myself. 
---
Add the ability to rent vending stalls inside.
---
It is, already mentioned I think in road map.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt totally disable it.  Just don‚Äôt target other players.  It should still be usable with the XP buff for the PvE part of Survival.
---
Cooking Oil, Digestive Goo, and a few other items need to be taken off the list. Not sure why they haven't fixed that yet.
---
Felt very sorry to shoot the robots a few times...
---
Had you from the get go said " bro i caused all this, let me make it right," i wouldve never peeped a word. But now i see you are enjoying unpaid for mutations and it makes me want to find your camp and burn it. Do you understand? 
---
No, you‚Äôre missing the point. I think sentinel is overpowered. I think identical armor effects should not stack. 
---
Sure. If you want.
---
What? Why do you care if somebody loses caps when they die? PvP is not about making somebody broke by repeatedly killing them until they have 0 caps left.
---
Here‚Äôs  hoping they do that make private servers a what you do there stays there thing. 
---
&gt;because I'll be able to recoup more of 
---
Good point.
---
That's exactly what I plan to do and I play Survival. I think it's ridiculous that you can lose that many caps if you're a high-level and I'm not alone.   Losing,  for me, 380 caps/ death isn't worth playing that mode. 
---
&gt;Is 25 the cap?
---
No, 50 is the cap for gaining SPECIAL points. Eevry level after 50 you get the option of moving a point from one stat to another or picking a new perk card.
---
&gt;when I hit level 27 I upgraded my agility which was at 1 and it didn't increase.
---
when it says it's still showing 1, are you talking about the number at the top of the perk screen, or the number you see when you look in the stats menu of the perk boy? There's a known issue where you'll occasionally get addicted to something but the notification doesn't pop up, so your stats will just randomly appear lower than they should. Try eating an addictol and see if that fixes things. 
---
F*ck im bored of lying. Yes it was set up. It was all chrissy's fault. Him being my older brother pressured me into it, i didnt want to as you seemed like an alright guy but i went along with. In all honesty i don't have your junk but if you come to me ill give you about 1000 caps. Im sorry for all this trouble but please don't tarnish my image, i have tried to get your junk but i simply can't. 
---
Only thing i don't like about the chameleon mutation, I can not aim since it's invisible. I don't wanna put a scope on my hunting rifle but it seems I'll have to if I wish to see where I am aiming at
---
I know right
---
Yeah, Rosie would approuve killing thoses fancy rats.
---
What did you say?I just clicked the Survival button.
---
Really now? I thought my theory was just the result of the painkillers I'm on...
---
What identical armor affects are you talking about? Are you saying that the left arm shouldn't work of the right arm had the same affect? If so I disagree. 
---
Do PvPers a favor and make sure to do controlled suicide in secluded location to keep yourself out of becoming a battlefield target. Some people hunt these chilling out people on sight, other are suspecting there will be guys hunting the #1 and they hunt them, to keep out of harms way do what you can to prevent becoming a beacon on the map.
---
Yes let's have Bethesda nerf melee the Rolling Pin is so overpowered survival mode here I come.
---
It is in my best interest to know the mechanics and I‚Äôm on PlayStation so Vats is very sluggish, it‚Äôs either the problem I‚Äôm outlining here or spawn sniping so er, yeah I have a very good knowledge and understanding of Fallout 76, thanks for trying to make assumptions about my knowledge without any proof. I also used to work in the games industry. But you‚Äôre obviously trying to justify duped items that have become prolific in the game. Great stance to take. This conversation is over thank you...
---
The factiom vendors at WR and allowing the renaming of  power armor (and other items) are great additions. Glad Bethesda listens to consumers.
---
Oof. Having it all through one vendor means if one is out, they all are. I am lukewarm to the thought a person can just camp at one vendor and drain the entire  map each cycle.
---
Honestly that was my suspicion as well, but for something that offers zero gameplay function, aside from immersion/realism, you'd think that maybe then they'd be able to have it done purely client-side. Maybe not, though. It's worth mentioning that the
---
Mainly I'm just annoyed by finding cut-content lol At least, in an MMO. With the single player Bethesda games, leave it in! There's always a modder somewhere who will be able to re-activate it and/or finish whatever was still needed :) I just have BSA Browser and look at what's new in the Atom Shop (ATX) categories, to get an idea if something is coming that I need to hold on to Atoms for and not spend on anything that does end up in the shop. Like there's a Black Excavator paintjob, and had I not known I would've bought the Blue/Red that's in there, then been frustrated when Black showed up :P (*cry* I already missed out the Blackbird paintjobs because I couldn't finish the download of the game until a month after release)
---
Oh and I looked at the files again, the other thing I couldn't remember is "Gnat", and it isn't the Bee Swarm as that is present in the Honey Beast directory. 
---
There's also something called a "GutPuker", which my mind immediately goes to the zombies in Dying Light which puke lol So I'm not sure what it could be in 76...But these both are in the Actors category, which almost all of them have a Skeleton.nif associated with them (except Gnat and GutPuke, as well as BeeSwarm)
---
While I didn't see any mesh for them, there are textures for the Seagull and another I forgot about: Vulture! Perhaps the Crow mesh is shared with the Gull and Vulture *(blasphemous, but can't think of anything else lol)*? There *are* Crow and Owl textures too, but curiously are under Actors (same as Gull/Vulture) and not Critters. Oh look, there's all the Vim PA textures hahah
---
Alright, shutting up now as I'm so far off-topic it isn't even funny...
---
Afraid?
---
There is something sexy about that mart.
---
I used to get a lot of these when my internet connection was particularly flaky (bad packet loss). It's apparently still too bad to play Anthem but Fallout has been fine for a while. Some other games were always fine. Connection tolerance varies a lot.
---
Yeah i understand come to me get some caps and you can have some steel as well if you need. I don't know what junk you had but ill try to repay
---
It depends on everyone's definition of hunting. I just meant "being after". 
---
The game is definitely worth it. But don't think you can play it like any MMO game. It doesn't have the content to keep you entertained for too long. Best play it a few hours a day at most.
---
Shotguns are pretty good and you can totally create a build that specializes in them.
---
I play solo for the most part. It's a weird cross of a single and multiplayer version of Fallout. I just wish we had more content added more regularly.
---
If you keep spawning in the same place you deserve it lol, just go somewhere else or to your camp.
---
But where‚Äôs the fun if everyone has the same build and there is little to no imagination in an RPG game?
---
I forget exactly where it's located, but [here's the note in question.](https://i.imgur.com/zNtL6uc.jpg)
---
There is also legendary armor that counts. I believe the legwndary perk is weightless.
---
I use that in nuke zones to signal Legendaries for others. I'll pop a flare at a legendary and then kite it until others show up to tag it. 
---
&gt; Still sounds like you dont make much bank tho. 
---
And why should he? Its pointless. 
---
I think they said that for item display (ala select items for shelves / cases). Though they haven‚Äôt gone into much depth on how this will work yet, or what types of items.
---
Yep. I sell union caps and my wife sells civil war hats. It is gonna be bad.
---
Ill take caps for the mutations and in return ill remove the post about you and stay off your ass. Heck i might even trade with you again. How long will you be on? I should be on in about an hour. Doing some SBQ action
---
Cannibal is a must have for certain PvP oriented people purely because it allows you to eat a downed player alive. Fallouts version of teabag is brutal.
---
50 would be perfect really. 
---
360 no scope.
---
I never argued to justify duping weapons. Nice strae man argument dude. I only said that being a streamer doesn't make you an expert because you said you were a streamer as if that makes you more knowledgeable. You havent actually made any counter points. All you did I'd make up a straw man to attack which is what people do when they doent have anything of value to add to the conversation, bye dude.
---
Energy weapons. They are the coolest looking weapon skins imo. I wish they were as cool in the stats though :(
---
Sure im on now, and after block me and ill block you and we'll never talk about it again? 
---
&gt;I love that people that previously called players who complained about getting cap farmed are so butthurt about getting cap farmed.
---
You didn't say anything about this though.
---
My reference of fortnite is people jumping and shooting wildly as for call of duty I mean the campers who watch spawn points.
---
Your are however correct about sniper builds I have one of the best but your saltiness to my reply means your really shit at survival. Haha
---
I‚Äôm wondering if someone blocks you (or the entire list of plays on the server) if they become invisible. 
---
That works for me. Erase the whole thing
---
\^ found the guy abusing this work around
---
I don‚Äôt understand what he‚Äôs going for here either unless he got upset all the people he is farming in survival have stopped dropping caps. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I agree- HOWEVER! One of my top 5 favorite things to do in this game is orbital-strike those bases. I'd sacrifice that, though, for the greater good.
---
I never said anything about players getting cap farmed so except that I thought it was unfair soo..... what's your point.
---
You know my gt, ill delete this post and forget all about it
---
You better let me name my rifle "talk shit get crit" don't filter out swear words.
---
well repeating the same thing every day is boring  ... it doesn't matter what the challenge is. this applies if it's about being intoxicated for every daily or being naked for every daily.  the same content rehashed and grinded out is why I don't play wow anymore...
---
i like camp building and I would repeat that if it wasn't so buggy and restricted, though, but that is fresh new content for me. my own lack of inspiration for a new camp is my inhibitor here not boredom from repeating the same thing.
---
Yup. Ill shoot you a message when i get home
---
Your shit and you know you are. Complaining about a 2 day old beta because your whack ass is shit. 
---
I would rather lose triple caps and all aid, junk, and a portion of ammo than this. It would be spicy, extra super carolina reaper spicy. While part of me would enjoy watching duped assassins sentinel pieces depart from their owners, I fear it would just kill survival.
---
&gt;Speaking of glitches, sometimes upon entering the game I will actually have another +100 carry weight?
---
It's a known bug/feature that happens any time you log in while wearing the excavator, and yes, it will go away if you take the armor off.
---
Stopp before you get lynched :p
---
When will that be
---
I think that either the effect (15%) should be the max. Two Chameleon pieces don‚Äôt give you twice the invisibility. Two water breathing pieces don‚Äôt make you breathe better underwater, etc. 
---
My opinion is that this is what has screwed this game up so badly. One shot kills should not be possible through armor, etc. 
---
Ad Victorium
---
Partly this will make White Spring a defacto hub...also, vendor have different item pools based upon faction; a vendor for the raiders will not have the same list of items as one from BOS.
---
Hope your on xbox so I can take all your shit. Douchbag 
---
In about an hour. 
---
Said hit a sneak attack
---
My GT is SexyKarl777 so it's just good branding!
---
They are supposed to all be "passive" in the Forest. 
---
I'm going to try that though
---
I've been up by Devil's Backbone lately. I build along the bridge using the top part to build a shelter with workbenches and such, the south side as a farm, and the north side for water purifiers. Plenty of options all along the bridge (which is long enough to support 3 camps) and you can build in spots with tons of water or tons of ground depending on your needs. The bridge itself creates a roof for anything you put under it and there's telephone poles in place for moving power around.
---
It's out of the way and not many people go there. It's a hop, skip, and jump away from Wes-Tek. So close that being over weight is nothing 1 can of coffee can't fix.
---
The main reason I'm there is because it's close to equal distance between Watog, Harper's and the Enclave/White Springs so it makes vendoring a ton cheaper with Fast Travel. It's also far enough away from Vault 76 that I can take full advantage of having 2 free fast travel locations to branch out from, making quest farming a cheaper en-devour over all.
---
I'd be standing or crouched with weapon and no armor/clothing, I'd see the shimmer and me go invisible but the other folks around could see me plan as day
---
Yes, yes, yes.
---
 I too am a cliff dweller and absolutely would love an option like this.
---
Griefer? It's the whole point of survival mode your fucking absolute cunt lol. Oh look overuse of the word griefer because there shit. 
---
Thanks will have to try that out when I play this weekend. Hopefully I will get one of those plans and be able to craft and sell themüòä
---
I will try this too thanks for the input.
---
Okay then let us kill you for all your caps.
---
People say this. But the shotgun is practically like having an elephant gun while deer hunting....
---
And the P90 feels like a laser to me, I use it over the MP5 9/10 even if I can't have the acog.
---
Did you actually report me to Bethesda or was that just a threat? 
---
WHAT?!???? YOULL HAVE TO SPEAK LOUDER
---
Idk. People who stay at 15% health with every perk card poured into damage are annoying but I think that the 1 hit is justified. The can be 1 hit as well because there health is so low.
---
Thanks hopefully soon it will appear thenüòä
---
You certainly know some stuff but my observations are that at least some of the perks you threw out will be commonly considered meta when the 'current' generation of gods, which I mostly dominate, meet the new gods, which as of now still dominate me. Out of hundreds of players, I only met few of those so thats still not the common knowledge.
---
Bethesda certainly said they made various weapons more deadly and gave zero details about that, and I am sure that items previously considered crap has been decrapified stealthily by Bethesda since the survival was released.
---
Keep your mind open, the rules just changed again.
---
Some cards are worth more then 1 point, and not everyine has a build, i know here on reddit it would seem as though everyone does but these are the more devoted fallout fans, most people i know pkay hap hazardly and would be nowhere near making a build at level 50.  
---
Damn.... what the hell. Defeats the purpose of you being invisible..... especially in PVP.
---
u/Ladydevann since it‚Äôs a beta, can we expect any changes to survival to be more frequent than usual? Or just one large update based on feedback that might not be implemented until this summer or later? Hopefully the former
---
Hey there. I just thought of a couple of other questions I‚Äôm hoping you can answer.
---
1) If 2 pieces of armor have the same perk, I.e. 20% weapon weight reduction, do those percentages stack to more than 20%, or do you just get the 20%?
---
2) Lets say the torso is Troubleshooters, so -15% from robots. Does that resistance ONLY apply to your torso, or does it give you the added resistance in total? In other words, would a robot damage you slower in the torso, but at the normal rate in your arms and legs, or would they damage you at the -15% everywhere simply due to having one piece with the perk?
---
I dont want two accounts and i dont want to have to choose between survival and adventure. I like both.
---
Hopefully its not the case, just what i think would go wrong if i had to pick something
---
So you are saying I should lose twice as many caps as you because you CHOSE not to have a build? 
---
No i seriously did. And im serious about that deal being recorded. I record all my transactions for that reason
---
u can switch to third person for this while aiming
---
Crafting and drinking alcohol will never be a chore
---
That's fantastic. Thanks for the help. I'll make it a goal to post the screen shots.
---
Most People don't have the exact same build. But in ANY pvp game hardcore pvp players will find optimal builds and use those. 
---
I was highlighting easy ways to counteract popular builds. TSE is a strong combination I was only showing that while strong it is easily countered for one torse slot and 3 perk points. Which still allows you 53(7+49-3) perk slots open for whichever build you want. 
---
Naming power armor chassis, yes!
---
The debuff really needs to apply for not being able to pay out.  No reason somebody should be able to store all their caps into alt. accounts and run around with no risk.
---
180 surely?
---
Cannibal is shit because it locks you in an animation for a few second and boom your dead and 1 Point in it is worthless for Hunger and thirst reasons. just my 2 cents ;-)
---
Yes please. And it's so ominous that I think I accidentally clicked survival. Have a mini heart attack every time.
---
Oh shit well im screwed but i deserve it . That tactic is so good but low life as hell
---
I agree. I think the max bonus caps are too high in bloodied builds as well. 1 divided by almost zero approaches infinity. 
---
You've said it now, and I agree that cap farming is unfair. I'd suggest waiting until they adjust the rules in Survival mode before trying it out again, and let the xxXnameXxx players get a taste of their own medicine.
---
Nice, thanks for that. I did the story about the non-ferals ghouls, but I don't think I ever found that note.
---
Let's see... How many Fasnacht bots did I shoot at in oodles of parades? Oh I must of thought it was ticking with a mini nuke. Yeah that's it.
---
Best of luck, I hope it works!
---
No, you're a troll for creating a Reddit account specifically to post trash in a dedicated sub for a game you don't play. 
---
The simple fact that when presented with facts all you can do is to post insults fairly well proves my point. Thank you for that. üòò
---
Use the long recon scope, you can see where you are aiming perfectly with chameleon and crouching.
---
I think you mis understood me from the start, all im calling bullshit on is people having stuff figured out by level 70 or whatever you said, i agree with you on the caps, it shouldnt be tied to level at all, i thibk it should be tied to level up until level 50 when you stop earning special points, then it should just stay at 50 caps
---
Hahaha I'd have to laugh if I found that on some one. 
---
It's the number at the top of the stat. I will try that and update 
---
Is the Woodland Walker paint even worth it? We already have the camo paints, as well as the Wasteland Walker ones...
---
Make it right and ill email then back and show them the text where you said that you messed up and wanted to make it right. 
---
Fyi all you have to say is "xbox record that" and it record the last minute in gameplay. 
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre referring to some of the reasonable, measured complaints that have been posted, while I‚Äôm talking about the deluge of demented comments, including the ones that sound like a person breaking up with a girl. And twitter, where you can read behind the vault, was much worse than reddit- but that‚Äôs a given because twitter is full of instantly outraged personalities.
---
Neat sleuth work! 
---
I'm excited to see the Space station have something going on. Maybe some Zetans will show up.  
---
Ok. Then we aren't arguing about that.
---
On day one I was finding people boosting their kill count by endlessly killing their friends at their camp. They were also baiting people to kill at train station. The moment someone would show up, or kill one of them, they would stop killing each other and hunt you down. Allowing kills as top three map markers would allow teams to artificially pad their score and lure unsuspecting players in.
---
Yes! I can hardly hear them. Abby's are the worst since she's actually telling you what you need to do an why. Biv is even quieter. But a scorchbeast attack will shake my desk. It's so weird that everyone has different experience with audio. My settings are all at default. 
---
No info about more energy weapon tweaking, laser rifles are still not in a good place. Too weak and still break too fast.
---
Or a room
---
I totally agree. I'm a software developer myself (boring financial stuff, not games) but you're right that the transformation from generic stored object with a bunch of nbt data to object in use back to stored object is a really vulnerable transition point.
---
I like the idea!! That has happened to me before.
---
I will make right as soon as you get on
---
I'm mostly hoping we get news about the legenaries vendor soon. I have a lot of stash weight taken up after killing that sloth so many times 
---
Ok. Agreed. I agree that many dont have their builds figured out by lvl 70 but it is also true that you CAN have it figured out by then and I agree that the caps lost should stay at 50.
---
the point of the mode is to survive, not pick on the guy that's minding their own business ya knob, while yes PvP is open it's not the point of the mode, the point isn't to hunt every other player, it's to play the game how you want, say someone wants to exit the vault with a new character and play the whole quest in survival mode, THAT'S FINE, they are allowed to do that, with the constant threat of another player looming...  and if one wants to play as a raider that is fine as well, but raiders don't hunt, and I am not saying you can't hunt other players, but don't fucking tell me that is the point of the mode you ignorant cunt.
---
Oh yeah. Biv is way low too.
---
Why didn't they say hi then instead of stalking them?  They clearly had ill intent and got what they had coming.
---
Ok?  I don't mind losing caps for losing, it's part of the risk/ reward system.  
---
Isnt the location of the pin thats holding up the sheepsquatch sketch also the location of that new unmarked vault thats been found?
---
Yeah its really bad, only travel on foot right now. 
---
And if you're getting spawn camped... don't keep spawning there, cut your losses. 
---
You fucking cock, yes it is but killing him/her will make my chances of survival better. Period.
---
Dick head. Your mum is your dad. 
---
I think so, yes. Just don't expect a lot of meaningful choices and a ton of super deep quests. It's still a fallout world, and a really large one, but *some* (**not** all) places and quests/events feel a bit empty and hollow. There's also a lot more grind for materials than there was in FO4, but you'd expect that for an online game. Still, I really love it and play it when I can (only weekends). Shotguns are viable, just don't expect to have one right away (hunting rifles are more common in the starting areas), nor to be dropping everything without the right perks. I've had it since launch (not beta) and played with one other person on a team for only exactly one hour (a really fun hour!) because I just prefer to play solo. I'm with those that miss the companions from FO4 (I didn't need to say a word to them if I didn't want to) but they wouldn't work well in this game.
---
tldr: If you enjoy the fallout world and basic mechanics, get it. If you want a dense, heavily story-driven world, imho, you may find it a bit lacking at the moment. 
---
Just so folks cant vats me. Sometimes I can't get my barrel sight over a good cover so you gotta stand. It's not Meta I agree but the fact it's just broke makes it worse
---
Neat little shop. My only note may be to lower your painting cost significantly. The Nuka ones especially since those can just be found with a mission and aren't "rare" so to speak. 
---
I approve haha ;). 
---
I love all of this, in fact I can only see one problem, a side-effect.
---
Those Whitespring Turret CAMPs are all getting a huge buff, going to make destroying them more of a pain.
---
Yeah, scrapped my responders police cap ages ago and now I'm stuck running Morgantown events forever until I luck out and get a replacement
---
There's a couple of them out there. I've camped at two different ones with nodes, one with steel, the other with acid. 
---
Why would it not?
---
&gt;name only removed when transferring between players?
---
The name is on your client, probably even stored clientside. It won't get transferred anywhere.
---
Not exactly. They still have to hit with a Crit activated. That and it uses the Crit so if you come back for another round they won‚Äôt get to Crit you again.
---
The advantage it gives is psychological, not tactical xD
---
I can see the stimpack if they run the 90% reduction perk and have hundreds and cant store them, but stable flux? Why not stash that up?
---
&gt;  at least some of the perks you threw out will be commonly considered meta 
---
First rule of the Fight club - dont talk about the fight club
---
There's over 40 hours of quest content in the game if you play at a reasonable pace and don't get side tracked into that much exploring.
---
I'm level 60 and I've got only about 15% of the main quest done. 
---
But the content will increase over time. So if you want more content, you can wait and see how the road map progresses. 
---
That would be good to, I tired off needing three wood floors in a row to set up a stair case
---
Yes! That is very close to the Vault 51 location. I initially included it but deleted it b/c it is after all holding a picture up and not, as I first thought, marking a map location. So that may very well be part of the Sheepsquatch Quest. Or it may not! We'll see!
---
I got you but the risk reward is not worth it :-)
---
Right. 
---
I appreciate that!
---
Or they can do like me, sort vendor inventory by price. 
---
Yep. As well as many others.
---
Server hoping will place you on like 3 servers so it is not much working. To be honest i don't find way how to do it in week. After 500hours of grind and knowing most of pro things.
---
I need a S.H.E.D right meow.
---
I hate throwing things away. I know this is a softcore survival game but my game play feels like an intervention on the Hoarders TV show sometimes.
---
This is a common gripe of mine from Fallout 4 too. I would love to see some ‚Äúmenu toggles‚Äù in the Pipboy that give us control over over VATS behavior.
---
Sometimes science is more art than science. Lots of people don't get that.
---
Oh yeah you can, second characters and stuff or if you look into it before you start levelling
---
I haven't complained about shit dickhead, I love survival. You're just full of shit and I'm calling you out on it.
---
The game was definitely playable, I played it for 100+ hours in the first 30 days of release and despite a few nasty bugs had alot of fun
---
Yes
---
Easy or hard to do, I just don‚Äôt have the time this week to get it done. I already have an M79 bloodied 50% limb, but an instigating one would be fun for pve. Maybe I can buy it off someone later.

Ye, some people want battlefield76 some CoD76 i want the sims76.

Ha haa.... Gary....
---
Grahm's pool is actually liked with the Watoga train stations pool and the responder bot is a part of the responders pool...not sure on the lemonade stand bot
---
here you go!
---
Yeah there have been several times where I have killed someone and gained zero caps. If they kill me, they get 300. People are abusing the team system to dump caps on a friend and then see what they can get from other players. 
---
It seems they let one member of the team hold all the caps while the others hunt people down. Instead of killing a team and getting caps from all of them, you get zero from all except the cap holder. Any caps they do get, they just give to one person. There needs to be something in place preventing you from gaining caps if you do not have enough to cover your own death. 
---
*begins artistically standing in a green, scummy puddle of irradiated water*
---
No, I'm also a sniper build.
---
 I'm "salty" because you just spewed a bunch of blatantly false shit that sounds like you haven't even played.
---
Would be nice to have that flag on server disconnect. I have had a lot of times - including 4 different times during the Fasnacht event - where I have lost connection or just plain crashed to desktop and not been able to rejoin where I left off. This is definitely on my wish list.  Even just a 5 minute delay that held your place on that server would work.
---
Yeh i personally go for a pump, seems more accurate than the rest... Maybe just pure luck but close to medium range always seems to hit the target. 
---
if it was a battle royal id immediately uninstall and reinstall FO4
---
Sounds like you really should.
---
I just think it would be funny... maybe dressed as a clown...lol
---
Well maybe Lydia could show up in WV. She‚Äôs sworn to carry out burdens.  Then again, she‚Äôll go off and attack sleeping scorchbeasts with her skisword. 
---
Lol, I play believe that. You on xbox you inbred? 
---
[QuadReal](https://www.quadreal.com/)

lol
---
I will fight to the death defending our right to be insane junk hoarding hermits in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
---
yeah same, I never bothered to actually turn them over or anything. 
---
I actually don‚Äôt think the crits are a big issue.  I haven‚Äôt really bothered with them in PvP.  Right now you‚Äôll kill someone in vats before they can react just by spamming shoot with the concentrated fire perk.  The auto aim mechanic is just really OP for PvP.
---
YEAH YOU WANNA 1V1 BRUH LMAO
---
I'm hoping those vault raids will be instanced. Once you're in, you're in. No one leaves, no one new joins once it starts unless it's to refill the roster. Much like WoW raids used to be.
---
It's related to speed demon right? I lost it and my stuff seems to expre about normally.
---
Not to be rude. But 800 pounds of weight storage is plenty. If someone can‚Äôt make that work. Then maybe it‚Äôs time to assess what really matters to be kept. If you‚Äôre a hoarder, well it‚Äôs time to compromise. If you‚Äôre a trader time to start being smart with what your selling.
---
I agree with that. Half the people I kill have no caps and no aid. So what am I really gaining?
---
Sounds like something people would abuse the fk out.
---
There doesn't need to be any reward for killing a player other than maybe leaderboard or ranking. I'd rather there were events in the game where killing players would prevent them from obtaining a very valuable resource of some kind.
---
That's just your opinion. I enjoy doing the daily at Camden and still enjoy doing Biv's daily's
---
It looks like exp and caps are different but the strings for the item rewards are the same. Unless I‚Äôm missing something. 
---
And there‚Äôs the rub, there shouldn‚Äôt be an ‚Äòoptimal‚Äô build because then you alienate the a lot of the player base...? Additionally, if you don‚Äôt have the perk at level 3 of fireproof or you‚Äôre a starting character, where‚Äôs the fun as a team of four sat in the hills and snipes you?
---
It does not make an audible clicking noise when you crouch down. It is arguably stealthier than the armor version as nobody can hear you go invisible. You can also stand and jump without losing invisibility. Hiding behind cover, watching in 3rd person, and jumping out of cover allows me to shoot people before they have a chance to realize I am in the air.
---
Some might say they're... daily
---
800 is plenty.  yall need to stop hoarding items.
---
When you say ‚Äúbarely any damage‚Äù do you mean you survive 4-5 hits instead of 2-3? Because with a high endurance and solid amor and perks (but no legendaries) you only survive for a second or two under fire. 
---
Not that I‚Äôm complaining. I played survival and lost lots but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I just went back to adventure and pulled my aid out of storage. I don‚Äôt play pvp games much but every time I have it‚Äôs felt just like this. Someone sees you, they fall off a ledge turn around and headshot you (without vats) before they hit the ground. 
---
I'm not sure I want to cross the bridge if the price inflates to something more intimate than a wave.
---
"This means they will not kill players in one shot"
---
Oh yeah... because that was a problem EVERYONE was having ALL the time...
---
I dont have caps because i always buy stuff like plans, should i be debuffed? Because if so its unfair to put people that dont use cap mules with those who do.
---
Salty downvotes ahoy, but you're 100% definitely correct.  It's the same reason, the same *real* reason, why they didn't bring in human NPCs, and everyone knows it really.
---
&gt; 800 pounds of weight storage is plenty
---
No it isn't. 
---
Especially with the Legendary Vendor coming. If you stock up on legendaries for turn in from a week of farming Watoga/Whitesprings your stash space is effectively halved.
---
Sure you'll trade them in at some point but you'll keep accumulating them.
---
i would like stuff without broken glass.
---
Where have you been?
---
I was watching a few Twitch streams this week to see what the hard core are doing in Survival. They are one-shotting everyone and getting one-shot themselves. It's fucking stupid and pointless. There are way, WAY better competitive shooters out there, and Survival is not playing to 76's strengths. I have no fucking clue why anyone at Bethesda thought that a game that has obviously not been balanced for PvP needed this kind of PvP mode. 
---
76's PvP damage model is not very sophisticated. The game's grindy, extremely luck-based endgame itemization favors a very small segment of the population. This game was quite obviously not designed for competitive PvP, so Survival with its leaderboard and "seek and destroy" gameplay feels extremely shoehorned.
---
I love PvP, and I love competitive shooters. Survival is not competitive, it's not interesting, it doesn't leverage anything that's interesting about 76, it's just fucking stupid and a giant waste of design resources. Bethesda can do better than this.
---
I initially thought it was a version where the entire map is in it's nuked state, but that would make launching nukes in regular adventure mode literally pointless. 
---
It was a concern. No need to be snarky. 
---
Dude I'm level 47, don't horde shit, don't trade shit, and I have like 615 pounds of stuff in my stash space.
---
 What are level 150s with multiple builds supposed to do?
---
I totally agree with this. I make a new character to play this mode, and it's ridicules to be show to other play (mainly high level) only because I'm focusing stealth to release my quests. 
---
They should go into debt, and everything they collect while in debt will automatically be sold to vendors to return them to zero....no more legendary hunting until they are in positive caps.
---
you really think the haters are of the community?
---
Healthcare in the US doesn't work because the vast majorit of it is Govt. Funded and Insurance companies are the hospitals customers, not the patient. You wanna make it better? Privitize healthcare. You can't make it free.
---
Holy shit this, AND A DAMN FAST TRAVEL MAT. So everyone stops living in my floors. 
---
Could be a cute jab at the lore of finding random items in the Fallout 4 lunch boxes. 
---
I agree, but . . Alas I cannot help myself, I found a trap base . . . Indestructible infact. 
---
So once I lay my traps and turrets I wana test it out in pvp. But after that I think I‚Äôm gona just actually play the game lol
---
I like the nerf it makes my automatic handmade op in survival. ;)
---
Lol bot sure you know what your talking about. 
---
And run around for six weeks expecting a bullet in the back AND loss of weaponry? No thank you. And that's coming from someone who lost 5k+ caps in the Survival Beta.
---
Yeah, they need to get on this. The last patch closed a network loophole and killed the chatmod. It made the game tons better. I'd like to see them just buy that mod and integrate it directly into the game.
---
That‚Äôs your choice to keep everything you find. Play your way but that shouldn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúdamn I‚Äôm full. Devs increase the size.‚Äù  Find a compromise somewhere. 
---
I think you need to include it since there is a string connecting to it. If it were just holding up the picture i think it would be standalone
---
Okay so for #1 they will stack, but they are a stack, not an additive. Ie if you have 2 20% ammo weight reduction perks, the first reduces weight by 20%, then the second reduces the remaining weight by 20%. That way you can't get all 5 pieces with 20% reduction and effectively make your ammo weightless. Instead it would be reduce it down to 37% of the initial weight. 
---
For #2 having troubleshooters does affect your whole character, not just the part of you covered by that specific piece of armor. Again those stack so if you get all 5 you're only reducing it to 44% of the total attack damage they would initially do. 
---
I think the haters are frustrated fans who wanted to like this game. Being unwelcoming to their opinions isn't helping. Especially for players like myself who like I said is on the fence. 
---
Well you can't put the camp on the train station. And people do that anyway in the surrounding areas xDDD
---
Same but with water, if anyone knows of one near water I‚Äôd give you an exclusive once in a lifetime opportunity for a shiny orange arrow
---
I have a lvl 35 3* AAE, and a lvl 45 2* TSE.
---
Looking to trade for RA or LL armors?
---
Thanks, but if you still hate me i definitely understand 
---
It really is pretty crazy. 2-3 shots, is as deadly as a melee weapon up close and spraying
---
Awesome look forward to seeing if i notice any difference in my rate of plans or combat armor. 
---
Do we have a rough loot table for this?
---
Sad fact is that you are right...
---
My main is melee but I keep enough perk points in perception so I can switch to my TSE handmade anytime and still be deadly. Also the ammo is more common and quicker to produce in a pinch. 
---
I have the drop a grenade perk, wonder if they'll ever add a clown horn, be freaky hearing that sound then the clowns come out or just stand there haha. 
---
Probably more than you I‚Äôd have to assume. I understand the nerf was intended to balance the game, but from my view, it‚Äôs definitely shifted power pretty significantly 
---
We probably shouldn‚Äôt continue this conversation here because it‚Äôs off topic. Your right his other video had probably 50% way too fanciful ideas. Here he‚Äôs mostly mentioned comments you‚Äôll find elsewhere on this sub. 
---
Keep levelled players with in reasonable groups on a server. Don‚Äôt allow players to take high levelled characters over to the survival. The leader board should show players by most kills rather than time spent alive. That was a very good point, because all you have to do it commit suicide and your at the bottom again. There were a couple more reasonable issues like that.
---
That would be fucking great
---
This wouldn't be able to work unless you added either additional slots or subslots, or variants of each legendary mod so that you cover the bases of each receiver, scope, etc.
---
Deal with the burden of having multiple builds?
---
Again Play Your Way. Too much stuff? And have trouble balancing the weight. There‚Äôs the caveat. Tradeoff of playing that way. 
---
Yeah but do you ever expect melee to be good in PvP without cavalier? People can just Vats on to you and spray with any automatic weapon anyways
---
I had little problem with this honestly. I fast traveled then sprinted away and hid and lurked away to safety
---
A carrot?
---
The brotherhood is commandeering this tech. For America. 
---
What discoed chat do u use to trade
---
Side note : you have to holster your weapon for it to work as described. 
---
There will always be an optimal build. Whether intentionally designed or not. 
---
Even in a highly balanced game, players will find optimal strategies if not involving game mechanics involving things like Human reaction time, human psychology, and the like. 
---
You have to look at the realistic nature of game design. Optimal strategies occur, its inevitable. You can argue we should try and close the gap, but ultimately there will be unbalance and when going into a scenario where you will face those optimal builds its helpful to know about counters to them. Which the optimal builds are probably running. 
---
If you want perfectly balanced pvp then a competitive shooter or a fighting game would be a better pick, where things are engineered to be as balanced as possible. But that approach wouldn't work for F76, because its an open world exploring game, the only way you could perfectly balance it would be to remove builds entirely, because its functionally impossible to make all the perk cards perfectly equal in power. If you remove builds entirely, and make pvp a mode where everyone is as equal as possible all the time, why not just make a new game? 
---
These are some awesome changes.  How will the items they are selling in the resort be affected?  Meaning, if we go to the Harper's Ferry Vendor at the resort, will their plans be the same as if I actually went to Harper's Ferry or will they have different items for sale?
---
So your suggestion once you reach a high level is that you can't care about any new perk cards? *That's a stupid idea.*
---
You are AWESOME (and obviously know your stuff)! Thank you very much. I would be happy to have different types of prefixes to get the 15% overall from the various types of enemies. This is very helpful to know. Thanks again!
---
this reminds me.. i still need to drop of all my .308 and 10mm at vault 76
---
Thanks Eckserah, I will add you in game and come to you when you're online if that is ok.  Got some caps for you even if you don't want them :D
---
https://discord.gg/TmZEud this one. It‚Äôs really good but you have to add everyone in game and it‚Äôs a bit fiddly. Would be much more secure to trade in game. 
---
According to this post, [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5e4rm/a\_question\_about\_speed\_demon\_and\_speed\_boosting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5e4rm/a_question_about_speed_demon_and_speed_boosting/)
---
People say that speed bonuses cap out at +25% apparently.
---
Maybe when player vending comes out. 
---
Currently, it is such a pain to sell them, and advertising on Xboc LFG posts invites people who just want to destroy my base. 
---
I use cav and people can punch right through it. And the intention is not to run though an open field at your enemy. If you take an equal power melee player and pin him up against an equal power guns player, if the two players are right next to each other, it would make sense for the melee player to kill in 1-2 swings. 
---
Currently, it seems you get free swing that doesn‚Äôt do nearly any damage, making it a 2-3 swings. That 2-3 swings, up against a 2-3 rapid fire shot, you‚Äôll never stand a chance. 
---
Glowing deathclaw gauntlets would be cool. Each flux gives a different glow and a different effect. 
---
Dude, you're literally arguing against increasing stash because...people should be frugal with their inventory? 
---
What is your stake in this debate right now? Why do you care?
---
I don‚Äôt agree
---
Absolutely my friend. I had the same problem when I started and couldn't wrap my head around the best way to set up your armor build, but with a lot of research and a bunch of already made maps, info, and guides from the reddit community really helped me out. So I figure I should spread the love. If you ever need more info on something I'll be happy to share what I know or look it up if i don't 
---
I see what your getting at, especially with armour mods and I was thinking add extra slots, especially for armour but don‚Äôt have variants of each mod otherwise getting tse weapons or bloodied furious weapons would be to easy.
---
My thing is what to do with my extra legendary weapons and armor. I sell almost all of them but I‚Äôve collected some that I want to keep to possibly try out different builds or play styles, and they add up. I‚Äôm hoping the new legendary vendor provides a clean way to deal with this. Junk, Aid, Ammo are all easily replaceable but it‚Äôs those legendaries like a 45lb Gatling plasma 3* that I just can‚Äôt part with :-)
---
Right now the only option seems to be making an alt and muling these off-build legendaries over for safe keeping.
---
Okay but why? 
---
Yeah, server hopping, but I got around 3-4 every hop.
---
Just got back when survival mode came out, so missed the whole parade deal.
---
Definitely! Just some different variations of what's already there. 
---
Git Gud
---
On a real note though, I don't use a bloodied build but some folks over on the discord do and they would probably be happy to hel you out. You can access the server via the side bar.
---
You could, you know, not be a condescending tool.  I have a mic and still have trouble communicating with some folks, that's not always a sure thing.  Yes, I always make sure my chat is set to area.  
---
The modes in beta anyway, you know theyre gonna polish it up
---
Sounds like a bragging rights achievement tbh. WoW has many many many of them.
---
Heavy metal is the best by far. The only things that deal energy damage are a few robots and the laser turrets in silos. The popular weapons used in pvp are all ballistic damage only, so heavy metal is the best armor.
---
Buuuuut, if you don‚Äôt use the revolver you don‚Äôt deserve to use French ops
---
Think about some of the TV you watch, and their content warnings.
---
Now apply those same warnings to cartoons you watched, which probably still run somewhere.  You will get at least a V, possibly more.
---
Whats the premise of most of those cartoons?  Kill something.
---
Now consider popeye/olive/brutus.  Brutus the cigar smoking, beer swilling ruffian, fighting w/ pipe smoking popeye over the "attention" of Olive.  Even some kidnapping in there.  
---
Thats not a G rated concept.
---
  Most of the bugs bunny stuff was written in the 40s/50s, Obviously, societal norms were different then, so smoking, racial stuff....all sorts of things that are not PC are scattered all through those cartoons. 
---
Current cartoons may be a bit more politically correct than what I watched, but still feature something other than "talking it out" as a method of confict resolution. 
---
Superhero cartoons, movies, and deriviative toys.  Whos the target market?  ADults that wnat to see modern versions of their kid favorites, and kids that want to the action.
---
TLDR
---
What TV/games/movies do (10 year old) boys like?  Blow things up and kill stuff.
---
What do we do in most video games?  blow stuff up and kill things.
---
What system?
---
If he's using Explosive weapons, use the fireproof perk card at Max in Endurance. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
80% for second rank I believe, so it scales linear which is nice, but for big building projects I usually run my hunger and thirst down to nothing even with the perk, so I just end up starving for my craft.
---
I get it. I run assassins sentinel with an automatic handmade and when people with melees hit me it doesn‚Äôt really do much at all. Then I just light them up with my handmade. But if you can one shot people then people can easily just use a dragon or gauss rifle and one shot them. And if you can one shot people then someone could sit in a house or train station and camp just one shotting everyone that walks in
---
In PS you can‚Äôt go into 3rd person! If you can please tell me how!  I have tried so many different ways!!
---
Doesn‚Äôt. You can crouch and jump and it won‚Äôt disable chameleon either 
---
they are frustrated gamers who wanted to like the game. they are people who played fallout new vegas and 4 and modded the shit out of it. They are people who was spoon fed lore like a baby cause an NPC told them. They expected content from other mmo games with a fallout skin on it.
---
Real fallout fans knows that the best lore of fallout isnt told through NPC's. It is found in notes, holotapes and terminals. They know the fallout games never had end game content. You just clean up side missions, explore, or build.
---
I usually just drop water and food.  Maybe a stim and radaway as well.  
---
Awesome post lol.  Anyone with egg head would look like humpty dumpty then?
---
I am  at 1104 hours
---
Yes thumbs up this needs to be addressed. What I did to combat it was paint all my gear that  I didn't want to disappear. Two reports of my friends said they found there gear in there bags when they never dropped them ever. So always check ur bags and paint ur gear. So u get a warning not to drop ur valuable gear. Had one piece painted for a long time no problems then when I took the pain off and traded it it disapeared.
---
Username checks out lmfao.
---
Yeah, I thought so too. But I mean... I guess some people will just sit down and play it non-stop like people do/did with WoW as well so.
---
Yeh, I never play in a team.. I don't like sharing caps lol. Shotgun builds are decent but 76 has awesome sniper builds, which are great for all parts of the map, I only use shotguns for close combat or interiors.
---
The map is massive compared to FO4 so there is plenty to explore and funny things to see/find.
---
The building is fun to say the least, I don't build a huge camp as I Pvp, that way if it get found and destroyed its minimal costs to repair, so I make literally a camp but the camps some people have made are awesome, you have to see for yourself.
---
Its well worth a go and I'm yet to be bored and there fixing minor bugs with every patch, plus there is a lot to come in the next couple of months. You've come just at the right time really, I'd say stay away from survival though, until you've played a bit. See how things work and mess around with builds. 
---
I am on new character, but what friend loses focus on is bloodied isnt just melee. I have my new one set to 15,8,15 just first three because now i can do bloodied melee, heavy gun, non auto/sniper by crouching and hiding and sniping them in pvp with increase damage.
---
I let it go inert and drink it, I currently have about 200. Let's me have more water for crafting.
---
If you couple it with ghoulish it acts as a minor heal as well.
---
Why are u getting thumbs down it is unnecceptable lol. Hopefully bethesda fix this fast
---
I appreciate the honesty lol. It‚Äôs true. I use to run wanted all the time and I would hate being crit‚Äôd by a good dragon and being one shot out of now where. 
---
But I did have to realize I wasn‚Äôt invincible. At least with the way things were before, everything had a counter. Now it just seems like if you‚Äôre not running a handmade you‚Äôre at a disadvantage 
---
Not trying to be snarky. Just commenting the obvious. 
---
Now that I'm thinking about it, probably half my camps involved cliff edges.
---
I'd end up shooting them anyways, I had to put a mask on Hancock in fo4 just to stop shooting him in the face. I see glowing eyes or messed up skin and I go ah! zombie! and fire. Fo3 was difficult LOL in the end after making my caps underworld is always cleared. 
---
That is why I originally thought making the entire grounds a safe zone protected by an invincible robotic security force. There is lot's of possibilities out there, that's for sure.
---
Serendipity in LCK and Dodgy in AGI will be your best friends. Max them out as soon as possible. Damage mitigation is **much** more important for low health than damage resistance, IMO.
---
The touch pad, tap it 
---
Imagine if there was an actual economy with supply and demand built in, who really wants all those hats? 
---
robots I guess :P
---
Have to redo Endurance but this is my build for new character

Only 6496 more to go! xD   
---
Impressive though :P Only game I've played for 1000 hrs+ or something that I know of is Metal Gear Solid V, maybe Minecraft (but I have no way of knowing with all the different modpacks I've been playing so idk how many hrs I have in total)
---
The plague was the catalyst - without the plague and the beasts, Appalachia would be the same dysfunctional mess as the rest of the wasteland. Nobody cooperates elsewhere really, but they get by well enough. But in Appalachia, when the Scorched came, that highlighted their inability to work together. It took them by storm, brought out each of the factions' individual weaknesses, and killed them all.
---
PLEASE GOD YES
---
I agree, the mic doesn't always help anyway.  I've sat there and wasted my breath trying to talk to someone who doesn't want to talk, or doesn't have a mic.  Would be much cleaner to just throw up an emote, drop the gift and be on your way. 
---
It doesn't even make sense to stop playing because of "this".  If you don't like survival then stick with adventure.  The changes it has brought makes it so much better for the player that wants a friendlier environment.  I play a pretty good mix of both but griefing in Adventure is getting harder and harder with these changes.  And that's a good thing.  
---
Yeah.
---
I'd say that's even true in Adventure Mode.  I like the benefits of Dense against Scorchbeasts, but Fireproof accomplishes the same thing, so I don't see why Dense needs to be such a rarity, barred from the scrap-to-learn system.
---
Good to know. Thanks!
---
Battle Royale: Statistically, you'll lose a lot.
---
&gt;	deal with the queen by ourselves 
---
Once you launch a nuke on the queen you definitely won‚Äôt be by yourselves. 
---
There are; Responders, Raiders, Whitesprings, Enclave, Watoga, BoS, and Free States. A total of 7 factions for a total of 1400 caps. So you can sell all of your stuff to one vendor at Whitesprings, and then also at Whitesprings you will be able to view each factions unique item pool. Without having to hop all over the map. This is going to be... interesting. Unless they set the fast travel point to inside, the constant nuking of Whitesprings is going to make it hard for the sub 50 group to take advantage of it. On the other hand, it will now be more of a trading hub, and people could theoretically set up their own shops around Whitesprings. It's going to become the next Diamond City lol.
---
&gt; Learn how to counter builds 
---
How does one counter a build when they are dead by the first shot?
---
Real fans? This is the gatekeeping I'm referring to. Don't forget that. Instead allow them to vent, send then you reply "okay, a lack of NPC is something you didn't enjoy, I get that, but here's what makes it wonderful" instead of "real fans get it, you don't, end of story."
---
i think the backpack is coming with the Scouts quest.
---
It should just make base sieges much more dangerous and costly, so encouraging people to be hunted in the world.
---
Wouldn't it be awesome to be able to build camps in grid pattern?  That way you could build your own settlement?  I mean that would be an amazing thing son.
---
If you go to the Isolated Cabin near Vault 76, there are two notes left behind by a family for one of their relatives called 'Ghoul Note' 1 &amp; 2, it says that there is a city in the Capital Wasteland for people just like them and they're going to DC to help those ghouls rebuild. So it could be that the ones that weren't slaughtered by people escaped Appalachia and traveled to Underworld in Capital Wasteland or maybe even went to Necropolis.
---
Because I said I lost something. Might have dropped or sold my favorite gun with a new silencer for my stealth sniper. Even if I did why could I. It was a favorited legendary. 
---
Looking forward to this! Love the cryptid content. Hopefully there‚Äôs some fun secrets to find.
---
u/valseek any chance patch 8 will fix the railway rifle so that it benefits from weapon perks? :) 
---
Are we expecting any of this next week? The road map doesn't have anything listed for the first week of April so not sure if we're just expecting a patch next week and then the quest/player vending on schedule for the 9th or if everything ls going to be the 9th. 
---
Ffs, I'd just be happy with a localized place where you could find what you want, and not have to bounce around 4+ different sites. 
---
Bethesda missed a huge opportubity by not hosting some localized buy/sell/trade site, or adding the option in game at start.
---
I was so worried that I made a typo, just to realize Bethesda being Bethesda. Whew!
---
There's a random vendor bot?
---
Its a joke 
---
I think this is a connection to the ancient dwemer heads from skyrim. Deep underground? Look like they have been there for thousands of years? 
---
If it comes down to your first point where you point at strategy and reactions (that most gamers have) then that would be balanced. 
---
But to say you need x, y, z, setup when there are players straight out the vault who won‚Äôt have that tech, but their cunning and reflexes will be present that would be a much more level playing field. 
---
Also, card games and strategy table top games and RPG like Dungeons and Dragons, Vampire The Masquerade etc have much more balanced battle systems. Poor design cannot be justified by ‚Äòit‚Äôs a RPG‚Äô or they should make a new game doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs a new Survival mode that we meant to have all the elements of a tense player battle focused RPG, not a Fortnite clone...
---
All I‚Äôm seeing here is justification for duping and bad design choices that have led to this unfortunate state of affairs... and that breaks my heart as I actually enjoy Bethesda RPG‚Äôs and I didn‚Äôt / don‚Äôt hate 76 adventure mode either.
---
Give you varying things when you turn it in.
---
If you're using power armor then try emergency protocol chest mod
---
If not look into evasion, barbarian, junk shield, iron clad
---
Nerd rage is key either way
---
I was thinking something u pay for so there is less cheating
---
No. Would be terrible for the game
---
So based on you other replies about the best armor types, my goal moving forward would be to look for 3* legendary robot armor, which I can mod up with deep pockets and whatever other mods make it stronger, and to look for the prefixes, majors, and minors to get the added effects wanted. Does that sound right?
---
You know, i thought the next one was the scouts quests, i forgot theyre seperate
---
True, just frustrated after doing it repeatedly that many times in a row just to get a bunch of grenade ammo I'll immediately drop off at Watoga.
---
Well thats another thing. Bloodied power fist plus your resistance plus perks.
---
How much for the right leg unyielding 
---
Yeah, but salmonella poisoning and explosive diarrhea
---
I swear to god if the Sheep mask they‚Äôve been teasing is a rare drop.
---
Where are people shocked that PvP servers force you to, well you know, PvP?
---
I was really confused for a second, then consulted with Lord Google. Yes, I guess I do.
---
I did that in Fallout 4. I had a bucket in my settlement  full of Holotapes.
---
Well if you wanna be smart about it your post says the handmade is the best weapon and melee is weak when clearly it is opposite. üòä
---
If you aren't using the revolver on Monte you just need to stop playing.
---
Ill be on in 5 min
---
i rly hope they gather much info in the beta to solve all of this.
---
I actually don‚Äôt mind the PvPing so much now I‚Äôve adjusted my build and perk loadout a bit, but there‚Äôs no point In being a stealthy sniper if there‚Äôs a big green target on the map - I don‚Äôt have the patience to crawl all over the map.
---
That sound effect was always a dead give away. Ok, jumping behind cover with it on would be pretty good. Noted.
---
Kill it with fire
---
You know I just realized that this is the fallout 76 subreddit and not the rainbow six subreddit... shit
---
Okey dokey, how many caps do you need? 
---
Where did I say anything about perk cards?  Builds are more than perk cards. 
---
If you carry 3 sets of armour and the guns to those armours and can‚Äôt pick up a tin can? Sorry your play style is hindering your progression. You knew doing so would catch up to you. 
---
Yeah the devs said increases to storage may come. But right now is not needed. We have backpacks coming very soon. And the vendor is around the corner. Yeah you can hoard stuff to sell to it. But if your play style is getting in the way of that, then we shouldn‚Äôt be rewarded for so. 
---
Xbox 
---
Actually, that's where you're wrong. Your version makes it easier but adds a downside that hurts over all utility and freedom of choice.
---
By using your system and expanding it to have the variants; you retail that freedom of choice and utility, while increasing the item pool and thus making it harder to obtain the desired item of choice, and also stimulate the ingame economy.
---
It has a sound effect? That‚Äôs cool. 
---
I was with you until you got all misogynist. Quit making being a girl a diss. You sound like a jackass. 
---
And one for when you accidentally do something(like shoot someone on accident)
---
We really need personal rooms at the white springs now - 
---
Let us buy a room for X caps. As we enter the world, we get assigned a random room at the hotel and others can visit us. When player vending becomes a thing, BAM! Everyone's happy. 
---
I get that just wasn‚Äôt sure if the effect was just to player v player. And not otherwise. The last part seemed worded oddly. 
---
Ace work champ!
---
There‚Äôs a vendor bot that spawns outside the Charleston train station and a couple other places that has a pack Brahmin and two eyebot guards. You can get some rare plans and cosmetic items like the Hunter‚Äôs Longcoat. 
---
Are you PvP'ing?  
---
Yes: Then yes.  You shouldn't be engaging in PvP if you have no risk to lose anything, or the other player has nothing to gain by winning.
---
No:  the debuff doesn't affect you.  The bankruptcy debuff is -50% damage vs Players.  
---
High five ‚úã 
---
Sounds like your having a ball lol, I‚Äôm sold and feel a purchase coming on üòÇ
---
Yeah go down se of the map. The fissures make level 80's. They're actually nerfed compared to how they were when the game started. Not really challenging with the right gear but the mirlurk queen is a fun fight. She's really tanky.
---
I fear too many camps in close proximity might be more a CPU usage issue/performance issue though. Same way if you just keep endlessly building in FO4 it becomes a battle of how good your hardware is to keep going. It would be dope if it worked though. 
---
You mentioned 1000 earlier. Ill take that. Sell you a nuka cola or something
---
It‚Äôs happened to me a few times in the savage divide and cranberry bog. Where were you at?
---
I want to say there's one with water under it in the Mire near that church with the ghouls in it. I'm at work though, and can't double check.
---
Depends on where you are.  There are fissure sites all over the map where they actually spawn out of.
---
If you stay near a fissure they can continually spawn.  If you go to the far south east of the map you may find half a dozen flying around and more coming with each kill. 
---
There is really no need to be near water.  Just plop down the water faucet in your camp.  If you want to collect water quickly (as you would  at body of water) just go to the faucet and drink and while the water is pouring out, just mash the collect button.
---
Its not common, but it happens more than enough. Also, dont know if I would use the Goose as the measurement of scorchbeast quantity.
---
Thank you I was hoping I wasn‚Äôt the only one feeling like this (I was thinking about it while I was playing Apex with my friends we kept dying and I was annoyed by the Constant loading into a menu wait for everyone to ready up and was thinking why don‚Äôt I just play fallout survival mode with my friends and we load up fallout 76 and it was some of the most intense fallout 76 session i have every played because we had to always be vigilant and when we found another group if the had guns out it was on but if it was one guy not with guys out we would trade)
---
Perhaps, but I'm less sure. Plus there's other pins and arrows beside just that one which match to interesting points on the map.
---
So there's the 'Vault 51 pin' by the sheepsquatch sketch and on that same picture there's an arrow that points to roughly the Marigold Pavilion by Point Pleasant (i.e. Mothman territory, though he seems to be hanging out at Johnson's Acre). Then there's the pin in the lower left with the picture. That seems to roughly correspond with an unmarked microfissure north of the Flooded Trainyard in the Bog. There is a pinned picture in the lower left but that pin is off the game map but most closely corresponds to the Beckley Mine, but I don't think that counts.
---
Ah forget the pvp.. The 20% xp is where it's at! =\]
---
Can you mod it?
---
The plague served as the catalyst - without the plague and the beasts, Appalachia would be the same dysfunctional mess as the rest of the wasteland. Maybe a bit better off - the Responders were doing pretty good work. Nobody cooperates elsewhere really, but they get by well enough. But in Appalachia, when the Scorched came, that highlighted their inability to work together. It took them by storm, brought out each of the factions' individual weaknesses, and killed them all.
---
Honestly, I thought the Scouts quest was coming before the cryptids quests so it surprised me as well.
---
Yeah that's exactly right! You can usually find the robot armor 3*s for anywhere from 2500 to 4k but expect to pay at least 5k for limbs and 8k for chestpieces in combat armor. So if you see one for any cheaper that's what you want, be sure to check that its max level of course, and then buy that baby up!
---
I used the Red Rocket and stashed all my tapes in the desk with the terminal. I built a filing cabinet next to it for all notes. Then one locker for armor, one for outfits, and one for weapons. And a footlocker for all the really great drops I had. 
---
Aahhh I miss stash boxes with a separate list. 
---
There's one with a junk node just a bit east and south of Point Pleasant.
---
I used to hate fighting three scorched beasts at once but now that they fire their attack a bit slower they‚Äôre manageable and even fun. 
---
No armor should make you invincible. You are getting killed because that is what happens in PVP.
---
What's the point of adding all the faction vendors in one spot, if they're now all sharing the same pool?
---
Yeah they didn‚Äôt make too much of a dent in my health in level 30 power armor and I‚Äôm very thankful for the level 35 two shot handmade the parade sloth blessed me with. 
---
LEaderboard has to go. I want a survival mode, not necessarily a deathmatch mode
---
Where are you in the main quest?
---
Its just a skin for the normal bat, whatever mods you have on your normal bat will still be there and you can mod after you put the skin on the bat.
---
I'm far from invincible. Did you read? 
---
I have not even looked at it yet, damn.
---
Can I have whatever drugs he's having?
---
I never really realized you could store notes. Neat.
---
I have multiple TS guns without explosive. 
---
full screen
---
Why is that?
---
It's their method for letting you see how many hours you've played.  I doubt they expect people to actually hit that mark.  
---
They do spawn in threes more than I would like. I have no issues killing them, it's just a giant waste of bullets and time.
---
I play solo most of the time,and I like it.  
---
Its different than FO4, but you'll adjust.
---
  I used a shotgun early on for those small annoying flying things, but now I just have it around as a backup, as I found other weapons to be more effective.  (in part because by chance, I ended up with a melee/sniper build)
---
You could always try using your microphone? No?
---
Two shot will still arc. I have one and it does just fine. And yes the explosive effect removes the arc. I find two shot stuff alone way more that explosive. 
---
Send me an invite to your lobby
---
Okey dokey. I have a new mission. Now to build up caps.... I‚Äôve been on a buying spree lately :).
---
Now that's what I'm talking about!
---
Yeah, I doubt people will have the patience to play for so long xD
---
Hour tracker. It‚Äôs smart
---
I just keep around 43 health with rads. But like mookish said.. Serendipity works good.
---
There's a whole horde of ghouls wearing civil war outfits, with no hats, driving that market.
---
Haha I like the word. 
---
Don't use workshops and you can 100 percent avoid pvp.  
---
I mean who cares about pvp when you can relive your childhood of hitting your friends and siblings with a wiffle bat.üòÇ
---
Aw damn so you weren't the same guy. Good to know others have the same mindset too! Its extremely generous and helpful, so thank you for your good work.
---
Also, I reacted the same way as that kid. As soon as I saw the amount, I started firing randomly into the air after a love emote.
---
And no leveled HP gains
---
Yeah kinda wish the loot was better after all the 5.56 rounds it took. 
---
I‚Äôm over 1/10 of the way there. So it will take me about 5 years lol
---
Where do i turn it into i think i have one?
---
I feel like there's been times where I vendor-out my cap pool and log-off, don't play the next day, then log on the following day and timers are still fucked.
---
I'll say it differently and we'll be in agreement. Its not a wise thing to do.
---
But it's not called pvp mode beta it's survival mode beta?
---
I had three over my camp south of Alpha. Totally unprepared for them when I went to drop such junk off. LOL
---
You call killing players in a pvp mode griefing? Ok 
---
This will greatly impact the trade price of serums. You can sell them to vendors for more than players
---
Or free? They added a 2nd PvP emote for free, why not a simple gift emote?
---
You‚Äôre in luck, today‚Äôs Behind the Vault says every vendor (except Modus) will soon be available in one stop at Whitesprings. 
---
Me too, I keep my health at 19.5% to get the most out of unyielding and bolstering armors. With food boosts to HP, I'm usually at 51 health.
---
They are a great way to gather resources and CAMP plans. People should go grief on the PvP server. It exists now. 
---
Bethesda shiuld fix it so that they want to be there, also.
---
Can you remove the skin from the bat? Im interested but dont want to paint my lego bat then be stuck with it.
---
I was actually really far North. I spawned in at Sunnytop Station. 
---
Nah too many freefrags to little challenge, gotta hint em
---
My sentiments about the game in general ü§™ !
---
I'm on hiatus for awhile, hopefully going to pick it back up after the smoke clears.
---
There's a quest called Forbidden Knowledge that pops up. If you don't have it in your journal, you can't turn it in yet.
---
If I‚Äôm correct there are about two fissure sites not too far off, one by pumpkin house and the other by the ammo factory.
---
thanks this helps
---
You the guy from discord that did that in depth tinfoil analysis of this when the roadmap first came out?
---
That's what I did.
---
Those values are server side which is why they look the same. You'll see most values are set as just 1
---
Oh ok thanks
---
That was Bethesda being generous. I don't know if that would happen again. Maybe, but I don't have much faith in Bethesda after 76. (Yes I know 76 is an okay game now, but I don't praise dev's for fixing something that should have just worked)
---
Don't quit at a station. When you come back on, try to figure out where the current meat grinder party is.
---
I've noticed that not every station is camped, cause how could it be?  People start grouping up around one station and that's the grinder as they get stuck in a cycle of spawn killing and revenge.
---
Whitesprings is a very popular spot for the grinder but I've seen it other places occasionally. 
---
I tried to build a church for lowbies to use as a pit stop. But I‚Äôm a minimalist builder so it always comes out messed up. 
---
Mostly to fit the theme. I try do it at least once a day if I have stuff to give. 
---
üòÅ guess that wasn't clear, I meant player vending, and having to flip through RD/FB/Discord posts, or find some rando in game wanting to trade things.
---
If you are on XBox I will either buy your 40mm ammo or sell you a two shot grenade launcher. 
---
I ended up fighting about Six near glassed cavern around the launch of the game, it was the only time i felt like I had to put on my PA, its got the medic pump and keeping an eye on my health in all that chaos was impossible for me üòÑ
---
That‚Äôs where my focus is on survival. Forget sentinel, I just run around with no aid and 3 regenerating armor pieces. 
---
Will be in touch if needed.  Much appreacited for the offer :) Thanks
---
I was only doing one. So I should be stacking two?
---
Btw when the next patch hits in April, they are going to put a vendor from each faction (except enclave) in the whitespring resort building, making it unnecessary to fast travel the whole world to make your day's money!! Heres the link https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1DeZX4Po9S2ApD1Sr4Tosu/inside-the-vault-lying-lowe-questline-preview-and-patch-8-highlights this will cover what I was talking about and everything else to look forward to, including being able to personalize the names of each item!!!
---
I want armor and weapon displays like they have in Skyrim
---
I'm pretty sure the ones that survived would have ran away.
---
Hope mods come to the consoles might fix some issues
---
Proper procedure is that team member enters the spawn and scouts it before rest of them moves. There are groups out there hunting and solo players besides the elitest elite are chanceless against those groups that are well coordinated.
---
Workshops should not ever be safe from pvp, you should not be able to join a server and claim a workshop indefinitely.
---
So just because i buy stuff i want and plans to get better gear for pvp i should have a debuff for said pvp.
---
I dont really get the sense in that. Im not a level 200 with like 20K, im level 18 and enjoying survival, but to give me a debuff on a mode i play just because i spent all my caps today on the heavy leather armor set for example sounds idiotic as far as game design goes. 
---
Survival mode is a damn joke.
---
I‚Äôm stuck there too. I‚Äôm level 55 I think it would be easy with a small group but on your own it‚Äôs hard and to top it off I‚Äôm melee too üòÇ
---
It might just be you. My buddy has this mutation and was showing it off to some new kids yesterday. Worked as supposed to. 
---
when pistol builds become more viable then prices will increase but until then still about 250 to 500 caps
---
Yes, part of my buying spree were mods for my ultracite and x-01, so being able to name the chassis is going to be great. I never know what I‚Äôm pulling out when I pick Power Armor Chassis from apparel :/.
---
I wear outfits myself (Enclave specifically) so I don‚Äôt bother with actual armor paints.  Never see them anyway.  But I am wearing full BOS Heavy Combat.  Personally don‚Äôt like the look of any of the armor.  Too open around the joints.
---
Yes! Why not? I've seen weirder things in the Wasteland ;)
---
Now I can sell all my top hats in one place hehe. 
---
QE pump here.  Never needs reloading. But when you eventually do have to reload it takes longer than the Dragon lol
---
Theoretically, the majority of players aren't hundreds of levels high with godlike weapons and instant-kill weapons.
---
&gt;  It would just be great if PvE and PvP were completely separated. Workshops included. 
---
That's what I've been saying too. And it's not just because  I don't like PVP. I might like it were it not so completely broken in this game, especially with how it applies to workshops since 2/19 patch. 
---
There's a handful of builds out there that are borderline invincible and nearly all other builds are useless. 
---
There appears to be no way to effectively set up defenses against people contesting. 
---
Didn't they announce this? I remember reading about weapon &amp; Bobblehead displays.
---
Yep which sucks because I really want to play fulltime in the mode otherwise
---
Well I will have to buy it right when people get it then.
---
I'm online whenever you are
---
So then I guess my question is again, how do you know you get a better chance at items if the values are server side?
---
yup!
---
I'm sorry but 800lbs is not enough.  I'm a builder and I also have been stocking up for player vending and the legendary vendor and that takes space.  We can carry a great deal on us but without perk cards it's 10 times heavier in our stash.  We need either a larger stash or some kind of offline storage like has been suggested.  I plan to ditch items if the way the vendor works doesn't require them but I don't want to give up perfectly good items that I could use because of a limit that is just too small.
---
Are you still trying? I can help if you're playing on PC.
---
That's your opinion. I, for one, bought this game expecting to play an online version of fallout, not have a bunch of teenagers grief me when they get bored. No one can claim it indefinitely, not with server disconnects and life happening. Besides, I have always shared what other people need, even if it means I had to go find more for myself. I would be okay with limiting it to one workshop per player, as long as PvP was removed.
---
Which trade forum do you speak of?
---
No thank you, not true.  In some situations it is necessary if you want to play the game well, but you have to do it right.
---
It would be cool thats why I want the pistol. Right now its just not very viable. How has it been going for you?
---
Different dude my friend. I just matched the places up to the map and my educated guess is that given the locations and theme of the quest we're gonna run into some cryptids like the Flatwoods monster (space station), Mothman (Johnson's Acre), the Wendigo (Hopewell cave) and the Snallygaster (West Tek) and probably others (Behemoth from the trailer).
---
That‚Äôs the problem. I don‚Äôt think it should be a world that persistently forces people into conflict. Why can‚Äôt it just be the normal Appalachia with elevated risk. PvP wars at the train stations are fun and all, but my favourite moments have been when I organically run into another player out adventuring.
---
The risk of other players is always there, I don‚Äôt think the game needs to give targets to try to make is some sort of quasi-battleroyale.
---
It wasn‚Äôt a two shot shotgun it was a shitty pump action normal shotgun lol I was only level 16 
---
100% agree here. Physically represented mutations would be so great
---
Thats not too bad.
---
Sorry for the losses. 
---
Yeah letting people carry their over the top weapons and armour in there beta or not wasn‚Äôt a good or smart choice. 
---
Thats a cool idea
---
Even my most played game, Garry‚Äôs Mod, only has about 6000 hours.
---
Jist give them a giant vaultboy head
---
I switched on the subtitles because I could barely hear them
---
Minecraft... you're talking about Minecraft. Jk does actually sound fun
---
Ah, alright. Thanks for the advise! I'll try tweaking the price points.
---
r/76marketplace
---
That's my point. If we are going to have a completely broken combat system, then please stop those broken people from wrecking le after I just spent half my junk setting up a farming operation.
---
Workshops are limited in both modes, thus PvP should always be a way of getting one because that way everyone has a "fair" chance.
---
No reason you should care especially. I'm not having a dig, I've just never heard it before. I don't think it's very much of a saying outside your immediate circle. But there's nothing wrong with that really, just makes I sound like you misheard "holier-than-thou". 
---
Nice drop! Maybe he was worth farming.
---
Yes it is removable
---
Just run. The theme is to feel hopeless as the BoS did trying to that mission. 
---
Good to know, thanks for your insight!
---
Is there anything worth selling that a low-level player can find? 
---
Whenever I look at a vendor they offer like 2 caps for the garbage weapons I find. The weapons are worth more to me as scrap. How are people clearing 1400 caps per day in sales? Everything I own probably isn't worth that much, but maybe it is because I am only L20.
---
Lol it is called survival if your were killed and body looted in real they would take everything you had on you money and items..again survivallllll..
---
Dude I wish it worked like that. People who eat chips while on their mic could morph into molemen
---
Ah, I hear you. Maybe as a cravat, players in game who don‚Äôt use discord will be more likely to dump legendaries they don‚Äôt want in this new vendor hub. You‚Äôll probably never find and thing super fantastic, but at least it‚Äôll all be in one location. I sell a lot of two shot weapons I don‚Äôt use but it‚Äôs hard to decide which vendor to drop it on incase an interested party wants a novelty weapon. 
---
That would be fun
---
I agree, I thought that tone meant I was about to get slaughtered in survival cause I‚Äôd hit the wrong button, gave me a jump scare lol, I would love a happy care free noise if we have to have a noise lol
---
Dude I understand. I started the game as the Powa Arma Farma and would regularly have 15 to 20 suits so I could keep my team equipped with the best the could use. Was such a pain in the early days to set them as fast as possible or actually drop them all and spend 30 mins climbing into/out of/swapping gear on suits before being able to leave. 
---
Thanks for the info, I just bought it :)
---
That sounds like a blast.
---
Min/maxing is a problem in D&amp;D, the 2nd edition books actually mention it and how DMs should counter it. 
---
Like seriously every edition has had build combos that absolutely break balance. But in tabletop you have a DM who can intervene directly on a case by case basis and custom build encounters. 
---
My original comment was regarding how people say TSE weapons are ruining pvp, when they aren't the sole reason. I gave an example of how to counter explosive weapons.
---
There are many systemic issues like the respawning invincibility being too low. Damage across the board being too high, some effects stacking too well. Cap loss being doubled, aid item drop being generally a bit high. Being tracked on the leaderboard. All of those are issues that need addressing, and don't increase the tension. 
---
Wanting a level 1 character straight out of the vault to be able to compete with a level 50+ with good gear is silly. Thats not how the game works in PvE. You naturally get stronger as you play, thats the core gameplay loop in this game. You're complaining about the mode not being X, when the mode wasn't designed with that goal in mind.  You were never intended to be able to bring a new character and compete with pvp focused builds. But even then some players have been managing to do alright doing that. 
---
I think our disagreement is I think you're asking for conflicting ideas.  You want player freedom and perfect viability and balance. You can make perfect viability and balance but you have to restrict player freedom or build options. You can have player freedom but then some builds will be significantly worse compared to others. 
---
This isn't a problem unique to Bethesda, every game developers making games have to tackle this problem. Some games decide balance is more important than choice. Competitive shooters that limit or remove loadouts. Competitive fighting games Others choose choice, like D&amp;D and many tabletops that give you tons of choices many of which are suboptimal. (Like building a fighter with low con, str, and dex). Some games like league of legends do a bit of both(and sometimes fail at both) giving you alittle customization initially but limiting certain aspects. 
---
In summary you can't say I want perfect balance and all builds to be equally viable in each scenario regardless of players choice. Thats asking for the moon. You can ask that they fix broken aspects of the current system that hurt general gameplay, fix spawns, rebalance damage. 
---
There's nothing fair about PvP in this game. Usually, I'm getting griefed by a group of 2-4 people with bloodied builds who are just bored. It's just as easy to hop a server and get the same one that isn't claimed already.
---
Limit it to one workshop per person and then remove PvP as an option. I can't go into and claim your CAMP. Same concept.
---
Well enjoy your pipe dream, because PvP will not be taken from workshops.
---
You want the care bear hand holding, go back to fallout 4
---
we know ..we know..this is not FONV part 2

I don't mind the vendor changes, it will make it easier to hit the limits on days I'm in a hurry. But I feel like the flip side is people need reasons to explore the map. I know I have set farming runs around the vendors and really neglected 90% of the map. Now that can easily be 99.9% of the map. I would almost prefer a unique vendor at the north of the map, to give me a reason to be up there. Having a player hub is great but we need reasons to explore and re-explore.
---
It's not care bare hand holding. It's the broken PvP mechanics in this game. 
---
You must have the patience of Job.
---
Thanks Eckserah!
---
Wait 
---
That thing changes sound effects 
---
*loud crashing sounds as i run to my gaming system to buy it* 
---
I‚Äôm actually shotgun, but I‚Äôm still at a disadvantage unless they land
---
Sentinel assassin is extremely powerful due to the stupid idea to make weapons all have the same damage to enemies. 
---
It‚Äôs 3 hits to kill a normal person and 45 to kill a sentinel assassin person on a good day. 
---
It wasn‚Äôt like this before the new combat system.
---
You know that you can unequip that perk card... right?
---
More C.A.M.P. walls and decorations? Absolutely!
---
I would love to build my own castle.
---
Plays awesome solo, especially if crafting and camps are your thing. 
---
Never pick up new loot after dying until after you retrieve your dropped loot from dying. 
---
I bet you are literally a child who enjoys engaging in the exact behavior I'm describing. There's nothing childish about wanting to be able to enjoy a game without being harassed by other players. PvP is broken. When 2 people can take on me and my 20 turrets without even getting a scratch on them, it's broken.
---
I ran like a little bitch. It was hard and I used up a lot of stim-packs but I got that and ran to The Glass Caveren. lol 
---
Also why did they change where the bag spawns? Before when you drop items they appear under you but now they appear in some random direction and if you drop more items the bag goes starts teleporting around.
---
If you use stealthboys; you‚Äôre making the game not fun
---
It could be a proximity thing. Like the radio broadcasts. If your in the area of a camp that has a ‚Äúquest‚Äù you can tune into the radio to head what the quest is looking for and what the reward is. So say you need lead, I wander close to your camp/radio tower and it advises me you‚Äôll pay me 3 caps for every lead scrap I bring you up to a total of 300c. Then I can choose to go caller lead and deposit it into your camp, or just ignore the possible quest and continue long whatever I‚Äôm doing. 
---
&gt;CUSTOMIZE YOUR GEAR WITH ITEM RENAMING
---
This was the first thing I asked for when I first left. 
---
*I believe I picked the right time to pick the game up again*
---
Goodluck out there though and I hope you make many caps!
---
Everyone would have the same fear though so people would run around in hand crafted leather armor and use pipe rifles which would then shift the focus to skill level and not time played/gear aquired.
---
Lol get over it you can still lose side 
---
I‚Äôve met a few women on Xbox. At least 20 or so. 
---
West Virginia belongs to the nords!
---
They lose 400 when they die and a level 3 can 3 shot them.
---
I don‚Äôt blame them for having 0 caps.
---
I was eating my tea sorry, invite Coming your way
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs Beta 
---
The flamer. And the missile launcher. Actually the missile launcher isn‚Äôt too bad with the right perks, I just think it should do more pve damage. I may as well punch them, way more powerful. 
---
Im a builder as well so dont BS me. My camps are HUGE. Wood concrete and steel isnt that much. 
---
https://youtu.be/S0Kd6yvFhpw
---
Also you should be storing stuff when you rebuild. You are not gonna BS me about building takes a lot of weight. Maybe back when stash was 400 you may have a point, but not now.
---
What is taking up a lot is you storing items to sell/legendaries. You are still hoarding. "Gotta hold on to this for whatever future reason." gotta stop.
---
It's a very dark camo. It's easy for me to see the difference when I apply the two next to each other. It really depends on if you want a dark camo for that many caps. (The pattern is the same, they just changed what's filled in with what and possibly made a graphical adjustment to make it appear darker.) I like it personally as a dark power armor paint.
---
Unless I don't remember correctly, I'm pretty sure I spawned my camp somewhere close by to repair my stuff.   And I'm pretty sure I switched worlds once because of 3 or 4 scorch beasts being up.
---
Yeah but hinting is all im willing to do, i ruinied two characters figuring everything out myself. Time and effort is not going away for free on my part and i'll bet you think the same.
---
I said basically the same thing and people jumped all over me but clearly the two shot explosive weapons are still an issue if they are so widely used and obviously still overpowered. 
---
16 is too low to PvP.  
---
Up to about L30, leveling can be slow - it picks up pace after that, as you'll start facing high enemies that yield more XP.
---
I was 20 before I went to the toxic valley, 30 before the ashheap.
---
Also around 35, with power armor, a good weapon and a supploy of radx, radaway, and either stimpacks or cherry nuka cola, you should be able to venture into a nuke zone.  The enemies will be much tougher than you've faced before, so @35, try not to carry too much junk the first few times.
---
The western side of the divide can be difficult, especially if a high level has been though (go back later if the enemies are too high), and the mole miners behind top of the world ..... yea they kick a 16 all over the map.
---
I'm @ 200 hours, and made L49 last night.  
---
I just started into the eastern side of the divide. Havent been to the bog or mire at all.
---
Ill be back in 20. Running up the street. Forgot to make my carpayment lol
---
&lt;(  ^w^)7
---
My gf plays 
---
I snuck past them when I did it. Chameleon armor and sneak perks. 
---
I play with a woman who's in her 40s on xbox everyday I'm UK shes US. Their out there!!
---
So I've heard. Until it's fixed the PvP people are just going to stay on Adventure mode and grief people because it's more fun for them.
---
Yeah, my camp is right by there and other than running low on wood sometimes, I can knock those out pretty quickly. Also if you are in the farm with the corn, run to the river then go south down the river bank and you can get lots of snaptails. 
---
Oh yeah dude. I played when the game came out but I took a few month break and when I came back I wanted to start a new character. I did the parade from 22 to 34ish before it ended all the 35 legendaries I got from him have been a game changer. 
---
are bats 1 or 2 handed weapons?
---
No worries lol, ill see you then
---
Omg that‚Äôs terrible!! 
---
 In 150 hours of gameplay I‚Äôve met  3 women. Not a lot play fallout  (I‚Äôm PS4 btw)
---
Thanks.  Going to pass on that one.  
---
Are you arguing with yourself now? As lots if your points were similar to my own, the current state of Survival isn‚Äôt working as intended and it has been exasperated by duping and other such exploits. 
---
Anyhow, I have a life to live and we are crossing points and kind of agreeing. Balanced gameplay isn‚Äôt unique to one company but we aren‚Äôt discussing RPG‚Äôs in general, we are discussing a specific mode that we were told had an overhaul and addressed a lot of issues to give an exciting PvP encounter experience, but failed to deliver due to a known duped gun that the developers have been well aware of for months...
---
The vendor faction update is making the white spring into the player hub we‚Äôve all been asking for. Yay. It should easily become the ‚Äúhangout‚Äù spot for the entire server and make player trading a little more of a possibility. This is the best news nobody was expecting and now my most anticipated feature. 
---
Ill link you something. 
---
There's many women who play. Just have to find them. I know of lots on Xbox.
---
I'm a woman on PS4! I have a mic but don't usually turn it on. I'm 29 as well so we are close in age. I don't play with people often but you can hit me up if you need help my Tag is Tokuswag-753
---
PvP is too broken for it to have anything to do with skill. It's just based on which legendaries you have
---
There might be ghouls in vaults that had reactor issues, we could see them in the future
---
Mutants  and Assassin are just too low, Executioners is worthless in PvP, due to the damage system currently in place.
---
As for PVE, something like Instigating which works at higher health and at a better degree is much better for a sneak attack.
---
TS has no accuracy penalty when aiming down sights, keep in mind.
---
I wish I could say that I have only killed my Brahmin once.  It's really hard when she's surrounded by ghouls :(
---
Throw on awareness from the perception tree to view resistances. Check an enemy before you jump in PA. Then again after.
---
xb1 lvl51
---
I have not tried Survival yet, and I realize it's more than the name implies to the true PvP junkies.  I limit my PvP to Public Workshops.  So I would have to say I agree with you 100%.  When a crew rolls in to take my workbench I run like he!!.  If they get the jump on me, I come back at least once just to test my melee weapons on PA... I have gotten kills, but never won the war.
---
On a related note, I have to say I am glad the PvP started this week.  The rewards for work benches have improved, and I have not had an aggressive encounter with anyone, anywhere!
---
I like it, so I hope it stays a that way as much as possible.  I like meeting people in game, teaming up, seeing their CAMPs and giving them things they don't have.
---
All that said, when I'm holding a bench, I know the rules so no skin off my back when someone takes it from me.
---
Hell yes I would love some defense mobs for nights at camp
---
What platform are you on? This can be an easy quest depending on how you approach it. Completing Mayor for the day in Watoga can be a huge help as having the robots for that town on your side (or at least not attacking you is huge bonus) Also without spoiling it there is a way to complete the quest completely stealth.
---
I just havent even been playing. Waiting for all the dlc to see if the game will even be worth playing. 
---
U must not pvp I'm guessing? It's required for end game pvp. Of coarse...
---
Have you ever tried licking your own elbow? I can‚Äôt, but I had a friend who could, so I know it‚Äôs possible.
---
Alright, reinstalling.
---
Lol!
---
I think 2 handed
---
What!? Never seen him before. Is that the only place he spawns? I would love that coat
---
Once the Sheepsquatch quest drops we‚Äôll probably see the alcohol dailies get replaced with challenges like ‚Äúkill sheepsquatches‚Äù.
---
It‚Äôs a solid secondary, and it‚Äôs pretty good for non-melee characters to keep on them when they need to hit something in the face really hard. 
---
It was totally expected that god tier gear will show up and sweep the place. It is more like a death match in my opinion. 
---
What I just did is ate a crap load of drugs and had like 3 stims on me. I just ran hoping I won‚Äôt break anything if you are ps4 I can help you (psn is Krisiboy21)
---
Nah, it‚Äôs handmade meta lol.
---
The "Shotgun" Mod breaks the Tesla Arc, I have a Shotgun Moded Tesla and it doesn't arc. I believe that mod is under "barrel" but not 100%.
---
Good point i haven't been there in a while I go check
---
I did it like this.  I did it like that. I did it with the whiffleball bat:   a Whitesprings edition. 
---
that is what I thought also.   thanks
---
I have a Vampire Handmade for sale. 
---
Absolutely
---
They haven't left. They are still in adventure mode harassing people. They just wait for you to be in combat and run in front of you or for you to take a workshop because you want CAMP plans or need junk. Then they come troll you until you leave the server.
---
I found a blast charge looks like a plasma mine
---
"starving for my craft"
---
Found the art major!
---
Turrets aren't shit lmao, get some good gear and then maybe you can defend yourself. Stop asking bethesda to hold your hand and sing kumbaya
---
I do this numerous times a day... and still only up to Knight Captain...  Fast travel costs 17 caps either way... maybe you can get a few off the ghouls... but with the slow loading times it's a pain.
---
Thing is that CAMPs dont spawn continuous streams of useful resources , just bare necessities.  
---
No game worth time playing has ever had limited amount of resource nodes in it and not have them available to be taken by others via PVP.  
---
You either give everyone in the server a workshop, or you suck it up and you do your best. 
---
What you don't need 50 alcohol everyday?
---
Run to Glassed Cavern, the end, and enter it.
---
The quest tells you to go to the Transponders, and those are nice pieces of story and information.  But as you experiences, the area is full of Fissures and spawning Scorchbeasts and their army of Scorched.
---
Good thing is you do not have to hit every transponder.  Just the final one inside the Cavern, and a couple other objectives you will find there.  It really lightens the burden for a new player without great weapons to kill a lot of Scorchbeasts.
---
No I didn't, but thanks!
---
Luigi says:
---
If he‚Äôs red, he‚Äôs dead!
---
I absolutely agree it would also be nice to see clean warehouse pieces that aren't all busted and rusted.
---
Chit just got REAL!!!!!!!! Rocket powered wiffle ball bat here I come
---
Just because someone upsets you doesn't qualify it as griefing. You are in a PVP zone. Workshops are PVP zones. You are meant to fight over resources. It is a survival game. He have food. Me have stick. Me use stick on he. Now me have stick and food. Conflict is central to any good experience.
---
There are a couple other places but I can‚Äôt remember them right off
---
I want to use the instigating guitar sword - decent damage for a sub L50,   
---
 the twang on impact is amusing and strangely satisfying - even with swing speed perks, it's just too slow to take out most of the critters I'm dealing with now.
---
&gt;Are there any other women playing this game? PS4
---
You will be surprised how many do .. I run into them all the time.
---
I'm asking them to take you griefing assholes and put you in the kid's corner where you belong. I've been playing Bethesda games for over a decade and I have never had to deal with this CoD bullshit. Those of us that just enjoy RPGs and not the PvP part they are literally forcing down our throats should have that option.
---
All that does is remove the marker off your screen. Technically the game considers you still in the event
---
Just like any shooter based game, it does take skill. I'm not trying to be rude bro, but if you get one shot that often to have to make a post about it, i think its time you revise your build
---
It's just really fucking hard. Best quest in the game by *FAR* imo. Feels so god damn epic.
---
dont tell me what i can and cant do. They arent a fan. They are a gamer. I can listen and respect their feelings. They can have valid opinions about something.
---
That's like me (a new yorker) saying someone who took a vacation to new york, or lived in new york for a few years while in college is also a new yorker cause they realized how expensive and crowded it is.
---
No you are not a New Yorker. They are not Fallout fans.
---
I play daily with a 62 old gal .. she is fiesty but fun to play with, I have another friend who is around 34 and a 3rd one similar in age. You will be surprised how many gals do actually play.
---
Wmcg204

Maybe it depends what country you are in cause I never see any
---
AA is nice unless you are close to max armor penetration. Then it caps off and you may actually be wasting the effect.
---
For example:
---
**Rifle build**
---
Tank Killer (36%) + perforating magazine (40%) + AA (50%) = 126% armor penetration. Since that is impossible it gets capped at 99% and rather than AA netting you 28.5% additional damage it actually only nets you 13.1% additional damage. Any Armor pen over 99% is an utter waste.
---
**Melee**
---
Incisor (75%) + AA (50%) = 125% armor penetration. Once again the cap is reached and AA is wasted. This time AA only provides 24% armor pen and thus only nets a 13.6% increase in damage.
---
First rule of wiffle bat club.... 
---
I have a great build for playing the game. Bloodied builds are still ridiculously overpowered. There is 0 skill involved in buffing your character to hell and one shotting everything and everyone.
---
Sentinel assassin, and you are near immortal,
---
Anything less, and you are dead in 3 hits.
---
How often does your camp get attacked?  How many times have you had to completely rebuild?  I'm in a relatively peaceful area but I still have to do plenty of repairs.  
---
I sell off tons of things including quite a few I now regret selling.  I'm trying to get a full set of unyielding armor so I can make stronger sets of power armor so I don't have to repair them as much.  I have a need for the space and armor alone weighs quite a bit especially if you are just taking whatever you can find with the right effect. 
---
 Don't even get me started on how much weight it takes to make ammo for my minigun and .50 cal.  The more self sufficient you are the more space you need.  When you add in the current bug with how fast you get hungry and thirsty you need to carry even more then you did a few patches ago.  I'm not asking for unlimited storage but it feels like we need 1200 to 1600lbs of storage space total to be in a good place.
---
Once it turns inert, drink it.  No health benefit, but it weighs less than purified water.
---
How do you keep it around there in combat? I saw a video where someone's rads stayed at one point and after a hit the health would go back up
---
That would being interesting so like player made fetch quests but how would other types work like go here kill a bunch of blank and it would probably easier to code fetch quests. a player made fetch quest maker would be nice to have 
---
Maybe it's just ps4?  I wave to and/or talk area to everyone I meet and never met another woman.  
---
Agreed, get rid of the leaderboard. It is terrible
---
This is an online RPG, not an FPS. It has guns, but it is still and RPG. If they want the PvP crowd involved in the game so bad, then fix the damned PvP server. I love this game, the story, the map, the other players that also don't care for PvP. There should be the option to fully enjoy the game and not have to involve yourself in PvP.
---
You turn in technical data and cross fingers
---
I thought they meant they were combining all the cap pools at whitesprings. So the pool at white prings will be 1,400. Not all the venders pools were being increased to 1,400.
---
I have the healing mutation, so I have to use rads to maintain it at a certain point.
---
Yeah but the brahmin is the *real* enemy while you're distracted by raiders **BAM** brahmin stampede /s
---
I got so excited when I heard Doug Mellencamp (one of the programmers on SWG) was going to be the Studio Director in charge of FO76. I just wish there was more systems like the one listed above.
---
Fuck, I miss Star Wars Galaxies.
---
I've gotten it by handing in Technical Documents for the Brotherhood
---
there is one near a junk node plus a puddle of water under it also, in the mire.
---
Im a bit of a dummy, where do i turn them in?
---
Damn okay. Maybe I shouldn't find him, I might buy everything he has üòÇüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
YES! Please Bethesta this needs to be in next patch!
---
I‚Äôd wondered about that
---
AND you get two random apparel pieces out of a pool of like 20. But you can have someone hold him and hop in and out to get a new selection. This is what I did last night. 
---
It was epic. Even in death
---
I have my turrets right next to the spawn point.
---
It‚Äôs showtime.
---
I never have a problem. I usually use the come here emote and then shoot at the bag. But a gift emote would be nice.
---
Pacifist, or friends to help you. You're not going to avoid pvp 100% of the time, and that's just simply a mechanic of the game.
---
Ill say this till Im blue in the face, but they could solve 95% of the issues people have with the stash by simply making raw junk mats weightless and have everything else take up our space. It would eliminate this balancing at of wanting to have building mats or having other gear for that build we can switch on with the perk system. It would reduce the time the player needs to be in Camp dramatically by just being able to go to a bench, scrap all, deposit all junk in stash, and get back to what they want to do in game. It would not casue any more stability issues because those are tied to unique items and the actual weight limit would keep that in check since there isnt a long list of raw junk in the first place.
---
I like your system, dont get me wrong, but I think we still need a more organic fix.
---
I find that if you do the main story but don't rush thru it it's great. Explore every location you come across and mix it up a little by doing some events. Build an awesome camp over time and play with other people every now and again. Basically don't just focus on one thing, mix it up and it's great fun.
---
I snuck through the cavern too. Had to kill a few scorched, but the mirelurk kings and scorchbeast never knew I was there. I grabbed all the ultracite too. 
---
Then take it to the PvP server. Those of us that bought this game to just enjoy the RPG and PVE aspect should have that option. That is 90% of the game. Now that the servers are separate, and they finally have you PvPers and your twink builds spending money, give us PvEers our peace of mind back.
---
Mule character time?
---
Sort by value. Use the filters bethesda gave you. 
---
It is very unlikely for this to become a feature considering the fact that it would mean for them to build an entirely new system. So far they just tweaked a few values and called it DLC...
---
They tend to remain off mic's and hidden but they there, mostly because males don't know how to respect or talk to them. Was in a party with a group of rejects who asked a young girl if she was lesbian, some males just don't know how to behave like gentleman and you wonder why they stay off mics. I have at least 3 female friends who play, both my daughters play .. it's no longer a guys only world although may still be more so male dominant.
---
Not to mention shooting the paper bag  you left at their feet to draw attention to it. I believe that would result in prison time.
---
I like to have two industrial purifers so I get plenty of them to sell as I do my vendor circuit.
---
Thanks that sounds good. Any specific locations  that you found the most interesting or think is the best and what about loot is the loot good, what are some good locations for loot.
---
&gt;A good chunk of the Forest being a safe zone too would help
---
Please no. 
---
&gt;This makes train stations an obvious choice for safe zones.
---
Please yes.
---
I don't want large swaths of The Forest to be a safe zone because being real, the mire and ash heap look like shit and I hate going there.
---
Because it was their first multiplayer game, made by a small studio who IIRC is new to the company entirely. 
---
It's way easier for them to leave NPCs out and just write in a reason they aren't there.
---
Wanting a workshop and taking it from someone is not griefing.
---
r/Valseek, are you able (and allowed) to confirm that the full pool will be replenished if we e.g. buy a plan for 5600 caps from a vendor? Or will that only bring back 200 caps into the pool, like it is right now?
---
That's a fair point; we can cap it at a fist bump, if Bethesda ever adds that
---
Seriously I have said before how much you would make if you sold different ones in the atom store üòÇ
---
More likely she'll follow really close behind, then when you run into a lvl 80 legendary glowing wendigo she will help by blocking the doorway that you are trying to escape through. 
---
you turn in Technical Data at Camp Venture, however you have to progress in the BoS quest to Camp Venture (I believe it may be Fort Defiance but I think it's Camp Venture) and listen to the "Preservation of Technology" holotape first before you can start turning them in. Also, you can collect them in stack until that point at which they turn into a unique quest item. So make sure to stash any in your inventory first and only carry one.
---
I'm 182 myself.  I blame them.  Opt out of the beta if you don't like it but don't exploit it 
---
Ye I know a lot of the guys are really inappropriate and mean towards woman if I meet a low level that is a female I ask if she needs help or anything she can just come to my base and use all my resources etc
---
That's what happened to oxhorn. He got rode like a pony. xD
---
I have one
---
I use the huge cement defense wall, is almost like a castle. But yeah, legit castle walls that snap to a foundation would be cool
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying but the capability to zoom out above a point is already there within Photomode. Just needs adapting a little. 
---

---
Je vous remercie!
---
(I think that means thank you)
---
A basic chat Box is all they need but they apparently don't care.
---
 Apparently they want everybody to use Mics or those stupid Emotes.
---
I still haven't beaten it. No spoilers, but the ending is intense. I've refused help from my high-level friends on it. This quest has become my journey.
---
It's pretty random for me. Sometimes I can be on all night with no issues,  other times I can lose connection or crash anywhere from 1 to 3 times over the course of the evening.
---
It seemed like it was pretty stable a few patches back, I had several weeks where there were no issues.  Recently though it has been a crap shoot performance-wise.
---
I'm on PC.
---
Furthermore, this is not a singleplayer rpg, it was never going to be that and it never will be that. This is a multiplayer survival game, if you can't handle that then that's your problem.
---
Camp Venture.  Once you join the BOS (a chain of quests) any time you find a piece of Technical Data you will automatically start the "Forbidden Knowledge" quest and be directed with a Quest Diamond icon to the location of the turn in.
---
Get better armor 
---
I understand why they hide their voice it makes sense because their is so many ‚Äòweird‚Äô people on games like this 
---
None of the weight reduction perks or legendary mods affect your stash items, to the best of my knowledge.
---
Learn to manage your inventory, most items like cork/glass/concrete/rubber you need less than 50 of each unless your actively crafting with them. Most of the other items you can get away with 100-200. Watch for the junk that cant be bulked too, if im not paying attention I can easily end up with 400+ antiseptic, circuits or silver that I hardly ever use. The only items I hoard are screws and springs and I have 600+ of each and enough mats to fix all my gear several times and build a couple excavator sets and im still &lt; 700 lbs stash weight.
---
I make bullets everytime I get some lead and gunpowder built up, make combat/trapper armor when I got extra mats. The key is to not treat your stash as a long term unlimited storage space. Keep enough junk to fix all your gear once or twice and your set. Sell or drop the rest. Junk is everywhere.
---
So you want to reward spawn campers? Lol "survival"
---
No, it was a ploy to get a larger fanbase involved for the game, and now that the servers are separate, it should be separated entirely unless it is completely consensual. I paid money to play this game, and the PvP ended up being a side note after I installed it. I have the right to fully enjoy the game without worrying about someone else taking what I've worked for, and you have the right to go park your ass on the Survival server.
---
That's the biggest thing. For someone to swoop in and take the fruits of my effort out from under me, and there's nothing i can do about it because they have a broken build. Maybe if PvP was actually balanced then it would be tolerable, but the way it is right now, it's just asinine.
---
Dense torso modification and fireproof perk negates almost all explosive damage.   If you're still dying to it after that, it's not explosive that's killing you.  Next meme
---
Is that what we call em these days ?
---
That sounds awesome!
---
I got mine from a random encounter in the cranberry bog. It‚Äôs a bunch of dead Brahmin with some brotherhood scribes nearby.
---
Different factions sell different products 
---
You're right there, but I'm concerned that if there isn't a safe zone somewhere that can accommodate bases then player vending will be impossible in survival
---
Now I must state that the skin removes the visuals of the mods, but not the effects of the mods. It'll still be called whatever mod you have on your bat, for instance mine was a puncturing rocket wiffle bat. 
---
With the marsupial you should just get like really buff legs as if that's the only part of your body you work out
---
I mean it‚Äôs kinda unfair tbh for them cause they can be harassed by some stupid teenagers 
---
Best advice I can give you is literally log in and explore. Do the quests, participate in the events, join the discord chat channels and interact with folks.
---
There are separate servers now. They should fully separate PvP and PvE. I'm far from the only person that feels that way. There are two types of people that play this game; the original Betyesda fans, who love RPGs for the experience and story, and the CoD fans like you that use a copy and paste build fo harass other players. 
---
I'm not asking them to take you out of the game. Just put you on the server where that is SUPPOSED to happen.
---
That will definitely depend on how exactly player vending works, but I see your point.
---
Wear your power armor, that's what it's for. 
---
I liked it until you said no building. Crap to that, I love my nice green lawn on the South course
---
I have every mutation they offer thus far 
---
Glowing blood from nuked enemies, and glowing meat is easy cash. Also bulk your excess materials and sell all of that. Makes it very easy yo make ur daily 1400 caps. 
---
Also, I like to build marine helmets, they cost one rubber, one plastic and steel each, and sell for like 20 caps a piece.  
---
Craft a heap of those and sell them for the caps. 
---
Thanks for the advice do you have any tips for loot and good locations?
---
Then whats the point of pvp? No risk no reward, why would i play survival when it would be just normal adventure but zero cooperation with people. 
---
Actually you are gate keeping. Most of these fans who are upset have been with Fallout since the original Fallout. So yes you saying they "aren't a true fan" is very much gatekeeping. A more apt analogy would be to say someone who lived in New York their whole life, but doesn't like the Yankees isn't a true New Yorker, because that's what you're saying. I myself played every Fallout game except Tactics, so I feel my opinion is just as valid as anyone, but not more valid than someone who has only played FO3, 4, and NV. Those people have a right to be unhappy with FO76. Anyone who purchased a product and isn't satisfied has a right to be unhappy. You telling them they are no fallout fans just makes you and your side look toxic. 
---
Having all the faction vendors on one place seems like super overkill. The only time you need to visit all the vendors really is when you're making the rounds to get all your vendor caps for the day which is already being addressed by the shared cap pool. 
---
If only they had announced ahead of time how it would work....oh...wait....
---
I need to do this so badly üò≠
---
There* I‚Äôm so stupid what the hell sry it‚Äôs late at night for me 
---
It's supposed to happen on your server. your hissy won't change that. Once again, it is never getting taken out.
---
Go. Play. Fallout. 4
---
The usefulness of having a camp far far away from everyone and all of the train stations when playing this mode is unparalleled. 
---
The story will take you to the more interesting places on the map so don't worry about that, by exploring areas around the places the story takes you helps to get you leveled up enough to go farm the higher level areas for good loot. Best places to go for good gear are west tek and whitesprings but be warned they are really hard for low level players and the story eventually takes you there. I would follow the story until you finish the first factions (responders) missions and do some side exploration and by then you will have good stuff and should be able to go to some higher level areas. Look out for an event called Uranium fever by the whitesprings also, I'd try and do that whenever it comes up.
---
I have zero inclination to do Dailys.
---
The whole pvp mode was set up to benefit dumb griefers, if you haven‚Äôt already noticed. All the ‚Äòbalancing‚Äô rules were set up with nice loopholes so they are easily bypassed. 
---
Don't rush it. Take your time leveling up, it will happen if you just go. Explore the map, search for gear, craft better gear, mod your weapons... Gradually improve your character while exploring, getting XP fighting enemies, and learning about Appalachia through reading and listening to holotapes. As you branch out and explore, you'll get to a point when the enemies aren't much of a challenge anymore, so that's when you should explore new territory. If you encounter enemies that are too strong, don't bother trying to fight. Just run away and come back when you are the appropriate level.
---
Also, Make your C.A.M.P. work for you. You can plant some vegetables and set up a water purifier to help keep your food and water stocks constantly replenishing. Fighting low level Scorched can help you stock up on ammo. Revisit areas with first aid kits to replenish your Stimpaks. Divide your time playing into exploring and restocking.
---
Alot of rps have pvp, take World of warcraft as a good example. This game is no different. There are builds for pvp, such as mine. And again, if you're really that mad over it, go pacifist and get some friends to help you.
---
Asking for clarity as I‚Äôve spent too much time looking for these particular plans. Did you get them as a reward yourself or hear about it from someone else? Trying to find a solid lead for something other than hoping around plan spawn locations as that isn‚Äôt working.
---
I have never had anyone be inappropriate with me in fallout while in a team, thankfully.  Of course, I'm the one with the potty mouth cracking Dick jokes...
---
Honestly, the ones that call me MS. Username crack me up.  I get it a lot lately.  I've tried different times of day.  They are probably on nights and I am on days. 
---
What platform are you on?
---
Even before the release of alcohol update i said it was irrelevant content. I have the same opinion even weeks after release. But i am happy they are working on stuff that matters and that's all i want from them
---
Yeah I never heard anyone thinking it was gonna be a Battle Royale lmfao 
---
Do you play on ps4?
---
hahaha truuuuue
---
Nuke zones are pretty good for xp, west tek also isnt bad for legendaries.
---
Google will be your best friend for locating large amounts of specific resources.
---
Once again, join the discord. it's a good resource.
---
You should have a camera system that allows you to move the camera freely to keep the player in place with the camp.
---
Or
---
You can have the camp laying in place deactivated until you decide to deploy it.
---
I make a NEW camp that takes AT LEAST a day to build every week or 2. My recent one took me like 3 days.
---
This link is to a creen shot of a ticket of 4 camps lost because of the new build areas. All fully built camps. A day each.
---
http://imgur.com/a/r3KPdn5
---
I had to build a 5th camp https://youtu.be/3nHfnFbnAnY that took about 2 days
---
i tore that down on saturday. Started sunday and finished on tusday my new camp https://youtu.be/S0Kd6yvFhpw
---
and here you can see SOME of my other camps. http://imgur.com/gallery/rZnrbRB
---
I ddint take pics of all the camps I made since beta.
---
You are not self sifficient, you are self indulging.
---
With a prime LMG and adrenaline.
---
We should be able to change turret targeting like on the nuke terminals
---
Snipers need a hard counter, they do too much damage even when in a fuck ton of armor, even without Armor Piercing. That's pretty much the only actual imbalance I've seen.
---
I say this as a sniper. I'm killing people I definitely shouldn't have this easy of a time killing. It doesn't need a nerf, it just needs a counter.
---
TSE version is a beast. Before the buff, it was... Interesting. It did, shockingly, less damage. Around... 72 or so. Destoryed scorched, but nothing too grand. Around grad bullet hose.
---
After the patch? Almost useless. Did... 40ish damage, multiple hit to kill scorched, waste of ammo, and also when I got it. I kept it in case of it getting buffed...
---
And now? 120 damage dealing secondary. Great for PVP and PVe on either a hoard of small foes or one big one. That and the heavy Gunner perks make this one of, if not the best heavy gun....my AA one star minigun beat it due to 5 mm being so common and a wooping 100 percent ammo dodge. Still, great gun
---
glad you had fun, thats what its all about
---
Cause it‚Äôs depends what kind of people are on different consoles no offense but from playing on xbox the community is kinda toxic I‚Äôm switched to PS4 
---
I did it at lvl 48 but I'm a 50 cal power armor build. I also didn't have 4 SB at the last bunker but did have 2 in the Glassed Caverns.
---
If you're on PS4 I can run it with you, I'm lvl 90 now.
---
It'll be a repeatable "kill the cryptid" task instead.
---
Same thing on normal non-primed ones. It hurts to keep losing ultracite full charge cores (flux used to make them) just because the game decides you should have 1 less. 
---
Yup, but when you get to the golf club she‚Äôll helpfully go inside and lead about 100 glowing ghouls out to you in the parking lot - all at once.
---
I can‚Äôt fathom how anything beyond a fetch quest would be feasible. But it would definitely be cool 
---
Can confirm. Just happened to me and a friend. Two Ghoul's spawned behind me, I killed them, we shot the heart some more and it closed, and has stayed closed. :(
---
[ ^uwu ^intensifies ]
---
Shiiiit. That questline pissed me off for the same reasons as OP‚Äôs and this comment totally flipped it for me, you‚Äôre totally right 
---
Did your friend drink his yet?
---
Go. Play. Survival.
---
The worst part is that most of you that play like that and insist you should be able to attack whoever you want are just compensating for the fact that you couldn't do that irl if you "tried your best."
---
It is broken, and they should either fix it, or completely separate it. I shouldn't be forced to play the one broken build in the game because you like to attack people that are just trying to have fun.
---
Oh wait. I get it now. You suck hard in survival mode. You CAN'T enjoy it because other people have perfected their broken builds slightly more than you have. You can't stay passive until the moment is perfect for you to strike. You can't bait someone into attacking you when they are trying to shoot a mob and then hit them when they aren't looking. You can't be a predator, so you'll just keep lurking in adventure mode ruining the experience for everyone that was so relieved when they found out PvP would finally be separate. 
---
If self indulgent is planning ahead and working towards a concrete goal then yes I am.  I know what I want, what I need to get it, and I'm making hard choices as to what I can keep to get there.  Quite a few of which I regret having to make after patches.
---
Obviously other girls play this game. I literally run into other girls every day when I play on PS4.
---
Any particular reason you were naked while running through the woods
---
dont pick the ultracite! it spawns more enemies
---
Have fun getting fucked at your workshop you entitled little brat.
---
They did not promise it two patches ago, assuming greed on their part is somewhat paranoid, given that they give out both free ATOMS and free content decorative plans. 
---
Check the Road map. They said it‚Äôs something they want to do and the first step is in game with the functionality of the Fermenter which says ‚ÄòItems to Display‚Äô. 
---
Can‚Äôt imagine it won‚Äôt, it also sounds like we can rename pretty much anything we want as it‚Äôs all client-side 
---
Geese come in gaggles.  Scorchbeasts, which are mutated from bats, would be a Colony or (sometimes, when in flight) a Cloud.
---
did your friend use his yet?
---
the same as f4. hold x to push and x+some trigger dunno if r1 or r2 to go up and down 
---
I saw four guys on a team camped in some kind of tower-CAMP. I checked the leaderboard and 2 of them had been alive for 9 hours. 
---
I just have one thing to say. Shit bucket.
---
When the hell was it promised two patches ago?
---
Item displays have and always were a planned part of either the April 9 or April 16 updates
---
It has its pros and cons, but I don't think a low Time to Kill is necessarily a bad thing. It's a game design choice, and I think this is a game that benefits from shorter intense encounters, rather than long drawn out ones. As of now the player with better positioning and the element of surprise has the upper hand which IMO is how it should be. If you extend the time to kills it makes stealth pretty much pointless.
---
Just got home Signing on now
---
WoW doesn't have a broken PvP system, WoW doesn't allow another player to come wreck you and your base randomly on the PvE servers. WoW has it's PvP COMPLETELY separated. Just like we should do here. Thank you for providing a great example that proves my point. 
---
For my team, totally worth it. Would have kept it up too if player vending would have come in faster. But now that we are all maxed out I only hold 2 sets for rando pieces I find in the wild, and then my x01, t51b ultracite, and excavator PAs. Still a bitch sometimes though. 
---
It shouldnt be caps at all, it should be something else, but not caps.
---
It's coming either April 9 or April 16 according to the roadmap.
---
Yeah, I don't blame them.  I've been a gamer since I played doom on pc in college 25 years ago.  There are times it's like playing with monosyllabic Neanderthals, but again I stand by fallout players are generally nice.  I just feel like a woman wouldn't treat me like I'm either a delicate flower who needs protecting or a useless noob.  
---
&gt;Build vending machines and flag items for sale. Simply set your prices and walk away to continue your adventures in Appalachia, being sure to capture all your favorite memories using the new functional camera. The vending machines do all the work, you just need to count the caps.
---
And it's fun as hell
---
I was in Done 7 two days ago, the doors were open. There was nothing amazing in there but obviously someone else was there before me. Finding Done 7 open is why I found this post.
---
You don't just switch. It's just a view for different leaders. The top three stay as the survival leaders.
---
It's an item in the game. It's there to be used. If that's your playstyle then its totally valid. 
---
Get a pipboy yourself. It's pretty easy. 
---
And some berry mentats. Can't VATS but it helps a lot. 
---
Yep.
---
I see I hit a nerve. It just means I was right. Go prey on small animals like the bottom rung predator you are.
---
You know, I've been a big fan of the targets.  I think they keep people moving and remove sneaking and hiding as a pure survival mechanic which is generally a good thing.  And I think you just talked me out of it.
---
That's what I've been enjoying about survival, that at the irl charisma perks wherein I try to talk people out of shooting me. The tension of meeting someone new.  I use my mic more now than I ever did in Adventure.
---
I think the targets should be for highest kills since last death.  Thats good info and is almost a rudimentary karma system. 
---
&gt;Everyone will probably have their camp there now, 
---
Why though? I mean having different faction vendors will be nice, when looking for certain things, but that's not a thing most people do everyday. What people go around to different vendors for is to sell to each faction to get their daily cap limit. Now, you'll be able to get the full 1400 from a single--*any* single vendor. Why put your cap somewhere crowded when you can camp somewhere secluded, a quick 1 cap hop away from some random train station and do all your daily selling?
---
Melee is hard at low levels. I  couldn't figure out how to level a melee character either (currently lvl 23). My current strategy is to use a rifle to kill as many as I can at range then melee the rest that manage to close. Once I am higher level then I will respec to full melee.
---
Also, I managed to get my hands on a handheld gun...great gun for taking out mobs at that level! Sort of hard to find though.
---
Minecraft/The Forest do this. Would definitely be cool to see in a new gamemode. 
---
Maybe Nuclear Winter? I'd bet that's going to be a more hardcore PvE survival experience, so that'd fit.
---
He wanted Fallout 5, not multiplayer fallout is what it boils down to.
---
Thank you. That‚Äôs just how I felt after listening to the transmissions and trekking there. I knew thr pain that paladin taggerty felt. Being a stealth marksman being spotted and knowing you can run to cover. Your pA core is low. Ammo isn‚Äôt working and stims are running out. 
---
Rest easy Paladin. 
---
I ran out of space hoarding 3\* armors and weapons. I plan to keep them until the vendor shows up and see what happens. I'm seriously thinking about getting a mule account because my friend doesn't play anymore to swap items to my alt. Maybe that's the point. The people running this aren't stupid!
---
It needs to be like birds chirping or something. Also they need to change the graphic for survival to be holding the bloody knife behind his back. Because that's seriously what it's like.
---
In any case you only go fetch the plans you want. And then it's done.
---
&gt; Whitesprings bots with 100% armor penetration, 100% accuracy, and 0% tolerance for bullshit.
---
But where will I farm Fusion Cores?
---
Bethesda have multiple community managers lurking actively in this discord and they constantly reply to questions and concerns on here üê∏
---
I've done this.  I met some kids in a team who said they needed ammo, caps, all the normal things you need to start off. I sent them off to collect matietals for me craft chems with and paid them for their effort.
---
I mean if you would be level 10 I would definitely help you out with some missions but if you are like lvl 50 or higher I‚Äôll just say hi and leave you alone 
---
TSE explosive is fine for PVE imo, it‚Äôs PvP where there‚Äôs a problem and Bethesda doesn‚Äôt seem to separate the two 
---
Well, clearly you're a chick magnet. 
---
Silvia and billings homesteads have enough corn and razorgrain to make well over 50 beer. Just do a run with green thumb there and you should be good to go.
---
Hah, of all the stuff you have listed, all I have even seen is plastic and steel. :P Either I am too low level or I have not found the right places yet! I'll look in to that stuff, thanks!
---
The world is full. Im queued to join
---
This would be an excellent way to "pay" for Power Armor Mod transactions with raw materials. I have been selling players T-51b torsos with Jetpack mods, and the resources are often traded to me. With the option to create a fetch quest, I could premake the Jetpack torso and list it in my Stash as the reward, and simply list the raw materials used to craft it as the quest items. I would love that!!
---
It‚Äôs already a thing, they all play in teams and crush single people 
---
Error after Tuesday patch. 
---
That‚Äôs what I do but I‚Äôm bored of doing it every day
---
Do you want to get in a new one and invite me? 
---
Just avoid workshops. It's that simple. 1000s play this game without touching a workshop ever. Its unnessecary ESPECIALLY if you are playing as an rpg. You know it will open you to pvp when you take it so complaining about something that you knew was likely to happen is fairly ridiculous. 
---
I can do that
---
Yes, yes, yes! A thousand times YES!
---
I thought they would have left, maybe some of them can‚Äôt handle it in survival. 
---
I'm a guy but usually have 2 women in my group I have about 10 on my list that play FO76 . bte xbox GT xDARTH BILLx
---
Dense combat armor. Turn those scorchbeast into zubat.
---
"Mooooom...my shit bucket's full! And bring me a hot Pocket and some g fuel!"
---
I used a toolbox for my legendaries. Because it amused me to pull a laser gatling out of that tiny box.
---
‚ÄúThank you‚Äù is simply ‚ÄúMerci‚Äù :)
---
And no enemies when in camp build
---
the golf fields are really large and if you are  not sitting on some resources you prob can make your camp somewhere and log in without problems xd
---
There is a ps4 community 'filthy casual ladies' with 30-40 of us - usually at least a session or two active any time I log on to play.
---
It‚Äôs bigger on the inside
---
I found playing the story up to Morgantown is really good the game teaches you just enough without spoiling the rest. At that point you have some gear ammo or weapons, junk and aide items. Plus you have some points in your special and perk cards. 
---
You can go anywhere, do anything, be anything but only if you have bravery and skill to do it. 
---
That‚Äôs where I am camped. Also a junk resource pile.
---
Fixed? It's not too save weight. It's so you can sell our value junk without it being op in the economy
---
It's all meh to me. Just saw a lot of people asking about it so figured I'd post. I'm trying to help but I get down vote brigaded for being me. I'm done with this place
---
That will get you like a whole 5 extra feet of distance on the ball.
---
I would just recommend doing other stuff at the same time. You'll get something good eventually. I had a long spell of no outfit rewards and then I got 2 PA paints and an engineers outfit all in a row. I'm back to a dry spell now.
---
We need more once a week events like that. 
---
This^ easy pickups of 25 purified is easy Caps
---
April 9th or 16th they said 
---
Won't work.  
---
1- it is server side, thus takes up DB space anyway.  
---
or  
---
2- it is client side, and therefore open to being exploited or altered by the user.
---
I mean, I'll take em if you don't want em.
---
No, it's ridiculous that the PvP mechanics and builds are so broken that the 100+ people with their broken builds can come troll me because they are bored. That was never what was intended for this game, and it needs to be fixed. I didn't pay money to play this game so that I could avoid the best way to gather resources and unlock CAMP plans. PvP is separate now. So for the PvE servers, they should either fix the broken PvP mechanics, or they should completely remove PvP as a game mechanic on those servers, and instead put limits on the number of workshops and the amount of time you can own one.
---
Save up and buy the plan for the mercenary helmet from someone (maybe 500 caps or so from a player). You will make your cash back instantly. 
---
Very cheap item to make bulk of and sell. 
---
Explosive dmg does nothing if you perk and mod for it. Dont pvp with pve mods and cards.....
---
Rifleman I believe. I get 9. With all of them maxed. 
---
No enemies should appear when in camp build mode. The ability to lose components is WAY to high.
---
That doesn‚Äôt break the arc. I use one for low level hordes. It arcs more if anything. 
---
I guess its in how you play. If I want melee, I log in to my melee character. If I want stealth sniper, I log in to that character. And so on.
---
Just like sex...every little bit helps ,lol
---
Omg please no. I'm still working on selling off 200 pounds of crap lol
---
It made me realize just how real stockholm syndrome is and we all have it.
---
"fuck this event" *proceeds to do it 10 more times before bed*
---
Use pvp exposive cards and mods.......
---
With the new updates to The Whitesprings, that place is going to be a meat grinder if they don't rework some things. 
---
Player kills in the resort should get you banned from the premises for 48 hours, or all the bots aggro on the offender or something. 
---
Ah ok, great. So the further increase to stash space would be lovely. 
---
Are you in yet? 
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to give item rewards. Maybe buffs or stuff that isn‚Äôt really needed but nice to have. 
---
You're not been griefed you have something they want so they are taking it. That's the only real raider play in the game.
---
You can always go to another server, or get a hired gun to keep you safe if you cant defend yourself. 
---
The first thing I do when loading into a world is take the munations factory for the ammo and fast travel point.
---
Also dafuq have a flash sale. 
---
Its for the most part, separated. If you're having that tough of a time Get. Some. Friends. To. Help. You.
---
The ONLY reason you would be defending it is because you enjoy forcing people who can't do anything against you into PvP, because you are one of those bored assholes I'm referring to. Otherwise you would just chuckle and go to your PvP server. No, instead, you insist on being a predator. Fight someone who presents a challenge to you? Why, when I can just one shot these people who want nothing to do with PvP at all.
---
Does the keyboard work with other applications?
---
That would be awesome! Some modded low lvl rifles for new players would be cool. 
---
It remembers the last limb you targeted, so if you aim for the head it will remember the head the next time you use it.
---
Joining you
---
Yeah I've loaded about 50 times and looked the place over. No golfers.
---
I found one that sells by 30 and 35 if I put some perks with charisma but i only sells skeleton costumes xd
---
Right. They can't handle an actual challenge so they have to come harass us to boost their egos.
---
Yes. The keyboard works with everything except Fallout 76.
---
It was a decent repeatable quest. However I feel that when Bethesda does something like this again, the level of the legendary boss at the end should be determined by all the levels present, should scale accordingly, and be as big a pain in the ass as a SBQ or Mirelurk Queen. I never once saw that sloth last more than 15 seconds with everyone attacking. 
---
Doesnt it give you a warning message that players can attack you at anytime when you take over a workshop?
---
There was a guy that did a huge in depth analysis of this when it first came out, he matched all of the locations and found other clues not associated with the map. It was pretty highly upvoted on this sub when the announcement originally dropped. 
---
We are aware of this and I've brought it up before, but I'll bring it back up again.
---
&gt; To unravel this mystery, you‚Äôll need to chase every lead you can scrape  together, solve puzzles, and separate monsters from myths as you explore  who or what may still be lurking around Appalachia waiting for its next  victim. . .   
---
&gt;solve puzzles
---
I'm getting flashbacks to Skyrim claw doors. I hope these puzzles are actually *puzzles*.
---
NO THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WITH FALLOUT SINCE THE ORIGINAL! If you believe that then you are stupid. Some people have. Others may have played it AFTER they played 3, NV, or 4.
---
Pay attention to what I said. I NEVER took anyone's right away to say a valid point. Rather if they played all fallouts or 76 is their first one. Gamers play games. Fans make it apart of them. I never played any pre 3 fallouts, I know the stories cause ive read about them. I have no interest in turn base games. 3, NV, and 4, I explored the hell out of it, watched videos about it, read wikis. I preordered fallout 76 as soon as i heard about it because I knew I would enjoy finding lore, exploring locations.
---
People can make valid points and not be a fan. Just because you've played doesnt make you a fan. You have to make it apart of you.
---
**bro you actually dumb TSE is trash unless you invest in literally every single perk, Melee is where the current meta is bud plus. your bad if you need a TSE to actually win in a fight bud. ps your trash. pps suck my pp. :)**
---
The legendary creatures need to have stars next to their name for the survival mode challenge. The lever may have issues with the hotwheel if there's another lever in your inventory.
---
Thanks for he heads up, i won't even bother trying it. 
---
Nice try Todd I'm not buying atoms.
---
Umm that‚Äôs too low. 
---
one of those hard choices is a full inventory stash.
---
I had a suspicion this might be the case based on how it is listed on the mod spreadsheet, but I haven't seen any claims to this effect before.  How did you find this out?
---
If you‚Äôre set up right most things won‚Äôt live long enough to hurt you. 
---
You can also get most of the damage at around 30% health until he‚Äôs used to it. Especially with melee. 
---
Can you confirm that you learned it by scrapping the weapon, as opposed to say the mod?
---
I've had to defend a workshop from 3 scorchbeast once.
---
Is it a keyboard with drivers, maybe they got corrupt and need to be reinstalled. My mouse drivers went out the other night and had to redo them.
---
Practically all energy weapons.
---
I love the alien blaster; and all of the alien weapons in FO3.
---
I'd also love to see more energy weapons added from previous fallouts, but first they need to fix the current ones. The damage is awful if they aren't going to fix energy resistance/penetration. 
---
&gt; I think I‚Äôm going to call my Bloodied rolling pin Gordon Ramsey
---
And my furious shotgun Kurt Cobain's Microphone
---
Check out /r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Plenty of casual fo76 ladies there 
---
I'll add that to our feedback :) 
---
Good idea. I‚Äôve actually never thought of that. However, the only problem is a level 200 could also get it if they happen to look and see what‚Äôs in it. But that‚Äôs a great way to gift lower level players.
---
I'm at 243 hours and today was my first time playing in a month. 
---
I feel the same, there is a lot of "if you're not with me you're against me" mentality in the gaming community in general and it shows a lot more when a game does badly at launch.
---
I love a lot about this game, I love meeting people in the game and either being helped, helping back, fighting or just ignoring one another. I love building any kind of weirdly shaped house i can think of.
---
I hate a lot about this game too, i hate that I had to server hop a hundred times to kill Evan, I hate that at launch if you got disconnected from the server you just lost any daily you were doing, i hate that even still on the DMV quest and others if you quit out or get booted *bam* start it all over.
---
I really really hate you Mr. Staircase.
---
I didn't want to put you into the dirt Mr. Staircase, I swear I want to make a second story not place you into the dirt.
---
I know it's my fault for cheesing the floor pieces to make a floating deck but why are you unable to be removed? Why Mr. Staircase, did you make the floor pieces you are connected to undeletable, I have a jet pack so who cares if the structure is "inaccessible ".
---
WHY DO YOU HATE ME MR. STAIRCASE!? WHAT DID I DO TO YOU.
---
but I love this game and all its quirks because let's be honest, when hasn't a Bethesda game had bugs?
---
Do I want better for the game? Yes
---
Do I begrudge anyone who hates the game? No.
---
We all have our *own opinions* on how anything should be. To tell someone their opinion isn't right is wrong. (Barring that the opinion in question can be disproved with empirical evidence like say I was of the opinion that the earth is flat, this can be disproved immediately. )
---
Everyone needs somewhere to vent.
---
If you hate the game, why? Tell me so that we can discuss it, if you are willing to discuss it. I know some ppl just want to vent and don't care about talking on how to fix it. (MR STAIRCASE WHY SO YOU HATE ME!!!!!!!!)  
---
It really is like some BS kids game.
---
Totally. Even if there were no greifers, its not worth your time to meet up with a guy and sell a couple serums for 200 caps
---
Im running out of space casue i started hoarding legendaries too. But i have to sort my stash too. I know i have a lot of something.

I shouldn't be forced to server hop to take advantage of the best way to farm resources and CAMP plans. I also shouldn't be forced to have someone with another broken build follow me around so that I can. Just like every other online rpg, they should completely separate the two playstyles. Hell, wow even had Roleplaying variants of PvP and PvE. You want to roleplay a Raider? Go to survival, where you can attack whoever whenever you want. That's what it's there for. You probably also don't like being one shot by other people and spawn camped though, so preach that hypocrisy loud and clear!
---
Yup I can confirm
---
I sure hope so
---
Im in your game
---
There is something here though... Lvl 50 and under shouldn't have to compete with 50 and overs. 
---
I wish we got more loops like this:  here is op weapon, here is strategy overcoming that, have to spend points overcoming it so now new weapon type or style becomes op, which requires a new strategy... 
---
Thanks for the kind words from you and the others in the sub :)
---
The sherif is after you for what you did to his daughter. ...  
---
Where are you? Im standing here at the vault. 
---
I have friends. Most of them are like me; they also detest PvP, because it's broken and it breaks the immersion of the game. They just need to separate the two playstyles.
---
How about FREEEEEE
---
Ok im blind 
---
it's a left leg bro and offer pls 
---
She was a ghoul.  And I didn‚Äôt want a steady ghoul friend.  
---
I just wanted to say I am very impressed by that photoshop. 
---
NiCe. 
---
Sure do! Love some fallout. (Xbox sorry) I never use a mic to avoid bias. Being handheld is just as annoying as being harassed.
---
I would say no update this coming Tuesday, big update on the following week (12 days from now).
---
are you crouching i can't see you
---
Im actually jumping aroubd lol
---
We've seen this feedback pop up a few times and added it to our documents already. Just wanted to pop in here so you know we saw this!
---
It‚Äôs not meant to do a ton of damage. You object something and switch weapons. 
---
How would you know what they've played or haven't played? I'm beginning to be reminded of a similar debate going on with Star Trek Discovery. Star Trek Discovery was by all definitions a flop, and the few fans that are following it are accusing everyone who dislikes it of "not really bring a star trek fan". Similarly FO76 is a flop, the sales alone prove this. So are we to believe that the few fans who are enjoying it are the only ones who "get it" while everyone else is not a true fan? Once again I have to explain that I actually like Fallout 76, but I don't hate the people who dislike it. I don't accuse them of trolling. I don't accuse them of not being a true fan. Because I'm not a gatekeeper. Instead I listen to what they think is wrong with the game and try to discuss it without being butthurt. 
---
The only reason anyone would be so against it is because they can't handle survival mode. Your build is only broken when everyone doesn't have the same one. They should fix the mechanics of it. There's no reason 8 shotgun rounds to the head can't kill someone with no armor and 10% health. It's stupid, and it ruins the experience.
---
Raider and greifer are 2 separate playstyles. 
---
If I come kill you for your workshop because you used your junk to build extractors, but dont continue to chase you down (assuming you lick your wounds and go about your day) that's raiding. Taking what I want/need from someone weaker than myself.
---
If I follow you for an hour killing you with slap damage and mini nuke your base then I'm griefing. 
---
You might wanna go back to FO4.
---
You can correct me if Im wrong but it appears that you are saying if you don't like fallout 76 you are not a fallout fan?
---
Yes, i was going to make a list of all chems
---
Post removed
---
Found you, sorry for everything 
---
I don't think it has drivers. The keyboard is attached to my gaming laptop.
---
Ill probably get more usage when we can learn all of the ammo recipes 
---
Thanks for making it right
---
Thanks lemme give you something else, do yoh want stimpaks, junk or anything? 
---
Yeah but if the big B does this they might have a frozen cap value for *blank* like wood is 1c per each and pure yellowcake flux is 100c and you can't change the value of gotten item
---
Aid items tend to sell pretty well.  If you complete events or workshops you get a ton of radaway/rad-x/stimpacks/etc.  Doesn't take too many of those to wipe out a vendor, especially with decent charisma and Hard Bargain.
---
Clear out the oddball scrap you accumulate and can't bulk.  Stuff like black titanium, circuit boards, etc. get up to 100+ pretty quickly and vendor for a couple of caps a pop.
---
Weapons are pretty much worthless to sell unless they have the "+" sign indicated they're modded.  High luck helps with getting these I think.  I usually find more than enough fast travelling to Harper's vendor just by clearing the mobs from the spawn point to the robot.
---
Naa dude. Its cool this is good
---
Tank here. I got your back. Let that stealth DPS die, he brought it on himself.
---
Bought a used copy for 24 on amazon right now xD
---
Okay well explosive weapons aside, after level 50 you stop gaining anything, you just have the ability to move things around.  Also they very much buffed low level characters damage, I've been grouping my level 182 guy with two friends who are only level 20 (they were like level 10 on first day) and they have been getting just as many kills as I have.   
---
SECONDLY, the knowledge the higher level players have will still transfer over, if they want to kill less experianed plaeyrs they could still do so by making brand new characters, going to the legendary weapon drop hot spots (like wes tek) and sever hopping until they are all geared up in level 20 legendary gear and still wreck new players.  They know (I Know) where to find several free stealth boys in the world everywhere, we know where to find ballistic fiber, we know dense armor mod is needed, we know we need to stagger guys running sentinel set to damage them, we know cryo grenades drain AP.  We just know things, youll still die, and we will "Twink" our charcters to be in the "low level" servers anyway.  ESPECIALLY grifers, since thats what they are after.  At least this way, if smoene is giving you a hard time, you can call in your geared up higher level friends to help out.  Just my two cents 
---
No no i insist
---
Possibly a new terminal or something to give a quest
---
Google translate always does this to me!
---
Merci!
---
I started a new character a few days before survival, and tried to do a lot of the Fasnacht events to get easy xp and rewards.
---
I went from a wonderful cooperative  festival to an apocalyptic warzone!  Happy robots and sausages and festive masks, and now? I'm eating dog food and scrounging barely enough to keep my weapons working.  People would rather shoot you than talk to you. 
---
I **miss** Fasnacht so much... 
---
One of them was an unyielding chest piece, another was a really nice gatling laser that would be really good right now.  Both of these were before stash increases were put in game.  
---
Every choice I made was on pursuit of goals that got me what I needed.  I'm constantly looking for weightless versions of the items I use all the time to gain space back so I don't have to make another choice I will regret.  
---
That stash space has been increased twice shows that it wasn't enough to start and it clearly still isn't enough based on how much people ask about it and how many new ideas there are so we can store just a little bit more.
---
This sounds like a trap....  haha
---
Happened again and I died picked up loot, went to blackwater and died of radiation and i came back and showed one where i was and at camp lol like i didn't pick up items
---
If you insist ill take some stuff. But you dont have to
---
actually, armor penitration is multiplicitive, so while you do get diminishing returns on each chunk of armor penitration, none of it is wasted. 
---
Nice. No more wasting caps making multiple stops around the map. üëçüèª
---
if theres a station you really need to go to, place your C.A.M.P. close by. if theres a station you want to camp re-read.
---
Take anything you want 
---
The staircase bit made me laugh. I love a lot in this game and hate a lot as well. My whole point is that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. Do now that everyone in FO76 has an inventory full of honey, maybe it's time to use it.
---
Thats awesome of you man
---
Should go quite nicely with the clown outfit,  right ?
---
now only if they‚Äôd let us put our personal vending machines inside the Whitespring... u/valspeek 
---
I'd say a lot of people im constantly seeing the message in the corner saying people killed themselves.  Either that or they are not good with explosives
---
On x01? I painted all but the arms, left those. See if I can get a nice shot in the sun.
---
Sorry again, ill delete this post
---
At 7600 hours you earn the ‚Äúlegendary Smite‚Äù weapon. It allows you to call down the hand of god once to smear your foes into the pavement. 
---
You don't have to buy the atoms man, just grind some challenges earn them and save up and bam you got a dope ass wiffle bat!!
---
It would be cool though if they had a new area that was in nuclear winter to explore. Maybe across the bridge from the Mothman museum. 
---
Level does not matter. 
---
Yes......very well.
---
I was kidding I dont really buy much from the atom shop. I have 1500 atoms saved up
---
Yes, and I'm asking for that to be kept all on the survival server, where PvP belongs, until they can fix the PvP mechanics. 
---
If I look on the map and everyone is under 100, and pretty much off doing their own thing, it's never an issue. Inevitably though, someone that just hopped off the survival server after getting roflstomped for an hour and losing all their shit tracks me down and attacks me, because they are a spineless predator who can't handle being in the environment that was made just for their playstyle.
---
I wouldn't care at all if the mechanics were balanced correctly. There is no reason why, at full health and in power armor, I die from one 5.56 round to the chest, yet the person shooting me with no armor and 10-30% health can take 8 shotgun rounds to the face and not take a scratch. I have all the relevant damage perks, scattershot, enforcer, better crits, gun fu, adrenaline, psychopath, etc. I have a good, solid build, and can solo just about any creature in the game. The. PvP. Mechanics. Are. Broken.
---
Yup it's good news.....and ew
---
I like this story.  Beats being one shot by a mile.  I wish my PvP felt this drawn out.
---
We're in a vault simulation at the moment. Nuclear Winter is the reality of the wasteland. 
---
OK, so you have claimed a workshop. Good. Now what? Are the select few who were able to get there first to rule the game because now they have a MASSIVE resource that no one else can have?
---
Never being able to lose a workshop is absurd. Either they can be taken, or they have to leave the game. Any other option is unfair.
---
There ya go yo!! Its only 300 atoms.
---
It was such good fun. I was pretty lucky with my runs of it, didnt run into anyone trying to ruin things. A couple of players tried to be idiots, but everyone else in that run soon put them on their place, peacefully (generally just thumbing them down and they soon got the message). 
---
I hope there are more events like this in the future, it was great to see everyone just working together and having a good time. 
---
As for the loot, it would be better if it scaled to the player, but I wasnt too bothered, I was really doing them for the fun of it and to get the plans/masks. I only really wanted the owl mask, which I got, so anything else was a bonus. 
---
Did I say nuking? No? Is reading comprehension that difficult? 
---
Then it's by definition not forced.
---
It's really great how many good interactions I've had in Appalachia. Sure, some people want to get a little spicy and mess with you, but overall people are nice.
---
The other day I mentioned to some people I had just met/teamed up with that I wanted T51 power armor because it looked the best. Dude just GAVE me a whole set, frame and all. And his other friend gave me the Nuka paint job for free.
---
What a fine group of people.
---
I'd tell you that the single easiest thing to sell for the full 1400 caps a day is bulked junk.  I'll go farm a place or two, perhaps grab a workshop or two with extractors, put on super-duper perk and bulk items up. I'm able to easily fill all my vendor needs as well as my own. 
---
It'll still be censored for sure. 
---
I held Poseidon for 5hrs last weekend with my level 60 sniper. Even against a level 351,
---
Every half hour or so someone was there trying to take it. I was hoping it would be different this time around lol I guess we will see.
---
Allow only one at a time and put a time limit on it.
---
Or, the better option, fix PvP :D
---
Level does not effect your chance of learning mods so craft the lowest level to save resources.
---
Thx ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Great job finding them!
---

I think I understand now you dont play too many PVP games do you? 
---
no im not. you can not like it and be a fan. i dont like new vegas. i have valid reasons. i still enjoy exploring and finding lore. i even modded it. beat it on both ps3 and pc.
---
a fan wouldnt hate fallout 76. it still has core features from past fallouts they enjoy. they can make valid points like certain bugs, but hating on it cause it dont have npcs, has bugs, and promo merch being poor quality  is something a fan just wouldn't  do.
---
I like how the guy who is saying "Please don't talk about how good the game is" is accusing others of living in a bubble of ignorance.  
---
Grin\_the\_Hypocrite.
---
Cool thanks. I‚Äôll make sure I got duper active as well
---
üëçüèª
---
Youtubers man. Welcome to the new normal
---
That sounds so metal, I love it!
---
It sounds like it was worth $60 cause you're still here.
---
We are a group of roughly 15 or so.  As of right now, there are 4 females in our group.  Everyone has mic except for one person.  We're on every night for the most part.  Usually we will have enough for a couple groups when we play but it just depends on work schedule.  You can always group with us.  We ran 2 groups in Survival yesterday which was honestly funny as our 2 groups were hostile towards each other.   
---
 It was actually somewhat difficult not accidentally shooting each other but we took some events down, got some kills, and 2 of us ended on the leaderboard.  Just send a message or something if you wan to group up.  PSN: boltpride951
---
The point isn‚Äôt that I couldn‚Äôt do it, I do far too often for my liking.
---
The point is; it‚Äôs not fun when everyone is doing it.
---
We‚Äôre all super powerful, super sped up, jumping beans, and now we‚Äôre all invisible. If you‚Äôre not doing it you‚Äôre at an insane disadvantage, and if you are, it‚Äôs honestly pretty stupid and hard to hit anyone. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they acted as a sort of vanish spell from WoW or something, but you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to just be invisible while jumping, springing and attacking indefinitely. 
---
Sneak and invisibility should be a skill and a tactic, not just what we all are forever in the meta. 
---
I agree and disagree, I agree with literally every point you are trying to make.
---
But as a man who had to deal with an infestation of fruit flies i'll have to disagreeüòÇ a little bit of apple cider vinegar and soap in a container with one way in and no way to escape is a great way of catching flies!
---
Written out the map xD
---
As pointed out by the OP. Rewards for winning. Rewards for winning, no penalty for losing is how tons of MMO's work. Most that have penalties for losing have risk management built in, like banks and such.
---
..so im on the run, cops got my gun, and right about now im about to have some fun
---
Yeah both of us need them close. Hard to fight something that flys with out builds lol 
---
IMO thats Hawt af if i was female i would drown the world.
---
I really hope they do more events like this on a weekly basis or something. Really great for getting people together, especially because all levels could partake in the fun
---
I need a higher player cap max.  once i hit 25,000 i had to start buying stuff, just to get rid of stuff, or give them away to friends for their stuff.  I dont actually want to get rid of anything.  I think im a hoarder.  I might get Overencumbered as a tattoo üòã
---
But this game isn't FO4. I didn't ask who would want to play FO4 without legendaries. 
---
I got a good laugh out of it though. I thought I'd have the last laugh by killing him. I definitely didn't expect that.
---
yeah, You might wanna mention that :P .. PS4, Xbox .. PC 
---
I'm getting loads stuttering and freezes for a few seconds again.
---
So you can't imagine people keeping an eye on the state of the game?
---
If you weren't around back when fo76 was announced, a large chunk of the discussion and blowback against the game was due to the always on pvp and forced multiplayer aspects of the game.
---
I'm sure there are still plenty of people like me keeping an eye on the status of the game for the private server rollout (if it ever actually happens). And, look, a topic about griefing, which is perfectly relevant to why I haven't purchased the game yet! Amazing.
---
how long till we can turn atoms into stash availability
---
Then go on survival. You're not a true raider if you have to wait for someone to take a workshop so you can force them into PvP. True raiding would be playing on the server where you can attack whoever whenever you want, because that's what raiders do. They also die. A lot. Because they're stupid and aggressive.
---
What you do on the PvE server is either; wait for someone weaker than you to set up the workshop because you're too lazy to just do it yourself, or run in front of them while they are shooting another enemy so that you can then kill them without them being aware of what happened. It's griefing. Now that the two modes are separate, anyone who says they are roleplaying a raider on PvE is just making excuses for being a lazy, predatory shitbag who couldn't handle the heat on the survival server.
---
To get 300+ carry weight without PA your strength has to be higher than 11. I have mine at 15, radicool perk, BoS Shielded Armor, deep pockets in everything but the chest that has normal pockets I have around 297-307 playing solo depending on radicool. But if I‚Äôm teamed up it goes higher because the +3 I get with herd Mentality using strange in numbers perk. Max with radicool, team and if I change to the shielded enclave suit I get around 335 without PA. Strength is 23 then I think, can‚Äôt remember exactly. To get higher you‚Äôll need more strength and to use mutations and perks
---
Wait, I hope that doesn‚Äôt mean that the other robots will beat the hell out of the BOS vendor like in Watoga. And the only goddamned way I can buy/sell in peace is the kill them all. 
---
Dude you‚Äôre a genius!
---
Yeah .. That's a great Story, And You want forget that gesture for a while
---
Manure catches flies too, so I guess I didn't think that one through.
---
It is fixed. Entirely 100% consensual now. You cannot be forced in to PvP if you do not want to be. (CAMP destruction is the exception, and coming soon)  
---
When you go and engage in PvP functions, you cannot act surprised when someone joins in the activity. 
---
Be creative. I grabbed a friend and we held the workshop at Poseidon for hours against multiple attempts to take it. Because we fortified. Built covering fields of fire where no one could reach us to melee, and we could revive each other.  
---
You could do this solo, with the right gear (lifesaving and first aid). Grab a porta-potty and give yourself some cover. Turrets to slow them, and mines to make it hurt. 
---
Ignoring the people angry about the preorder and special edition fiasco as that has nothing to do with the actual game.
---
Why can't you be a fan of the fallout franchise if you hate the bugs? 
---
And scrapper
---
Why did you carry all your aid? Why did you repeatedly engage in pvp with players that were sweeping the floor with you?
---
If you got killed, you can choose to spawn far away from where you died. They will not know where you spawned. Then, after you spawn, you run away and forget about it.
---
I read somewhere that that specific pose is bugged  right now ü§î
---
I found this too man, it was fucking bs, big high levels with nothing to loose and everything to gain. Just ended up being a waste of ammo pvping them, especially when they are relentless too, it isn‚Äôt even worth being on the same server coz they just keep coming and u gain nothing from killing them.
---
I would love to use the chainsaw.  Or pistols...in fact it would make my day if they'd introduce dual pistols as an option. 
---
Please Bethesda, keep increasing stash limit.
---
good point, but still i'd like to feel like we're doing something to her, maybe somethibg based on rifles since he already uses them? 
---
Shit, I didn‚Äôt even think of that. Thanx
---
ohh, thanks for the heads up!!
---
PS4 
---
If you don't want to pvp then don't take workshops...
---
Didn‚Äôt work...
---
If u don‚Äôt gain shit from killing someone then wtf is the point?
---
Thanks ;)
---
You Maniacs! You Blew It Up!!!!
---
I intentionally avoid them like the plague. I can say that CoD, Halo, Battlefield. Those are games that I played and enjoyed. Because the mechanics weren't broken. PvP was added as an obvious afterthought to FO76, with no real testing or thought out into how to make it balanced. It was a marketing ploy to get a different fanbase to spend money.
---
Ye forgot xd it‚Äôs PS4 
---
Yeah so don‚Äôt trip chocolate chip, other people who purchased it are having the same problem hopefully they fix it (: 
---
Well, much like the many varied opinions on Fo76 there are many varied approaches to catching flies üòÑ
---
That is a very valid point. I think it will be safe since the vendors are not on Watoga faction.
---
It's not a pvp server, it's a survival server with pvp enabled.
---
If they make a brass knuckles skin guess I will have to name it ‚ÄúBrass Monkey.‚Äù
---
it wasnt enough at start. i was there at the beta. we just had the junk we collected. then we figured to scrap it. then bulk. still tight space. we got ot to 600. i was good with that. then we got 800. i started saving stuff i wanted, not needed. now i can indulge myself by switching weapons. dont need more space, you want more space.
---
Good! I occasionally run into someone who isn't using the stupidly broken bloody sentinel whatever build, and can actually have a match with them. That I don't mind. Fair play is fun. Having 3-4 people one shot you over and over, and then follow you to the next workshop to do the same is not fun.
---
The disconnects in the queen fight are enranging
---
You're still not getting it. If I take a workshop it has nothing to do with the PVP 85%of the time no one comes to defend it anyway. I'm taking it because I dont wanna use my screws or whatever materials to build on it and I want the resources that come with said workshop
---
I don't disagree with that. The fallout subreddit is equally bad about polarisation as this place, just in the other direction.
---
Can we turn up the screams at the haunted cabins?
---
Croquet mallet is also great. 
---
Gonna keep repeating yourself, huh?
---
I refuse to play Fallout 76. If they didn‚Äôt value their world in making the game why do I want to value their world by playing in it?
---
Gotta get you your money's worth somehow, right?
---
How about using a mic?
---
Survival mode could use some work.  
---
That said, do you remember that dialog that popped up when you chose survival mode that told you you would lose double caps and aid?  
---
Same here, I also suspect that the results of atlas may also have ended up being incorporated into the G.E.C.K. as controlling the weather is just up the alley of something like the  terraforming device the G.E.C.K. is. Just speculations on my part thou.
---
That's why you keep getting your ass handed to you. Sounds like you dont understand how to optimize yourself to be equipped to deal with these situations. 
---
I hate to say it but: Git Good
---
I sure as heck hope so.  Right now turrets are dumber than the bandits in Skyrim.
---
Yeah this seems obvious.  But that's what beta is for!
---
You can only lay 2 mines at a time, and the turrets are shit. The people I've run into don't even stop to break them. They just beeline to me. One even had a bloodied explosive build. That was insane. 
---
They should still keep PvP and PvE separate. Or fix PvP.
---
Wow next thing you know we‚Äôll get perk card preset swapping!
---
If you were drunk with a beerhat challenge completed
---
i dont care what they played. i know non fans are playing it. haters play it too. maybe they can make fallout apart of them too and become a fan.
---
Sounds like you didn't survive my man.
---
Don't look now, but that bush named 420SKANK69 just drew a rifle on you.
---
Really like this idea. I have more photos of teddy bears than anything else lol. My favourite so far is the breaking bad parody.
---
Or they can remove pvp and limit me to one workshop and put a time limit on it. 
---
Or, the part EVERYONE is missing. They can finally actually balance PvP combat!
---
Isn't that the point of all the robots? If someone causes trouble the whole place just goes ham on them?
---
I honestly don't see why people don't want to earn items themselves.  It just seems border line cheating to me and ruins the feel of accomplishment and progression.
---
But I guess each to their own
---
That is quite literally the only thing you cannot argue. But you did it anyway. You've joined the crowd. Maybe if you took the time to invest yourself in it you would find out how interesting the world is.
---
I created a new character and doing this in the next day or two, I‚Äôll post here if I get the same since I‚Äôm also on Xbox 
---
What are you even doing here then?  Do you come back just to crap over a game you don‚Äôt play?
---
Yeah I think some people would be happier if they treated it more like a "how long can I hide/evade" than "wait I'm trying to play Survival just like Adventure and it isn't working!"
---
Of course, I'm staying the hell away from Survival, just an observation. :-)

Whitesprings / queen is still my go to. Find someone who also wants to farm, figure out a good route to clear the majority of the ghouls,  that takes you at least 5 minutes, and when the run is done, have one of you exit / rejoin the game. As long as it's been at least 5 minutes since you killed a spawn, it should repawn for the person spawning in. 
---
A bunch of level1's gathered around the nearest weapon spawn, talking shit.
---
I did kill a guy who was carrying Glowing Mass and High-Radiation Fluids amongst a ton of other aid and junk ... I don't know what these people are expecting tbh.
---
Like dr disrespect.. But he missed
---
Makes complete sense to me!
---
Trading feels like cheating? Lol...
---
I have 1059 of 5mm ammo
---
Did you not understand? Lazy.....predatory.....shitbag.
---
LoL
---
Thanks for proving my point twice now. Have a good one.
---
Hostile takeovers should still be kept on the Survival server.
---
Or. They can fix PvP! Which is the core of this whole issue. I don't mind fighting someone where it's an actual match. I hate being harassed by someone with a broken build, because they know it's broken and they are harassing me because it's broken.

Between Billings and my personal camp with like 100 razorgrain, and green thumb, I can do 300+ in a day easy. The annoying part is actually wood for me lol. Have to go to Sylva and Sons with multiple characters with Wood Chucker perk equipped, because I'll go through 1K wood doing that.
---
You still get xp but killing scorch beasts and other high level creatures and getting the spinning circle sucks... also happens to safes, and other locked items. 
---
"With our next update, we‚Äôre adding a vendor from every faction except the Enclave to the shops at the Whitespring Resort."  
---
...effectively creating the much-requested player hub?  
---
Also nice to not have to sell my stuff at different places. I suspect i'll have a few more caps to my name due to this, and not having to pay to fast travel all over to sell.  
---
Renaming items is HUGE. I can put all the good stuff at the top of my inventory.  
---
Turret improvements and a new questline are really nice, too. TY Bethesda. &lt;3 
---
I found it relatively easy (at level 51 I think), the biggest problem is that I had gulpers on my tail too, and they hurt compared to any other "trash mob". At the fort I had to ignore the SBs and deal with the gulpers first, then get away from the fort to allow the SB to land, and basically unloaded my heavy weapons and shotguns in it's face. I didn't have any perks in heavy weapons, but found they worked the best for my build.
---
Once I got to Glass Cavern, I then hid in the upper building, and the SB would nicely land in front of the entrance. This was all pre-update, so by the time I'd finished the quest, all my heavy weapons needed some major repairs, but it didn't feel like they were useless or expensive to repair
---
I do have the lone wanderer perk at max, so 40% damage reduction makes all the difference, and I do carry at least 10 weapons on me (always overencumbered, but that's not a big deal).
---
Didn't feel like it was a hopeless situation though as portrayed by the storyline.
---
Since then, moved some perks around, got a few more in heavy weapons, and those oversized bats are nothing to worry about. Sweet revenge on the times I've had to run or server hop away from them levelling up.
---
Its Bethesda. They aren't consumer first anymore 
---
Oooh I like this idea a lot.
---
Even if everyone selling in one poin, that wont help you. high chances you wont get what you want. In this game you got 26 players per world, thats maybe 3-4% of one platform playerbase (3-4000 concurrent players) who are trading. Not a mention player vending is only active when you are active, that means when there is 10 000 head playerbase, who has been online past 24 hours, you are missing so many deal.
---
I've been asked quite a few times if I was a lesbian, usually after they figure out I'm not a teenage boy going through puberty lol. And its not just FO76, its pretty much any team based game I play. I don't know why but its like they think 'older chick playing video game = must be lesbian'
---
&gt; It is fixed. Entirely 100% consensual now. You cannot be forced in to PvP if you do not want to be.
---
you missed the first line you responded to.
---
who said you cant be a fan while hating bugs? I got stuck in my PA. couldnt play until a patch. I still have stuff vanishing from my camp. Hate thise bugs. Some bugs i use to build better camps. Still a fan. So can other people. Fallout is apart of me. Fallout being apart of you makes you a fan.
---
I just did this yesterday with no problems on my Xbox. 
---
That 5 wood per drink is too much.
---
Add drug addict and isnt that a what a raider is at the end of the day.
---
Official Discord, that you can find in here right column, has trading channel.
---
There's about 500 - 800 atoms worth of different challenges I've completed that the game didn't recognize as being completed. Some were daily challenges like picking different flowers. Some were weekly like taking photos at different locations, and some are the challenges that are permanently there like reading recipe books. I'm owed at least 500- 800 atoms.
---
I had no idea it would make a good sound, I might have to pick it up!
---
There was a thing in WoW that if you killed another player multiple times they would stop awarding Honor I think. Might have just been in open world, but that's what 76 is, so makes sense. I just remember seeing "this player has been killed recently and is worth no honor".
---
No, there is no reason why anyone should be forced to play the same build as everyone else just because it is broken and PvP is being used as a mechanic. The system is broken, and they need to fix it. 
---
In those other games I mentioned. You can be a pistol, shotgun, rifle, sniper, heavy weapons. Ot doesn't matter what you are, because your skill determines how well you perform. In this game right now, it's all about that one broken legendary affix.
---
If you can make your way safely up to the crashed space station, you can farm spacesuits and space helmets and they always fetch a nice price. Remember to pop a chem that boosts your Charisma, as vendors will give better prices.
---
Wouldn't it be easier and more cost effective to just stockpile the technical data, drop all but 2, turn in the quest and pick up 2 more from your dropped loot bag and repeat?
---
You can jump with chameleon armor, just not stand.
---
How do you know this?
---
But I have my camp in the golf course, will I be fine? If I can‚Äôt move my camp if this becomes a feature that means I won‚Äôt be able to participate in this :( and the robots will always kill me :(
---
That acronym might need tweaking...
---
I am spending way too much money in the Atom shop.
---
You are missing the point. Workshops are PVP content. They are not PVE content. You want to take PVP content away and make it PVE. You have no business taking a workshop as an exclusive PVE only player. Workshops being first come first serve is a stupid idea. All it would lead to is endless server hopping until someone can claim one effectively locking out access for anyone else who may want it.
---
This just makes me want faction based PvP even more.
---
My character is optimized by the way. Take away the legendary affixes on me and anyone else and I can wreck anyone, it does take some quick thinking and keen reflexes though. 
---
meh...This is a post-apocalyptic survival game. I don't think we should have bountiful options for "fake" commerce.
---
Think of it this way. We are all effectively turned into virtual homeless living off the scraps of a society long gone.
---
Go to a city with a lot of homeless. You'll see some with tents, some with carts they're lugging around, some just with what they can carry on their back.
---
They have no meaningful amount of currency.
---
Nobody in "the real world" aka the Robot Vendors wants to buy the crap they are carting around. Maybe they get a few coins or dollars out of pity.
---
Life is hard, and they need to choose what garbage to keep and what to discard. The ones I see who have the hardest time seem to be the ones who are trying to hoard far, far, far too much.
---
There should be no rich people in Fallout.
---
Can we get more info on turrets? Like their actual damage and range?
---
I just want the max range turret, because I hate, when supermutants or scorched snipe my turrets while they cannot answer due to their small range.
---
Team together with a few that have posted here and do it together! At least 2-3 players. 
---
With a train station in the background lol
---
The one that works the fastest?
---
But no I was wondering the same. 
---
Perfect lol
---
No, it's not. Even with sent/Cav/ass players who understand PvP mechanics will kill you in one shot. Assassin gear is worth running, sure, because it still protects you from people who don't understand the game mechanics which is actually more than you'd think.
---
Survival mode being dumbed down to 3 hit kills for every weapon was the ultimate middle finger for those wanting to PvP.
---
It deleted any chance of build and somehow made sentinel assassin even more powerful than it already is.
---
It is not fixed. Just because I'm trying to farm some junk and CAMP plans does not mean I want to participate in PvP. Just because you run in front of my bullets while I'm shooting a SB so that you can turn around and attack me doesn't mean I want to participate in PvP. It is far from consensual. It is also broken as all hell.
---
I see, that solution makes sense.
---
Its crap ive been selling to vendors plus junk stuff although i still gave about 50 masks too
---
You don't have to go copy someone else's build is about optimizing yours. I have a sneaky sniper build and I've been destroying those bloodied melee builds for a while. 
---
If anything you are at an advantage because if you stopped and thought about it there are PLENTY of downsides to the "meta" that makes them vulnerable. 
---
Fallout is an outlier compared to the other games I play and it gives me an advantage because I'm used to outsmarting everyone who is copying a youtuber.
---
their actions and points they made
---
&gt;but hating on it cause it dont have npcs, **has bugs, ** and promo merch being poor quality  is something a fan just wouldn't  do.
---
*text quoted and highlighted for reading convenience*
---
So then what you're really tell us is you aren't a fan
---
Does support count?
---
Weightless, chameleon armor...with escape artist.. add in speed daemon and you should be able to get out of most bad situations. IF it works.
---
the supply drop‚Äôs inventory is player-specific so dont worry, you both got your own supplies from it
---
Never gonna happen. All the rules are about encouraging the penniless to murder and rob those who have some savings, this is the foundation of this toxic pvp mode. 
---
Right, good point, any train station will do
---
"I'm going to bed early" ...looks like clock "time for work, maybe I'll sleep tomorrow"
---
Hey, don‚Äôt you have anthem to shit on?
---
I know it's cool to get the paint but now you're missing out on the actual adventure to get it yourself.
---
It's pretty accurate. There's a lot of fire involved with making booze. 
---
Ugh that's horrible.
---
My outfit, of course
---
Gah that sucks.
---
I know that's just retarded, I actually play with older women, but both married. Young adult males are idiots, not sure how they put 2 = 2 together and come up with that. I felt very sorry for the poor girl, I just left the party as it was. LFG group, she seemed to tolerate it and probably not the first time someone suggested it.
---
Handmade all the way. Thing murders in PvP.
---
I've finally gotten that goddamn music out of my head!!!
---
Will probably be a few weeks before murderfest calms down and you have server divided between those who genuinely enjoy murdering people, and those who enjoy the thrill of being in danger. When that happens we will see what survival mode actually needs to be a more balanced play.
---
They should have come up with a better system that wasn't so easy to exploit is all I'm saying. And I've made some points elsewhere in this thread about what they could do instead. Honestly they need a 100% revamp of survival. This is deathmatch plain and simple
---
If you price your stuff correctly you will get it.
---
Add me maxpowers_69 and I‚Äôll run it with you if you want.
---
In 76, its not the ammo, its the barrel.
---
Why back to back?  Just kills everyone currently fighting SBQ when the second one hits, and doesn't cause any damage at all to her (tested, proven - as far as I'm aware).
---
OK FUCK YOU, I ONLY GAVE MY OPINION !
---
Put a one workshop limit and a time limit on ownership.
---
Or. Because everyone is missing the main issue here. Fix the damned PvP!! I love when I go against someone and it's an actual challenge. We both stand the same chance of winning. PvP is stupid broken over the bloodied builds and it needs to be fixed. 
---
Bloodied was never put in the game so that someone could irradiate themselves to low health and keep insane damage. It was meant to scale up as the battle went on so that the more damage someone did to you, the more damage you did to them per shot. Instead people have found a way to exploit it, and ta da, we have broken PvP combat. Vanguards equipment doesn't get stupid overpowered at full health. The scaling is broken.
---
If you are uncrouched, and the enemy has 1 perception, they can see you from a mile away, and you‚Äôll be murdered fast.
---
When possible, kill everything with a serrated combat knife....that's commando
---
We launch one, kill her, launch another, kill her...and so on and so fourth 
---
I am a girl. I did that because of the assumption being made otherwise. üòâ
---
I do definitely see people fighting her with rifles but I have never built anything for rifles so I'm not sure what to suggest. Good luck!
---
Man, that'd be an easy way to do things.
---
I can do about 1k a hit with my shotguns, yet I can't leave a scratch on them. Even with AP and explosive. So something is broken.
---
Nothing is stopping me. I can sell it or give it away
---
Not everyone who hates FO76 isn't a true fan. I'd argue most of them are true fans.
---
That‚Äôs too bad
---
ahh, please quote the times where i said i was a fan. (you can)
---
also quote me hating fallout 76, or Bethesda because of a bug, promo merch. (you cant)
---
if i encounter a bug i tell bethesda so they can fix it. not rage on reddit about it. Even when i spendlt like 20$ on their christmas emotes. i made a ticket, said i didnt like it, asked tor atom points refund and bought the red rocket. i told bethesda, not reddit or discord or Twitter. I am a fan. of something is broken, i tell them so they can fix it. Not other people saying not to buy the game. 
---
High value clothing items that have fixed spawns. There are a few around the map and not all in high level places. Those will net you about 30-75 caps each even if you still have low charisma. The civil war outfits and the haloween costumes come to mind but there are a few others. 
---
Best to just grind caps though till you get enough to buy some plans for MIRV grenades or chems or some other thing that you can craft for cheap and sell in bulk.
---
Well yeah, but you don't really give a sh#t about what they sell. In the beginning, you maybe server hopped for lever action or some other weapon plans, but pretty much hitting level 50, you stopped giving a sh#t about what they sell. For the last 200 hours I haven't cared at all what they sell, I already know they don't have anything special. And fast traveling is cheap anyway and big problem for game is that there is no cap sink. At least current way you are spending some caps and you go around different world parts. So in away they want you to see less world and they make caps even more useless.
---
Here‚Äôs a tip, if someone in sentinel or cavaliers staggers from your weapon then it negates the effect leaving them vulnerable to attacks. Get them shots in quick, a critical hit should do it then u can do damage after that.
---
Best update so far. Whitesprings ish going to be busy as hell though. I feel bad for the PC players that struggle with FPS.
---
You didn't already learn it?
---
i'll wait for survival exclusive chars before i play it myself. 
---
Yeah, but most of them are organized through discord. It's still a pain to find one and a hastle to keep up with it.
---
Anything ghoulslayer
---
If you are on Xbox, it might have been me. And if so, give me back my screws!! You can keep the black titanium. 
---
Enjoy the stuff!
---
please argue. open to other viewpoints 
---
Is that your psn?
---
If you do not know how to deal with bloodied builds, that is your own shortcoming. Bloodied is a weak PVP build. They cannot one shot people at full health, yet they put themselves in a position where they can be. Either use a gamma gun to irradiate their last bit of health or use an automatic weapon to overpower Serendipity perk. Stop asking the game to change around you when you are the one that needs to change.
---
They are at home cooking and playing board games, you know those boarded up houses that we can‚Äôt get into.
---
Yes. I'm a woman and team up pretty much every day with another woman. We met through filthy Casual. We do team with guys too. I'm lvl 46. She's 80 something. We're really casual though.
---
in theory id guess firecracker whiskey for a ranged build, + fire damage seems like a helpful buff.  not sure for a melee equivalent.
---
otherwise id run something you can craft in mass and easily, like whiskey or burbon (anything fully camp grown, the basics also benefit from the double effect perks where new ones dont)
---
You can over lap the zone so people have places to fall back on. 
---
I also wonder about the nuking. Are they going to move the fast travel to inside and allow it during a nuke? Otherwise it wouldn't be accessible half the time by fast travel.
---
Maybe that why the stuck a ‚Äúbeta‚Äù on the end lol coz they knew they‚Äôd have stuff to change.
---
That is good. The only difference is armor restrictions, standing, and audio cues then.
---
Jesus this. Moses that. Abraham hit me with a whiffleball bat.
---
Or you could stop wanting to force people to fight you and take it to survival where you can ACTUALLY be a raider because you can't pick and choose who fights you :)
---
Oh God that was a hard question line. Those fucking Holo tapes, I'll admit it I may have cried.
---
They made the damage stupidly high on guns. You shouldn‚Äôt have this problem unless you aren‚Äôt sneaking.
---
Shoot first, think never.
---
https://imgur.com/10DkJX7
---
Outside of the power plants, I was thinking that there could be another location on the map where ghouls live, kind of like a ghoul-city as it were.
---
You still get tagged as a thief if you pick the lock, durn it.
---
Just mix and match the best you can find or buy from a vendor for caps, unless you are going to buy a full set online for Cash.
---
I think the leader board should be switched to kills. That better directs the flow of PvP rather than punishing something for doing the namesake of the mode; surviving.
---
   I strongly agree with this, but I would much enjoy to see the top of the world get a face lift and become a player hub much like the one mentioned. It has the template for all these cool shops already and it‚Äôs big and open plenty of places to meet new people and hang out all while being in the central area of the map. 
---
   As well as being central I feel the top of the world was discovered early on in my play through being roughly level 10 or 11 when I found it, I didn‚Äôt even attempt to go around white-springs till I was level 25 because I would always see high level players patrolling that area on the map
---
    Also the white springs to me felt very late game due to the main quest line making its way around to map to primarily finish there besides finding the nuke  silos, I feel the top of the world was introduced early enough for new players to be able to get help from more experienced players of it was changed to a hub
---
I had like 60 of them on my main and they all went into the cache. My alt hasn't done it and they stack like usual. Some say you put in the stash before finishing the bos quest and draw one at a time. I'm not sure if it works. The safe way would be to get it all in like a friends account who hasn't done it and have him feed you one by one at the cache.
---
What I want is enough space to keep supplies for repairs, to store raw ores while I get the acid to refine them, to keep armor and weapons have a need for, and enough space to keep some items that I can sell at a later date or use with the legendary vendor.
---
Ok, thanks.
---
Perhaps a compromise could be made? Maybe just the main building is off limits while the surrounding out buildings and area are free?
---
Anytime someone leaves me something I stand there trying to figure out how to use emotes again and at the same time not shoot them by accident.
---
Armor piercing. Even better would be Furious.
---
Lol don‚Äôt the drugs cancel out each other? I thought you can only be influenced by the last one you eat. 
---
&gt;no im not. **you can not like it and be a fan**. i dont like new vegas. i have valid reasons. i still enjoy exploring and finding lore. i even modded it. beat it on both ps3 and pc.
---
**a fan wouldnt hate fallout 76**. it still has core features from past fallouts they enjoy. they can make valid points like certain bugs, but hating on it cause it dont have npcs, has bugs, and promo merch being poor quality  is something a fan just wouldn't  do.
---
Fine, down vote me for r/mancave post tradition.
---
... All started by an invasive r/comedybangbang subreddit goofing off this clip [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLwtBSxKWAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLwtBSxKWAM)
---
Use plasma flamer. Much more efficient.
---
At the same time not that i know, but you can back up , go look at your cards and keep a mental note.
---
that was one of the reasons why they took the explosive prefix off of future legendary enegry weapons dropping. it was "not working properly" 
---
lol where do people get so many of them? Are they craftable or what? I see vendors with two dozen of them sometimes and I've only ever seen two or three in display cases.
---
You can back out of the Select a Card/Point by hitting Tab on PC and then you just get your standard perk card screen.  There must be an equivalent on consoles.
---
Sometimes cards you already have are either sorted to the end of the list, or show up with a x1/x2/etc. to indicate how many you have.  But I think their logic gets a bit strange when you start ranking up cards.
---
Or offer a piece of candy or ask for help finding their lost puppy.
---
So if i take your stance because I like Fnv and you don't that means you're not a fan of fallout.
---
Awesome. 
---
I'm 29, not miked, play as a long haired dude in a dress (SO's original character but I liked the game and stuck around), female. I don't socially play because I'm so erratic when I can play. I'm a stay-at-home mom so I'll play during his naps or sometimes when I can get away with it when my toddler is up BUT he'll turn the Xbox off so I am done playing. Therefore I do not join teams or anything and there's no way to tell I'm female
---
I'm not an expert on this so maybe someone who is can enlighten us all, but I don't think the weight assigned in game has anything to do with it, it's more about how many unique items need to be tracked.
---
I mean, it's not stored in a real box somewhere at Bethesda where more will fit if it's smaller right?
---
But if that's the case, essentially every item takes up the same space on the server so maybe an Uber bulk option that would be 100 bulk becomes one ton of steel or something.  1 item to track vs 100.
---
Dense and fireproof and padded add together, you can resist 100 percent with dense and nearly everything with padded.
---
Glad to know that so much attention is paid on Reddit rather than the official forums. I've been suggesting this for months...
---
Before you do the Brotherhood quest you can stack as many technical data as you can find in your stash. After you do the quest all technical data become quest items once you pick them up. There is some evidence that turning in a stack of 2 kicks you up to a slightly higher reward bracket but turning in more than two makes no difference.
---
The hard part is after the BoS quest you can't just pick up your stashed data and turn it in. So you have to do one of two things to convert stashed data into functional quest data. One way is to sell your data to a vendor for one cap then close the trade window, open it again and rebuy it for two caps. Another is to pull the data from your stash, log out then log back in again. Both ways should convert the data to a quest item and trigger the quest marker.
---
Iirc when selecting a new card it should show "owned" under the card if you have it already. I believe it will say a number after owned for how many you have and say "maxed" if you have fully upgraded the card. 
---
Perforating is 40 percent.
---
Thinking about the ways people would abuse it by kill trading / spawn camping. 
---
Here are my ideas:
---
* Commendations are a "misc" item and do not drop on death. You earn them, they're yours.
---
* Players must be alive a minimum amount of time to be worth commendations. 
---
* The longer a player is alive, the more commendations they are worth when killed.
---
* Players earn commendations passively for staying alive. The longer a player is alive, the more commendations they earn passively. \*glitching through foundations to become immune to damage NEEDS to be fixed before we do this.
---
* Leveling up and completing quests also award commendations, but far less than pvp activity. 
---
* The top 3 players that are worth the most commendations are listed on the map, but with a search AREA, not their pinpoint location. This area should be a little smaller than a nuke zone.
---
* Commendations can be turned in to faction vendors for legendary rewards, caps, stable flux, plans, etc. 
---
This rewards both PvE players and PvP players. No matter your play style, there is a reason to go to survival mode. Want to just farm a bunch? Go for it, you'll be earning commendations that will make your time in survival mode more worthwhile than adventure. Want to hunt people down? Again, go for it. If you're good enough, it can be very lucrative. 
---
I'm trying to think of loopholes here, but IMO this seems solid.

It seems the purveyor for legendarys trade ins will be around harpers ferry

After the recent update, I cannot use the letter keys (tab, esc, space, etc. work, but WASD and the like do not), so I am stuck unable to move. Hurray! I spent 80 bucks for a standing simulator. Fuck this.
---
Yeah they are craftable. Get you a plan asap. 
---
Modern multiplayer with old systems that influences player interaction, a genuinely good suggestion!
---
That could work too, but what if there was a choice between choosing Whitespring and Top of the World? It would introduce player choice with consequence to the game.
---
Me. On PS4 as well. üòä
---
Maybe try getting the weapon out in first person rather than inspecting it. I noticed when inspecting the enclave plasma rifle it looked normal but when equipped it is all black with the enclave logo on the side and some glowing bits... but I totally get what you are saying and would love true unique weapons such as ‚Äòthump thump‚Äô or ‚Äòsurvivalist rifle‚Äô which just adds character to the gun.
---
What I was thinking about is I have one character with a stack and didn‚Äôt know if I could transfer them to my main and then pull them out one at a time. 
---
Cant wait to rename mh bunker buster to Random Kritz are fair and balanced
---
That would be very interesting, side with the enclave or the raiders and make them the big factions of the game
---
Perhaps the restricted zone could only encompass the main building and courtyard areas?
---
Thanks !
---
I wonder if those gnats you see randomly flying around in the mire are what those gnat files are for. Also I wonder if the bug swarm that busts out of gut piles when they disappear is the gutpuke thing? Yeah I like digging around in xedit looking at all this stuff too. I mostly dig around to find what loot comes from what events though, I never got into the actor section much.

This is just a repeat of information we already know about from the road map graphic.

While there will be a Nuclear Winter game mode the entire summer season will be titled "Nuclear Winter" just like them current theme is "Wild Appalachia". The vaults are planned to start opening during that summer season of content.

Not a bad idea - but I love the taste of my alcohol too much to ruin it with that Monster shit  XD. Definitely like the Blue Curacao idea, though you could also use a blue cream soda, there's a few brands of it out there though it may be hard to track down at a regular supermarket. I feel like Vodka isn't strong enough to do this drink justice though - need to put some real moonshine in it!
---
It's nice to have a freesync monitor, then you don't have to worry about tearing when turning vsync off. Input lag maybe something else. Maybe try reinstalling the graphic driver.

your question was "You can correct me if Im wrong but it appears that you are saying if you don't like fallout 76 you are not a fallout fan?"

which "no im not" would naturally mean "no im not saying if you dont like fallout 76 you are not a fallout fan."
---
the context is very important. 
---
as for your second quote how is me bashing?
---
Maybe it's a guy
---
Absolutely love these updates.
---
Just wish that the vendors would have been placed somewhere other than whitesprings  maybe Flatwoods or in a newer area outside of Flatwoods. It would make it much more accessible for lower level players, and white springs is already a rendering pain I the butt with older Xbox especially especially. You have the million boys, players grinding and the ghouls. I just wonder how this is going to slow the area even further. 
---
A second trading hub in the forrest would have been really nice. And would have been more accessible by all. 
---
I agree.  I use Tesla weapons a lot and this is consistent with what I've seen with the Charging Shotgun variant.
---
Indeed. Could make PVP a whole lot different and meaningful.
---
I shot those damn robots 1000 times cause of gun Fu heh.
---
Youll also be able to name your armour 001 LA/RA/CP/LL/RL 
---
No touch pad on Xbox one...  LMAO!
---
I got a bomber jacket on my second drop. I have 47 in my stash, but I can‚Äôt figure out how to get it to pop up. I‚Äôve even tried putting them in containers and random suitcases. 
---
Any advice?
---
Does renaming gear apply to power armor frames?
---
want... not need.
---
To note off of factions it would be interesting to add a mechanic per server to have fraction control over the map, faction a claim a workshop in a specific area and they have control over the area making events and quests easier for them but everything harder for b unless they capture the workshop
---
A huge circles thats gets gradually smaller over time until it narrows it down to a small area
---
You just have to server hop until it will let you turn it in
---
Exactly what are they doing!
---
upcoming DLCs will most likely have additional content..but u did..basically completed the final mission
---
It's cool if you have a team.
---
I have just been waiting. Scavenging and discovering places. 
---
Well sounds like you get to be a guinea pig and find out. Transfer one and if it triggers the quest (which it sounds like it should given what happens with vendors) then you DO NOT want to transfer the stack and instead you should transfer 1-2 at a time instead. (But no more!)
---
Hopefully power armor frames will be among the renameable items.
---
Honestly I feel the golf course should be open, everything else closed 
---
Been wanting to see that place anyway, good idea!
---
TIFO.
---
That actually doesn't change anything for melee if you are maxing out incisor. You still hit the 99% cap and do not get the 28.5% damage boost from AA (@ full 50% armor penetration). That does hurt rifle builds though, as they get close to the cap but not quite with tank killer, perforating, and AA.
---
Still, the original post on AA that pegged the damage bonus at 28.5% didn't use any additional armor pen. If people are using 28.5% as their reference for comparing legendary effects they, like me, are making a mistake when their build includes other armor pen. For example: With any additional armor pen TS is superior to AA if you can get both bullets to hit.
---
Another one in Whitesprings - in a bathroom in the buildings to the left of the swimming pool area
---
That‚Äôs what i figures. Thanks. I guess I have plenty of times to mine workshops and build a nice stash in time for the new content. 
---
My stash box has about 200lbs of just stuff I want to put in my camp. Mostly prewar money for the bathtub 
---
A want can also be a need.  The question is how much is needed.  My guess is we need another 400 to 800lbs of storage.  25lbs of lead on my character with perk cards is 250lbs in storage.  Do the math on just keeping 100 of building materials and it adds up really fast in storage.  I said what I want to do with my stash, what I need to be able to do it I've stated.
---
Remindme! 1 day
---
Thanks for reply , even tho got banned so ha. 
---
I don't want to ruin my location, but I built my camp on the water near the boat (pleasant valley lake).  I call it that but it has no name.  It's basically where the flower is on the map.
---
FYI - Helvetia has a wood shed with about 100 wood in it, 200 with wood chucker. 
---
Same here. Crashed my game tree times just now before I saw this thread. Off to Charlie I go...
---
I'll try this stuff, thanks. 
---
That was meant to be one quote.....
---
You are literally saying that if you don't like fallout that fine, you're still a fan, but if you don't like fallout 76 you're not a fan.
---
The Reddits on this game and many others is used as a way to gather more varied bug reports and suggestions about the game otherwise there wouldn't be community managers saying " got it we will bring this up with the dev team" 
---
What I can't wrap my head around arm is how is they bitching about the game effecting you? 
---
I will just have to accept that no matter what you say or what I say will effect our opinions on the matter one way or the other.
---
Overseers mission is on hold until more information is known about new quests.
---
At this point while waiting for new content. Fight her again try for cooler loot, so time trials so on so forth. 
---
They went way too far in nerfing the TSEs.  My build depended on that, and with no respec option I realized that my heart was not in re-grinding all of those levels.  So I've accepted my build as the semi-shitty build that it is, knowing that if I put in the time to grind enough levels to rebuild it, the new build could be subjected to a nerfing too.  So I'm not going to bother, and I'm a little sad about that.
---
I also live in WV, and I was hoping that this game would bring some positive vibes, tourism, whatever to the area.  Instead it became a punchline.  WV could really use every extra dollar thrown its way.  It's a shame that there isn't more love for a game set here.  It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring attention to this state and help its woes a little, and it went about as well as every other opportunity to help WV has gone.  I'm not surprised, but I'm disappointed.
---
*Picks up disgusting bloody chunks of super mutant* "Hmmmm I wonder if I can decorate my camp with this." Lol
---
How did they get you banned ?
---
Nice, I'll add that to my rotation. At this point I'm sitting on 500 Ballistic Bock waiting for them to make it actually work with my .50 cal lol.
---
So, sheepsquatches aren't in the game yet? If that's the case, then I experienced a glitch a few days ago. I took over the Sunshine Meadows Farm and had to go reclaim it. When I got there, I was told to reclaim the workshop from the sheepsquatches that had taken over, but then the event suddenly ended, and I got credit for it. I remember asking myself what the heck a sheepsquatch was, but didn't think anymore of it til now.
---
You should start a female gang and greif all the dudes in pvp 
---
I feel you pain - close to 100 deposited now and still no paints for me
---
My Charlie is having the same problem

Maybe on a pike like you see heads in games...
---
I‚Äôm definitely not done playing. I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôll nuke myself again, the silo was a bitch and a half for me. I‚Äôll join others tho, it‚Äôs a fun dynamic fighting the scorched with strangers. 
---
Field scribe outfit (red sleeves, backpack, pockets everywhere) I think you can find at thunder power plant, bos fire bases, or basically any bos influenced location.
---
Pistol builds are great for the casual gamer. Headshots are really easy with it and vat crits are amazing. I can give you a link to my build if you want.
---
What part of PVP zone do you not understand? Taking a workshop is an invitation to fight. Try playing any other shooting game and go around telling people you do not want to fight. Your logic is absurd and sanity questionable. Stop taking the fucking workshop if you don't want to die. Go play in the dirt and eat grass if you want to be left alone.
---
im waiting for my god-tier weapon to drop..hasnt happened yet..plenty of hours logged in
---
Yeah I really forced it, but I also didn‚Äôt try very hard.
---
Dropped my TSE pipe rifle by accident and the floor ate my bag :(
---
If you two are on PC I'd be happy to help.
---
There's always that time after am update. The parade week never fixed it self for me. 
---
The silo gets easier each time. Just did one the other day I found out I could just hack my way around it to bypass stuff. Being a stealth marksman that option was a godsend. 
---
What are god tier weapons? I have roughly 170-180 hours. I feel like I rarely get good weapons in general. 
---
Just lost a second legendary gun today. Fuck this game
---
It‚Äôs server side in the same way a mule account is. Literally no different. 
---
It‚Äôs a different server than the one you‚Äôre playing on, dedicated to storage.
---
It's a survival game not a killing game. You guys are the same people that suggested leaving characters as is and not forcing survival characters. Bad ideas all around.
---
Depending on the build full combat efficiency is reached in late 50s or mid 60s. This is why many players have a PvP oriented alt with full gear on that levels. There is no advantage that comes from being over level 70s as you gather all the repair perks by then too, because there are people that level that couldn't have better gear.
---
I finally broke down and looked up a walk through on YouTube. And seen about hacking the terminals to make the turrets target the robots too. That was a huge help. 
---
Please add this feature 
---
I got the boss knight power armor paint today after many many stimpack etc drops.
---
Good masks? C‚Äômon, everybody knows that the owl mask is the **best** one. 
---
Add Dirt Piles like from Fallout 4
---
Is it a heavy chest piece and how much do you want for it?
---
Thats how I see it too. No more wondering "Did I already travel to that vendor and are they out of caps already?" 
---
It's really Serendipity and Dodgy.  Serendipity only kicks in on low health, but Dodgy is applicable all the time.
---
Damage resistance matters less than flat damage reduction.  The Sentinel armor effect (+15% damage reduction when standing still), which stacks with each armor piece you have of it, is key to this.  The perk Lone Wanderer gives you another 20% if you're not in a team.
---
Im wonder if the vendor at the watoga train station will be there because he is a unique vendor
---
It's a trapper one and I'm looking for BOS combat armor plans 
---
a powerful 3* 
---
maybe 
---
anti armor explosive
---
bloodied explosive
---
two shot explosive..etc
---
If there is going to be a debuff then the caps lost from dying needs to be lowered badly. 
---
I have sentinel. Looking for cavalier
---
I have encountered mass die offs in Mole miners, scorched, and Snallygaster. I enter the area, view them with scope, moving and doing their thing. As I move in, they all collapse and are dead. Whole towns and mines are affected. Maybe I need to take a shower....
---
I've made so much boiled water since this publish.  50 is too much.
---
Oh ok. I don‚Äôt think I have any 3* weapons. Well I guess that can be a goal. Thanks
---
Maybe what we need is a better quest / quest tracker UI?
---
This all sounds really great. Especially the turret thing. I hope they do another weapon balance pass too though. Energy weapons are in a much better place but there's still room for improvement. And the VFast melee weapons are still all terrible unless over-repaired to 200%. **And** I think I read that the chainsaw isn't affected by any perks.
---
Agreed. Glad there wasn‚Äôt just a brute force option for doing them. 
---
Dont you want a super mutant head on your evil villain desk?
---
(it's a video game)
---
Some people just don't understand I guess
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/ip2cdP2
---
Yup.. just hit the back button if it's PS4. I have 4 Perks I haven't chosen yet, or move the points around. My build has been kicking arse as of late..
---
Also true. Guess that's why they say to keep your junk out of things that lay eggs.
---
Wonga
---
Make sure you're in pacifist mode and it should prevent you from damaging any player. Having a workshop on the other hand, can't help you with that.
---
You're right. I don't care that Bethesda released an early access game, while telling everyone to expect an early access game, but assholes like you stuck their fingers in their ears and ignored them telling everyone to expect an early access game and then continue to lose your goddamn minds over bugs in a video game five months later.
---
You're fucking ridiculous and everyone knows it now.
---
Nice that was quick will do mine tomorrow when I get on.
---
&gt;not that you would
---
People would abuse it for sneak kills, it's like how some in the top 3 do, they act as bait and have their team in the bushes waiting for you.  
---
Most kills seems like the best solution for now, and EVEN that can be abused.
---
&gt;But I shouldn't start popping up on every player's map because I've been C.A.M.P building or questing - minding my own business
---
Except that's the entire reason for you to pop up on every other player's map.
---
You're gaining the benefits from survival.  You also need to face the risk that comes with those benefits.  If you're "minding your own business", you're not facing that risk.
---
Ignoring possible chems, SPECIAL stats, bobbleheads and all other legendary effects a full set of assassin armor will cut your damage down by 48%.
---
The fact that you are using shotguns means your max damage only happens at point blank range so who knows what your actual damage output is in those fights since you are trying to create distance from melee users.
---
Dont get me wrong the PVP system needs work,  but it sounds like most of your complaints are due to your lack of understanding the game.
---
Not really, grahm might leave.
---
Not knowing a workshop was owned and becoming wanted because I grabbed a tin can lol :)
---
Oh!  That makes much more sense
---
Yeah but the other player doesnt have to travel to the one baiting him. If you want to hunt those who turn it on, its a risk. But if your a lvl 5 that just want to earn more xp, you wont get a horde of lvl 300 on you
---
Lolz.
---
Yes, this is the kind of thing I was hoping for with survival.  
---
Second. 
---
Yeah if the bored griefers  move to survival everyone wins. 
---
I got tired of being frustrated and researched my builds to find out why I was underpowered and often changed my builds based on the  weapons and armor I had access to. It‚Äôs a lot more complex than maxing a few stats and always using the same perk cards
---
&gt; I feel like the time spent leaving syrvival, joining adventure, fast traveling, leaving adventure, and rejoining survival, could just as easily be spent walking to your destination.
---
No.  Especially if your destination is a workshop.
---
If that other seller doesn't work out, you may have some luck in r/fo76bazaar
---
What part of there's a PvP server now do you not understand? This is an RPG franchise. The game itself is an online RPG. Those of you that crossed over from CoD and want to just go running around killing everybody need to go to the server that was made especially for that. This game was not made or marketed as an FPS. 
---
Your integrity is questionable. I wonder if you're as much of a predator irl? Probably. Wouldn't surprise me. It also wouldn't surprise me if you had already tried the survival server and couldn't handle it because you can't pick and choose who you fight, so you came crawling back to Adventure mode with your tail between your legs where you can prey on the passive, unsuspecting people you're used to, because it makes you feel "powerful". My sanity? Bah. Lmdao. That's rich. Take a good long look in the mirror bud.
---
315 hours solo... still playing 2-3 hours a day 
---
Max of 24 players, you know exactly where 4 of them are (you plus top three--unless you are in the top 3), you can assume some people are going after those top 3, and some people are too busy getting killed to be camping... It's not like every train station is going to be camped. Sure, you may not know for sure about any given station, but you can watch the map, see people getting killed, and watch for the blips to see where the hotspots are. If you're going somewhere popular, maybe go to the next nearest place and jog.
---
i literally said hatin on it because "xyz" is something a fan WOULDNT do. 
---
i used an example of how i dont like fallout nv. valid reasons. Same as a fan might have valid reasons to not like fallout 76, or any fallout. not liking something doesn't mean hating. 
---
ppl bitchin about the game because it discourages people from buying it. thats less money Bethesda has to support the free updates. they may stop supporting sooner. them putting their input makes devs do things to satisfy them like this survival mode that many fans dont want. same way  you misunderstand what i say is the same way you cant wrap your head around the situation.
---
Or maybe a fort like Pickett‚Äôs. 
---
I know what you mean, I never used to boil a lot of water but now I‚Äôve had to invest in the woodchucker perk just to be able to make the stuff on a daily basis lol
---
If you kill ghouls, you often get a diluted radx or Radaway from each. Sell these
---
So...when the vendor change happens...will THAT fix the fact certain plans are impossible to find now? I hope so, daddy needs some BoS legs!
---
Hey Razor9586
---
Found this post and your response. I've read all this but I'm not sure I understand what "stack" means exactly. If you have rifleman maxed out (10,15,20) shouldn't the first expert rifleman say 25% then 30 and 35 if you maxed expert out. OR are they the same meaning if you have expert maxed you can simply remove the entire rifleman stack and not lose any damage. 
---
Thx.
---
I've got 2 mules, my stash is full, and so is my main. I need a S.H.E.D! I'm also only a level 25 so that shows how bad my hoarding is, but in my defense... I've got nothing. Never mind 
---
Damn right it does!
---
wow, man, I'm so glad you cleared that up for me. I had no idea. thank you so much, my life is now complete with your mind blowing revelation.
---
It's not the M79 so much, though I admit I thought it was going to be a Super Sledge or something with the name! 
---
I'm just not super into the crippling prefix, I suppose. I don't doubt it's useful, but I personally can't vouch for the mechanic in 76. Occasionally I'll cripple a ghoul with explosives, but beyond that I don't ever see evidence of it. I've not had much success with the shotgun perk and Scorchbeasts either, it's unreliable and seemingly just coincidence when they land sometimes. Again, just my experience!
---
Trolling a sub about a game you don‚Äôt play?
---
Lolz might I [suggest this..](https://youtu.be/moSFlvxnbgk) 
---
Or if it helps [serenity now](https://youtu.be/moSFlvxnbgk) 
---
I also hope with played vending U can sell my unwanted ammo. I'm a melee character, but I still take ammo because I want all the things
---
I only disagree with the first part.
---
The board is a clever idea, just poorly executed.  It lets you know who has survived the longest (the game is survival after all), and in a harsh wasteland, nobody is supposed to survive very long.
---
No way should anything in the game reveal your position, though.  I don't know why Bethesda can't just let that go completely.
---
&gt;the point of the mode is to survive, not pick on the guy that's minding their own business ya knob
---
If they're minding their own business, and they never get marked, they will never die.
---
Thus they'll be getting the benefits of survival without taking any of the risks.
---
Thus they get marked, and have to occasionally face dying as payment for the benefits.
---
Owl is bestboi
---
in this case your want isnt a need. 
---
A person needs to eat. A person may want to eat. One keeps you alive. one makes you obese.
---
No, they are separate Perks, and apply additional damage separately. If you equip both, the effects stack additively. If you only equip Expert Rifleman, you will not gain the benefits of Rifleman.
---
Inherent flaw of all bounty systems, game can't distinguish motives.
---
I‚Äôm really excited about this! Will it be a temporary type thing (like Fasnacht) or will it be like a regular old quest?
---
I‚Äôm really happy to see y‚Äôall improving the game and I‚Äôm excited for its future. 
---
Its what some guys do. Their friend just doesnt do the quest and they just collect all the tech docs they can find. Once they have a bunch, they just go the the camp with thier other friend who completed the quest and just unload them one at a time with the friend trading them to the one who can drop them off. Then they split the loot afterwards. 
---
I think the issue is that people assumed that "a random number of aid items" meant that if you had 100 stimpacks, you might lose 20 or something, but that's not how it works. Instead, it's more like "you will lose YOUR ENTIRE STACK of a random number of your aid items", so one death you might lose your water or your food, next death all your stimpacks. I'm not a fan to be honest, but then, I went into it with only like 5 of each type of stimpack and a little bit of food / water.
---
I can agree with that. The main courtyard could be protected and offer trouble free access to the hotel and shops.
---
That's why i believe it should be about most kills, it incorporates most of what you suggest but it doesn't give the PKers the ability to hide and just hold on to their place.
---
&gt;However, the only problem is a level 200 could also get it if they happen to look and see what‚Äôs in it.
---
Theoretically, yes that's right.  But speaking as a player who is over level 200, I would never bother going to the overseer's camp if I wasn't leaving plans in her stash box.  And the likelihood that I'm dropping something that someone else of my level doesn't already have is pretty low I think. 
---
I personally enjoy getting leaderboarded so I can find a place to hole up and fight. 
---
1 hr 15 mins with a lvl 8 char. Ended up holed up in the sickleman shack, brought the first guy through the door with me to hell.
---
It's odd, isn't it?  Players will die on the hill of resisting pay-to-win, but the same players will readily do the in-game equivalent of pay-to-win if it means being able to crush players that don't.
---
And then you wonder why so many companies embrace pay-to-win...
---
What if they realize they have no skill and it's to hard and come back to adventure for easy pickings?
---
Ok there, Dr Frankenstein...
---
200 was a number just at random. And I agree with you, however there‚Äôs always some jerk(s) that will take simply because they can. Just like those who take forever to kill you because you‚Äôre in pacifist, but just want to do it. I do take and get your point. Enjoy your gaming!
---
Exactly. It‚Äôs not called ‚ÄúFree-for-all.‚Äù
---
&gt;You're not been griefed you have something they want so they are taking it. 
---
That would be fine, were it not for the fact that game mechanics make it way too easy to do. 
---
Just saw John Wick for the first time because it's one one the few Keanu Reeves movies I've yet to see...but I want this. I want this idea whole heartedly to happen. 
---
How hard is it to maintain the addictions now? I just got an amazing junkies explosive weightless weapon =)
---
Ok then I misunderstood the term 'hating' on it
---
If I hate something, I don't like it.
---
But that still doesn't mean that just because they are hating on Fo76 doesn't mean they aren't fans of the Fallout series, like op was saying some of the people on Reddit complaining about the bugs genuinely love the fallout series.
---
I will agree that the bitching about the game doesn't fix anything, but how would the devs know if the community at large is angry with the game if not for all those people complaining on the Reddit.
---
I and many other casual players of the games have no *idea* how to report a bug to Bethesda. Hell I can't even log into my Bethesda account on their help with for some odd reason or another.
---
I would like to apologize for misunderstanding though, sometimes the anger or frustration can make the best of us narrow sighted.
---
I lost my nuclear virginity today as well. I solo launched it at Mama Dolce's and got enough flux for 20 stable cobalt or violet (whichever helps make ultracite bullets). I didn't think that enough people would help me with the queen.  If you are on Xbox I was just at a queen who got to half health and regenerated. We didn't do it.
---
Over priced I‚Äôm not paying 20$ to get 10k I pay 10 for 10 
---
So my desire to have enough space to plan ahead, have supplies for repairs, and have space for items isn't a valid need.  I plan ahead, that is a need of mine, and I need more space to do it properly.  
---
If you want to keep having to constantly scrounge for supplies, find yourself lacking in materials at a critical moment, or just having constantly farm Whitesprings for that one legendary then go right ahead.  I don't want to get stuck in that grind but actually finish my goals and plan for the next one.
---
collect your t-shirt son. its all over.
---
I'm a big fan of the "search this area" quest marker-circles (the ones where your compass glows instead of pointing you right at the item). Can you share if this questline utilizes that a lot? Or, even better, no quest markers at all :) \[I'm a Morrowind fan if you can't tell\]
---
Excuse me, but why is mine showing the bright purple/pink that indicates a missing texture?

It's me I misunderstand.

The kind that i'm drinking AM I RITE BOIS?
---
Huh, I'd be curious to see if it actually adds explosive damage at all. Do you have a 1 star Bloodied Gat Laser to compare it to?
---
That is horrible. A lot of people make the judgment on AA vs other effects based upon an original post that compared AA to no AA with no other armor pen. In that test AA added 28.5% extra damage. What the multiplicative issue means is that if you have any other form of armor penetration, AA's effect is severely diminished in terms of extra damage. 
---
For example: maxed incisor + AA would yield only 87.5% armor penetration. Since AA is only providing an additional 12.5% armor penetration it is only adding 7.2% additional damage.

Why is no one on here talking about this: when you hit an inanimate object with this skin, it causes a blood splatter... 
---
That might apply to all other melee for all I know. It was the first thing I noticed though, 20 seconds after applying the skin. Ah well, minor thing...
---
I don't but equipping the demo expert card does nothing and it's maxed out, so I'm guessing that a 1* non explosive will be the same dmg output... Pretty disappointing really. 
---
Not perfect but it's a lot better than it was at launch. We just started getting DLC and so far it's pretty consistent. It's only about 20 bucks now so you'll easily get your money worth if you actually give it a chance
---
Well I can hold my own against them.  What I hate is to see them hassling low level characters.  Just because I‚Äôm high level with a decent build doesn‚Äôt mean I play like an asshole.
---
It they wanted to do level scaling on adventure for pvp combat. I would be all for it because it doesn‚Äôt effect how I play.
---
its a post apocalyptic game. the point os for you to constantly scrounge for supplies. It starts off difficult but as you continue, you know the good spots and what to look for.
---
orea that you have, what are they, i can tell you where you can find items that has the material. 
---
3-nitrophthalic acid is diamidated by hydrazine. The 3-nitrophthalhydrazide is then reduced with sodium dithionite to produce the Luminol. When oxidized by an oxidizing agent such as O2 in a basic solution, Luminol forms an unstable peroxide. This peroxide decomposes to an electronically excited dianion that then chemilumineses.
---
will it matter anymore if they all share a cap stash anyway?  or am I misunderstanding...
---
Yes, Castle, Fort, very good ideas I think for CAMP themes for walls/defenses/etc
---
Meh - I'm looking at that Corvega water purifier instead.  Who needs a wiffle ball bat?!
---
Thank
---
They said every faction. That's just another faction. The BoS vendor at Super Duper Mart in Watoga is unique too, but I would expect a BoS faction vendor as well based on what was said.
---
You can just click in the right stick mate, or use whichever button you have it mapped to
---
Are DLCs free? Whats improved?
---
I just hope that it is a reasonable process to get grind and get those god-tier legendaries everyone wants then all the continuously-unhappy-whiners-delegate can stop crying all the time about ‚Äòoh no.. two shot explosive, sentinel bloody blah blah unfair poor me blah..‚Äô 
---
That's exactly what I'm talking about. Some platform wide market incorporated into the game itself, or a linked site through the game menu to a Bethesda.net hosted market. Not just having to lurk in the reddit markets, or the facebook markets, or dependent on the 23 people on your server wanting or having tradeable items.
---
Oh God!
---
I was doing the Cold Case quest the other day and ran into someone at the water park. There were a lot of Scorched running around but I thought I had gotten them all. Apparently I missed about ~~415~~ 12 of them because the dude that I ran into held them off while I did my thing with the terminal. Then I did the same for him while he read the terminal. 
---
As a way of thanking him for helping me, I dropped a few things for him like some purified water, a couple stim packs and some ammo. Granted, it wasn‚Äôt much because I was only a level 8 at the time but I really wanted to thank him for his help. 
---
After I dropped those things, I tried everything to get him to see it. I tried the ‚Äòfollow me‚Äô, a thumbs up. I shot it (and made him think I was shooting at him), I tried squatting down beside it. 
---
I came back about 10 minutes later and the stuff was still there. I just picked it up and went about my day. Today is payday, so I‚Äôll pick up a headset on the way home and see if that helps. 
---
1 steel already = 1000 steel.
---
The problem with the stash comes when you have a large amount of different items that aren't stacking. The engine can't handle it and it begins to choke. If you want to see this in action, go into Skyrim or Fallout 4 and try to see how many items you can put into a container that stack vs how many you can put in a container that don't. You'll see the game start to really slow down if you try opening a container with more than 1000 different items, but pulling out 100 potions from your stack of 1000 is little to no stress at all.
---
i think it works like if you have a weapon that weighs lets say 0.8 lbs because of the weight reduction, the perks will take their percentage of weight off the already reduced weight so if you had a perk that cuts the weight in half you‚Äôd get 0.4 lbs on that weapon
---
nope
---
Yes they are.
---
Stash size has doubled since launch, a lot of bugs still exist but many have been fixed. Plenty of QoL changes that I'm not gonna list because you wouldnt notice the difference anyway.
---
That‚Äôs not a bad idea either. I was just thinking maybe I could do it with a world container and crossed fingers. I got through the bunker buster mission with a lv 6 mule (yeah that was a lot of crazy running)so I‚Äôm brainstorming ideas. 
---
It further reduces weapon weight. 
---
Example if a gun weighs 20. It becomes 0.2 after both apply.
---
Makes the most sense dont want weapons just being weightless
---
Hey at least I'm making a point and giving useful feedback and possible solutions. Not just complaining about what isn't working
---
Just got stuck in a lorry axle for the 2nd time this week and had to log out b4 a sallygaster had me lol. Also been stuck in the weapons workbench animation for 5 mins before. 
---
Possibly
---
That possible
---
Turret range increase is juicy for me. Got a nice little camp not far from a farm in the forest. It‚Äôs always patrolled by those little Chinese bots. Occasionally they‚Äôll agro my turrets, now my turrets will agro them! My steel scrap farm is going to be a lot more productive now. 
---
It is a beta server. It is not ready to operate in an official capacity. There is only one official way to play and that is adventure mode. But that does not matter to you. Fuck anyone who does not play the game like me, is what you believe, remove all PVP from the main game right now so I can enjoy my peaceful Minecraft mode!
---
Of course it's my opinion ;) Cool to see you enjoy these features
---
I paid $60 bucks and it was half that a week later. I'm still salty
---
I think that the games initial PVP was a place holder for Survival. They wanted to fix the game for PVE while still getting PVPers on board at launch. Since survival is BETA I would bet greatly that there's going to be a lot of rebalancing and tweaking in the upcoming weeks based on what they see and feedback.
---
Risky click of the day.
---
Is it called the union hat? Because I found on a 'reenactment' guys corpse in a specific location like an hour ago.
---
Or are you looking for something separate? Sorry, super new player but I figured I'd mention it, if it was what you were after. 
---
You have to scrounge but you should be smart about it.  I know it's invaluable to have a rainy day fund of sorts right now with players able to destroy my camp in one or two minutes and I need to have the supplies to rebuild until that isn't a problem anymore, then I can cut how much I need since it will only be creatures after that.
---
I've evaluated what I need and I know how to get it.  Beyond that I've planned ahead for things that I can't predict.  That's the difference between surviving and thriving.
---
You know, despite the jumping, you should swing your hammer anyway.  Half the time, the game ignores height in melee attacks. üòÇ
---
(Course, in all likelihood they were using Sentinel and your All Rise wouldn't have done much against it, since it has no armor penetration unless you have Incisor).
---
No. Not "possibly". That is how it works
---
Not annoying at all.  The Fasnatch event was very exciting!
---
You also should have received the recipe to make the beer he requested. It's automatically added to your recipes rather than given to you as a note item. Not saying it's a great reward, but worth nothing.
---
Source????????
---
I think "hipocrisy" is the word.
---
I mean how did you not expect that to happen? There have been people literally customizing their characters since the start for pvp servers, and you go to the obvious location where they will be spawn camping and then complain when it happens? Get fucking good. 
---
Honestly leader board is fine it's the dam map markers that go along with it that stuck
---
I did lol, I killed him eventually, but it still went 4-1 in his favour
---
I'll get screenshots when I get home
---
It‚Äôs bugged
---
I don't get it. You were being sarcastically misogynistic? There's no such thing hete. Your post didn't say you were a girl, and it just reads full-blown dick. Not helpful. 
---
Aight thanks mate
---
It‚Äôs a known bug. A lot of people have had that event or ‚ÄúSheepsquatch Horde‚Äù events pop up, but it‚Äôs just a naming issue. The creature isn‚Äôt in the game yet, and will be added with the coming questline.
---
you're trying to thrive in a survival game. thats boring. play fallout 4 for that. 
---
I like this idea, but we'd have to get more viable nuke zones first. Otherwise, what's left to nuke, just SBQ?
---
Its still an early access game and will be for a while. If thats dont bothers you and can get the game cheap, buy it.
---
I suggested something similar a while back. The way I farm Whitesprings, I blow through it as fast as I can with my farming route, exit game, and rejoin my alt account which is sleeping on that server (and before some of you bitch, you can do the same thing with a friend). Playing with other people slows me down to an insane degree. I can clear WS solo in 6-7 minutes. If I'm waiting for others, that goes up to 15-20 minutes. Because I am all about efficiency, this means that I always play solo. 
---
Also, since I'm a bloodied build (again for efficiency), I can't exactly stand around with mobs wailing on me all day waiting for others to tag. I've done this before and I usually end up dying and wasting stimpacks / radaway. I'm a glass cannon, and the only way it works is if I kill mobs immediately when I see them. This obviously leads to a lot of upset players when I blow through the golf club and murder everything in it in 30 seconds or less and they don't get loot, but that's the way it is. I know Bethesda doesn't like the idea of power leveling and such, but the restrictions now lead to a very unfun experience. 
---
Another issue is the lag. Add more than 3-4 people in a high mob density area and you just won't ever see your loot. You'll be waiting on those mobs to show their loot for 20-30 minutes. Because of this, I feel that it behooves me to actively discourage people from sticking around - so that I don't have to wait for my loot to spawn. So, despite the fact that I'd rather be able to tell people "hey, follow me for the loot / exp train", I end up intentionally preventing people from tagging things by killing it as fast as I possibly can, so they will be discouraged and leave. I feel awful doing it, but I feel like the game forces my hand. No doubt some of you will still condemn me for those actions, and I don't blame you, but whenever I'm nice in this game, it punishes me.
---
For a multiplayer game, Fallout 76 feels like it does everything to reward the efficient solo player over the group.
---
Thriving is how you rebuild America or did you forget the purpose of Vault 76?
---
I feel silly for not having thought of that after farming a million ticks. 
---
Or just carry what you are okay with losing. In survival you should be abusing your camp, ideally keeping it nearby. 
---
That is very disappointing. If you're on PC want to test, I have a 1 star bloodied gatling laser. I'm curious as well because I was considering buying a BE gatling laser or plasma.
---
**ADVENTURE!!!**
---
Video confirmation or it didn't happen...  Jk
---
Average player here,
---
     I'm level 80 so I've sunk a solid amount of time into it but nowhere near as much as some. It's a solid game, I play for an hour or two a day. I find it easy to jump into and explore, I highly recomend it.The "loop" of fallout 76 is explore area, clear area scavange area, use salvage to craft higher tier wepons, repeat. You level up easily and it's a nice progression loop as Bethesda games have always focused on exploration and picking up everything you see. The loop repeats seemlessly as well as there is tons of origanal locations to explore with different biomes and lots of different wepons and tiers to those wepons that all look and play different with every new wepon, mod and tier. One inportant note though. "comparison is the thief of joy" It can be easy to forget about the hard work and joy that came from making a kited out pipe rifle when you see some lvl 240 monster in power armor and an explosive heavy gun prancing around like an antilope. My advice, when you play find people preferably at your own level but at least below level 60 and play with them, any higher and you'll have major "laser envy". Overall love it, fav game of last year.
---
TIL- get It, don't worry about levels or pvp initially, explore a lot. 
---
Take my up vote.   Although, you really should keep an eye on that one Brahmin though. Something dodgy about that brown one in your herd.
---
I bought this pack but am unable to paint my pump action shotgun... wth?
---
There‚Äôs a union hat and also a top hat plan you can find the same way. The top hat is the one everyone wants for vendor runs. 
---
Ballistic bock and high voltage hefe will be my gotos for my heavy gunner.
---
The objection is not PVP or griefing per se.  It's about a game mechanic that seems to undermine its own premise.  The premise of survival is that the next person you run  into could be hostile and wipe you out, and it could happen at any time. 
---
You know... the element of danger and uncertainty.  Making three players on the map removes all uncertainty. He knows everyone is out to get him and everyone else knows its their job to hunt him down. 
---
I think that PVP should erupt organically and spontaneously,  not because a map marker declared open season on a handful of players. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôd like to see it
---
OK, thanks for letting me know. :) 
---
HAHAHA SAME!!!
---
Probably that the updates are necessary in the first place? And that many of them have been needed because of insufficient testing. Your analogy below also doesn't add up, because some of the bugs have been closer to "your car doesn't start". Others have been more on the scale of "your car won't drive faster than 15 mph", while others have been minor.
---
We are about to launch round 2!!!
---
How does he find you, make sure he is not in your friend list.
---
now i will rename all of my weapons and armors "power armor chassis"
---
This, make it like Bivs reset.
---
So... On that note, I have a 1* bloodied gatling plasma and I can squeeze 350 base dmg out of it without mods, the gatling laser I can get 225 with the charging barrel (I think that's what it is, it does more dmg per shot), both with the same bloodied stats, both with radicool, the same stuff. From these simple tests I would say possibly plasma. 
---
Yes, this has been done quite a few times. Not new info, sorry 
---
What do you have?
---
I'm on Xbox, is there a way to have me unfriend me on his end?
---
we have factories that auto build nukes. We have a survival mode where we shoot each other. America is rebuilt. 
---
Yep....I went through it around lvl 40....I was not prepared....I just ran with my tail between my legs and ducked into the glassed cavern. 
---
Then my troubles began
---
Union hat is not bad either it‚Äôs just the top hat sells for more. Even union is a good find if your a new player. Just make a bunch of them and take all the caps from train stations each day 
---
Dropping aid items is one of the best parts about survival. I think you should drop all of them on death. The premise of the server should be only bring what you can afford to lose. Having over 40 stimpacks on you at once is  just dumb.
---
This. Anything you think is to vaualble to lose should be left in your stash. 
---
Everything, mostly one and two star weapons.
---
Alot of one and two star armor.
---
A variety of mods 
---
I don't know if this will help or not, but try to appear offline. I think that prevents people from joining your games
---
Weightless ammo doesnt even exist.
---
As far as food and aid goes,the game has a cap at 90% reduction. After that you're wasting perks.  I would expect the same rule for every weght reduction.
---
Beautiful. I hope they‚Äôre in the same room 
---
That is rebuilding war not America, not the cities, the people, or the government.  War does not define a civilization and is not the sum of a civilization.
---
Then suggest a new game mode.  Saying that survival should be based on kills doesn't make sense.  Survival should be based on purely on surviving or why else call it survival.  If you want something to be based on kills, that sounds more like a deathmatch mode or battle royale etc.  The crowning jewel in survival is surviving the longest irregardless of in which manner.   
---
Yea that to makes sense
---
Adventure Mode. Forgot to mention that. 
---
I'd prefer top 3 killers and their team mates all show on the map personally.
---
I'll try!
---
Where did I say I agreed with that number??? I was agreeing to the idea of trading numbers of items for a new one. Say 3:1. 
---
Also I don‚Äôt need to take meds so üòõ
---
Do you understand the math involved to get what you want? It‚Äôs impossible 
---
Ammo weight reduction gear does. 
---
I agree with the perks 100 percent. Or at the very least let me make half a dozen ‚Äúperk card loadouts‚Äù  so I can switch up easier
---
I don‚Äôt understand 
---
Yeah the charging barrels are absolutely worthless on the gat laser. But without that it's double the attack speed of the gatling plasma. Basically it just needs to do roughly half as much per shot as the gatling plasma to be balanced, and IIRC it does. The only issue is that even if armor penetration worked for energy weapons (it doesn't), the gatling plasma is still going to be more effective dps due to enemies having any armor at all and it doing more damage per shot.
---
The real strength of the Gatling Laser is that it's really efficient with overcharged Ultracite Fusion Cores (craft them with 20+ int, you get more shots per core that way) and the perk that doubles their shots.
---
True didnt think about that
---
&gt;Saying that survival should be based on kills doesn't make sense.
---
I never  said that.   OP said that but not me. I think OP wanted player locations to be revealed based on kills. 
---
I said that no one's  location on the map should be  revealed at all- ever.  
---
Why did you friend them? Just remove them as a friend then they cant join your world and find you
---
I have unmodded excavator 
---
It doesn‚Äôt seem that great in nuke zones, so I‚Äôve been running heavy leather and stand fast
---
Do you want to help us try?
---
(FYI I‚Äôm part of the team attempting it)
---
I hope they start doing similar events for other holidays, using different towns around the map. 
---
As servers allow
---
So like, 2, and the infinite spawning robots, haha
---
If your team is not playing for xp, then you just have to be near the kill to loot it. You do not have to tag it if your teammate does. You still get the loot. My teams play Whitesprings and elsewhere all the time and just loot each other's kills. You do have to be in proximity though, and it does seem to vary. Sometimes it's hella far (other end of the cabins), others you have to be right next to each other. It really keeps the team moving when you're not waiting for everyone to get a swipe or shot in. 
---
I never disagreed with you :)
---
&gt; With our next update, we‚Äôre adding a vendor from every faction except the Enclave to the shops at the Whitespring Resort. This will help reduce the need to fast travel all around the Wasteland to visit vendors from multiple factions. Additionally, we‚Äôre combining the Cap totals from all seven vendor factions into total pool of 1,400 Caps, which should offer you more flexibility in the trades you make with specific factions.
---
Boo.  Down with changes that make things easier.
---
&gt; Additionally, turret attack ranges will now match those of players‚Äô weapons. 
---
Wow, I hope that means the turrets will target that shitty little scorched plinking my CAMP.
---
Seems logical to me
---
What platform
---
Oh yeah I run 7 purifiers atm. Helps me and teammates keep hydrated and gives us plenty to sell. 
---
You unlock them going through the story missions I think. 
---
I didn't, but on Xbox, you can have one way friends. As in, I can't see if they're on my friends list, but I appear on theirs. 
---
You can't do it. As soon as your main touches them, they stack. Tried it with a friend. 
---
Aeris lives again. 
---
i completed the main story today dont think i got anything
---
Any Unyielding or Bloodied/anti armor/instigating 1 hand weapons?
---
Hey i realized if you have two of the same masks and click them each quickly you'll lose your head. So theres that
---
war does not decided who is right, only what is left. We rebuilt war not civilization. That is what's left of America. 
---
the list in the spread sheet doesnt show anything for me is it working or do i have something not set right?
---
Yeah I got at least the one character that could support some silo runs, what can I do to prep besides scooping aid items and code-pieces?
---
I've been playin since day 1 but not wasnt part of the original beta so I been here since Nov 14th. And I still think it's ok to not reward adventure mode for anything as it's the base game, you want good loot play the hard mode really.
---
Or the system is broken because when I go against any build but those it's fine. I'm not the only one who experiences this. I have the relevant perks to increase range and decrease spread, and I'm also a vats/crit build. So, my range is decent, comparable to a short rifle or lmg. That doesn't change the fact that even after 4 crits they are still unscathed.
---
I've done plenty of research and done trial and error to learn as much as I can about this game. It's not lack of understanding, I'm a Bethesda super-fan, fallout universe especially. Most of the mechanics were carried over from FO4. They just didn't think what would happen if they left them that way and allowed PvP
---
You know you just need that beer right? If you buy the beer you wont have to craft it
---
I'll join with you.
---
And that I am fine with.  Not revealing the top 3 leaders.  I'm fine with it either way but have no objections to someone suggesting the top 3 shouldn't be shown.  
---
What is left is also the potential to rebuild civilization.
---
Or, you can manage food better by getting carnivore mutation or cannibal. Those legit will keep you fed. Eat almost anything, no disease. I agree weight management is annoying but it's easily done. You don't need more than 100 of every crafting material, and you don't need weapons you won't use. I found that out and stopped doing it. Scrap all junk, hit nearby train stations when getting heavy. Sell junk/weapons asap.
---
Is her loot loading empty or not loading at all? I confess, I haven‚Äôt killed her since the latest patch but she usually drops loot for me on ps4. 
---
I think that cap losses upon death are basically double your level?  If so, that's a terrible game mechanic. It basically punished you for leveling up. 
---
Oh it I could use my powerfist or gauntlet   In PA it would be lovely.  I think not being able to wear hazmat over armor is annoying since I can wear clothes over it.
---
Also, it's RNG. You don't get better rewards with more than one. All other evidence is anecdotal. You will get a bit more xp turning in two (max) at a time, but not as much as if you'd turned them in separately. 
---
Where can you buy it?
---
at the bottom. there is tabs go to the 2nd tab or you can use the published version https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ3rkpSJ-6_6MiXGeItP1LF96koaF50eucxx_dI4Bl75qiw_GNemTpgGWB1IcRV_VUa1AFudJectPnF/pubhtml and then the tabs are at the top.
---
The vendor caps pool is by player, not for the world...
---
Sure. Joining my game? I‚Äôm passed the first phase (Biometrics). But I‚Äôll wait to do reactor until you‚Äôre here. 
---
Also, make sure you are hitting her in her second phase at least once. If you play with other people and don‚Äôt hit her she won‚Äôt drop anything. 
---
My camp is in a great location. It takes a long time to get to it from Whitesprings but quick to get to whitesprings from my camp.
---
There is zero chance there will be off server storage. And it is primarily a game play mechanic. It‚Äôs definitly not storage space, could possibly affect responsiveness when accessing your stash. 
---
But the primary thing is to ensure you always have to be grinding. 
---
Yeah it is fast some players can almost insta kill me tse bloodied explosive or even a  reg auto. Handmade! Sometimes I do ok sometimes not
---
What‚Äôs your GT?
---
from a 1600 stash limit...
---
You said it, but one could hope that theyd make a new little feature for thaat endgame where you got a generator that powers the spawnpoints for those robots, its on the roof, and only marsupials can get up there to restore the robotic backup systems? Would potentially let us get a third scorchbeast up there but really imagine 15 of em at each others throats as well as our own?! 
---
I believe ive seen that beer on the bar upstairs. If not try the bar tender at whitesprings on thr second floor
---
None of that in the one handed category
---
Yes, one building at a time.
---
Northwestern part of the map near the lumber yard? Unknown as of now. Was added via an update a week or two ago. 
---
Chances are it‚Äôs part of a future update 
---
ah sweet thank you completely missed that at the bottom.. 
---
Honestly even my rifle crit build is worse than an automatic handmade without even using commando perks. The balance is very weird right now. Some other more detailed posts have come up but in my experience I have been absolutely dominating the bloodied builds. Though a lot comes down to who sees who first with the short ttk of most builds/weapons.
---
Yes, the perk load out options would be great, even if all my other suggestions were implemented. Still, it wouldnt solve the core problem of having to allocate agility or strength so you can carry around things you need for core gameplay, like travelling pharmacy.
---
Like... I understand that we *can* play by limiting what we carry and not picking everything up. What I am saying is that it would be more fun for most people if we didnt have to think about it so much and could just play the game. I'm even of the opinion that all these 'X breaks more slowly' cards should be removed or moved into these utility slots for perks. Like.. I leveled up three times to earn my rank 3 White Knight, let me just have the effect without having to sacrifice three ranks of adrenaline rush. It does nothing but make the game less tedious and annoying. It's not fun, it doesnt feel good. 
---
I might have a few in my inventory but wont be on for a few hours sorry
---
This is not the release notes it the in the vault... wait until the release to whine. üòÇüòÇ
---
\*Reloading flamer\* Yes.
---
\*Whispers to self\*
---
We're gonna burn him haha.
---
Head, remember you from yesterday!  Have any Bloodied Explosive Blackpowders or gatling gun?
---
Not for a global strike....
---
Why not announce it on Appalachia radio. It makes everyone turn on radio to hear where the latest killing was and who killed who...plus some great music.
---
I dumped all kinds of legendary items there.  It was so much fun every time I did the event.  Met some cool people as well.  Zero chance I‚Äôm touching survival though lol.
---
Also, potentially again considering servers, maybe you could release a bunch of 1/2 sized scorchbeasts that land... i wanna say more but less would probably up the ante, call em Scorchbeast Scouts or something, like they send smaller ones out to check new territory? I mean they ARE technically a hivemind right?
---
Right on!
---
Not bloodied explosive, but I do have a stalkers blackpowder rifle, that's two stars 
---
Block them, appear offline, report all of them from their profile for harassment stating they maliciously follow you and grief.
---
Block him on 76 and on Xbox, that will probably do the trick
---
Also have a one star exterminators black powder pistol
---
what building weighs 1600 lbs
---
I've got three but it says i only have two. I think it may be because i was given my last one. I didn't find it myself. 
---
Don't forget about /r/Market76
---
just having full damage is risk enough when you can be one shot, questing in the top 3 is impossible
---
Razor
---
Got it. Thanks
---
No thanks, thank you for replying! 
---
I did thanks!
---
Overseer stash I forgot which one though
---
No falmer I promise, and my build is general for now, I def use vats but no critical perks to speak of. I've jus been killed by players really fast and have done the same to other players built for pvp so I'm not the only who sees that gettin shot hurts alot more now. I have 1 piece of assassin's and 1 piece of chameleon armor and the chameleon is worth alot more I promise
---
I think i bought mine at Whitespring train station a while back, so I'd suggest checking all the stations. 
---
you get at least one of them (the small one, i think) through the responders part of the main questline. the others i dont remember how to get them but i have them all and i don't remember buying them, so quests and random drops are my best guess

Did you expect to get items when you die?

I just moved from Australia to the UK and my Australian bought version still works fine. I don‚Äôt think this game is region locked unlike many other MMO‚Äôs. 
---
I think I actually somewhat understood that. Very interesting 
---
So let's say I'm ok losing 10 stems, so I only carry 10 on me, plus the bare minimum food and water, let's say 6 water and 6 dog food. I venture out and run into a hostile. During our battle I use 2 stims, but am killed anyway and drop 7 more, plus 3 water and 3 of dog food. (Since those are all I'm carrying there is a much greater chance these items are dropped, as opposed to carrying a ton of stuff hoping to drop less important aid.) So, now I am left with 1 stim and barely enough food to complete my trip.
---
I know I am just throwing random numbers out there, but what it boils down to is that simply dying once on a map where fast traveling is very limited shouldn't mean that you have to head directly back to your base.
---
Furthermore, they are clearly encouraging people to PVP in survival mode, via leader boards and gold increase, so why cripple players who participate in pvp? -- I'm fine with dropping a few random aid items, but what people are dropping is large chunks of the most important aid items in their inventory. (I know it's supposed to be random, but EVERY death bag I picked up or dropped last night had stims and purified in it.)
---
Tldr; fine with aid penalty, just make the amount  less and truly randomized.
---
Your understanding of the system may not be as good as you think. 
---
In a previous comment you asked how were people tanking your hits without armor when armor goes under you clothes so you have no idea what armor they may he wearing.
---
Vats is shitty I'm a sneaky sniper who wants to use VATS but it's not viable in real time because of movement from both me and my target so you're most likely missing.
---
As far comparing your damage output against other builds, it's the meta for a reason.
---

Nah, they want to runaround with no armor and no perks and expect not to be killed ever.

Every gun they die to is a duped tse op god gun.

Why should anyone play a game mode they don't like? I liked the idea of survival where it made the tension a lot higher, but the way it is right now is a deathmatch. There is no tension when I know if I see someone they're going to attack no matter what because they give you shiny feedback to incentivize you. Now there's nothing wrong with that, but soon if you don't have at least one or 2 other people on your back it won't make sense to run survival.
---
Not making judgement, but it's not for everyone.

&gt; I think the haters are frustrated fans who wanted to like this game.

Really?  You think the people who lied about the game are "frustrated fans"?

basically, keep doing stuff. even if it's just busywork (events and daily quests, for example). i'm sure it's not the fastest method, but it's the quickest i've found.

About this - I know you can move the physical C.A.M.P. object position after you've made camp, but it doesn't change the position of the build circle. I really want to move the build circle just a tiny bit without rebuilding the whole camp.
---
is this possible?
---
What about incentivized? Like having bonus loot appear on the map and everyone fights over it, but it takes 2 minutes to open?
---
Does not exist in this game unless they just added it Tuesday. Which I doubt.
---
Thank you for making my point as to why we need more storage space.  People who just throw nukes and attack other people's hard work.  That is exactly why I want to store more materials.
---
i heard they finally patched in the number, removing the purple rectangle. it's vault 51 i think.
---
Events. A lot of events.
---
nuke your stored items too
---
the quest is uncompletable right now. probably for when they add more "main quests" later.
---
I found it twice in the raider vendor bot at top of the world. Not the train station, the one in the ski lodge. It spawns at the cash register.
---
...stash issue, how about reduce the item types meant for crafting by half thus the varietues of items junked by half too. We would then use that remaining items for crafting...thus reducing the varieties of items we have to keep on stash and using more of the stashed items in our crafting.

I have a post from a month ago saying that I am an energy weapons/brotherhood fanatic that solely played with energy weapons from fallout 3, I was obsessed with them. Since fallout 4 they have fucked the energy weapons into the ground... So much so that now I rock a bloodied melee build and have never looked back - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apl33r/behold_the_mighty_chinese_officers_sword_an_open/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share high dmg, high risk, high reward melee. 
---
I wholeheartedly agree. 
---
Get lots of exp fast it the quickest method I've found to date.
---
Yep. That's my point. Weight isn't the problem, different items are. You could have a billion of one item and it would have the same impact as one of that item. We could have kept the release day stash size if they made junk weightless in it. Bethesda solution doesn't help players it just makes the player needlessly micromanage and punish players more they play. My solution would solve it, have little to no impact on stability, have more players actually playing, and let players enjoy the loot they can choose to keep.
---
I get the feeling that there‚Äôll be more rolled out for this quest.  Personally I‚Äôd like to find a note saying she‚Äôs headed to some other city for help. Then at some point later a cavalry of NPCs will swoop in and make the world more interactive. 
---
I don't know if Bethesda cares enough to fix it. most other bans in 76 have been on the ( wait for a future patch ) a few months now. I've never played a game that does a soft ban with promise of lifting it but then does not give a time frame.  most were 24 hour, 72 hour, a week, ect.. Fallout 76 however is a we will just throw you a bone by saying it will get unbanned someday.. Someday might be the day we close the servers or maybe when we lose so many customers we need the money.. Sorry for the black day response but it is pretty much all true.

No one got suspended for carrying duped items they bought, no one!

Whats stopping me from logging with an alt and killing in over and over and over again?
---
Holy shit, the reading comprehension of this subreddit is atrocious!
---
I was level 120+ the people I were with were just hitting level 30, the guy that was griefing our shit was level 100+.
---
I never said the guy killing us was level 30, your reading comprehension sure does suck ass. üòÇ
---
Also you are the one being toxic because you are assuming shit, when you can't even comprehend what was said in the original post.
---
I was helping 3 buddies who are new to the Fallout series, we all had just built them all level 25 Excavator armor so we could loot more. They needed cores so we took a power plant yard, and in doing so had a douchebag keep killing us.
---
Since this happened I now offload my caps to one of them, and get my bloodied build going. I have been making people quit by bankrupting their stash components, and keep on killing them. 
---
They lose caps, I gain none. I made these same guys around 1k caps for killing two level 120+ douchebags who took out Poseidon power plant yard workshop, I would spawn at the station, run to the yard, destroy as much as possible, rinse, repeat.
---
You clearly don't know how to comprehend anything, and are the one who is toxic (I was helping newcomers understand the game, the lore, and do quests) and also crying about me voicing my OPINION.
---
They even addressed one-shot builds in the survival update. So please stop being such a white knight douchebag for some asshole you don't even know, who was ruining the gameplay we had, when I was helping people who never played a single Fallout before.
---
Your name checks our, stay on that sofa, I bet that shit has molded to your brown eye by now.
---
Also, on another note, how many times a day do you scream "MOM, BUCKET, BUCKET MOM, HURRY!" üòÇ
---
For leveling, sure. For stopping power, not unless you put the charge or shotgun mod on it.
---
Lol, what a toxic player crying about being one shotted (ironic) üòÇ
---
yea wearing all unmatched sets for stats but look good too. üòÅ
---
Totally right. There should be safe zones, because then you won‚Äôt have to worry about someone sneaking and killing you when you‚Äôre trying to sell stuff. I think it would help a lot of people that are getting a bad experience with the mode. Personally I‚Äôve been camped out but when that happens I always just respawn at an event near where I was going or a further train station. I also found that with wearing chameleon sometimes I spawn in invisible and that helps a looot
---
Instead of a top 3, have the Enclave send out amazing loot package events that are announced like nukes but take 10 mins minutes to land somewhere in a circle and let everyone PVP over it.
---
One cosmetic is not worth the risk of getting banned in my opinion. So for all intents, they don't exist, yet.
---
Unless it was very large quantities.

trading doesnt work for me atleast. got a bunch of magazines and read them but still didnt count. you have to find them in the wild I think.

TSE are very inaccurate aswell so screw em

By level 190 you should have enough perk cards to do crafting and a viable combat build. My character is level 101, I totally messed up the build and had to restart at like level 70, and I'm still almost done fixing my combat mistakes while not sacrificing craft perks. given 89 more levels? I'll probably have a backup combat loadout. 
---
Yeah. Iv had a REALLY busy week. (Theater prod.) I think I'll be on Saturday 
---
If you play appropriately cautiously, you won‚Äôt get shot at by anyone.  ‚ÄúFull damage‚Äù is moot when no one is shooting at you.
---
now i gotta see john wick 1 and 2 again...

Bloodied combat knife?

That sounds awesome! The Tesla rifle is one of my favorite weapons in the game

Nothing. I‚Äôve waited near two hours re zoned to check and waited for her to meat pile.

Wooo hiii Ladydevann!

I fi d its not so buggy as it is restricting

As a fairly new player I appreciate anyone trying to help me or other new players. The game can be kind of a drag at first without some good old fashioned human kindness. :)

yes...and those timeshares or whatever those condo-like buildings are

I had survived for 2 hours and had 600 caps bounty on me and I was hiding on a mountain when players started coming left and right to kill me. Had so much fun when adrenaline kicked in just before battles!
---
Agreed. Got #1 on my server as a lvl 9 surviving for 2 hours by pretty much staying as far away from train stations as I can. It was completely unearned XD, didn't even kill a single person.

I sold my only one a few days ago

---
&gt; In a future update, we‚Äôre going to give you the ability to compare your  scoreboard stats with players on your friends list as well. 
---
Once their out of Beta, this tells me there will be more to the scoreboard than just Time Alive. I think Time Alive is the best option of all the stats to use when revealing locations on the map though, it's the only stat that can be reset for a viable reason mid-week. I mean I guess you could have it based on kill streak before death, that would be good as well. 
---
Just saying that, a cool idea would be to have the reveal stat change each week. If it's Time Alive this week, next week it could be kill streak. The week after it could be richest players or most bounty collected since last death. Would be a neat dynamic to keep it fresh.
---
My battle strategy is to use my instigating  to start the fight permitting I hit first, spend the better of the first half with my shotgun for CC and the better the half of the second with laser rifle and lever. Grenade when I need to and that‚Äôs it. 
---
I know all of this, I do. I dont carry food and use a cannibal card to eat when i need to. I understand that you can scrap and bulk stuff to sell it when you are running out of weight. I do all these things, and would do them even if my suggestion were followed, because selling scrap junk is how I hit my vendor cap every day.
---
My point is, and you said it, it's annoying. And it doesnt have to be. These changes would still limit what you carry, would still cause you to go to your stash box, and I'd still be bulking and selling excess. It would just be easier, less taxing on server resources, and less annoying. 
---
Reducing time managing these things and the annoyance inherent is the core reason for this suggestion. 
---
I should be able to hit my stash box and offload 100% of my excess aid, ammo, junk, etc. and store a good item I found or two (those types of things would still be limited) without asking my three teammates to give me 20 minutes to sort things out every hour of gameplay.
---
I want to be very clear that I know you can play the game as it is, but you and I both know it's annoying and too often boils down to an inventory simulator. 
---
You and I both know they took item/inventory systems from Fallout 4. Theres no reason why that same system would be performant in a hosted environment with 24 people all over the map. Bethesda is slowly upping the limit because they know the limits are annoying, but they dont know how far they can push their non-performant system.
---
Who has lied? Most of the videos I see on YouTube that's critical of this game have been pretty honest. 
---
Please let me know

Why not both?

You need to follow up on the ticket and don't expect a rapid reply. You'll wait even a few days to a week. They'll look at your account and you should get an email to your registered account and an update in the ticket.   
---
If they found that you were a duper instead of a finder you could get a perma ban but they might say something like xxx,xxx amount of ammo like many others.   
---
The patch was a future patch, NOT the next patch.   
---
For now, if you're on xBox, create a new email and account on same xBox and just play from the beginning again. Sucks but at least you can play.

These people get it!

TSE are dead. No one uses them bloodied explosive is the new king.  Newbs who die to an explosive weapon always will whine and scream TSE bad please nerf. I killed some one with my medics explosive Gatling and they started being an asshole saying I‚Äôm bad because I have to use TSE to kill them blah blah. I offered to show them my weapon with a trade but they declined. Didn‚Äôt want to be proven wrong. Easier for them to blame TSE weapon over admitting their build is trash.
---
I‚Äôd imagine you and I are on opposite sides in the real life gun debate, but this sir is brilliant.
---
 "Additionally, we‚Äôre combining the Cap totals from all seven vendor factions into total pool of 1,400 Caps, which should offer you more flexibility in the trades you make with specific factions." 
---
is that each faction will have 1400 instead of 200? or all combined ?
---
O my every fucking soldier main
---
You had me at making the Whitesping a neutral zone, and then lost me when you suggested the no nuke no ghoul thing. 
---
I dont really find many bugs while building to be honest, but i do get boggd down in unessecary restriction like "must be placed on a foundation" and "cannot remove or some parts of the structure may become innaccable"
---
I think I also failed to mention my maxed out stash and that I'm carrying a lot of aid items.  I'm just going to use this toon to build equipment and supply the other.  I actually enjoy it more this way.
---
Hey, on ps4 myself! I also have this trouble. Out of every team-mate i‚Äôve had, they‚Äôve all been men. I am a bit younger than you (21) but i‚Äôve had fo76 pals of all stripes, so I don‚Äôt mind the age difference. If you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôd definitely love to play together! I‚Äôm mic‚Äôd, and I also love decorating so if I ever have some extra materials, I‚Äôd love to help out and make your camp super cute. 
---
You muled your main! Nice. Carry on. Play your own way.

Not really any reason to avoid it anymore. 50 is the stat level cap, so any unique weapons you earn from quests will drop at the highest level (45 or 50).

By the river next to Dyer Chemical in the Mir.
---
Not at all. I want a mode where I can get killed at any point but I don‚Äôt want a target painted on my back because I‚Äôve not be killed for so many minutes whilst I do x, y and z that isn‚Äôt PVP. Survival mode is not a PVP arena.

I dunno if West Virginia is the place for an Area 51 type vault. But I guess if it was filled with conspiracy theorists as their experiment, it could work.

When will this be dropping because the road map says both shear terror and player vending are coming on April 7th but it feels weird to have a week without content then a week with two things, has this changed or is this actually whats happening?

Honestly I can kill super easy with just a medic's explosive automatic handmade with no commando investment. Survival balanced is fucked. Everything kills super easy barring the assassin sent builds and those get scared pretty quick with a vats head shot followed by gamma gun.

Dedicated share boxes would be even better if it's not been mentioned
---
It was a quest reward in Beta that got removed, so there‚Äôs no way to differentiate between cheated marine armor helmets and legitimate ones. I have been wearing the marine helmet for three months and haven‚Äôt been banned. Once you scrap it you can craft it, so it‚Äôs easily traded.

I'm guessing you're a level 44 (since you said fellow level above)... did you not think that you would be covered in BBQ sauce for all the higher levels?

I bet that guy asking was to sidetrack you thinking you'd fight someone on the same level... except other players just lured you in.

Oh god

I will be honest way back when we only had a photo of the 76 jump suit and the name of the game "Fallout 76" me and a friend thought it would be a battle royal. We guessed that people would come out of Vault 76 and there would be a truce period then fog like the far harbor fog would close in. Glad it's not a battle royal if it was a optional game mode that would be fine but I definitively like the open world game we have now.

In game play yes I knew that.  That is basic game play, in build mode to go 3rd person for a different perspective that doesn‚Äôt work.

If you're on Xbox I'll sell you one for 40 caps.

Did everybody else get something?

Love this game but sometimes people are sorta asshole-ish. Nothing you can really do about It though lol.

I loved seeing all the people working together and I hope Bethesda creates more events like this. However out of the 30 + times I completed the event not one rare mask or beret (someone eventually gave me a beret). I also never seen anyone wearing one of the rare masks.
---
 While the 60 caps and easy xp were nice please up the drop rates. I honestly wouldn't be surprised to hear that the devs forgot to add them to the events loot table.

As far as first impressions go however this event shows a lot if potentional for Fallout 76 and my first time completing the mission was very much memorable.

Haha, it is pvp, you should have expected that. Fatman sucks for pvp. You don‚Äôt sound pvp specced so you are going to get chewed up. A level 25 can take a two shot fatman with the right perks and dense chest mod. You learned something which is good
---
I tried. People only give me hate. So it's all I'm going to give back. Fuck this echo chamber.
---
If you can't see how badly Bethesda fucked this product up then you are blind. It's the only online Fallout game we have, so we have to suffer through it if we want to play Fallout online.

The 1400 caps is a total between them all. I don't think they realize that if you try to sell a serum to a vendor for 450 caps they cannot buy it cause they are at a limit of 200. Now we can sell serums to vendors for the full amount. this would drive serum prices to at least triple since most serums can be sold to a vendor now for more caps then before

There are armor and perk cards that almost 100% counter the stagger.

I am agree! Sea of Thieves is so awesome
---
Woodland warrior is similar to the camo paints that have been floating around, but look nicer and are cheaper(?).
---
The bundle is a set of desert/heathland camo for power armor, and camo for combat, leather and metal armor. Plus some new camo for the listed weapons.

ADVENTURE MODE!

Never saw them again since I did the original quest. They don't appear when that other quest activates also. Something of the swamp or something - can't think of the name. 
---
I guess so lol üòÇ 
---
Dark souls egg head, with the parasite kick as well!
---
Good point. Sorry for jumping

No perks for that. And if you are willing to trade Dense for Pneumatic, you are dead anyway.
---
I did point out that could be exploited if not handled properly in the first post you replied to. Could be something as easy as a cooldown timer on multiple kills in a row. That would prevent large use of alt killing as well as spawn camping.
---
Didn't they say some mutations would have a physical effect on the character's appearance before the game was launched? I swear I read that somewhere. 
---
Looks like your correct so that's good it's not necessarily wasting anything thanks man
---
I was just watching something that adamantium skeleton helps with the stagger effect. 
---
Yes I also tamed one at the random spawn by generals steakhouse 
---
" Additionally, we‚Äôre combining the Cap totals from all seven vendor factions into total pool of 1,400 Caps, which should offer you more flexibility in the trades you make with specific factions." also from the patch notes
---
lol my build still revolves around TSE and I have no problem one shotting anyone that gets in my way 
---
Nah, I have 3 points on that.
---
So I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the tamest way to get owned and yet still be salty enough to make a post about it.
---
I really hope that mole rat didn't get her :(
---
My camp is hanging off of the cliff next to Argos Pharma and had that issue, found by moving the c.a.m.p. Around it changed where I spawned. I just moved it till it spawned me at the top of the cliff 
---
...but why?
---
Yeah, so can everything thing else.
---
I think I bought the dense marine mod from watoga vendor, still have it I think as I use buttressed instead
---
"Heart  or Hearthof the swamp"
---
I'd say farming the random spawns to get the civil war Era hat and witch's costume recipes are your best bet.  With either of those making caps from vendors is pretty trivial. Also some weapons are worthwhile like the revolutionary sword + electrified blade mod can turn minimal mats into better return than bulking.
---
Just please don't invalidate  people who honestly don't like it.  So you liked it, but people who really didn't (mostly old school fallout fans) have just as valid of an opinion - and no one can deny that there are real reasons we don't like where they went with FO76.
---
dang bro, the daily doesn't even activate unless you go to Biv and talk to him... stop going to talk to him if you don't want to do them anymore.
---
I wouldn't worry too much.
---
Whitesprings will be the hub if you want to BUY THINGS.  Need that one plan that could be on multiple vendors?  Head to Whitesprings.
---
If you're just looking to sell stuff for caps, every single vendor will tap into that 1400 cap limit.  I'd venture that's the bigger ongoing need, especially since you'll need to do a lot more selling than buying, overall.
---
I just put stuff in the Overseer Cache at her camp. When I started a new character two weeks ago, someone had put a ton of supplies and plans in there. It was incredibly helpful for me just starting out so now I do it all the time.
---
It's also good for me because I have social anxiety and actively avoid players. This way I can give gifts without the interaction haha Though I know the downside is someone who doesn't need the stuff could take it but eh...
---
Yea I‚Äôve been finding the mods laying around and I pick them up...it‚Äôs the plans I‚Äôm after
---
plans cant be found anymore (at least for now)
---
mods can be found at harp ferry, watoga &amp; bos vendors (not guarantee though, might have to server hop)
---
I did get a free location discovery and it put me near a quest marker for continuing the overseers journey! 
---
Personally I‚Äôm okay with the current system. It actually reminds me a lot of survival in fo4 where each trip out of your camp is an actual excursion. You have to travel light and take just enough to survive but also thrive. 
---
To get around that I‚Äôll move my camp around in survival a lot more. Kinda sucks to give up a spot you like but it‚Äôs wayyyy more efficient. I‚Äôll determine where I want to scavenge then set up camp in a nearby central location. 
---
Remove bloodied explosive and suddenly there is a new meta and people say that meta is op.
---
Repeat this until there are no guns.
---
Just because you died, dont make it op
---
There's no reason not to do it at that point.
---
Just be mindful that some of the quest rewards are ridiculous when it comes to weight ("Congratulations, here's a 40 pound Missile Launcher!")
---
Dw, they're upping the turret lethality in the next patch, for pvp anyway.
---
I do this too! I started the game over two weeks ago after not playing for months and someone had put a ton of supplies and plans in there. It was incredibly helpful for me just starting out so now I do it all the time to "give back"!!!
---
Wat? Everyone wears outfits man, no one can see gear other than your gun. 
---
Nice :) im hoping this pet doesn't randomly drop dead like my past two pets
---
Events still remove pvp, I‚Äôm pretty sure. 
---
*cough*bunker buster*cough*
---
get rid of all pvp on adventure. leave the pvp scum on survival.
---
lvl 190 here, I have discovered Overseers camp in the main quest
---
Too soon.
---
Most people go for the guy with the power armor and the minigun than the guy with the regular hunting rifle, I've seen that more than once, even tested it with a couple of buddies across different servers.
---
Maybe a option too switch between both
---
I agree.  My jam is serrated combat knife lvl 50.
---
I swear the assumptions from people on here are too damn funny, I feel like I am in r/politics right now.
---
I like how you call me toxic yet you go on to berate me calling my mother a slut, and saying my step-dad grounded me for being a lazy piece of shit (nice projection here, I see why all you have done is talk shit, then a week later complained about the same kind of shit.
---
I didn't try to get him banned lol, I was stating my opinion on asshole players who harass low level characters. But don't let that stop you from showing your ass, and looking like a right ole nutcase at the same time.
---
Also, if I had no phone or internet, how the fuck would I be on here replying? I let that thread die since the majority of people replying were just as toxic, and have just as horrible reading comprehension as you do.
---
Go back to McDonalds and demand a free cheeseburger, cause the one you ordered had cheese on it. üòÇ
---
Or better yet, get drop kicked by someone cause your talking shit IRL, and have that porkchop come flying out your asshole like a cannonball. üòÇ
---
Your name matches your attitude, and the projection is too on point, sorry you have a shitty life, maybe talk to someone, get counselling, or just go off and be a recluse, your choice bud.
---
Have fun crying, and being toxic, as I was stating my opinion (never linked the dudes name, never called for him to be banned ; all I did was say it is fucked for someone to do 2145 damage in a PvP situation when his internet speed was as slow as you are when you go for a "jog") hit the showers bud, you reek.
---
if you don't enjoy the game overall i can see this. most of the game is kind of a chore if you look at it that way. i play the same game you do, but i enjoy doing everything i still can with no main story quests left.
---
hahahahaahahahah omg so funny 
---
if you did the quest that takes you to Dyer Chemical then the only way to get pods is do the Heart of the Swamp event.
---
Lemonade stand is also Watoga station/ Graham in my experience.
---
Its fine the way it is
---
Correct but they had to have a LOT of them. I know 2 players that had 2k quantum cola and didn't get banned. That's a lot imo
---
If the pvp war clusterfuck is at the whitespring terminal like it usually is, don‚Äôt go there. 
---
There you go: http://imgur.com/a/BB4OhOg
---
I think it's Arktos Pharma not Gauley Mine.
---
I know of 2 that didn't duplicate and picked up ammo at White Springs. They got the suspension letter and login error the same until they cleared their accounts, meaning they verified they no longer had it and it was dumped.   
---
1 picked up a bag and it had a bunch of ammo and nuked flora in it and the other had a stack of 7 axes but they were level 50.  
---
The one dumped the ammo got their account back but the other hasn't yet since they haven't played that much.   
---
Bottom line is that I know they didn't duplicate stuff but they did pick it up and both admitted to that to Bethesda. 
---
My issue(s) didn't completely go away, but it went from every few minutes to once or twice an hour, which is an improvement 
---
I think TSE is more shorthand for "That lame one-hit-kill gun people buy in the aftermarket to compensate for their lack of actual skill."  TSEs were the first, so the name stuck.  They won't be the last.  Besides, it acronyms better than BE. üòã
---
There used to be a fast travel mat in the B.E.T.A but they removed it by the 3rd or 4th day
---
Lol oh no, that's backwards. As I raider I don't target people in power armor because they look well equipped. Quite the contrary, if someone is in power armor I assume they are the weakest target with the worst gear. It's less "Oh noes power armor" and more "This guy definitely doesn't have assassin's gear."
---
I think that's it.. Supposidly on the corpse slightly north of the fort
---
The weapon isnt even good.
---
For me thats 30 skeleton costumes!
---
Well they have references to all kinds of pop culture stuff in this game, just added a pvp server, pvp emote..
---
So tie in the pop culture reference to riddick and im gonna kill ya with this tea cup kinda thing.
---
you should lose everything when you die -true survival
---
I live on the river as its the only place I know of that has a junk pile close enough too water.
---
Yeah I remember that, but WHYYYY
---
until you reach the top 3, which is literally what we were talking about, ffs use your head...
---
That‚Äôs my biggest worry. I wasn‚Äôt even that excited to hear about the new whitespring vendors because I haven‚Äôt even tried to go there yet, and I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs going to be safe at all. 
---
I've checked the random spawn point near the Overseer's Camp about 20 times, looking for the corpse with the top hat plans--read about that here. No luck though. Where should I try for those other plans? 
---
Lol! I know! I thought I picked survival lol please turn it down! thx..
---
Thanks for this post, super sledge noise is super annoying!
---
Best fan idea for this game I've seen yet totally on board!
---
I do but on PC. I never use my mic though because being female in an online game tends to be bad.
---
Plot twist: misplaced decimal. Again. 2500 kills needed. This week.
---
Yes, man, exactly this. They gave us an awesome online game but the incentives are just completely out of whack. They need to make it easier to play with a team and also people who are just in the same area as you
---
 It should be a good thing if two people can clear the golf course, main level vs top floor, and still get rewards for it. Everything from exp, loot, and inventory management taking some time (and being wildly different between characters depending on perk cards) makes playing with people a huge loss in efficiency. 
---
Sucks to hear you suggested this and we still don't have it. Seems they want to spend their time building the survival mode that nobody asked for, instead. 
---
A real shame.
---
You should probably try to actually follow a discussion thread before starting to turn to insults.
---
We‚Äôre talking about the leaderboard being necessary because of the safety you can have in survival if you are careful.
---
YES PLEASE
---
Does have the lowest damage resist, but its more than enough for fighting Scorchbeast and Scorched.
---
How do you tame them?
---
You're the first guy I've met to not attack the "big boys" then, nice change of pace.
---
As with John Wick, start a fight inside and once you die or leave, you get a bounty &amp; excommunicated from the Whitesprings for a decent period of time e.g. a week. 
---
I can respect that. I feel like moving your base around is fine if you want to do it, but shouldn't  be an encouraged part of the meta.
---
They give us the tools to build fortresses, and moving most bases isn't very easy currently, so for people who like me who love the pvp and base building / defending aspects it kinda kills some of the fun.
---
I also think it's worth noting that I've had a lot of fun PVP skirmishes that were extended battles, where I wouldn't have had the same experience if both me and the enemy weren't loaded up with a ton of stimpaks. If the ultimate strategy now is to run around with minimal chems I feel like we might be missing out on some of those opportunities for larger battles.
---
I would assume so. As everyone was trading and selling at Watoga. 
---
Agreed
---
Or they could just incorporate:
