Sometime next month after we kill 8 million Scorch.

This isn't an airport there's no need to announce your departure.
---
Anything west of Mississippi and below Colorado should have mutated tarantulas. Like New Vegas and Nuka World. ALL of them should have snakes. Big fncking snakes.
---
I have mine in a room where the only entrance is a garage door. When the witch is flipped the machines turn off and the door closes, completely sealing them off unless someone destroys a wall. Edit: The switch is in another building in a locked room, so people can't even find it unless they break into the room and become wanted.
---

---
The machines are still active even if they aren't powered, so I changed to this method after someone stumbled on my camp and bought a 15k legendary when I was at max caps.
---
....display cases got added to the game recently.
---
Spread the word, we’re all fools!
---
Sell. The “value per weight unit”  is not good. Now that meat week is a repeating event, I’ve liquidated my tenderizers. Wait, that sounded better in my head.
---
Dextrouspick539
---
So did pubg and sea of thieves. I'm still not holding my breath Bethesda will. It will cost them money, and they really like their money.
---
Fallout games are Fallout games. It Is not about them being good, bad, garbage or perfect. They entertain a certain type of gamer. Like myself. If you want perfect, go play super Mario bros 3, or Street Fighter 2 World Warrior.
---
So, me coming here saying other games are better is “trash talk”? If I have an option that differs from yours it is“trash talk”? Fair enough I guess. This is the world we live in.
---
It's tedious AF, but you can change each individual light by clicking on them directly and cycling through the colors.
---
Do airport do that sort of thing? I don’t listen to the radio much.
---
Not this week
---
Where can I find Grahm to give him this prime meat?
---
Read inside the vault

I wish more people understood that the issue most of us have is with people not taking the workshop after they shoot us, *not* the fact that they shot us in the first place. I'm fully aware that when I'm claiming a workshop, I'm opening myself up to PVP for the workshop. 
---
For
---
the
---
workshop. 
---
Key words. 
---
If you, especially at a much higher level than me, come to my workshop, shoot me, loot me, and leave without taking the workshop, you're a seal clubber and a griefer.
---
If you, at any level, come to my workshop, shoot me, loot me (or not), and then also take the workshop, you're a PVPer and anyone accusing you of griefing them at their workshop is a whiner.
---
Mind you, this is for adventure mode. I have no idea how workshops worked in Survival (I'd assume similar; also RIP Survival even though I never played it).
---
You will continue to get that same helmet plan until you either learn it, or carry it on you when you finish a raid.
---
About the 'not receiving plans':
---
?
---
“Pay to win”
---
Honestly, I never thought there was a different type of consumer than one that only wants the best they can get for the money paid. But maybe Bethesda is seeing a whole market I never thought exists
---
I just did it and got my scrip. I dunno....
---
Legendary Players?
---
Same here. Level 360 but just ran out of things to do, even after leveling up multiple characters just to build cool stuff. Looking forward to something major!
---
Remove the turret or get ready to be ruined.
---
She will probably get her stuff back as she has video proof but I am just wandering how a thing like that is even possible. Who wrote this code? A 12 year old kid with? Not even that, I bet 12 year old kids can write better code...
---
I put a sign saying free on mine and it's still always full.
---
Love it man :)
---
Do airports regularly announce departures or are they just put on a tv for people to look at? I fly a lot and hey only announce lost bag or people. If they did something like that it’d be on the radio “ LAX  just announced all departure are on time.” Never happened.. ever
---
It's considered trash talk because you came to the Fo76 subreddit to say it.
---
Recently? Feels like a month ago.
---

Next week it will be.  Hell, if ur on Xbox, I’ll probably buy it, since I’ll probably not get one this time either
---
No gear (just undies to prove no armor (not even under armor)), a server of peeps watching the duel. Each man gets a single shot with the blunderbuss. If they both miss it comes down to a bare knuckle fist fight.
---
No stimpacks. 
---
The sight to behold as two Alphas duel for the amusement of the blood thirsty crowd. One man standing at the end.
---
... and if the crowd are Raider RPers they can take down the winner afterwards &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt;
---
Mine kept getting stuck next to his station so I have to move it around
---
Assholes still take your junk while you are busy taking pillars, dying and fighting the fight. Stash your shit before joining.

s/
---
\#metoo sucks :( missed a few so far
---
That’s a really loose interpretation of trash talk. I might be wrong but, what I heard is “ don’t come into my house and tell me it’s dirty”
---
Optimize for a particular type of weapon. Exit the game to force save. Favorite your best gear. Don't expect the game to work properly 100% of the time.
---
Stop connecting to the internet using a toaster.
---
Scrap them for materials along with the cleavers and clothing.
---
Nuts I was all excited
---
The best way is to be realistic in terms of how many weapons you allow yourself to carry, avoiding fast travel and stuff like that. Not swapping perks Is what I do, also.
---
Gotcha, either way it's still announced. An announcement in writing is still an announcement. Overhead speakers is an announcement text on screen is an announcement  ... I never thought I'd write announcement that many times lol
---
Also for the deaf I assume they still do the speakers thing.
---
It’s available on PC because people got it from the dev room and once you scrap one you learn the plan. Bethesda said they won’t go after people who already have it.
---
It’s not available on console.
---
Recently as in a month or so.
---
Well technically is would be rude for someone to enter your house and insult it...
---
Grind on that meat yeahhhh.
---
Again, where did they say this? I believes you but no one has given me a post.
---
Lol! What a funny thing to debate about. You are right. I guess I announced it... damn it. Guess my next step is just to toss all my BE’s into a river outa spite.
---
I’d even be happy with my buddy from FO 3. Good evening sir! Always made coming home special.
---
Bloodied heavy guns power armor is the best DPS in the game, if you’re at an SBQ for less than 5 minutes, its because of this.
---
I average ~350-400 damage a shot with my bloodied .50cal and don’t die easily, thanks to emergency protocols on my power armor core. 
---
The trade off is the massive amount of resources required to run this build, luckily, once you have an excellent farming route, this is not an issue.
---
:)
---
its the white SB piss they spray all over the place that's poison.
---
Lmao, I've never been lucky enough to find a BE yet.
---
&gt;Dodgy, Serendipity, Fireproof and Blocker
---
these are wonderful, worth the points
---
Just checked. August 8th. I love them but all of the issues we found back then with display cases still exist. Many items clip outside the glass (try the captured frog, no display case can contain her). Many items you’d think would work just can’t be displayed (banjo, VTU baseball cap, Scorched Ashes just a few off the top of my head). Just pointing out that this is an ongoing issue, I wish they’d address it.
---
The only mention was strangely placed in the Raider pack's description. I've got it equiped on my X-01 and Ultracite now. Looks awesome, just wish it had a visual representation of Tesla coils. I bought them to make my X-01 look cool, only to realize that they don't actually show up on X-01.
---
I told them I had the same amount as the previous day, and they doubled down on assuring me I was credited them. I stopped responding, as support is fucking useless.
---
25 is also enough in a lot of cases.  Won't mitigate every last drop of the damage but enough so that a diluted stim is all you really need.
---
Invest in serendipity or emergency protocols to negate dying
---
That’s my point. I guess I’m 100% wrong on all of this. The only true outcome is to dump all my BE’s into a lake before I untstall. Hopefully I laugh while I do it... you can always chalk my profile to see if I’m bs-ing
---
You can still use broken armor and get the legendary effects. I think that’s the only viable way to use them.
---
Greatly appreciated! Nice to finally see a skin that supports Ultracite. They seem rare in supply.
---
Yes, but they cost money. Bethesda doesn't like to spend any money if they don't have to. Plus, they already use PC as the testers right now, why would they change that?
---
I’m queued to join your server. Are you in a party or team?
---
Yeah. Money.
---
&gt; If it is locked and I'm in the right mood, I just take the bounty and try to get to as many camps as I can before I'm taken out.
---
That sounds like fun :) may give that a try.
---
Yeah it seems it just wasn't working earlier but I reset and it worked.
---
I think I can craft it, but it is honestly not as good as some of the other soups. It gives more food, but at the price of a salt and two addition vegetables. I use them as a treat when I find salt. 
---
I found my first copy at Clancy Manor, but there is some apparently in Sutton.
---
Wastelanders is coming out in November though?
---
Sorry dude I’m gonna throw all mine in a river. Even the be Gatling plasma. I’m done with this game and community. Good luck getting yours tho
---
Lol me, always. You can hit some impossible shots in vats
---
That's an interesting approach.
---
Pay-to-be-royally-irritated-by-its-incessant 'jokes'
---
fixed it for you
---
Jesus Christ I sold mine for 300 caps
---
No alone at the moment
---
Sarcasm
---
I made a new alt just because there's times in the game where I have all these legendaries from events, and nothing to do with them. So I decided that my main will be a good guy and my alt with be a bad karma when that system rolls out.
---
It doesn't delete it but it seperates it into your inventory when you rejoin a server. At least that's what it did to me
---
Different difficulty for different levels
---
i am one of his managers and he is the greatest person on the game
---
Deathclaws are chameleons. But we have WesTek so I think they're easily explained. Never got the radscorps though unless we are just saying all those pet scorpions grew up in life lol
---
Because some people do that as a trap.
---
Joining. Do you need more than 55?
---
Too true!!
---
Oooh, a bosssssssssssss
---
Congratulations you failed
---
Hey, if it's a high-speed toaster, OP should be fine!
---
Unyielding Sentinel or Cavalier with AP or whatever else you want.
---
More like, “pay to move on”
---
There was a bunch of old posts about it. Here is an old screenshot from a support ticket.

good luck on your adventures.
---
3-5 primal meats depending on which zone you're in (less for lower level zones).
---
I built mine by the meat week main event, just to try to get rid of alot of my stash weight, and to make it easy to fast travel to ghram and be right up the stream from him
---
How?
---
Nice, i’ve Got unyielding sentinel with AP. Full set of heavy BoS combat armor.
---
It's all good I wasn't asking for them I'm a Junkies build I'm too reckless for a low health build. I'd most likely trade them for stuff I won't kill myself with. 
---
Hey have fun in your next game. BL3 looks pretty sweet along with Cyberpunk actually there's a lot of good new games out. I wish I had more time that's why I mostly play Fallout. I can do my daily runs in about an hour (caps, scrip Legendary farming, and hit a few vendors) and be happy with it.
---
Good luck in your next game may your BE's rest in peace.
---
Constant? I login every once in a while to bitch and moan about the game. Isn’t that what everybody does?
---
Two-shot is one of the worst prefixes in the game.  They SUCK.
---
Just got one arm done, need like 30
---
Same, bloodied .50cal, and a Furious FFR Ultracite Gatling Laser as my “Daily Driver” because fusion cores are so damn easy to get.
---
Tesla rifle too for group tagging.
---
I just wanna say thanks for not being a dick! You’re one of two. Thanks again!
---
I think they should spend every minute of their time on the game and the many issues it has.
---
Sorry, how do we tagg? Just point at them to make sure i see what they read?
---
Have a teammate cuz when you're wanted you can't see where any other player/camp locations are! 
---
Or, I keep toying with the idea of a snapshot of the map before picking the lock. Haven't tried yet.
---
Wait, this is the proof? 
---
I’m assuming it’s something on my end. It’s blurry as fuck. Also the text look very odd.
---
It was fixed - I think quietly - in patch 13. I hung onto my duplicates and have sold a few since then. Stock is going down now with meat week 2.
---
Mine just froze 30 seconds ago, but I was past due to sleep anyway...
---
Ahh there's no point in it. I like the Airport joke but that's about as dickish as I get. I love puns I can't help it.
---
I feel you, took me by my suprise when i hit it myself
---
I’ve got a B25 and BE Gatling, and I prefer the BE.  I only use my Gatling for normal (non-boss) mobs, and the BE is more likely to 1-shot them.  B25 is better overall DPS, but at the cost of more ammo.  It’s hard for me to justify FFR on any heavy weapon with the rate they chew through ammo.
---
Keep it chill bro-Chacho. Thanks again.
---
I know there's reasons, but the main thing that makes me not want to play the game much anymore is the fact I cannot build more stuff. My camp is super cool, but with all the things I wanna display, I know I'd end up taking down a bunch of stuff. I told myself I'd wait, but there hasn't been a budget increase announcement like I was hoping.
---
You’re living the dream then. 👍
---
Have fun at Watoga, friendly scorched beast spawns there and pulls the fog crawlers away, runs the timer down, kill it before event begins if you can.
---
How so? As long as it isn't locked it shouldn't trigger pvp
---
Yeah I wasn't sure which it was, I always preferred pneumatic mod without much consideration, I'll look into dense. Ty
---
What the hecks a noxious sheepsquatch? Lol
---
I’d wait until the next double XP weekend and just make a new character.  I went level 1 to 123 over the last one.  I’ll do it again the next one too.  👍
---
This GnB 5 is pure gold. Especially if you clear west tek and Huntersville to scrap all of the weapons, you can get upwards of 2500-3k steel from assault rifles if done right. Plus however much plastic from lasers.
---
Yes, what is the break-even dr?  Where the berz is equivalent to vanilla?
---
Freezing up when I initiate commerce with the local vendor bot is cool too.
---
Wait. Where even is Nuka world? I know its not in the commonwealth because they always mention going to the commonwealth, but I dont think they ever directly mentioned what part of the country its in.
---

The Fallout / Borderlands crossover you never knew you wanted until now.
---
Haha, ah well. I don't understand all the downvotes. I've taken a long hiatus from 76; at least adventure mode. I love the game and I think it's repetitive at this point. Nuclear winter, though!
---
The planting of normally-unplantable crops could be done with perk cards. Since you’re not going to be using your high combat perks, you’d have space in your load-out. Without those farming perks in your load-out, you wouldn’t be able to plant or farm those crops in your C.A.M.P.
---
All $12 lol. Funny thing is I’m sure you’ve got hundreds of hours of playtime under your belt.
---
Yup. I spammed the picklock button and was finally able to open it.  But was the lock was picked I could not access the contents.  Happened in Watoga.
---
The last time I used one, I had friends rotate the map and we got 7k steel and 1k plastic
---
Long story short. Some people have trapped players by having the door close behind them(powered doors) and have some kinda of nature damage area to prevent the players from fast traveling.  Note I only heard of it but given this was my friend I do believe that.
---
correct

---
I’ve not read close. But basically, I’m not a meat week fan. Let’s kill scorched instead ;-)
---
Spaghetti code my dude. When a game engine hasn’t received a total overhaul in over a decade, it becomes a mess held together with duct tape.
---
I honestly am not sure, but I assumed somewhere in the mid-west since it looks awful a lot like Nevada.
---
The past few days I've been roleplaying as a naked man around Appalachia. Surprisingly, nobody has asked why I'm not wearing clothes. Maybe they want me to think the suit really is magnificent.
---
Sucks but why do you need to store it anyway? Meat week and prime cuts happens so often I can't even make time to go back home sometimes.
---
You win this time...
---
depends on how much bread he can push through that toaster.
---
Not really. Its more personalized and in greys for what you do having a positive and negative effects with particular groups or people. Karma was always a bit too lazy in comparison.
---
Platform? It’s a glitch where it’s halfway above ground.
---
Oh like mine won’t even let me do anything. It’s glitching so much that I can’t even look inside it there no option to do anything with it. Just keeps twitching from the surface to under the map real fast.
---

---
I just assumed that Nuka World was a stand-in for Six Flags New England in Agawam, MA. It’s located in south central Massachusetts, so it could conceivably be linked to the suburbs of Boston via a monorail system. 
---
Although it clearly takes inspiration from Disney World and Hershey Park.

I just kept repositioning my view until the pick lock option would flash and disappear.  That’s when I spammed the pick lock button.

But I never got inside.

If you like jetpack, it's the ultracite for now. Because you can combine jetpack with the other torso mod (like emergency protocols for low-hp buff or assembled core for better ap regen).
---
T51b is the strongest one and have every mod.
---
X01 is the best PA for the nuked area (best radiation resistance) and also has every mod available.
---
Excavator can carry the most weight and has bonus for mining ores.

That would be another $9 plus a few PA frames getting emptied.

Actually, I was told Fortnite is still in Beta, so you never know

But think of the canvas bags!

I should be able to, should i get my power armor?
---
I'll trade you a bald eagle for a kangaroo
---
Yes. Part of it is really radioactive.
---
Not sure, I tried to look into it to find some information but couldnt really find anything. I recall people saying it was broken at some point and if you have any dr it goes straight to 50% less damage. But I don't think thats intended. 
---
I havent done any testing other than seeing berserkers weapons do less damage than the same stock weapon.
---
If you have a berserkers gun and want to test it, the cars in the game show raw damage numbers after you blow them up.
---
I do it sometimes to bring the enemies out of hiding, too. Plus, it's fucking awesome fun.
---
As others have said, I’d put in a poison or two. You may find you don’t actually need the AP refresh (I generally don’t - Grim Reaper’s takes care of that for me generally always)
---
Gamertag is "phinfan007" Feel free to friend me! I'm usually on later at night, depending on my work schedule. I'm always looking for people to team up with.

Nail on the head. Given the rocky state of the game, I expect the last thing the team behind it wants is to be better known to their exasperated player base.

With all of this "project clean Appalachia" business I'm starting to wonder just where my tax money is going🤔

---
I just donated one wood while reading this
---
At level 200 I finally gave up camping at nodes. 14 of anything an hour was a joke anyway for a very long time. Scrapping a single assault rifle yields more scrap. That's right 1 rifle an hour replaces an extractor.
---
Yea ive heard this works, sentinel would be a good effect for that, but you can never take the armor off unless you wanna repair it and go through the long process of letting it break again. Which means no hazmat suits, and power armor would negate your berserkers weapons, so no nuke zones haha
---
Hey there. I'll add you when I get on later!

If it's the black uniform, I've got the plans for those, and I can make you one if you want. I'm on XB1.

Take the hard bargain perks early and always save your grape mentats and use them before buying/selling.

I've been keen on this since it was announced, and even moreso now that the Vault Raids have been introduced.

That said, I'll always take a necessary delay over an incomplete product.

Just means I'll have more levels when it goes live.

Such a perfect name for the challenge!

I've been using the same weapons for months. I've noticed a change.

---
Unfortunately...Wastelanders is of utmost importance at the moment, I hope they plan on throwing some shine on this for all the plans they are pushing off until next year/spring. 
---
Really like your ideas, but with the engine being so limited I believe a massive chuck of building budget would be needed for some of your ideas(Idea#1 &amp; 4), not your fault of course, it's the ones(Bethesda) who want to throw a fart tube on a Prius engine and think they can drag race (modified outdated engine trying to run an MMOish/Survival RPG).

How did you buy it for $7?

Same shitty rewards as last time, not worth it.

One of the things I want is a loadout that will come on automatically when you enter the bounds of your CAMP -- so all your crafting perks switch on when you get home.

Really disappointing how long everything is taking considering we all know it will be a broken mess at release (yes i want them to take their time. That said it will still be horrific and we all know it). That said, i am super happy for all these thing. A great communication and they earn some points for that. 
---
Especially glad that they brought up legendary players considering it was originally locked for the summer map and they just never spoke of it again. 2020 is concerningly far away (especially since they announced it for wastelanders content and now its out.)
---
No update on the wastelanders release date with such an honest post is a good sign. Means its on schedule for the very last day of november.
---
I have a full wood unyielding set, wood armor for that sweet stealth. The stat boost you get from full unyielding is better than chameleon for sneak. 
---
I have 1 piece of chameleon wood armor I switch to when I dont want players to see me, but I go into caution and danger alot easier with chameleon as opposed to unyielding.
---
With 35 perception and agility, if you use vats its amazing. You can headshot everything at any distance, with a few shots concentrated fire makes your headshot accuracy 95%. Gun-fu makes you switch targets and keeps firing and doing more damage, grim reapers sprint keeps you in vats foreverrrr.

&gt;todd howard is the face of the company

even though he isnt at fault I really do love the todd memes that have been made these recent years
---
I’ve had this happen a couple of times. Sometimes the next step is far so I fast travel but that seems to be fine one time and not the next.
---
I agree. Freeloaders are fine. At least they will pull some aggro. 1 shot assholes are a problem and also forcing players to reduce their damage on events to allow friendliness is also bullshit.
---
5 maximum
---
I'm really hoping Wastelanders adds a lot to the game, too.
---
The vault raids were dissapointing, NW is the main thing keeping me in game right now.
---
thanks for this, just spent like 20 mins looking for this info lol
---
No. In fact I tried this on Xbox myself this afternoon and it doesn't work the way claimed.
---
This is something the community has been requesting for a long time. 
---
Total weights for a category (junk), individual item weights (all your screws weigh xx pounds). 
---
This needs to make it clear the weights with and without weight reduction perks).

YES! I’ve been playing quite a bit the last few weeks on PC. I’m not good and I’m aware that I get killed fair and square most times, but it’s been getting ridiculous lately. I’m level 45 with a pretty good load out, yet I’ve been 1 shotted (in frog legs mid air even) more than ever.
---
I’m taking a break for meat week. Ahhhh, calm peaceful meat week.
---
Nah it’s still explosive and its legacy
---
So because it’s legacy it’s worth a lot more then normal weapons
---
That would make in lore role playing viable, so NO
---
Same for me. I love NW, and haven't even bothered to drop into Adv, to finish my 100th camp rebuild for a while.
---
I was really looking forward to running around as a 5 star legendary and seeing other 5 star legendary players ;(
---
And cazadores
---
*shudders*
---
Cool, thanks. If/when I finally reinstall, I'll try and remember that.
---
Righto man
---
I hunk its a lot harder to track/catch NW cheaters.  Unless someone submits video evidence (which would be next to impossible) they are unlikely to ever do anything.    Maybe if one player gets reported about times, but that’s still tough
---
It’s unfixable, an exploit that has been abused since day one.
---
I can use all the fusion cores I can get.
---
I’ve mentioned this a while ago.  If you hover your cursor over an event there should be an offset, persistent text box that says “Join xxx Event”. You can use this (if there are a lot of players) or the event circle to join.
---
I’ve watched red vs blue, yes
---
Wait do you mean there’s a limit to how many renamed things you can have, or there’s a limit on how many times you can rename anything?
---
Possibly november. Could be the very last day of november
---
Dude
---
That’s offensive!
---
I just want a consistent timeline/roadmap. 
---
Or even just which bugs they are prioritizing &amp; why and which bugs will never be fixed, lots of weapon perks are broken because "insert reason"...(here's looking at you MR. +250 DR While Reloading). A lil more transparency goes a long way for most people, being silent until patchday is getting old.
---
Son of these things were originally supposed to be in waste Landers so it is kind of a Badomen
---
There's a limit to how many renamed things you can have across stash and inventory. It sucks
---
Very likely the last day of November
---
Legally they cannot reuse that code without having a full code review and getting the original author to relinquish all rights to it
---
Maybe they should increase the rarity, or decrease the duration, but the items themselves feel fine to me. They take a certain skill nuance and planning to use to their full effect, and can be countered if the person using them botches the attack. Especially chameleon where if you get caught out you die extremely fast without armor.
---
What we really don't need is for people with frog legs grenade launchers being able to see everybody else everywhere all the time to be able to wipe out the last people without any form of difficulty.
---
Did he have the word furious in his name?
---
My camp is set up as a brothel...
---
Ok
---
I got it, thanks to meat week, and I still can't figure out how to run power through the wall. All the conduits say they're intersecting with another object when I try to put them through a wall. 😭
---
That's about when I started getting three at a time almost exclusively.
---
And leaving the damn decontamination shower turned on after they switched it on. -_-
---
now I want Skyrim spiders in 76
---
I can see how you'd confuse the lack of terrain design with Nevada

That's the one that will go through the wall :)

yes, giant snakes would be a great enemy.  with a new enemy type confirmed and this being an ongoing game hopefully they eventually add snakes
---
It can be a bit finicky
---
The naming is screwed up. They mixed up a lot of mods.
---
Excuse my ignorance, what’s a perk loadout?
---
&gt;tonight on Dateline...
---
Your idea kinda makes me think about the best duels I had when I still played Dark Souls 3. Every so often I’d be in a “fight club” and one of the opponents would drink all their estus in the first few seconds of the fight, and the honorable thing to do would be to chug all of your estus as well, that way neither opponent could heal and it truly was a fight to the finish. Those were some of the most intense PVP fights I’ve ever had.
---
I just show up for scrip and chance at a legendary.
---
Cleared them all real quick. Except the lvls one. I always forget to chnage outfits or whatever.
---
Yes i will play it.
---
Dupers break the entire game where NW cheaters just ruin an unpopular minigame.
---
Acid deposit here
---
Got it. You da man.
---
A saved set of perks that you can swap between with the push of a button. For example, I have a couple for combat, a couple for crafting, one for hacking and lock picking, etc.

That would be great.

Can't get it to work on PC.  What are you on?
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I assume you made this post because of meat weeks events?
---
Go to the White Springs vendors, some sell bulk screws. The toyshop has some giddy up buttercup for sale that you can break down,  as well. Also, check the responders vendors, some of them sell bulk screws.
---
Depends on the type of cheating. The people who are flying and teleporting are really easy to capture video evidence against. Simple aim-bots are harder cases.
---
The 3 star legendary death skull rad scorpion I keep running into in the savage divide uses its stinger.As soon as that thing hits you the health bar melts away in 2 or 3 seconds.In fact most of the (anti armor) Poison,venom,toxin and sonic effects in this game are the deadliest things around.
---
I really like ur C.A.M.P. its not flashy or extravagant but its well made and well decorated. Great job
---
I must be stupid because I still can't figure it out. Is there a video to follow along or anything like that?
---
What is the reward
---
I know this 150 days old buuuuut, were you able to get a full set of weapons weight armor to test?
---
Well thats lame but theres always next time i guess.
---
If I wanted to give my money the best possible use, I would not but videogames, dude. Are you being serious? This is a hobby.
---
It happened to me today, and to people next to me too. Bag and empty junk after that.
---
Good, ban both. 
---
Dupers can find a way to dupe their account if they wanna come back :D
---
I asked the same some weeks ago. Unarmed and melee weapons and their descriptions are broken. Just read the number.
---
Maybe 4k-5k max I would pay. The bloodied Gatling isn’t the best bloodied heavy. .50 cal bloodied I just payed someone 10k for
---
Was it during the actual event? I did it a few times last week and didn't drop a bag. After the event is over, however, you're on your own.
---
I keep it because... Well... I do not know why I keep it. It really Is heavy and not as good as other 2h melee weapons.
---
No. You calling this game "truly garbage" is trash talk. 
---
I mean do you really have that poor of faculties that you don't remember what you put in your title?
---
Pc earlier today had 6+ people showing up to each event location
---
He lost the rare expensive jumpsuit, not the underarmor
---
FYI there is a workbench on the side of Graham's lean-to.
---
I wish they would give us a stashbox.
---
Definitely a kindness when people build right there.
---
Lets add water moccasins (swimming copperheads) and some Brown Recluse the size of a soccer ball while we are wishing for extremely venomous radiation monsters.
---
You are not stupid, you have to figure out how to use the concrete slope, it is special.  Maybe I do a post later?  I don't know how to take in game videos, may just draw some pics.
---
Ps4. Each event I've done has had about 3 to 4 people and some afk running in a circle.
---
No idea what platform your on but every one I have been to currently has been full and completed. 
---
Maybe your world had people that are farming the meat for more scrip or even just exp over the meat week exp alone.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Not in my games. There’s a lot of people. About 8-9
---
Not talking about the prime event. I can solo those. I'm talking about the cook off. That's where people matter. I could care less if they show up to the prime cuts cause I dont need their help there.
---
Definitely! I made sure all foundations were firmly planted on the mountain top. Not much room to work with but it works!
---
Well that's your games dear. I'm talking about mine.
---
[removed]
---
Nope you, me, and many others.
---
Are you on PS4
---
The cook off had on average 8 people there every time I did it
---
Yea
---
Oh it really does work. Once again, very well made base
---
The crops you can't grow are intended as an incentive for you to explore / travel beyond your CAMP.
---
I also don't expect them to make it any easier to spam Cranberry Relish for the XP boost.
---
"Livestock" would negate any incentive for taming pets, or for harvesting meat.
---
Not trying to belittle your ideas, but if you think it through, you'll see that the intention is to have you interact with the world.
---
*worlds. I keep jumping when an event fails cause that tells me the players on it aren't interested in showing. I've gotten one complete event and that was when I first started today. Otherwise every single other event has failed. And I can only do so much within the limitations of the event.
---
Well that's not my experience sadly.
---
I've jumped worlds at least 6 or 7 times in the last three hours.
---
Honestly, from a design standpoint, I don't think it's possible to add to the game with this engine. The problem with snakes (especially giant ones) is they take up a lot of land while moving, and unlike with radscorpions or something they can't just "walk over" any obstacles, since that wouldn't be realistic and would just look silly, and would lead to a path finding and rigging nightmare. I guess they could always have it in a confined, flat space like Yawn (who was mostly stationary, though), but that wouldn't really be much of a challenge, especially when playing in groups
---
Well if we are both ps4 then people are doing them. You are getting into bad games. Stop complaining dear lord.
---
I modded them into draugr.  Less creepy ;)
---
Thanks for the reply. I have full aid weight reduction sets on both my characters currently, but as already stated, doesn’t stack passed 90%. Was more curious about the weapons weight stacking.
---
Exactly. There is a difference between griefing and PvP, but they don't seem to want to accept that.
---
People who don't play NW in this thread. We don't need suggestions from low skill and low experience players.
---
Too busy crafting ammo, i thing im developing an addiction
---
Nice base. Mine is on the other peak lol
---
Yea Robco needs to go back to the drawing board
---
I moved near the Savage divide location shortly after the last meat week. I didn't expect another so it wasn't a strategic move, I just liked the spot. But holy hell has there been a ton of traffic through my camp today. It's like living on a highway all of a sudden. And for the record, my missile turrets are out of range of the event.
---
Am I joining your world or mine
---
Of course you wouldn’t. You’re so fixated on complaining
---
I joined you
---
Sludge Lung has been bugged for me since launch for this challenge, hope you fare better.
---
See that's what I feel like would make it so much better. Having someone to play with / be my role-play partner.
---
Then those people are stupid as fuck.
---
There are clear instructions when you travel over explaining what needs to be done.
---
Yo can you stop going around telling people I'm part of the beef curtons group? Because I'm not.
---
How
---
I wonder if that is why people buy my ore...
---
Also, breech &amp; clear is good for finding lots of different types all in one place.
---
Try your local brothel, I'm sure there's a few nice ladies ( or gentlemen,  I don't judge ) who can help you out.
---
My friends and I pooled the caps for the recepie we all wanted so it all worked out
---
Aye nice I see people over there all the time!
---
Quote : " We are also planning a second phase of Public Event improvements that  will bring additional cooldown adjustments, performance-based loot, and  remove the need to tag legendary event enemies to claim their loot. "
---
idk if Bethesda gonna read this. But while it's still in a development progress... Can you please add a marker or something for the corpse, not just for legendary corpses (make the corpse glowing or something). Because in a huge event like Project Paradise if you're protecting wing A and the boss spawn in another wing and you didn't get the tag, you wouldn't even know where is the legendary corpse.
---
No I'm not, jesus woman what is your fucking problem? I've spent over 2k hours into game since beta. I've been through all the shit this game has to throw at someone. I'm more than allowed to point out that the event shouldn't be rely on other players if you can do it yourself.
---
Yes
---
o plz most if not all games i played at a stable fps on the xbone the only ones that droped a bit were jet set radio
---
lol I love that.
---
War never changes.
---
I have a full set
---
Too bad it doesn't work. Oh well, at least I'm salaried so it didn't cost anything.
---
On PC there is a mod for that. I tried it but didn't really see it useful.
---
Right now and in the near future - a couple of thousands tops. But once Meat Week ends and some time passes it will become more or less uncommon and eventually someone will buy it even for 10k.
---
Source: Sold 2 normal ones for 10k and 3 peppered ones for 15k in a span of a month.
---
Wow, that’s... odd.
---
Awww that sucks. I was far more intrested in that, than wastelanders NPCs and that other stuff. I have done less than half of the quests in the game because they aren's so intresting to me, and the new NPCs are mostly going to be that, quests.
---
I could see it with the harmonica or jaw-harp, but the audio would probably be only heard by you, like the locomotive whistle at Harper's Ferry. 
---
You won't be having any impromptu forest jams with other players.
---
Well there a lot of things strange I thought he or she was gonna kill second it was a level 10 third the character was hideous
---
&gt;New characters can choose from unlocked legendary perks at character creation.
---
Which by all account means they are shared on all your chars.
---
How to you get scrip form prime meat?
---
That must be nice.
---
same
---
PC seems to have more issues overall in both categories...
---
They acknowledged missing the original window for Legendary Players/Perks a while ago. They mentioned it might come right before Wastelanders at some point, but even then they weren't sure. Apparently they just aren't satisfied with the ideas they have tried behind the scenes.
---
Like the way many people share food, meds, resources, plans, and generally cooperate for the "greater good", instead of murder each other over loot like Bethesda hoped they would 🤔
---
Yup
---
Watch, this will be Bethesda's next mobile game app. ;)
---
For real that’s why I was happy it came back lol it doesn’t give scrip? Haven’t been on all day
---
I can't get it to work either.  I'm on PC.  Someone on PS4 says they can.  I dunno.
---
So uh, chloe actually has a reason for being kind of an asshole. A certain disgruntled worker at robco got offered a better job at another company and decided to reprogram one of the miss nanny units after her asshole cat as a parting gift.
---
Put it on the bbq.
---
Ppl said it’s bugged and doesn’t work, I tried and got nothing
---
I've yet to get scrip for that
---
We don't judge
---
I mean it's not like the stuff from the BBQ is that great. The exp from the primal meats is totally better than anything you get as a reward from the bbq. imo of course.
---
Clean up leftovers!
---
This is the 3rd delay.
---
For clarification...is that info you found in game on terminals or were You riffing?  Either way 👍🏻
---
There’s some in the wendigo cave.  After you enter main chamber with the mirelurks and to the left, and then around the area where you sometimes find a PA frame.
---
I live in Morgantown. I’m upset about the lack of pepperoni rolls.
---
Fallout Australia game just mutated spiders, snakes, dropbears, kangaroos and cassowary aka the entire map is the deathclaw area from new Vegas but they are also half cassador
---
I've taken to hitting the 3 veins at the Tyler county fair adjacent work shop.  Of course after having same extraction experience as you.
---
You are not wrong. 
---
Go Mountaineers.
---
I haven't tried this time, so I can't say for this. But last time sometimes I'd have to look at the bbq at certain angles or the prompt wouldn't pop up. You had to kind of really get in there.
---
Same.
---
I run around like a crazy person!  I cook challey feed in advance, collect wood in advance and add both to the respective places as I’m scooping challey poo, putting out fires, collecting greens and critter bits. Once I’m out of all of the above I turn a spit or play drums until the event completes. (Any prime meat cook in 5 meat increments for scrip. I do this first)
---
I remember my first trip into the swamp. Good times
---
Didnt even know they were a thing. Got attacked from behind and it messed my vision up. Never saw it kill me
---
Didnt go into the swamp for a long time. Despite how much I wanted a frog
---
Adding to the list of to-do's at the Cook-Off:  Clean up leftovers! Gray piles of bones, usually a group of 3 leftovers together.
---
Yeah, the weirdest one by far was a scorchbeast that had my low 20's alt trapped in a tent (I'd killed off everything else and was waiting out the sneak meter). Suddenly heard a weird noise as my sneak meter cleared to Hidden. Snuck out of the tent... it had died nearby. Nobody anywhere near me on the map, and even if someone in sneak mode (thus hidden on the map) had somehow managed to one-shot it, it was a weird time to finally decide to down the thing when there had been a lot more noise and commotion from me killing off all the scorched minions previous to the waiting-it-out for the big guy. I'm thinking that sometimes when an enemy loses track of you enough, the server kills it off for some reason... like the code says "mob can't see player... mob can't find player... player must be gone... mob no longer needed..." but the body doesn't completely poof because you *are* still there.
---
yes you can find the souvenir teddy bear at the "lost home" location in the doghouse
---
This is my tactic. I now have 8 characters. When I want to switch roles I prefer to make a new character. What happens if you want to go back?  Well now you have to level 30 levels again.
---
Nice! I guess I’ll hang on to it for now
---
I noticed this! Very pleased. Thanks Bethesda! :D
---
Ha!
---
God damn it YES!
---
Right there with you.
---
Couple things here that folks aren't telling you.
---
1) Prime Cuts is NOT needed for the Cook out event. It can give you a small ammount of scrip and move the progress bar a small ammount, but is otherwise worthless.
---
2) People using the spits and drums prevent the bar from back sliding while other folks do the gather / cleaning.
---
3) If you wait until you have a large ammount of collection items to turn in at once (critter bits / greens) then the progress bar will move MUCH more than if you had turned in the same ammount in smaller increments. Collect 30 or 40 bits and you'll see the bar move one or even two progress sections.
---
TLDR: Man the spits and drums until no spots free, the collect critter bits in large numbers.
---
Interestingly enough, no.  I made this as I was unable to access another event.  However this could be applied to any event, really.
---
Warning: The bright light is BRIGHT.  It will wash everything out close up, but is fantastic at a distance.
---
Apparently the scrip isn’t dropping for anyone right now... did Bethesda Put this out?
---
Nope and I’ve done the cook out 3 times now.
---
Howdy, neighbor.
---
I think I remember reading about
---
The rock over hang is awesome! So much potential if it wasn't for the party-poopers: scorchbeast and the scorched. The cycling different colored lights would look amazing there.   It's a shame. But I love my location = forever home.
---
I was hoping that a pre programmed robot with a DJ like personality would run Appalachia radio. Either unaware that everyone is dead, or simply doesn't care. Sadly, I was left disappointed

---
Also I was wrong about her leaving RobCo, it was that she left General Atomics for RobCo.
---
I dunno. None of those items are good even at level 20. Adding more stuff to the legendary loot pool just for the sake of flavor will only decrease the chance of getting something worthwhile.
---
Pistols and one handed melee are the two most underperforming weapon styles.
---
Maybe if they had a unique bound effect, like the Fixer does. The Voice of Set is functionally and aesthetically identical to a troubleshooter’s .44.
---
reactiv plates?
---
Yeah. I'm not who you were addressing but I came across the same information. I think it's at robco. 
---
Additionally I think in Berkley Springs you can find customer complaints about her.
---
One of them, yes
---
It's not only one player. It seems like there are new guys now every day
---
Thanks!  Just went and confirmed it I’ll add that to my weird stuff post
---
Yeah, it’s easier to focus that way too.  I know what my next two character builds will be in advance.  I’ve already started to collect high end gear for level 50+.  I could have my Rifleman go back and forth as a Commando, but it’s even better to have laser focused character builds. Plus, I think it’s a ton of fun to go from 1 to 100 in a few days during double XP.  I *really* hope a reward for the next “kill 1,000,000 X mob” event will be for double XP.
---
lets discover some mayans BAY BE

Was this supposed to be changed?
---
HOL UP! WAIT A MINUTE!
---
Buying the game. sinking hundreds of hours into it and pouring cash into the atom shop isnt enough we have to clean up the wasteland for them to continue making the game interesting.
---
Aye what’s your GT?
---
Tesla n stealth bois
---
No clue where these even drop, but I see 99 out of 100 players have one in their vendors.
---
I remember in July sometimes there was a bug where the scrip add wouldn't appear on the HUD but it was there if you checked your pipboy. I haven't been able to play today though to see what's up
---
PVP comes down to shot placement.  Bloodied isn’t the only way to go. Need to see your specs first. I run a junkie heavy/explosive build.

My main PvP is two shot gamma gun, junkies exploding .50 HMG and two shot auto nade launcher.

Cotton mouth. Water moccisin. All in all probably a nightmare to animate.
---
Yeah I can understand a lot of limits but a naming limit I can't fathom
---
Why are the downvotes so numerous ITT. I’m level 60, so I’ve played my fair share and if I get a stealth boy, I win easy 9/10 fights. On a conceptual level, being near invisible in a gun fight is OP, that’s a given. I use them every chance I get because I know they’re OP. I think the only recourse would be to remove them. There really isn’t a reason to have them in other than to be unfair.
---
That's exactly what I was wondering too..
---
It's crafted at the tinkers bench now
---
Don't have a vid, but it's different from the Tricentennial, Free State, and Communist Salutes.  Your character raises two fingers to their forehead and then puts their arm back down.  It's a more casual salute.
---
Try a full strangler heart PA with a BE plasma gatling. It's actually the new meta right now
---
exactly why the system needs clarification and fixing.
---
There are graboids in the Nuka World dlc if fallout 4 haha they're just called blood worms.
---
Thanks.
---
Way I see it, can't control it anyway, so I might as well focus on what I can.
---
I mean this community has no fucking clue what game balance is; the majority of people think that adding damage caps to PvP on survival servers (so that PvP stopped being instagib) was a mistake. 
---
Like, what in the fuck? I get that a better fix would be to just remove Legendaries and the RNG perks, but capping damage was a pretty solid fix in the meantime. You no longer required legendary god rolls to compete. 
---
You’re absolutely right. Being able to run around invisible with a weapon and fire is moronic. It’s fine for a single player game where you are the only player (and the rest of the game revolves around you), but in a multiplayer game it’s asinine. It’d be different if firing broke your stealth, but again it doesn’t, which just highlights how broken it is.
---
np
---
It's weird to me that raiders have a salute at all. They aren't a military.
---
Oh wow, thanks man
---
Nuka-crypt.com has the weekly launch codes
---
...in cost of 5mm ammo. Gatling is one of the cheapest weapons to shoot in the game.
---
Hmm- social comradery is nice, but i distinctly remember this was supposed to be about earning scrip along with the other rarities.
---
Wow!  I really like the way you have the store set up surrounded by the astroturf, makes it look very natural.
---
Seems it would’ve been a great opportunity for a middle finger...
---
Well I used the card I had where can I get another
---
No thank you, we already have sea eagles
---
Sure, but I need all my 5mm for my BE Minigun.   I will say my BE90 Lever is vastly more efficient than the Gatling, I almost never need to ever shoot twice at the same normal mob. I think the BE90 Lever hits roughly 3x harder than the Gatling. Not to mention, the Lever is WAY more accurate. 
---
So while the Gatling is cheap to shoot, it’s nowhere near as efficient to shoot as a good bloodied sniper build with a BE lever.
---
You enjoy hiding in some corners on the map in survival mode\*  Greets from xXDemolisher
---
Hmmm just the timing made me assume it was meat week, particular cause it’s so popular
---
I clicked on this too fast 😂
---
You cant sell them you have to earn them its a way to not abuse the backpack system.  Same deal cant make one and give it to someone either.
---
Check your scrip count from  Stats -&gt; Collections before tossing the meat in the grill and again right away after. I'm pretty sure it gave it right away the last time.
---
im waiting on the new dlc's (prestige mode) before going back in the game.
---
Which case fits instruments? I couldn't find a way to display my cool banjo
---
It’s basically always over lvl 76 and wear sunglasses, so I only have to pay a little attention lol
---
Ooo- Now that's the answer that was right under my nose. I'll check it. Thanks!
---
They degraded the food on purpose to create the need for fridge options because it made sense.  It should NOT be locked behind a pay wall and optional crafted item after a quest is completed in game.  I will NEVER purchase things in Atomic Shop nor spend real money for in game purchases that should be part of this game.  Sorry - I feel its a rip off and I'm already upset about my money being wasted on this game to see it turn into a complete money grab.
---
Oh noes!
---
You do. Look in your pipboy. I've gotten it all 3 times. There is no prompt on screen but its adding up.
---
Breach and Clear event in the Ash Heap gives every ore type, and a lot of iron and lead. Make sure you have the Hornwright Keycard and Marsupial to get most out of it. The event pops up fairly often at different locations.

1. Crickets Cave near Tanagra Town. There are some crickets. They contain 5-8 acid each.

2. Vault 94, 2 and 3 weeks. Crickets again. You can do a novice run without time limit and farm acid as long as you wish. 500+ acid in one run is easy.
---
3. You can claim one acid node with your camp and capture the Hemlock Holes Maintenance workshop that have 3 acid extractors.
---
I didn't even bother contacting them. No response to my last two tickets.
---
Thank you, I love the astroturf!
---
No surprise. Oh, they did link me to an article they wanted me to keep up with since it will update on their progress on the bug. It was last updated in March.
---
Ya thanks again, i just did it. Each primal cut is worth 1 scrip. Dat's betterer!
---
The RNG was in our favor today.
---
Encrypted event. More people looking for fixer plans so you'll prob continue to see them in vendors.
---
I was so happy to see that. Trying to get all the atoms before Halloween lol
---
The quests reward 3 - 8 scrip depending on difficulty.
---
and scraped together ADA clone would be cool.
---
Sludge Lung comes from bad air, so go to the Ash Heap and find a spot with bad air and just wait until you get it.
---
Load bearing has all of the ores in one mine.
---
Unhelpful
---
This.  Absolutely this is frustrating.  I was just happy there was a camp next to the event tonight I could fast travel to, because it was impossible to click on the event.
---
I don't care what it's on just as long as someone's testing it since Bethesda clearly isn't
---
I thought I had seen one before, but it was when they first came out
---
Done it 3 times since i got home and always was a full tier rewards with a bunch of people. Change servers if the people are doing thier own thing.
---
I’ve done Encrypted maybe 5 times, and I never got the hat.  🤷‍♂️
---
Also PC, but yeah. No dice.
---
They are tradable when I last checked (yesterday). 🤷‍♂️
---
Snakes are one of those enemies that aren't in the game due to technical limitations, or at least the difficulty of physically implementing them far outweighing the benefit of having them. Because of their unique method of movement, animating a snake means animating every single bone in the skeleton for every single possible way it could be in contact with the ground. In a mountainous region like Appalachia, that's just way too much to bother with when there's other, more pressing issues at hand. Just look at the Titanoboa from ARK and how terrible it looks in motion. RDR2's snakes don't look that bad because there's a lot of brush to conceal the wonkiness, plus they're smaller than Fallout's Vipers. But in general, snakes are very hard to get right in a non-flat worldspace, and the effort to make them even passable just isn't worth it.
---
I may grab that one.  Sounds a whole lot better than the big, dorky wave hello.
---
im all for it, but a snake would be a pain in the ass to animate
---
Probably a player in limbo like in the picture there then.
---
That's amazing, I haven't done it in awhile so I was lowballing. I'm sure you can get even more by buffing intelligence as well.
---
https://youtu.be/Pbyhpsv-6sM?t=22
---
Don't mess with the Tunnel Snakes.
---
I bought one within the last 2 or 3 weeks.  A bargain at 50 caps, and I was able to abandon the tedious possum quest.
---
Yes, at least transferable, used an alt to get refrigerated and traded it to my main.
---
How so?
---
Well yea. That’s pretty much it. 
---
Uploading a Patch on consoles costs money.
---
So it’s only logical that it only exists on PC were they can upload stuff just like that.
---
Dense and fireproof don't work on legacy weapons lol
---
That's not a bug. It's the component view, where it shows what components you would get from breaking down your junk. The same thing that you see when you are about to scrap from a workbench, except you don't need the bench. The feature was there in FO4 as well.
---
And you'd know this if you took, like, three seconds to read what each button does, at the bottom of the screen, instead of posting on Reddit.
---
These kind of challenges make me enjoy the game even more. I can finish my daily challenges early and then enjoy the meat week or lvling alts.
---
There is literally a high beam mode for the power armor. Hold the button that you use to turn the lamp on
---
I don't remember the exact numbers so yeah I could be wrong. I just remember there's easy, average, and hard ones with different rewards.
---
Totally agreed. I experienced the same issue lots of times. Upvoted for visibility!
---
Yeah, 5 is the max, I checked with some other people.
---
Look at them push their junk together awe yeeeeeeeaaaaa boiiii
---
Not really. You’d be better off scrapping them or selling them to a bot
---
That's what I kind of thought but also thought the roleplay community might want them. I've seen people try to sell them for outrageous amounts of caps and started collecting some in the hope people might want them.
---
yea well with all the other stuff getting put to the side till wastelanders is done we won't see any QOL changes with pets for a while if at all
---
Yea it's a bloodied build.
---
At under 20% HP they both show 98dmg before and after Equip, I'm just high HP in this video because i hate running... :P
---
The green hood might get you some good caps to the right buyer
---
no way!  I mean they were def creepy, but they are such a cool enemy!
---
I am sure that canonically it will. Gameplay wise I doubt it unless Wastelanders is introducing raiders NPCs as well that attack on sight?
---
My understanding is that Prime Cuts' rot-timer resets when it goes to 0. Can anyone confirm this?
---
If they really ever do this, I'm gonna see just how close I can get to Burt Gummer in the character creator.
---
But that’s why you provide correct information. There’s still no need to degrade the person.
---
Cheating would run more rampant than it already is
---
I don’t play on ps4 so idk how you switch to component view on there (assuming it’s r1) but on pc when you try to view your components there is a known bug that may tell you that you have like 4592736 of a certain junk type, there’s no reason to think that component view in and of itself is a bug so I was giving op the benefit of the doubt assuming they were talking about that known bug
---
As I sit here posting from my plain 6x6 camp in a wide open field, I must say I am extremely impressed with your creativity and location
---
Tell a man a fact and he will post misinformation tomorrow. Teach a man to read...actually, don't. Let him learn how to read himself. Reading isn't hard.
---
Exactly. Depending on your relogs, the meat can spoil if not lined up with the timing of cookout.
---
Sorry guys, I just slithered in here to lurk.
---
That doesn't happen in component view. It happens in your junk tab itself.
---
This idea is even better! It's beyond my comprehension why people sell generic weapons and armor (not even crafted or fully decked out) while being lvl 100+...
---
Everything involved in FO76 turns into a catastrophe. The game is cursed.
---
The prime cuts turn to spoiled meat. Can confirm
---
It may have just been patched because they patched another exploit to do with Atom Shop paintjobs as well.
---
I’m looking at it happening in my component view right now but go off
---
Talk about a party crasher.
---
I can confirm this, it does get extra bright when in caves/mines but only in the area where you turn it on. Once you move from the area it is normal.
---
Oh okay, thanks. For some reason I didn't see the variants the other day when I was at my camp, but I can now.
---
So yes, they added in a variant without the concrete that is still tagged as being able to be built at other peoples camps, but the one with foundations (original) you can only build at yours.
---
theyre all pretty easy.. i dont mind it
---
This only works in interior spaces and the extra light is only in the area where you turn the light on, it doesn't move with you, turning off the light then back on moves the bright area.
---
Guess that'll depend on the other factions when they come into play also. Exciting times. Here's hoping they can pull it off
---
six six six nuuuumber offf the beast
---
log off before it spoils then log in right when a cookout starts and use it
---
What I'm really curios about is wastelanders-nuke interactions tho. If I had to guess I'd say settlements will have protections of some sort, and raider/cannibal encampments will turn fellers into ghouls? It'll be interesting to see ho Austin deals with existing mechanics, it is truly a make or break moment for the studio.
---
When is that? Are they going on now?
---
before I personly would buy this, a lot off stuff needs to happen first, 
---
first and most important point i need to play more that 30 minutes without glitching/crashing.
---
Ya i almost had that issue even tho i got good with salt perk its rough we get 10+ prime meat events before 1 meat week event
---
Then I hope you got your running shoes on. At one time I ran so much they melted off my feet. But no more running. My hunters 50.cal machine gun is too heavy to run with so now I stand my ground and to do the killshot my TSE black power rifle has quite the kick. Plus if they ever land my Zealot’s fire axe starts the swinging.
---
It is brought up every single time, and then someone says ,"i wish this was brought up..." 
---
Congratulations. Tonight you are that guy.
---
[PC] Absolutely, during the last meat week this was particularly noticeable. I took to going via the vault &amp; walking, NOT to save Caps. But because it would be impossible to click the event icon if loads of people were there.
---
lol duh
---
Exactly what i think sense f76 supposed to be pretty much fo4 multiplayer
---
I couldn't even put my primal meat in the bbq :(
---
Why is there a small pink pa?
---
That’s pretty much what they used, I couldn’t even fight back.... think of remaking my guy into a commando and using an auto magic Tesla, speaking of. How do you even combat sheath users? It’s so lame
---
I do have a bloodied build, and I use a .50 too, but even when I go to hit someone I’m always hiring em first but they turn look at me shoot and I’m dead lol
---
I have a crew on xbox one. There is about 4 of us who are on every day. With a few others on here and there that we will run with when they are on
---
Yeah, this was a common complaint last time, too. Wish they'd listen sometimes.
---
They should add a non-atom shop update that allows skinning weapons with snake skins, (and probably hides too while they are over there).  
---
   
---
This would bundle these enemies to the game beautifully, and finally some trophy weapon skins that could show you killed rare or difficult enemies.
---
" Features like PC text chat" , good.
---
Yeah I’m familiar with the builds. Currently working on a junkie vanguard build to test the difference
---
They will probably have their population reduced to make room for the new hostile human NPCs, but they will stay in the game. I’m honestly just happy that Bethesda is at least attempting to explain why the people from Wastelanders don’t just get infected like everyone else did before Reclamation Day.
---
PS4 today, tons of people showed up for the 4 or so cookouts that I participated in.  Also had a lot of people joining the Primal Meat events.  
---
Hint:  For the Mire Primal event near Watoga to succeed, you need to chase down the attacking animals.  There isn't enough time on the clock for you to wait at the stating point for them to arrive.
---
Maybe I was lucky in being on the right server, but I'm not seeing a large drop in players on the PS4. 
---
One strategy that I usually have is to jump servers if I only see low levels on a map.  Especially if I want to dive right into events.  I didn't do this today because I was mostly on to farm acid and make ammo.  However, it filled up nicely with a good mix of higher levels and low levels after a couple of hours.
---
Or faction takeovers, for that matter.
---
Oh, I referred to something "else" than the typical level of in-game knowledge (I'm on the spectrum, I'm Fallout fan last 20 years, and I am a software tester that wins ST competitions).
---
Like: did you know 10% while aiming works 100% of the time: hipfire, aimed shots, VATS. Unlike explosive, it does not change the projectile type, which prevents additional explosive-reduction effects from dealing maximum damage. This means that Bloodied +10% while aiming minigun will hurt the SBQ more than BE one.
---
But your drugged vanguard is potentially a really damn tanky build so if you're in pursuit of something else thats really strong I won't be trying to change your mind, the path you wanna follow is a solid one.
---
zoom in
---
This is a solid idea
---
A quick question fam, havn't been home for a while and I'm trying to understand what "Meat week" is because I also missed it in August, but what exactly do you get by for example giving in 20 prime meat to Virgil or what his name was. And last of all, is it worth it. Sorry for asking but I'm not very comfortable with google. Thanks
---
Why the hell did someone downvote you?
---
good ideas, but to be fair they have those already, the insult bot and prize bot come to mind, the merchant Graham, but I do hope caravans make a return
---
Pacs of 30-60 rad boars...
---
Imagine a settler asking for protection: you could just take them in, expect payment or refuse completely, and afterwards you could try to scare raiders going after them, negotiate for them to leave, betray the settler and hand them over to raiders, or kick the raider butt.
---
Its still super simple encounter, but it provides a nice selection of choices of how we wanna play, and these tiny little choices would be perfect to make the world feel more alive.
---
I have the punch bowl. The keg is in the menu
---
Usually a week before they update the shop. So at least that long.
---
Burt would just don the power armour with his biggest gun, get swallowed and go to town inside
---
Long after the foundation stacking was gone,  I built ab extensive bunker that sas completely protected from all sides, and required marsurpial or jetpack to enter.
---
A scorched spawned inside, destroyed the reactor, and made me scrap it.
---
If your camp is placed near a spawn, this may not be enough :(
---
is meat week also double xp ?
---
And it's been 3 days now at least but thanks for the reply m8

NPCs. Having explored the whole of Appalachia, I find a lot of locations really lacking anything worthwhile. Then again, the same can be said about the endgame in general. I'm thinking on starting up FO4 again too, well at least until Wastelanders comes out.
---
Most of the mounted heads are rewards from Stings and whatever. The repeatable bug quest.
---
I remember seeing the plans as a challenge reward shortly after the Nukashine DLC was released. I completed the challenge (Was something to do with Nukashine. Either it was Make 10 or Consume 10.) But the plan never dropped. Thought maybe it was a glitched challenge reward. Then saw a camp with it. So, unless the player was a Dev testing on Xbone, at some point it was available. 
---
It's frustrating to see it in my build menu for months, wanting to place it in my camp, but not being able to. 
---
Same with the mounted possum. My GT is mcpossum. Almost every social media I use is mcpossum. Even spent atom on the silly possum hat...
---
It's super cool of you that you do make adjustments like that to give everyone a chance to tag the legendaries.  Not everyone does that.
---
Epic Games would take a suggestion from the Fortnite subreddit and implement it into the game within a few weeks tops quite frequently. I think it has a lot to do with having the right number of people working for you.
---
I’m definitely always looking. Currently I’ve got 3 vanguard pieces. I’ve played bloody on my other toon and I’m really liking the health on my second toon.
---
I think it's to give the spawning enemies a target otherwise they'll probably just roam around on the outskirts of the event
---
Yeah, so much hiding, which is why my camp is lit up in vendor mode... never see your camp though..
---
Yeah, I started doing two things early on.  I sniped a lot and, when moving closer, switched to a super sledge.  You don't go through a lot of ammo this way, which is a good thing. 
---
Personally, I set off to explore the map and find all of the locations without using the lookout towers.  It made it more interesting because I never knew what was around the corner.  
---
I also made the Top-of-the-World area my prime roaming spot.  There are lots of enemies, weapons and armor plans spawn there, and you can sell all of the dropped weapons at the train station for your daily cap limit.  Plus, it's open enough that you can snipe without being in any real danger.  Just be careful because the enemy can spawn at higher levels if a high level player has passed through.
---
Wait... people on the internet blew something out of proportion, I’m shook.
---
I'd be interested in seeing how much the player count drops with new game releases.  I bet Borderlands 3 put a pretty big dent in the player count.  The only reason I started Fallout 76 again was because of Meat Week.  After that I'll probably be right back to BL3 besides hoping on to take advantage of the Legendary Vendor sale, and its not like that will take up a lot of time.
---
Yeah it sucks.
---
No one has. And losing my proof is even more frustrating. I already yelled at the podling. He didn't mean to erase the external. I wasn't home when it happened. His Dad was "babysitting" (aka sitting on the couch talking to his girlfriend that can't stand him doing anything with or for our son. Because it means he isn't at her house playing Daddy to her kids). From what I can piece together, Podling went to do what I do when I mass upload. But instead of hitting one drive, he must have hit the trash can. And since he isn't able to read very well yet, he probably had no idea what he did till it was done. And tried to hide it by making 20 Bendy vids. 
---
None of them the one I asked for: Alice Angel jump scare and her monologue. But, if you are ever interested in watching the in game dancing Bendy clock for 20 min. I have a clip
---
yeah, even with zooming in it is difficult
---
Finally! Someone else that saw it too
---
That’s what you get for paying 7$ for a fridge
---
My theory is that they intentionally avoided to put creatures like spiders and snakes since it looks like a lot of people have a primitive phobia of those (therefore making the game unplayable for them). 
---
I also remember that in FO4 there was a mod that changed radscorpions aspect for people who had arachnophobia.
---
Yes, you can claim the plan for badges and do whatever you want to do with it - sell in vendor, sell to other players etc.
---
Haha I tried to suggest Fallout 76+ and the community crucified me like I lost Caesars lottery.
---
That actually sounds very accurate
---
yes this is a bummer.
---
I'm happy they are upfront about delays. I'd rather have something that works, than something half-thought up bring dumped into Wastelanders before Christmas/New Year when they won't have enough time to fix everything properly.
---
Yes! Scorchsnakes!
---
I had one, got rid of it quick ...for me  its too heavy to keep as it's not a useful weapon ....
---
I also have full set and it's best PA in the game - with best stats overall and for the fact that whole set adds bonus acid damage to all attacks.
---
it definitely makes it easier
---
I'd be more worried about giant Roos and Wombats than giant Cassowaries, Emus or Crocs.
---
Giant Midges too. Oh fuck imagine a *cloud* of those bastards. (Midges generally swarm)
---
fyi juice head did one as well.
---
No legendary for it but the mods are nice and add some different effects. It is heavy tho. Saved one from last time to hang up.
---
Can always sell it. I think i got 3 last time and i played way too much that week. 3-5 is where i see them sell.
---
What you say may seem true for those who go to PvP unprepared and alone. I spent few hundred hours just researching the combat and the builds shooting my friends. I was considering majority Assassin/Sentinel players freefrags back when this combination was commomly considered the only viable combination.
---
The truth is that what this game presents in terms of PvP is only visible to those who play in a group of super optimised builds versus a group of super optimised builds. I agree that usually the random encounters are rather lackluster, but the prearranged ones, or the glorious moment a PvP gang stumbles over another PvP gang are majestic. Having multiple teams and 20 prepared people all try to kick everybody else out from one place is glorious.
---
But you can't expect something made randomly to be able to compete with something perfected over hundreds of iterations of experiments. There would be no balance in that. This is not a simple game, its extremely complex, and so the math underneath is extremely complex too, but its actually a great PvP environment - once you prepare yourself. Its main flaw is the concern of this post - no effective counters for Teslas.
---
Little happen to me at westek every now and then but 4 times in a row is odd
---
Then maybe they should prioritize other things. Feel free to get upset about people not liking how the shop gets more attention than anything, but it's fucking ridiculous that fixing even the Social Menu has taken so long.
---
Oh do you get mods easy? Like I don't wanna dismantle it if it's worth 3 or 5
---
You leave stealthboyers. Fuck them, bore them to death.
---
No. Mods are rarer then the tenderizer. And don't scrap it for plans. Bunch of us tried that last time. I still need two of the mods.
---
You cant learn the mods from dismantling, they are separate rewards from the event.
---
It works jist didn't have the hud display. That happened last time too.
---
Status&gt;collection and check before and after. Worked all 3 times i did it.
---
How do I check my collection? I tried after hearing others doing this and couldn’t figure out how
---
I just drop them at the event now lol
---
I get its annoying but it is part of the game and their are assholes who get their supplies by killing others. That's exactly what would happen in a world like fallout. You play with guns you might just get shot. It sucks but it's going to happen. I had it done to me a few times over my gameplay I even had some idiot follow me back to my camp then turn up with his mates just to distroy the wonderful home I spent weeks gathering resources to make took me ages to fix everything (I had no resources left by completion) . I was pissed but shit happens.
---
Status&gt;collection in your pipboy.
---
I maxed out for the day before started the events and went up 45 scrips past that.
---
Thanks. Now I'll have  nightmares haha
---
This is disappointing since the prime cuts are relatively heavy. I've found the fridge to be disappointing on many fronts. The refrigerated backpack though extends food life across multiple extended play sessions. Can't recommend it enough.
---
its more of a collection thing, lets be real if it doesnt have any stars its not really worth it.
---
Do you have a source? I've been paying attention and the ONLY thing I've seen is a lack of acknowledgement of it in the detailed roadmap to NW. That's it.
---
Would be interested to see if they actually said so.
---
Exactly.
---
I play it for the community factor, but the rewards are horrible. Last night’s efforts delivered a meat cleaver that I instantly scrapped, tato salad that I don’t need because my backpack is bursting with prime cuts meat and a bloodied chef’s hat that I’ll never wear. I wasn’t around for Fasnacht but the stuff you could get from that seemed infinitely more desirable - the creepy masks and ribbons and bonfires and whatnot. I really hope that the Halloween event (I think I heard that there will be one?) delivers more interesting rewards.
---
Okay so I’m sorry for asking this dumb question but, how do I check the status? I first assumed it was the pipboy itself but couldn’t find anything.
---
You mean vats accuracy? Reflex adds vats accuracy
---
It'd be cooler if it were armour-piercing instead of anti-armour-piercing.
---
First tab.. The one to check your mutations/diseases ect.
---
I'm very specced into bloodied stealth commando. Until I haven't been fighting stranglers, I was dominating using 2x assassin, 2x unyielding, 2x chameleon, 3x ap refresh, 5x harder to detect while sneaking.
---
Since Strangler Armor opponents surfaced, I modified my set to accomodate this new danger. I'm less sneaky, but still sneaky enough, but now I can get into tankier mode when shot via Strangler spam.
---
My current setup is 2x assassin, 2x unyielding, 1x chameleon, 3x ap refresh, 1x posion resistance, 3x harder to detect while sneaking, 2x sentinel.
---
Since I did the change, I managed to win 1v3 vs two bloodied sneakers and a strangler PA guy so I'm pretty confident it works fine.
---
Like a viper from Xcom
---
Ooooh. Bruh I’m stupid af idk how I forgot about that. Thanks lmao I know I was just being dumb
---
Moved to 4 different locations and same issue every time lol meat week
---
Did it the other day to put up like 4 signs before I ran out of light budget!
---
Very good, I agree!
---
You will need to remortgage your camp to afford anything from those robot vendors. My eyes were watering when I needed ballistic fiber fast and they were my only option.
---
Hey I run into a few people every time I play that make me wish I had that emote...
---
Np check what your at and how many meats you turn it. 15 max per cookout. And its totally separate from regular turning in legendary. So your just getting "free" scrips and can still turn in your 150 for the day.
---
Wow, what a slap in the (pork) chops! That is just ridiculous.
---
damn
---
Imma hop on and grind the event in a bit after I finish a movie I’m watching, thanks again man. I’ll use the info you gave me and make the best of what I got :D
---
Ash heap rewards you with a legendary sheepsquatch and a face full of cave crickets. It’s great. XP for days, especially if you’re doing it solo.
---
There is a lot of variables look at your perk cards and make sure your guns are at your level.
---
That collection tab is a good way to see if you earn a possum badge. They also don't always show when doing those events. Pretty useful.
---
thanks a lot pal
---
And increase load-in times for everybody? No thanks.
---
Why not use the other person's camp? I mean, basically everyone has all the workbenches and a stashbox.
---
Okay, that .44 is probably only Lvl5
---
The Fixer, defaults at lvl 30, so thats better. 
---
But, check the lvl of your gear, and don't forget to Perk in to the weapons you are looking to use the most.
---
Since we’re on that topic, the only reason as to why I did the opossum challenges were for the backpack, do you happen to know what the other mods are for the backpack? I love how the carry weight is plus 60 but can it go any higher? If ya don’t know it’s cool I’ll try to figure it out
---
Here I see the same problem I had trying something alike: You spend so much budget in the structure that the interior will have to be almost empty.
---
On the other side, if you go for a small structure, there won't be enough interior space for all the stuff you want to use, so you have to place it outside and spend budget on turrets... I want more budget :(
---
Todd please.
---
I love the xp gains just sitting in my camp. Those while in camp perks help too
---
Too much. I've never seen more than 2 bulk screws for sale before, so only 20 at a time. Last time I bought them with no perk was, I think, 192 caps
---
You get legendary scrip from delviering prime Meat in the grahms cookout event, but there is a limit and a cool down on it, i would absolutly say that it is worth grinding but not Just for the scrip but the uniqe rewards like bloody chef outfit and hat, plans like Meat cleaver and Meat flag and you May even get the tenderizer weapon. Hope it made some sense
---
The other day I was playing for maybe 2 hours and there must have been at least 10 SB just drop dead from the sky right in front of me.
---
Nobody shooting, just dropping and landing dead
---
Please don't reply to questions you know nothing about.
---
The backpack plans, buyable from the Possum vending machine, **are** tradable. An 8 possum badge plan sells for 12-15k in the fallout marketplace.
---
You max out your budget with this build? It's fantastic.
---
Yup 20 steel to go for the full Strangler Set.
---
There is a cooking pot in the hourly event where you can turn it in. Previous meat week you could hand in 15 prime cuts for 15 scrip each hour. Last night I didn't see the +5 scrip notification appear and didn't have time to see if it registered in back ground, but you should get 5 scrip for 5 prime cuts.  
---
So basically this is a good way to get more scrip than the 150 scrip from the machine.  
---
Do not spend your scrip, there is a purveyor discount event coming in a few weeks.
---
Think 60 is the top. But there is lead lined and insulated and an armor one i believe. I only have 4 so im hoping to finish up some of those in between doing the two dailys. Got 2 badges from the dailys so that's working again. Both pretty ez too.
---
As long as there are no legendaries, lack of VATS is not a problem, VATS is mostly useful as a counter to sentinel effect, no sentinel effect, no need for VATS.
---
Since no legendaries, next awesome thing could happen, i.e. the loot drop could become full, meaning that each time you find a gun that is like the guns you like, you're keeping it, and everything becomes valuable now.

A wonderful result of these changes would be a complete shift in meta - from minmaxed builds, to builds that can be operated as cheaply as possible. Noone would be using their precious ammo on rats, everybody would use melee as well as ranged depending on the enemy type, being prepared would mean having ten same prepared weapons in your stash so you could go back to fight quickly if downed.  
---
So to sum it up: Would I play it? Hell yes I would.
---
Thanks :)
---
but how do I get more weapons at my level?
---
I checked a few minutes ago and there’s a high capacity one that goes up to 120, imma try to get that one and hopefully it won’t take too long.
---
Learn the plans. As you rank up the game gives you guns at your game
---
BTW, any information if we can finally get plan for Tenderizer? Does list of possible rewards is the same as before?
---
Bugfix Bundle 1800 Atoms
---
lol
---
(Xbox1) i've done it 5 times and only once there were more than 3 people (around 7 and failed) doing the event. I check to see if anyone joins the event before I jump in.
---
There are a lot camps where not all workbenches are set up and traveling to my camp is free, while traveling to others costs caps.
---
no group perks, no mutations, no group chat ( proximity only) food for health and No stealth boys. That's  REAL hardcore.
---
Well I’m using them to make lever action rifles to unlock the mods and each rifle needs 10
---
The way camp building is now with the options they give us makes pretty much all camps non immersive imo. I have yet to see a camp that really looks like it belongs
---
It will.. People are trading god tier weapons and their little finger for Plans that are traded in for 8 Possum Badges
---
If you give me about 20 minutes I think I maybe able to spare about 100. I just sold loads so just need to check. If you want to add me o0hopem0o
---
People usually always tell me that my camp looks like it belongs in-game. There ARE good camps out there, but the majority of people are either too lazy to make them look good or just dont care. If Bethesda puts up a contest and lets people submit their camps from across all platforms and hand picks the good ones you'd be surprised at how many good camps they'll find.
---
As a PlayStation friend or is there a better way
---
I'm myv can have j
---
I’m not saying there aren’t some amazing camps out there but they’re all way too clean, fallout locations are known for being grimy and cluttered unless they’re some ultra sheltered protected areas like white springs shopping center or the bunker or some vaults
---
Don’t think you can do it any other way. You can delete me straight after.
---
If you do the quest he shuts up, it took me like three minutes
---
Can't recall the exact video. It was from one of the conventions a couple of months ago. Its where they actually detailed what was at the time the current way the system would work.
---
How much do you want for them
---
If it is brought in as you suggest then servers would need to be level appropriate, i mean last i checked i was level 70 something and can hold my own in adventure but slap me down with 7 200+ angry raiders wanting to know what my insides look like and it will get bad quickly.
---
I wasn't even aware they could be changed through interaction. This helps alot, but I will also be afraid of trolls from now
---
Come see me in grafton on ps4 psn howling1984 i have tried to stay immersive as i much prefer this.
---
Yeah, that's pretty much why I do it. Sure, I got the peppered mod today, but since I didn't keep my Tenderizer, it weighed a TON, peppered does me no good at all. It's only fun because of other players. 
---
I hope future events have more goodies.
---
Nothing they’re screws not a legacy weapon. You’re doing me a favour as my stash is almost at max. I’ve just got in so give me 15.
---
I’m on pc
---
I had this bug yesterday it even came inside my camp.
---
Ok thanks
---
Yea that's true . Like "this server is for only lvl 50-70" type of thing . But i still like that idea of teamplay 😂.
---
plan: 2020, deployment: 2021, bug fix: 2022, up and running: 2023, another bugfix:...
---
You sure she is dead? :) Maybe she is pretending dead, the only way to survive!
---
Nope he comes back.
---
Did you stroke out? Lol
---
Lawn on a rock?!
---
We got lots of PC users, we will get our fellow PC brethren to test it out ;)!
---
Three people on drums and three people on spits, and one-two persons doing everything else mentioned should do the trick. From what I've heard. The "passive" roles are what counts the most, music and cooking
---
the only time I have seen this, i just needed to wait a little longer until it loaded.
---
"Please assume the position"
---
This is what Beth says on 3-7 Oct " first ever Mystery Pick Event from October 3 – 7. During this event, you can choose the limited-time “Mystery Pick” option at the Purveyor for a chance at a greatly reduced Scrip price on a purely random Legendary item. " The discount of 25% is later in October.
---
I'm so proud of you being a part of this community. And so sad that you are not the person who create this game. 
---
Many times I had this feeling that something has to be done with this redicules CAMP combat encounters. 
---
I had this idea to change this random spawns into events. Let say one time per 90 minutes of gameplay your CAMP becomes a small event. "Defend Blah Blah Camp Event" . 
---
It is difrent kind of event. Event with much longer timer so you have enough time to walk to closer train station and sell your junk.  Event will be triggered not by fast traveling but by player itself. Other players can join you and help you with defending but only the CAMP owner can trigger the event. 
---
I thought this idea of mine was good but I find your idea about difrent random visitors/encounters/vendors/westland sole survivors much more   immersive and more interesting. 
---
I wished there was like 2000 difrent encounters/visitors in your CAMP instead of just combat. 
---
The lore of Fallout universe is so big and there is so many things to be told. Why Bethesda don't make game like this. They could use stories used in Fallout 1,2,Tactics,3,4. Just tell the stories  from difrent perspective and place them in the fallout time line so even most hard-core fallout fans are happy. 
---
I'm so sad right now. Oh look pink unicorn wallpaper in Atomic Shop for only 8 dallars. This fallout 76 is so Cool.
---
:(
---
but it still works. just a ui bug
---
Plus: I can't sell anything in my vending machines, if my camp isnt placed.
---
Beleive it or not yes it is! The catch... only in the audiophile circles currently. I honestly beleive this trend started  because neck-beards love Guardians of the Galaxy and decided they wanted to play music on their vintage 80's sony walkman they got on eBay and play it at home too in the best quality possible (i.e., hobby trend).
---
I do high end vinyl myself, but only listen when I'm in the mood.  But when I do, I Thoroughly enjoy every second of the sound.
---
Where is your camp? Sounds like a popular spot.
---
Happens to me often. Last night it sent me into the same server 3 times. But the 4th try I got settled.
---
Lol ran into the same shit on xbox yesterday there was over 20 at the meat week event i was at the drums doing my part after tossing in over 25 prime meat and all i see is 20+ high to mid range lvls running around trying to find shit to kill while everything else layed barron like wtf.
---
the 44 is not armour piercing. make sure everything else IS. big difference.
---
question ? the fixer is level 35 ???????, or is it not ?
---
FYI, it didn't work for me the first BBQ, but my second I was able to do it and got scrip.
---
Do you want to join me?
---
Joining now
---
usually the roaming merchants reset there inventory each time you server hop im not sure though if its different with graham beeing static now
---
It's the cliffside west of Whitespring.
---
I'm fine it might be a popular spot but when loading in and no camp is around at all - since i'm often curious checking the area for my parallel camping dwellers - it's just a wtf moment.
---
They can't all be winners.
---
Sounds completely terrible.
---
Yeah thats what i mean.
---
is there a specific way I should be looking for plans or are they just random drops from events?
---
The primal cuts enemies are super tanky. At level 33, don't do the event alone and just get your hits in. Nothing wrong with that. You should think about maxing out Tank Killer, but Bloody Mess is still locked for you, which is another great card. The fixer is good, but also think about getting the plans for the handmade. Less damage per shot maybe than your hunting rifle, but it's faster and just an overall better weapon.
---
no my fixer is level 20, is there a way to upgrade it?
---
I was trying to do the same thing today and I couldn't get a server I hadnt already been on after the first three jumps. I tried about 6 times in total.
---
I had a simpler idea, just show us how many stars they have in total, or even better, show us the number of 1* 2* 3* items.
---
you should have at least one weapon type maxed out with all the damage boosting perks
---
The way i see it in my head it would be great, the way it would work is a load of squeaky people jumping up and down firing random headshots.
---
Until it comes back, and you do the quest, then it comes back, and you do the quest, and it comes back....FOREVER.
---
Before I started the possum badges I saw that plan for 10K caps. Then I started doing the 8 badges to get the High capacity mod plan and always regretting not buying it.  Eventually got it the hard way.
---
It's 20 pounds of useless garbage. Unless you're a collector of course.
---
Yea it's a known Bug. A leftover from skyrim i've been told.
---
Some of these were over lvl 200. I was amazed. But the weird armour bug (actually it was entering the armour not leaving it) crashing the game just topped it off. :D
---
Well not when lvl 200+ players are running around like headless scorched no you're right :D
---
So where do I put the meat? I couldn't figure it out with everyone running around so I just turned a spit until the event ended.
---
no. you need the plans from the event. I thought the fixer was min 35. Everyday is a school day. however, learned, at your level, everthing has to cut through armour. look at weapon stats for hunting rifle - hardened reciever and penetrating mag -scrap till you learn them. If your a rifles person, you might want to look for a gauss (l35 / 200 dmg), but again, crap until you learn the peircing capacitors.
---
cheers
---
Same 😂
---
Until they fix all the cheating in NW that will carry over to the adventure servers, it's not going to be fun period.
---
Go to a weapons work bench and craft a new one at a higher level, if you know the plans for it.
---
I was replying based on what I discussed with others dont be a dick about it.
---
I guess you have never seen the train station camps.
---
That and the wallpapers fron the Far Harbor vault.
---
No, aggravation! See in passive mode I can stay in their character faces and follow them everywhere they go not allowing them the chance to enjoy much. Sounds stupid huh. After about 15 min they start to get annoyed, a few minutes later it turns to anger finally causing them to either leave or deal with it and I don’t give up. Again it sounds harmless and dumb but the aggravation is real and they can’t ignore it for long.
---
Same here the players ranged between 200 to 80 in lvl
---
You need 3 charisma to share one perk. 6 charisma for 2, 9 for 3.
---
&gt; The event itself. I know what you have to do. Extinguish fires, kill critters and turn in meats collect certain plant, clear poop etc.
---
The devil is in the "etc".
---
Spin the meat!  Bang the drums!
---
Also, feed Chally the moo moo!
---
&gt; Yet the bar was more or less going backwards or staying stagnat.
---
Who was on the drums?  The spit?
---
Do not use it just yet, in a few weeks Murgh the Purveyor is doing a discount week. Save your scrip for then, you'll get more legendaries.
---
Yeah, I've been missing something like this too. A guestbook would be great!! I mean, it would make it possible to be rude too, but that's always a thing with people.
---
I'd love to leave a 'thank you' note or a ' I'm sorry I mistook your pet deathclaw as random mob spawn!!! D:' message. (I have pacifist on at least, but still...)
---
It’s not much help but around 30 is a tricky level, at least I found it was. 
---
Soon as you reach 50 it gets a lot easier. 
---
Helps to tackle that level range with a friend. I personally went full stealth sniper around then with sneak attack bonus it was a piece of cake.
---
Without the bobble my charisma says (-)2 in my pip boy and I heard bloodied unyielding build also just char a lot of cards. I wanted to share ‘strange in numbers’ a one star charisma perk.
---
Maybe a stupid question but do these count for the daily 150 scrips? Like putting actual legendaries in the machine? Or are they just scrips that go directly to the total collection in pipboy, think someone already mentioned here...
---
What is the popular modifier you asked?
---
Ofc the Bloodied + Unyielding build.
---
The bloodied build imo is the only specific "build" in this game because it is the only one where perks play a huge part, and everything synergizes very well.
---
However the build requires you to be at very low health so you need to control your rad level most of the time. If you don't like that then use other modifiers.
---
For those who do not do low health builds, Junkies weapons are being sought quite often nowadays.
---
For ranged weapons, well any hit scan heavy weapon is great. Handmade, Gauss, Tesla, Combat for rifles. Combat shotgun is the only good shotgun but others are viable. Handguns and SMGs aren't really popular.
---
For Melees, well they all work fine, Super Sledge,  meat claw and deathclaw gauntlet all stand out a little bit.
---
I think it was confirmed that there will be generic hostile raiders like in the single player games, in addition to the joinable raider faction. However, it was also said that the old main story will remain playable (maybe with some changes), and I recall a scorchbeast can be seen on the Wastelanders trailer, so there will likely still be scorched enemies.
---
Free acid and occasional radscorpion stingers! Plus all the meat you can vendor!
---
I find if I exit the game and then reload again it always seems to work. Otherwise it keeps trying to put m back into a server where my camp cannot be placed.
---
I got pass those levels by getting a .50 cal machinegun, and using shotguns.
---
The .50 cal can be picked up at a few fixed locations, check wiki.
---
Dude go back to Rust
---
Someone died in the river in the savage divide event and I finally got my swimmer badge
---
So a Behemoth?
---
Some of these suggestions sounds fun but most go way too far. Stealing from my stash? Really? That's sadistic
---
I’d play. I like the idea of your stash being vulnerable although I’d see this leading to people grabbing and dumping stashes in a bush. 
---
I’d add some sort of logout timer to prevent combat logging.
---
And there are only two mods if I am not wrong lol.
---
That's quality
---
Sometimes if you look at the poster at the front door again it opens. Sometimes you just need to hop server
---
Happens every time. They fix something, it comes back next patch, fixes it like 3 weeks later. Wouldn't be surprised if PA freezing glitch already returned
---
Looks good. The wood, and rusted steel, building sets seem to be the ones that are easiest to blend in with the environment. You can make brick look more natural on the landscape, but it takes work and most people don’t pull it off. Blue steel doesn’t really work anywhere, which is annoying as we’ve too few sets to just write one off!
---
ammudiction
---
I throw apparel like that in my vending machines for a few days for maybe 25-75 caps depending on what they are. You never know what people are looking for. I typically just end up selling them to vendor bots to make more room, though.
---
Ok thx guys gonna try it
---
Yeah I'm not much into pvp but...
---
Thank you guys for always buying stealthboy mk3s, certain armors, radium rifles gamma guns etc. almost immediately when I put them in machine lol!
---
It wouldnt be for the faint of heart and it would also be an optional game mode/server.
---
I am on PC yes, same username as Reddit
---
We're waiting on a supposedly functional mailbox that's been datamined. I think a tip jar would fit great with the musical instruments and the bar set we have also.
---
Optional but you'd have to create a new character for it or  delete mutations, legendaries and stash items to play. Seems pretty unrealistic that people would do that.
---
If only there was a *tips fedora* emote
---
I think they might be something wrong with PERK sharing.
---
I used to be able to boost my CHA from 5 to 6 via a PERK then share a lvl 2 PERK. Can't do that anymore.
---
$0=4350 atoms in my case
---
You cannot take those atoms and cash in for dollars. They are not the same thing. 
---
You cannot take $7 and go into the shop and buy a fridge. 
---
The fridge is 700 atoms. If someone buys atoms because they cannot wait to earn them that is a separate transaction. They are paying a premium to rush. The fridge is not $7. They paid a premium to get atoms faster is all.
---
Is meat Week going to be the exact same as it was lat time when it comes to rewards ?
---
Cause if so i alreay have everything and Don't need it... :/
---
Im gonna make a video showing my camp tomorrow so you can see that its possible - the problem is that 99% of people in the game would rather make the biggest structures possible and their left with such little camp budget that theyre forced to only add one piece of furniture every couple of yards. My camp is small as hell so I can cramp a ton of shit inside of it.
---
Thanks. What with survivabilty on bloodied builds? Can I clean raids on it?
---
What about tse or aae? Also I see many people with Gatling plasma, and earlier I saw many people with .50 or gatling gun
---
I am fully aware of how to get mounted heads. I have most of them. Several hve not been released though (ie Scorchbeast).
---
Someone please tell me how I start this quest!
---
Why? 
---
But more importantly how? Seize the camps from the owner? Forbid them from making changes or relocating? What happens to the camps when the owners log off, what about their vending machines?
---
I agree. The only way to make something that truly fits in is to use unmarked locations for camp building.
---
If people ever put some good legendaries in their vending machines, I will happily give them some caps for coming to their camps. But they dont, so I dont.
---
This must have been what happened to me the other day! I was so confused why I couldn’t share. Didn’t even think to see what affects I had going on.
---
When playing in that game mode your current legendaries become normal guns, your mutations are suppressed and if you have too many items on you when booting up the new game mode you'd have to go to your stash and dump all of your items inside. Then, once you want to go back to adventure mode everything is back to normal.
---
The 3 vault 94 where just a random case but everyone panicked like it's everyday.
---
Totally [Deathclaw made me lol]
---
&gt;but the majority of people are either too lazy to make them look good or just dont care.
---
Let Beth fix all the fucking building bugs and more elaborate camps will come back, in addition freeze the no building zones and don't add any more.
---
Really, that is great :)
---
Still extremely unrealistic for this game, you'd have to add brand new features just for your server, and even if they did accommodate you I guarantee none of it would work properly.
---
The milk of human kindness?
---
Where the yao guai is cooking. Walk up to it and it will say deposit prime meat or something like that
---
You put the meat in the middle bit of the area on the bbq spit thing
---
Here is a pic to help https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/2590/4084783-1564921072.jpg
---
Why do people hang out in Grafton so much? Lol
---
Well to be fair the scorched obviously has a different model. And I always feel like they are a little bit more stupid.
---
I would think that the amount of scorchbeast encounters would decrease to a point that they won't spawn unless you are at a fissure site or specific events. As for scorched people, most of them should be turned into stones right now, if not dead. Or maybe they will all completely relocate to the eastern side of the map.
---
I really hope for more non combat perks like Legendary crafter that would give max durability to power armor pieces (the only thing you can craft that is relevant). Legendary builder increases your CAMP budget. etc...
---
Start by seeing curator, then stop, don't finish it. No mayor anymore.
---
Some items yes,greenhouse no
---
What perks you got enabled? Also certain enemies have armor.
---
Great job skipper! Every little victory counts!
---
This is like an in-club secret but the railway Rifle still hit scans. So if you mod it automatic, and line up a sneak attack critical and hold down the trigger, you will get ten sneak attack critical. It demolishes pretty much anything. Keep it on the low down tho lol.
---
Other than that yeah handmade etc.
---
A God roll fixer is worth it's weight in gold but good luck trading for it.
---
that's also my biggest concern.  one person can be 1 shotting all the mobs, while someone else camps the terminal and does the non combat objectives before you get there.   you could be trying but because of the 1shot and camper it appears you did nothing.  which would suck to burn 15 minutes and get the "minimum" reward if any.
---
They are allready on this,just have to be patient..
---
After the 5 th serverhop I did get in thx.....
---
IIRC, they can build items which you don’t have plans for, as long as that plan can be found in-game is not an atom shop item. 
---
So they could build you a contamination arch, but not a greenhouse.
---
Well, if you're on sometime this weekend, preferably morning, I can build you a tricked out handmade at no charge (you'll need to be level 35 to use it). Anyways, I may need to find some mats to fully mod it out, but add me if you're interested. Ign raskol.
---
I couldn't help myself, it's one of like 5 spiders I'm legitimately afraid of lol
---
Well first of all Im thinking that Bethesda can choose like five of the absolute best camps across all platforms, so its not like any and every player in the game is gonna have their camps become static locations.
---
When the owner is on their own server they can make whatever changes they want and once they leave it goes back to normal for everyone else on that server. Also if they choose to relocate they can do that, and the old camp will stay where it is and remain a static location on the map.
---
Thousands of people play this game and a single person tweaking a location on one server temporarily isnt gonna do much harm - especially if its a location without any quests attached to it.
---
An option to downvote camps which show as having 58 armor pieces yet in reality only have worthless outfits- is go for that.
---
When I first started writing I meant to come up with small changes mainly to the HUD to make the game more difficult for a private server but I got ahead of myself and started coming up with all types of shit that would warrant BGS making it a new game mode entirely. I agree that 75% of my suggestions would be impossible to make in a private server.
---
Wow. Thanks!
---
yeah ive learned from it and launched a few now, turns out using the alpha code at site charlie is not smart, ty
---
&gt;**PTS** – A **Private** Test Server (PTS)
---
Is it just a typo or really a **private** (instead of public) test server? Does it mean we will be able to also set up and mod those private servers to test mods? Or is it just private in the sense of "you will be invited to this server" like "closed" like in "closed beta"?
---
Back in my day we didn’t even have the option to switch if a camp was in our location
---
I'm getting the voice message thing and my camp is at the bottom of the savage divide
---
Never said camps had to be elaborate to look good. Its entirely possible to make a good, realistic looking camp in the games current state, but like I said a lot of people just choose not to for whatever reason.
---
yup, gotta finish my last few plans ans then its just grind out the steel for the PA, then more steel to re-roll some perks on my solar set.
---
Yeah I can almost imagine having to set up private servers for events, which kind of goes against the whole community aspect of it.
---
Disable those daily events
---
I'm just happy the challenges are doable for now. Not sure if they actually listened or the challenges have rolled back to their launch date simplicity. Create healing items, scrap wood, kill 5 mirelurks, I haven't seen challenges this simple since launch. Only time will tell I guess, if we'll start seeing those ridiculous camera challenges again.
---
Back in my day we had a stash of 400. But that a long time ago.
---
I would be happy if they hadn’t completed half of them for me &gt;:(
---
No. It’s just a fun event. It isn’t actually supposed to make an impact. You can’t just kill all the scorched. The plague still exists and will infect more.
---
4 poison damage/ second in a 7M aura
---
30 poision damage/10 seconds per hit on attack
---
the effects stack and ignore DR
---
also has same stats as ultricite with higher rad resist
---
You won’t.
---
Ah yes, let us encourage the leeches.
---
Well I mean. Didn’t we help create a vaccine?
---
I was thinking I was the only one who had this happen. It's done it to me 3 times this week. I don't mind as such but it's like 4 less things for me to do in game each day :(
---
I don't have any friends that play fo76 so I just play as a loner or a drifter. Once everyone left the vault day 1 (literally, beta days 1 and 2) I interacted with other people which was cool at first, but I quickly ended up going my own way. I do events and I have different routes I grind through and things like that. I'm never hostile to other people and I'll help anyone out, but I typically just do my own thing traveling around as a drifter. This really can be a lonely feeling game so I embrace it and do what I can
---
Aka how to be a wet sock in winter.
---
Oh good point, that would also be really terrifying lol
---
Lol it’s grahm. Not as smart as Virgil. 2 prime meat gives you 20 scrip. But completing the cookoff event can also give you unique loot, apparel, plans, and additional legendaries.
---
Strongly against for much the same reasons. It shoehorns everyone into bloody builds because those are effectively the only ones likely to get those higher tier event rewards. This game needs more viable build options, not fewer.
---
What level are you? Purveyor at Berkeley springs train station will give you legendaries in exchange but you need to save up. Wouldn’t recommend if you are under level 50
---
Game isnt dead to people that play.
---
Mole rats are the worst. I killed a 3 star legendary with vats as it was going back into the ground and it never came back up. Sad
---
It would be nice to get a plan for a jet apck for the excavator
---
Grahm literally is standing there telling everyone what to do and nobody listens.
---
Spaghetti code really is the problem here.
---
Survivability should be fine if you build it right, there are multiple ways to reduce damage taken if you look into the build.
---
TSE and AAE are good if you are not using bloodied build, but I like Junkies more
---
Gatling plasma are even more popular now because we finally have armour penetration for energy weapons. But I'd still keep my .50 cal because there's a new golden paint.
---
Great job my friend, bet you get no enemies that high up would be wonderfull for your budget not having to use turrets, looks great
---
I think it's because you need to have set special points available to begin with .. they changed it so you can't use perk cards through consumables.. so change whatever chem you using that effect your charisma
---
I agree, but also I feel they'd somehow ruin this and for entire lengths of time between patches you wont be able to get rid of your pet, or somehow youll be able to release it and itll stick around eating budget. Basically I think they'll fuck it up lol.
---
This is a pretty funny bug, but I've wondered is it only you who sees it? If not then having a  bunch of people do the event then end up in a field of empty aid drops would be epic.
---
Maybe the fact that you are attracting them through making noises?
---
I am also using a bloodied build and I don't see any problem.
---
As far as SPECIAL, here you go.
---
S-3 blocker
---
P-15 all commando, tank killer, ground pounder
---
E-1 radicool
---
C-4 lone wanderer
---
I-5 gunsmith 2, nerd rage (gunsmith 4 wo mr sandman in ag)
---
A-15 covert op, sneak, escape artist, adrenaline, dodgy, mr sandman
---
L-11 bloody mess, serendipity, class freak, starched genes
---
Sentinel doesn’t work while stealthed. Go for harder to detect armor.
---
That's what it basically is now. I show up to help and end up sitting there because the shit is dead before I can even shoot. How is that fair for me? I go to actually get experience and loot and barely get anything because the high levels steam roll it.
---
It's only good when you do event solo, which is opposite with what they want to achieve with this change - encourage people to participate in the events. Even though I can one-shoot almost everything, on events I change for less vats cost weapon that mark the enemy, so everyone can get their loot/exp from mobs, but this change will change the way we play event. For worse...
---
But the option to switch does nothing. It stops you from having to open the map to check yourself. If it could tell *before* the super long loading process instead of after, when we can just check ourselves by clicking a button, it would actually be useful.
---
That's good
---
It doesn’t give you a notification, but if you look at your collection it increases when you deposit.
---
Need at least 5
---
I thought it is in the safe zone?
---
Like you said, I'm find with the idea on paper although my faith in seeing new content that is well-balanced, properly documented, and containing only a *minimal* amount of bugs is pretty low. On top of that, event rewards are usually pretty lousy to begin with so I'd really like to see an overhaul of the drop tables. Double .38s and rad-x isn't a huge motivator but an extra roll on the rewards table for some of the harded to find plans could convince me to do Leader of the Pack for the 100th time in hopes of finally getting a hatchet elctro fusion plan.
---
They do not count toward 150 limit
---
Yeah, that's my take on it. It's just a bit of fun -- kill 'x' amount of enemies for goals. They're just tying it into Wastelanders to create an in-game reason for it.
---
Wait that's a thing?
---
Thx for your time and effort, but can you please elaborate on below doubts:
---
* Why blocker? Usually nothing can get too close to get me on melee range?
---
* I don't need more STR to carry items, since I only got 2 weapons and 2 kind of ammo to it. Life seems more beneficial to me.
---
* Why gunsmith? Weapon degradation (ballistic ones) I own is acceptable without gunsmith and demolition expert boost damage for my explosive weapons.
---
* I don't need dodgy, serendipity procs so frequently I prefer to keep gun fu and action girl.
---
* And what do you mean with sentinel doesn't work with stealth?
---
Yes and no.
---
First, yes .. we need more control ... it cant just be a random add.
---
Second, voice of set is the weakest for sure, but if it had 3 more stars it might be an actual viable pistol. 
---
...
---
And then the others
---
If you could get legendary effects on the wearables now that set becomes usable truly and not something just for people looking for a challenge. Unyielding? Sentinel? Cavalier? Given you cant wear 5 pieces just the two that's limited but now we have far better options.
---
And then the Blade of Bastet.
---
Well they can one shot things, yes, how about you shoot those things first?
---
This the level of theorycrafting usually found on Star Citizen reddits. But do keep dreaming, mate.
---
On the cargo bot, aim for the jets. After shooting out a few of them it'll stay pretty much stationary. Makes it soooo much easier
---
Heh, totally, I'm just giving you crap about how a significant percentage of us are not men :P
---
Let people play the way they want. For some it's fun to optimize.
---
Well at your level even if you get the card, you'd find it difficult to do the silos, get a powerful friend like Bruce Wayne to help you.
---
Easier said then done. Plus most of the time if I just get one shot it still doesn't give me experience.
---
Then your damage is just pathetic, that's it.
---
Get better gear.
---
Read sub rules. Mainly the last one.
---
what
---
Proofread your posts
---
thx for replying!
---
User name checks out.

Upvoted strictly because Hot Rod is my favorite comedy of all time. Carry on
---
That lady is a damn hero
---
If you are on PC I can make you a handmade and / or a lever action suitable for your level. Other than that it would be a good idea to focus on one type of weapon (e.g. semi-auto-rifles) and get the damage perks for that category (you can invest a total of 9 points in rifleman, expert rifleman and master rifleman). Tank killer and bloody mess will also amp up your damage
---
Don't tell me you actually purchased atoms with real money to buy a $7 fridge?
---
And now I'm being stalked by the supply drop crate as well,shot myself when it came through the roof of my camp.
---
People during events should use low dmg weapons or shoot in a politic way... that's it.
---
Its about finding a server with a terminal time of 1ms or less to instant, we 3 hop servers to find a good one. It can take us 15 mins of just finding the lagfree terminal experience.
---
Oh damn posted on the wrong one
---
Thats what you get by building your camp in whitesprings station
---
I've never gotten my damage anywhere near that level but I'd never get a solo SBQ on console.
---
The SBQ can be brutal with lag on console as well but at least you can bust out your wallet and upgrade your PC. I can't even block sometimes due to the lag.
---
I ran around with a quad, explosive, 90% reduced weight db shotgun for awhile. Pretty awesome but I blew myself up a lot
---
No damn way. The new event system is fun because everyone high or low level can participate equally. If it goes performance based, then all you will see is people in a race to one shot everything and low levels and non op builds are basically sol.
---
I do feel your expert experience, we had never done washout or meltdown expert since DITW(dead in the water) was easy. Acouple days ago we had the perfect pump code and reactor task rng which gave us 17 second remaining when we finished it after 4 hours of trying.
---
I am not this guy but I have some opinions:
---
*Blocker because there might be accidents, switch for travelling pharmacy if you don't need it.
---
*More weight is always more convenient. If you need health, use Rejuvenated instead, it gives 25 more health then usual (for a total of 50) when well fed.
---
*I would use max rank Nerd Rage, and B25/B10 weapons instead of BE weapons because explosive affix breaks stealth.
---
*Dodgy or not is up to you.
---
*I think he meant when you are in stealth no one attacks you so sentinel is useless.
---
Chuck Norris would be no good. The nuke would launch out of fear before you got into the silo
---
It was a joke my dude
---
That's why I said Bruce Wayne.
---
Yea guy below answer but the effects are super strong
---
nice try todd
---
Yes.. go in pip boy
---
What did I say that isn’t accurate?
---
You should make a video and put it on YouTube for us on Xbox and PC.
---
Why is this NSFW?
---
Reptiles do not survive the fallout because it is too cold. There is even a game mode called "Nuclear Winter".
---
actually, given the low price of the game and the ease of getting a new account ... many do so apparently XD. It should be necessary at this point more effective protection methods ...
---
ping /u/valseek /u/ladydevann /u/cm_pipboy
---
Thx for info.
---
* I though about rejuvenated, but it might get kill me - when bonus from well fed/hydrated drops, it can be quite drastic - even if that won't kill me straight, leaving me with 1-2 HP can be deadly. And I'm not always well fed/hydrated, so it's situational.
---
* I have max nerd rage in build, but didn't knew explosive breaks stealth, might need to check it further.
---
* I understand, it's similar to Blocker - can be situational.
---
As both of my armor sets (uny/sent from my main and chameleon from alt) haven't got better sneak affixes and I don't want to look for them (just use what I already have), which would be more beneficial for sneaking? I know chameleon stacks, but unyielding gives me 30+ agility...
---
That's the easy part. The silo itself is a brutal slog of robots (those gun using colonel gutsy bots are deadly), so be ready for a tough fight. 
---
As for the cargobots I use short bursts from my .50 caliber mg. Aim for the jets and they end up hovering. The vertibots are screwed if you aim for the rotors. It's so fun watching them spin out of control.
---
Good idea. I had assumed the event spawn points were randomized.
---
Yea the vertibird will be the least of your issues. The silos are loaded with robots, lots of turrets and assualtrons. May want to hold off a bit and level to atleast 50 and gear yourself up before proceeding.
---
I hit 97 last night. I met a fella and we ran through site A and I launched my first nuke, very cool! Without his guidance it would have taken me atleast an hour to figure everything out. He was level 132 and between the two of us ,it still took 20 min or so and both of use have pretty good gear.
---
Take advantage of the xp the meat week events provide ,get some scrip ,save it for the perveyor sale coming in a few weeks and gear up!
---
Because of the way stealth works in 76, there will be times when you will be spotted and there’s nothing you can do about it. You need melee defense. As a current example, stealth is effectively disabled during Primal Cuts. The second an enemy spawns, you’re immediately in danger. I have a 37 ag, a full uny/sneak suit and all shadowed/muffled/ultralight armor. Normally I’m invisible, but there’s times when enemies magically see you instantly. It’s rather common, in fact. You need the ability to eat a hard punch. At 19% health, you don’t have a lot of room to screw around.
---
If you want to ditch gunsmith, be my guest. Demo expert is diminishing returns past one rank, but feel free to figure it out on your own. Adding an extra 100 damage on top of 2000 isn’t really worth 5 perk points to me. Try it out in actual combat and see if it’s worth it for you.
---
You need Dodgy for the same reason you need blocker. Serendipity is amazing, but 45% is not 100%. When a Yao guai swipe gets through, you want to be able to eat a few. Sometimes there’s three at once. They WILL spot you sometimes. Don’t fall into the glass cannon trap. It sad when you see someone dying nonstop during SBQ. You know their build is broken, and it’s so easy to fix.
---
When you’re crouched, sentinel doesn’t work. It only works while standing. I’m not lying to you as an evil plot to thwart your build.
---
Gun fu is a waste, in my opinion. You can toggle and cancel vats immediately while swapping targets far faster manually. Ground pounder and True weapon mods will make hipfire accuracy very tight with a handmade, so I hardly ever use vats.. You’ll be using one or two bullets per standard enemy, so gun fu is a lot of empty space in between. 
---
Ive condensed my build into the most efficient version possible. If you want to use Adamantium Skeleton 1 in E, that’s good. Radicool has so much bang for 1 perk point, and helps with the combat knife. Lvl 42 ghouls are dead in one stab. I’ll take the extra carry weight as a side bonus.
---
I’ve been playing a sniper since Fallout 2. I feel like I have a working knowledge of the build. I can’t force you to listen to me, but everything I’ve said comes from thousands of hours of experience. You asked for advice, so there’s mine.
---
😂
---
Am sitting on top of a pole in sneak mode not doing anything
---
This is literally the last mission.  The difficulty is more like a "hard" on FO4 then the other missions which are much easier as you've pointed out.
---
You should probably level up more and get a full set of legendary armor and weapon before you attempt it on solo.  
---
You'll also want level 3 hacking, or be able to lay down "enough" firepower to take out hordes of robots without getting downed.
---
Not since week 1, i don't want to risk losing all my stuff
---
What happened...
---
What platform you on dude love to role with you
---
the thing that makes it good imo is when you have a rifleman character and you use it as a shotgun its quite ammo efficient and packs a big punch when you use it in vats, furthermore with the tormenter perk you have a really good chance to cripple enemies and for a legacy weapon its condition bar holds on really long
---
Sounds good. I'm hoping it's part of the plan and not just flying by the edge of their seat.
---
Yup, PC. Can't really aim with controller.

I wasn’t here for the last meat week, Where is grahams?
---
I hope it was gentle
---
But the event starts when someone sound the drums.
---
Why u think Xbox meta is more centred around Vats or massive splash/ Tesla’s, wether that be Explosive gat plasmas or explosives lasers for the splash but ye anyone without one of those build is gonna suffers
---
Big thx for you time, that's a lot of info you gave me, for which I'm very pleased.
---
In this case maybe you're right with the demo expert - I'll transfer those 4 points to agility and use dodgy.
---
So it'll be my build:

---
It was also mentioned at QuakeCon that there will be a major "normalization" pass of some sort that intends to make the difficulty more balanced between low and high level players, especially at events. This was planned to be introduced around the release of Wastelanders, although I do not know if there have been changes since then (as the prestige system was already delayed to 2020). While it was not explained how the system would work, I can imagine something like damage multipliers being applied to players who are too high level for an event.
---
You can pry my steel from my cold dead hands
---
Some players here say lengendary spawn rates are not down so I might get downvoted. In my experience however, legendary drop rates are **way** down compared to two/three months ago. I used to get 300 scrip in 5 hours of playing, now I get about 75 scrip on the same time frame. It was suggested to me to change the places I visit but that doesn't seem to be any better.   
---
Everybody I talk to in game says drop rate is way down. I do not understand why people here say differently. Anyway, in my humble opinion, this is the main reason why prices are going up. If things continue like this, expect them to go up even more... The legendaries I sell are also priced at minimum 3K because everything that would sell cheaper, is more usefull to me as scrip.  
---
BTW, the prices you mention are not high at all. Prices of 100K+ in 5.56 ammo are normal these days.
---
He pops up every hour on the hour (6:00, 7:00, etc) just below vault 76.
---
Oof
---
They should, bit we both know people won't. They want to show off.
---
Amazing!
---
I know it'll be perfect, but on the other way I don't want to invest/trade for that set - I'm tired of completing my uny-sent heavy combat too much (it costs me arm, leg, first-born and couple of godly rolled items;). What's more, I'm obsessed with that being one armor type (scout to be precise), which further complicate situation. But I must think it out. Maybe than will be my next goal?
---
I jumped on yesterday night to do a trade with a guy and within the 20 minutes I was on I hit up a prime beast event and did a successful meat cook. Got potato salad recipe, black girl Master hat, and was able to buy a couple decent plans from Graham. 
---
I have no idea what you guys are talking about.
---
Great info! Thanks!
---
Once again. Easier said than done. Unless you want to fork over the caps for me a level 35 then getting good isn't going to cut it. That's why I do events and once again bringing it around to the actual topic. I can't get better gear or caps to buy gear if the high levels are killing everything before I get a chance to do anything.
---
Flagged this to the team. Thank you for sharing this, especially the video footage.

This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

---
To start, the key card. I have found the best weapons to shoot the cargo bot down would be energy weapons that can shoot a distance if you have standard and most legendaries troubleshooter, anti-armor, multi shot.
---
The best strategy I can offer would be:
---
Go the the Enclave bunker and get the quest to get a key card. 
---
Go to location to intercept the cargo bot.
---
Ambush cargo bot with several hits. It will start circling.
---
Attack one vertibot while hitting the cargo bot every few times to keep it engaged until you take out the vertibot.
---
Rinse and repeat until the cargo bot is left and then take it out. 
---
The quick version - if you have speed or stimpaks would be ignore vertibots and dodge their attacks while concentrating fire on the cargo bot. Then either take the vertibots out or get the loot, including the key card and book it out of there evading the vertibots until they lose track of you.
---
It is extremely difficult at your current level, but it is possible. I soloed the quest around level 60 and have as of right now soloed the silos at least a dozen times with the last time actually helping a friend through it for the first time.
---
I figure, you need to be at least level 50 or higher. You will still have issues and die a lot if you are not prepared to take on level 56 or higher robots.
---
I have done silos Alpha and Bravo, but not Charlie  since they each seemed to have a difficulty. I wouldn't touch Charlie unless in a team. As of right now I have at least 10 of the key cards and launch a nuke a week or more.
---
I have a problem with it just like others. You get the greedy type in these events such as UF and they’ll block you out from getting even one shot in. About as bad as a griefer.
---
TBH a level 35 like you has no business complaining, this game really starts after lvl50.
---
You are like in the tutorial and you are complaining about the actual game, non sense.
---
Grind through the first 50 levels and we will talk.
---
Grab radicool instead of life giver you'll get +5 str from it
---
TBH level 200-300s have no business at low level events, but here we are. You telling me not to play the game because I'm too low level is fucking dumb. It's not like I'm showing up to kill the queen and bitching about not getting xp. I'm complaining that I'm doing events for my level and not getting xp like I should because higher levels one shot everything before I get a chance to do anything.
---
My first was about level 60 a few weeks back, and it was so uneventful. I packed a load of stims etc but it just went by in a flash. The worst part was a power armour glitch that took me a while to fix!
---
One stabilized arm is the same as holding your breath. Perfectly still, which is a Huge advantage.
---
20 off the top of your hp, but if you run a 19% bloodied build for damage and unyeilding that's 3.8 life points difference.
---
We're all here to take the wasteland my friend!! Give em hell!!
---
Nothing new. Same challenges as when the game first started. It's like they aren't even trying anymore. I loved this game and with the newest "fixes" that turned events down to one at a time. I LOATH it. I sit in my camp and ask myself which of the 5 daily I would like to do and then finish them all before a single event pops I want to do. Then it's server hopping til you find an event and boom, server crash. I hate that I am losing my love for this game but it's getting worse and worse the more they "fix" it.
---
Does having more people at the event make it harder? If no then who gives a shit. Why screw over people wanting to participate because your scared of one person going afk
---
I agree. I loved some of the non-combat random encounters in 4.
---
He doesn't. I've started the quest more than two weeks ago, and he's been silent ever since.
---
Kids, this is why you should not use drugs before going on the interwebs.
---
I'd like a letterbox that allows us to send things to our other characters, friends and to drop off gifts at other players' camps.
---
Are you sure? As far as I compared my BE Lever and HRifle the second not only had significantly lower damage (even with .50 cal receiver), but also require longer 'reloading' after every shot.
---
Do not ever use the event icon to join Scorched Earth, it will drop you in the rad zone and it only appears after the nuke hits.
---
Ok, I'll surely give it a try.
---
Yep exactly. This is my third character though on a different system and God forbid I actually want to do the event and get some xp or try and get some better gear.
---
That's good to hear
---
Gunsmith is a waste of 5 perk points.
---
I understand that, but still more strength is irrelevant to my build. I'd rather use Good doggy for easy food and one rank of rejuvenated.
---
I swear by it. The perforating mag on a hunting rifle gives you armor penetration that lever and pipe guns don’t have. Armor pen doesn’t show up on paper, but pays off out in the field. I can take out a lvl 80 scorchbeast in four hits with a B/E prime hunting rifle. The same lever gun requires a reload.
---
How did you find any of this lore?
---
Can't watch right now unfortunately
---
I use two, but it’s easy to do without now that SBQ drops repair kits like candy.
---
Yeah I've been wondering what's going on can someone pls explain
---
I don’t think so. Doing both arms has no additional benefit, either.
---
So the event is precisely the same? That is a shame some new rewards would’ve made it more worth it.
---
Yep, I honor my name! ;)
---
You can't display the banjo.
---
You can only display the flute, violin, snare drum and trumpet from what've I've seen.

Darius Angler left a chain of notes and holotapes he called his manifesto from Grafton, to Willards Corporate Housing to the Grafton Steel Mill detailing his downward spiral and eventual sabotage of Grafton Steel.
---
Thanks
---
I had this happen when I was playing Nuclear Winter and returned to Adventure mode - not playing NW at all now til all daily and weekly challenges are done (and that usually takes so long I never get round to NW!)
---
Although I haven't been affected by this as often as other people have, this really needs to be fixed.
---
Thank you.
---
Of course I'm not see your posts as negatives, I really appreciate the input, we just discuss.
---
I'm still yet to decide final build, since I have a lot of points to move and quite a few perk cards to gain, I wasn't lucky to get earlier. So at least 10 levels before I have final SPECIAL configuration.
---
Thank you very much.
---
I joined, too, but I'm not allowed to see the welcome channel. What am I doing wrong?
---
Legendaries are reason we can even kill the SBQ in the first place.
---
This last week my friends and I have said goodbye to Henry the Mirelurk King, Fenris the Wolf and Danny the Deathclaw. My poor Danny had only arrived at my camp a couple of days prior and I made him a lovely little house and decorated it for him - when I loaded into a world to see him dead on the ground... not a good feeling.
---
I didn't have them before the event, did the event and after, checked what all I had...and they were there....so, I didn't see them pop up on the screen as a drop from event completion (I'm not even sure I saw the screen pop up as we were still fighting ghouls after event completion) but I don't know how else they would have come to me.
---
Still no video? I’m shocked lol
---
The fact that you cannot read amazes me.
---
I said "Grind though the first 50 lvls and we will talk"
---
What I really hate about Reddit is it randomly deleting my posts for not being "interesting" enough. At any rate, I've been playing for two hours and the meat cook event hasn't happened yet.
---
Happy now, idiots?
---
Best thing you can do is blueprint sections of your camp to rebuild it.
---
Bug: There has been a fast travel bug lately i've been noticing. say you go to fast travel to a CAMP, you'll arrive at a different CAMP, or in the middle of nowhere.
---
Bug: Mr. Messenger, lately been a bunch of events where you can't pick up the part, despite being able to see it on the ground.
---
Bug: Heart of the Swamp, The strangler heart can disappear completely and not return. Seen this one several times.
---
Bug: Plasma Flamer, normal mag size is 306, a few times I've logged in and the counter was showing as 999/0 and allowed for unlimited fire without reloading.
---
These are on PC
---
Neither do the folks at Bethesda
---
It may generate 33, but it has a holding capacity limit of 14. You have to get back and collect it for it to keep producing.  Once it it 14 it storage limit is reached.
---
I am on PS4, unfortunately I won't be playing for a bit....maybe can get on Saturday? Add me -  jacktriphyllum
---
I droped a nuke just to get a boy scout badge.
---
It depends on how well the game measures "performance". That is, ideally it should not only be kills and damage that count, but for example also spending time as a conduit in Encryptid, feeding the creatures in Project Paradise, herding the brahmins in Free Range, repairing the loudspeakers in Guided Meditation, reviving other players, and so on. Basically, anyone who contributes in a meaningful way receives the rewards, just not those who crouch in a corner and do nothing.
---
The normalization mentioned by Jeff Gardiner at QuakeCon as a new feature coming with Wastelanders (unless delayed) could be an important factor as well in balancing events, maybe the damage dealt by those high level players will be scaled down.
---
I usually just zoom in and then it makes player icons smaller than the event icon
---
What is COBJ?
---
I got disconnected when I popped my nuclear cherry. Just like real life very awful I was left confused, I was dissapointed and had no idea what just happened.
---
If you can hold out to some more qualities of life they’re going to remove Legendary tagging, so even if you don’t hit it, you can still loot it
---
Mine is in the shop.
---
I agree, pretty lame there hasnt been any trophies in the first two updates.
---
Yes, but I doubt that all of the new NPCs characters would know to vaccinate themselves against the plague. They likely will just show up and not know anything about the scorched.
---
Lol best most confusing 30 seconds for your life??
---
Just stop talking and leave.
---
Wow you lasted 30 seconds!!!
---
Okay. I assumed that but wanted someone to confirm my assumptions.
---
Thanks for all your replies, it makes a lot more sense now. Its a fun event.
---
It's the internet, I gotta talk myself up!
---
Lol
---
1 shot will ruin the game
---
Definite no on this one. I always try to use a weapon with low dps during public events so everyone gets a chance to tag something. If this does happen I think most players won't participate in public events.
---
Because a lot if people only grant access to some of the workstations.  Because fast traveling to your camp is free. There are many reasons
---
&gt;TBH level 200-300s have no business at low level events
---
Bullshit, I'm trying to farm rare outfits and plans that only drop in the Forest and Ash Heap regions. Why shouldn't I be allowed to do that?
---
considering that pretty much 95% of the endgame isgetting your perfect gear i think this idea is horrible
---
maybe for survival it would have been a good idea but definitely not in general
---
food builds are gona have a rude awakening lol.
---
I had the same experience yesterday. Three guys with teslas going to Prime Cuts and Cookout shooting people. I finally hit back. I think I ended up losing about 200 caps total. 3 on 1 and I was killing them near as much as they killed me. They were raging over the mic. Lol. Funny thing, I actually forgot to equip Serendipity. I wonder how things would have turned out then.
---
I hope they bring in some PVP. I don't really want to attack players in adventure mode at all, and workshops are so boring when you are used to having the whole map like survival mode. Having a shootout in a square patch is nothing compared to chasing each other through Charlestown or watoga or even whitesprings.
---
bulk it and sell it to the train station vendors. Keep 100 or less of everything besides for screws, steel, and lead. You find everything else everywhere you go constantly and there's never a time you're going to use 500 of everything in 1 day.
---
For real, even if they were grindy ones. Like “Craft every alcohol recipe earned from Biv” and stuff like that. Or even ones for completing the small cryptids questline
---
Throw out the stuff you don't need.
---
You won't need 200 gold or 200 asbestos.
---
Anyone know if there is a place detailing the storage capacity for these sorts of things (extractors, water pumps, etc)?
---
Do you play a lot of NW?
---
I’ve noticed that that only happens to me when I go there first. If I log into regular mode first it doesn’t happen
---
That's what happens when you hoard crap.    
---
These games are made like that on purpose so you have to spend more time. They are time sinks. It's not worth it.    
---
Bulk up what stuff you NEED that's harder to find. Almost every junk item can be found in higher number in many places. You can find that info and make getting it more effective.    
---
Why waste time hoarding stuff?
---
Definitely a tip jar. I have plans to recreate a section of the NY subway so I can sit with my guitar and play for the wasteland.
---
I recently had 15 BT Ore on sale at 5 caps a piece, to help people with Metal Worker. Someone cleared them all out just the other day, considering their lvl, I doubt it was for ExPA
---
It's like a DeLorean looks really cool but it's very useless.
---
Keep all screws and ballistic fibre, then keep 50-100 units of everything else, depending on how useful it is, then bulk and sell the rest to robot train station vendors.
---
Have you thought about farming lead ore and acid?
---
Absolutely. My brother and I regularly pick locks to get wanted. When someone shows up and pops off if they lose, they leave right away probably 75% of the time. If they win and we seek revenge, they're gone 75% of the time, if they stick around for to duke it out and call friends, we have a good time doing something that's actually strategic and uses skill in this game. I love it.
---
and me. mine is vamp auto and I'm specced for rifleman. low damage but I can tag around ppl across the room
---
I run a junkies build and it’s great, big damage bonuses but can run full health tanky build too!
---
Yeah I try to do a standard run once per day if I can. And usually I’ll squeeze in a novice run for the extra steel
---
they have their uses
---
for example when the vault raids came some people came prepared with exterminator sets
---
or troubleshooter for the encryptid event
---
im sure in the future there will be similar situations for hunters/mutantslayers
---
That was the only time when. The community wasn’t complaining about the dailies.....  
---
Daily challenges/quests are supposed to be designed to take a small amount of time, but engage you in the game every day.  When they were impossible, people just didn’t bother. That’s the point here.  
---
If the game isn’t doing a good enough job thinking of things for you to do for several hours, then write a map/list of challenges you made up yourself and go collect 30 bobbleheads or something
---
Too much junk in your trunk? Bulk it all with plastic at tinker bench and sell off any and all to vendor bots that  you don't honestly need or can farm easily. If you have weight reduction perks for heavy guns and ammo (as an example) then keep that stuff on your character until you sell or scrip it. Same with all chems you don't really need. You have to get out of the hoarder mentality.
---
 It's what I finally made myself do and it works. I also have bandolier and as soon as my level 47 can get 3 ranks of super duper to use with ammosmith all of my gunpowder and lead and steel will be turned into ammo and kept in character inventory.
---
Very good video, I've always wanted to learn about how the toxic valley looked like that.
---
Nay 
---
It will hurt the lower levels because the upper levels will then start mowing down everything they can.  
---
I would rather have higher level events that drop better items. 
---
Just my opinion
---
Good to know, but I wish they'd learn that every time a player has to look something up, a scorchbeast gets its wings.
---
Great info.
---
You are supposed to get scrip not scripts ;)
---
Bulk it at the tinkers workbench if you haven’t already.
---
Grape mentats you say? Where's your camp again?
---
Ok yeah ill just build a nice big base and after bulk and sell. Thanks for the help!
---
Thanks. When I first encountered the area in the beta I thought it was some sort of geothermal event that made it look like that. I found part 6 of the manifesto first, it took me a while to find the rest.
---
You get this "fix" and you will be back here complaining on every post that no one is killing anything and the low levels are dying. These changes are killing the kindness of the community.
---
In my research I can seem to find much on the advantages of the Mutants build except the 10%. I know the junkies build is good with chems and such but I’m starting to feel like I maybe wasting my time. I’ll give it a bit longer and decide what build and which way I should go. I don’t PVP so assassins isn’t  for me and I’ve done built unyielding and did away with it. Glad to hear junkies is not a waste.
---
Apply all the xp bonuses you can and then have a marathon crating session. When done, scrap what you need to learn and sell the rest. 
---
I'm a hoarder too but other than the scarce resources, everything else should be used and sold.
---
How about having 4 level 20s show up to the Bog prime cuts expecting to be carried? Come on.
---
I've had that bug. The important question is: did you get your Atom Caps? I've checked and definitely didn't get mine. Other users have complained and been told by support that they were paid in full.
---
Been playing since beta and I never knew about this somehow. Thanks a lot for this. This is awesome.
---
It's the same as water purifier. Big one can make 60 per hr but it's full at 5 so need to clear them out.
---
I’ve tried it that way and still nothing.
---
I think this sounds good in theory, but I level alts and you don't want me as your level 15 opponent. Plus if it's gang warfare then it makes sense to have like rookies or whatever tagging along with the big guys. 
---
I've been playing another game that has tiered PVP in zones, it's kind of dead until you reach the highest tier. Boring, I'd rather get killed over and over then sit at the kiddie table. At least I'd be able to observe more experienced players and learn from them.
---
Bulking only reduces the weight if aluminum and lead just so you know so unless they do vend everything bulking it will be a waste of plastic.
---
You should see the [mating habits of Mole Rats](https://i.imgur.com/9oxJdPG.png)...
---
Good video
---
Yeah I thought the 10% to 60% ( 5 armor and 1weapon)would stack and help but got screwed on that making me feel like I’m wasting my time. I guess I’m wanting a good all around full heath build then. Being in the 200+ lvl I want more damage and less rads.
---
Yeah, but that location where both deposits are leaves a lot to be desired.
---
I'd quite like events to give us all our rewards in magic air-drop format so that we don't have to check every pile of ashes and goo in case one was a legendary. Actually, I'd like that to be the method for all legendary drops. Too many drop through the floor.
---
I took my low level alt through at 39 solo. Bloodied stealth makes it easy mode.
---
Ha, I like your style. What platform?  
---
You know, I always end up +- at 0 caps, even after prolonged fights with multiple opponents, simply because nobody expects PA to do much (while it certainly can) and they keep coming back for more. Though I've been in skirmishes with net loss of over 1-2k caps, simply because I can't do much against realy pimped up sent-ass tesla user - and I also keep coming back for more beating, haha. This game is great pvp fun, despite what most people say.
---
Thanks very much
---
I appreciate it
---
try vanguard its very good :)
---
Same
---
This right here. 
---
When all the hoarders are at Uranium Fever it just opens up another area for you to pilfer through. 
---
I did Uranium Fever yesterday after a week of not going and it was a cluster fuck. People really care about their crappy legendary scrip. (99% of the time.)
---
Ssssssssorrry
---
I posted a similar idea a few days ago only how I would have done towns from the release of the game. Check it out if you think the ideas any good https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d56z1x/comment/f0klux7?context=3
---
So ignore them. If they die let them die. They are only an inconvenience because you decide they are.
---
Oh i have one of those. Do you know what you guys were doing? Not my favorite weapon but it's decent as 10mm adds up fast.
---
Also 2x the disconnection rates and bugs.
---
Nah.
---
Yeah your right maybe but some legendary weapons are too strong
---
I dunno about that. I feel it takes waaay more than just 5 minutes to make 5 purified water
---
What do you do after I am become Death then?
---
One in the junk yard drops 5 each time. Maybe it was nerfed back in the day. If your collecting junk there power it up. Quick money.
---
Yes, I did this last time and will do it again this time. Snap away at all the corpses.
---
Now offline, but usually near white springs train station. On ps4. But it’s a speak easy so I keep it on the low
---
I meant to do it to sell to get rid of too much extra materials. Sorry if that wasn't clear.
---
I think they listened because the weekly challenges are easier as well. If you look at the requirements for gathering crafting supplies, the amounts for each category are a lot less than they have been in the past. For example, instead of collecting 250 wood, we only have to collect 100.
---
Constructable Object
---
The new scraptron can walk through walls in camps and i have found mine floating in midair while fast traveling to my camp.
---
Handmade rifles have a small chance of spawning with a paint on them that is identical to their normal look in game.  If the paint is removed, it cannot be put back on.
---
So what's the build to kill cloaked tesla try hards? 
---
I'm assuming food to lower energy damage would be a good start. I have mags with lower energy as well. I never PVP on my heavy gunner but I'd like to give a go.
---
I prefer solo running silos over teams unless they ask for help. 
---
I remember helping someone run the silo and turned out he had nothing to actually launch the nuke. 
---
Charlie is my favorite because it has no turrets and I’m too lazy to turn them off at a terminal.
---
You just spoiled the new enemy from Wastelandsrs!
---
If my understanding is correct, negative effects that drop CHA can prevent you from sharing a perk, but temporary positive effects (chems, bobbles etc) will not give you additional points for sharing purposes.
---
#TEXT CHAT WHEN?
---
FFS they list dozens of QoL features for 2020 but they still ignore one of the most requested features since betas in 2018.
---
couldn't agree more. I prefer, by choice, to keep my game dificulty level similar to fo3/4 on hard. I do, use a few, but again, nothing overpowered or just flat out, breaks the laws of physics. That also means very limited use of VATS (or to counter other things that breaks said laws, like gouls that can move so fast, their guts should be left behind. ) and no mutations. I get by just fine. Can I one shot a level 65 s/b ? , nope, I have to put some effort into it. Now , some out there will say, that thats just weak, I have a VERY different opinion on that.....wonder, how far my karma will drop ?
---
On the other hand, overpowered legendaries are also the reason why boss enemies have to be made such damage sponges in the first place . While I do not think legendaries should be removed altogether, at least some legendary effect/character build combinations could use some rebalancing.
---
Same, I have a gatling laser that I use for events, it has good consistent DPS but it's not burst DMG and really easy to control.
---
Agreed. The challenges need love, too. I've killed Scorched with all kinds of weapons; down to doing the Robots and collecting 5000 more wood :(
---
Before the CW upgrade and backpacks I had this problem.  
---
Copper for example isn't as common and I needed it. Plastic and steel? It's everywhere. If you bulk what you don't need it sells for more. Common items won't net you much if you try to sell it.
---
The only legendaries that I think are truly overpowered are legacy gatling plasma and laser guns. The explosive effect stacks with the splitter mods and makes them deal an insane about of damage. I think that is unintentional because shotguns do not work the same way, and they can already shoot multiple projectiles at once.
---
This post needs upvotes.
---
Bethesda could have simply placed a perimeter limit on how close camps can be placed to the Prime Cut locations during meat week, it seems they believe everyone is thoughtful, out to help others and generally not a douche. They are very naive.
---
Do you have Excavator Power Armor yet?
---
Or just a reddit up vote system.  It'd be nice to see how many people stopped by, took the time to look around and also the time to give you an upvote.  Of course, it would have to reset each time you move camp.
---
Yes, I have stopped playing for now will return probably after meat week.
---
This sounds like it would be fun on its own, I just straight up don't like having the hardcore experience be the price I have to pay to be able to PvP. 
---
As far as PVP goes, you can't have PVP but you aren't supposed to really do it. That's just lame and gives all kinds of mixed signals. Nothing is worse then having PVP mechanics that everyone avoids out of politeness.
---
Check your aid and weapons and armour tabs, you could probably do without a few things in there. Just the gear on your back and whatevers in your vending machine. Check your aid tab and your misc in case you have any ore that needs smelting. If you have a lot of plans in the stash they can pick up weight fast. Check if you have missiles, grenades, mini nukes etc in your ammo and think if you'll ever use them
---
Sounds like a great shop item for 1200 atoms.
---
Good. I'm glad.
---
I read your post man and I agree on EVERYTHING. All this would make more sense to an online fallout
---
just grab a tesla rifle, let the turrets do all the work and just relax  👍
---
Yeah. I know about Lucky Hole Mine and it's abundance of ore.
---
Three. Spicy / Salty / Peppered
---
A caps donation box would be cool
---
If it does focus more on participating like you've outlines id be much more welcoming, but for some events that doesn't really apply. Like Uranium Fever, the only thing you can participate in other than killing miners is activiate the terminal at the beginning and fix the generators. There's others too like Heart of the Swamp, Scorched Earth, Swarm of Suitors and Primal Cuts.
---
I'm hoping they eventually bring back survival mode with no legendaries and everyone has to start with a new character from level 1 in that mode with that character only used in that mode (no switching back and forth between adventure and survival with that character). That would be fun and maybe kinda even the odds between players a little. I don't think legendaries should be in survival mode at all
---
I saw a camp near there that was mostly underground, you got down there via a base cello that was half in and half out of the ground. Have not been able to replicate it lol... but the bottom of the camp was under the map. Totally cool. I have a video somewhere
---
When I do Uranium fever which isn't too often (yeah it's crowded) I equip my Auto Tesla I can tag almost everything with it.
---
What was your gamer tag before? Lol
---
I was under the impression that they had corrected that in the last 2 months?
---
Everyone I know just wants the scrip
---
You must be fun to shop with
---
I just want something worthwhile to spend 25-30k, when I have it, on but everyone just likes to sell shit.
---
Would be cool to see
---
More lore videos, please :)
---
Didn't work for me yesterday either. Added prime meat, checked scrip - still sitting at 1000.
---
...Gah damit - need to switch characters!!
---
&gt; You get good and bad groups. 
---
This, occasionally you'll get a bunch of people full of ignorance and selfishness who just OHK (I use them myself when doing it solo), but occasionally you'll get a group that will swap down to "normal" weapons (I carry a Sheish for this) and allow everyone to get hits.
---
I run with a Bloodied Build with powered unyielding armor. My main weapons are a swing speed mole miner gauntlet 2800 damage with sneak attack and a faster fire rate instigating lever action rifle 1600 damage.
---
That is why I mentioned the other upcoming change as well, which hopefully makes the one shotting of enemies by very high level players not so much of an issue. And to be honest, I would not rule out the possibility of a nerf to the most overpowered builds, either.
---
Thanks, working on a couple at the moment, but they’re still in the research phase
---
Have you not seen the ghoul's slither on the ground XD that being said giant snakes would be cool and terrifying!
---
Yea. I was almost level 200 before I finally committed to a bloodied build and I was sick of people one-shotting everything.
---
I was a one-shotter for a few levels before I realized that I was the dick now. Lol
---
XBOX here, didnt have any issues last night.
---
Yeah your right guess I was wrong thanks for changing my mind :3
---
I just want that Burrito
---
Last time I checked the nocturnal guns do change the displayed damage numbers in your pipboy. But you may have to unequip and reequip to get it to update. Nocturnal kind of sucks in the way that the damage peaks at 2am but drops off as the night closes. So at 4 am it is less. And even less at 6. So it's only at it's best for like an hour or two.
---
We already have the ability to take a selfie, in the game.... so how about a Guestbook where we can place a “Polaroid”, and attach a gift (that is only accessible to the camp owner).
---
That solves multiple problems at once, and improves player interaction.
---
Hunting rifles have always dealt lower damage and the 50 cal reciever still does less damage than a hardened 308. What perks were on your lever action? Also did you have a perforating mag and / or tank killer on? Armor penetration makes a big difference in damage.
---
You have to decide whats actually important, and what you can re-acquire in a reasonable amount of time.  (Which I truly understand is much easier said than done - don't ask about my teddy bear, Mr Fuzzy, beer stein, model, and other collections....)
---
Agree with others that you don't usually need more than 50 of anything, especially if you have already crafted all types of PA.  
---
Exception may be steel and lead - real easy to use that amount when making ammo. 
---
Make sure to check your chems - after an unknown number of WS runs, I realized I had over 300 each of stimpack, radx, radaway, and diluted version thereof.  Made just a few caps selling those  : )
---
Get the 200% repair perks for armor, PA, and weapons.  Reduces the frequency of gathering mats to repair stuff
---
generally, ore weights more than the scrap is smelts to.
---
With good doggy perk, you can reduce the amount of food you need to carry.  
---
Inert flux is drinkable, and weighs less than purified water.
---
Most of the junk, weapons, armor, etc I collect during any given session ends up being sold to vendor bots so I can buy some of those expensive plans....
---
Good idea. I have one of them too. Might start using it more
---
I agree with the majority of folks here, let's not give the greedy dicks and more incentive to one shot everything.
---
Sadly, based on how Bethesda has treated balancing so far, I would bet that the best performance tier rewards are going to be equal to the basic event completion rewards you get now, and go downhill from there. Finished an event but someone else one shotted everything? Have a purified water, you've earned it!
---
Im always visiting your camp. Im busy running around and killing everyone i see. wanna try me?
---
Also i already reported players with enough evidence and they are still active (half a year ago)
---
If you can find me, you can kill me ;)
---
I had an issue with my controller randomly disconnecting during a session once. I switched controllers and relogged. No problems since and I know I've used that controller again. 
---
The only problem I've had with the emote wheel is sometimes it'll randomly go to the favourites. Odd but not game breaking.
---
wanna meet up right now?
---
see? you are on survival to hide. you are not engaging. how boring
---
Hell, at one of the F76 mining companies estates in the Ash Heap, there are cages that housed sloths.
---
(This game has infinite potential. Let's give them time)
---
That's the sale price.
---
PS4, no, have been on one server for most of last night, and then I only switched servers in the end because it became less populated. It's been fine even with 3x Prime Meat, a nuke zone, and Project Paradise all running concurrently.
---
Lucky Hole is only one part of the equation you still need steel I like to farm Welch for steel with 3-4 server hops and you can have 800-1000 steel after scrapping all the weapons. For acid I like Toxic Larry's Meats you kill a few Snallygasters and get 18+ acid each server hop. Farming can be boring but it sure is fun having 50k rounds of 5mm for my Bloodied Explosive Mini Gun.
---
Actually very highly recommended. Low lvl 1 star weapons can be very helpful early on. You Just wont have much use for them later on, and you wont have the scrip saved up already when you're higher level..
---
Should be the point of finding mr veterinarian. He revived your last pet
---
I’m not worried about pvp so I run with a pure pve set. I have a troubleshooter RA, Zealot LA, Hunter LL, Mutant slayer RL and auto stim CP. I don’t use ghoul slayer or exterminator since I run blocker 3 and have 75 poison resist so I take reduced damage from pretty much everything. I also run a shotgun medic build, the only thing that really hurts me anymore is the mirelurk queens acid spray.
---
It's very effective especially in close quarters. You tag the first enemy in whichever tunnel they happen to spawn in and it gets the whole row of them.
---
\&gt;&gt;  The PA chassis should display what armor pieces are currently equipped on the PA. 
---
Do you mean when in your inventry? If so, you can rename the Chassis yourself.
---
Arent you making an assumption that performance is based on damage delt? I didnt see that.
---
Selfish dick head. Lucky you're not on xbox. I glitch destroy your camp.
---
I think the mr.fuzzy ride should cost one cap to ride and the owner could collect those caps
---
I've been playing since just after release and launched my first nuke a few days ago. I thought it was really boring and confusing and dull, but I cracked on. Then I launched my nuke... and got disconnected. It was an amusingly perfect ending.
---
For steel, I hit New Gad and Grafton Steel, but it's it's also nice to know about Welch. Toxic Larry's...haven't been there in ages. Thanks for the information.
---
that makes no sense at all
---
Wow.
---
gobble gobble I’m glowing
---
Yes, and thanks you for the heads up!
---
the only kind of snake that matters is the kind in tunnels
---
#Tunnel Snakes Rule!!
---
I've read sources saying that it's most powerful just before 6am.
---
Rewarding events shouldn't pop as often. Then people will just stick to events rather than doing queens or other activities. There's gotta be a balance I don't wanna be doing events back to back the whole time
---
PC version is still without achievements
---
Yes. Thanks for the heads up on that!
---
At some point, you should get a mission to shoot down a strategic cargo bot.  That'll get you the card.
---
Ive found a Troubleshooters gatling does wonders against the escorts.  Occasionally, you'll run across an unescorted cargobot.  Easy pickings - especially once you get the first engine smoking.
---
Some plans have static spawns in world.  For example, if you go to the top floor of the Charleston Harold, enter the editor's office, and look on the table behind the desk plans will spawn there (unless someone has already grabbed them).  I'm not sure how many different variations there are, but I know for certain I have seen plans for the pump action shotgun and laser pistol there.
---
&gt; I know Fallout isn't beholden to strict scientific accuracy
---
a truer statement has never been said.   they dont even hold to their own scientific canon lol
---
Just because you can’t find me doesn’t mean I’m hiding. If you need a hint, I like to travel between player vendors and do events. I’m in Survival for the extra XP and the tension of coming across other players.. not for pvp-based dick measuring.
---
Make sure you are scrapping weapons to learn mods for them.  For example, by scrapping hunting rifles you'll learn the mod for "hardened receiver", which will boost up the damage on your weapon.
---
Lastly, it seems like you're mostly using rifles, so you'd want to adjust your perks accordingly.  Equip all 3 Rifleman perks (regular, master, and expert).  I would also recommend equipping Bloody Mess in Luck as it gives an across the board damage boost for all weapons.
---
When I started playing FO4, I had huge hopes for the settlement system.
---
I hoped some NPC would build their own settlements that we would have to fight, either with weapons or with trades, or with speech. 
---
I hoped we would be able to setup caravans between our settlements, so that we could have for instance resources from Camp A be sent to Camp B, and there would be Raiders assaulting those caravans, and we could/would have to hire mercenaries to defend our caravans.
---
We all know how that went out for Fallout 4 (you build a few settlements, put up defences making them impossible to defeat, and that's it), but my hopes were renewed when they spoke about an online Fallout.
---
I wish it has really been thought off as a multiplayer game, instead of a solo online. You don't have any reasons or incentive to play with other peoples, you just happen to do so. I would LOVE a "wasteland" in which you really have to fight for water, or a contrario where water is the only thing everybody is ready to share but you need to trade steel for food, ammo for stimpak. A game in which you'd have to think longly where you'd settle your C.A.M.P. : a quiet remote place with scare resources, or a heavily passed by location with many trade opportunities but also high risks of being attacked.
---
I wish. But hey, at least I can take pictures of a player riding the mothman while doing PVP in a clown suit and buy wallpaper.
---
IF you re looking for god rolls thats gonna be rare in player vendors, youd find maybe 600caps 3 scrip at best. Anything usefull, maybe serums thats all.
---
Ahh thank you for clarifying. Tbh I don't mess with nocturnal much, haven't checked in a while. I'm kind of surprised, i feels like 6am is sunrise. But who expects guns to be able to tell time anyway?
---
I was told that MQ spray is considered poison, that’s not true?
---
for some of them the radiation even causes them to jump across the country and back in time!
---
radiation is *CrAZy!!*
---
Are we allowed to post videos with player names shown? Or I can just PM it to you
---
I was just making a point. I don't care that you're there my issue is that when high levels go and then kill everything so fast that the low levels don't get any xp from it.
---
The problem with all these delays is that there often isn’t something to fill the gap which gives the impression to some that there is update droughts. 
---
It would be nice if they are delaying something big like that to fill the gap with small east-to-build content maybe the barn update everyone’s been asking for since beta or pushing numerous skins into the world with obtain-quests like the Nuka cola paint. 
---
As always the more they kick down the road the higher the expectations will be. I hope they are calibrating for that this time around.
---
yup. super curious
---
Maybe shit is all they got. All I ever get is shit. Shit is all this game offers up sometimes
---
I saw that yesterday! Couldn’t find the cello though lol.
---
Yeah I guess this is quite relevant information in this case. Also I'm just curious.
---
Awesome post, some if that info was new to me!
---
Pretty sure it is but it still deals a shit ton of damage. Maybe it ignores armor or just deals so much damage that 75 resist isn’t enough.
---
I understand you. It makes me sad and angry. 
---
I like Fallout universe very much and it is not a nice feeling when I read posts and comments about bugs, gliches and exploits. 
---
I write my first comment because I'm tired of reading all those posts/comments from Bethesda where they say: "We are aware of this problem. Please sobmit a ticket with video clip of this exploit. We will fix it as soon as possible." 
---
It is not about this ladydevann. I know it is just a person. Employee of Bethesda. Somebody who try to survive in this cruel world just like we all.  But when I read all those answers from her/him it makes me sad and angry at the same time.
---
I believe all of this when it happens. Bethesda has a bad habit of bait-and-switch as far as I'm concerned, this is just to drum up players for a game that's failing. If Bethesda really cared they'd take a step back and fix many of the problems that are encountered every day and have been that way for months.
---
&gt; Fallout Australia
---
just normal current day Australia, but with radiation
---
The only event I one shot on is Back on the Beat. I'm not letting the robot die. Otherwise I use a lvl 35 tesla I saved. I can tag everything and not worry.
---
Even in endgame if you reach 30k max caps invest into serum recipes i already bought 5 of them over my 400 hours.
---
Something something 69 something something 420 something blaze something 4u
---
It's not about the Destination, it's about the Journey.
---
Australians cant even defeat Emus in the pre-apocalypse.
---
they could just be normal in the game and still be hard enemies
---
Hey you did it once, did it twice, and only the third time you find any problem?
---
Get a grip old man.
---
&gt; https://vimeo.com/362792761 edit: it starts out already underneath. When I go up the stairs look to see the cello neck sticking up out of the ground. For those interested, the C.A.M.P. apparatus was placed under the blank billboard that faces the Train Station
---
Ah so I am missing 1 lol
---
Dude, I hear you. I put a post up yesterday about meat week and was it worth it..most said yes but I do not. So what did I do? Well..I decided to give it several hours gameplay today. I picked up a spicy tenderizer mod, a meat week flag and meat cleaver plans..wtf!! 
---
A waste of time..killing critters,  cleaning up shit and shovelling greens..this event sucks ass.
---
or like "gazdajewls666"
---
But the Queen is an event
---
if you dont pay back loans, the thing you bought gets repo'd
---
xXx_Assblaster6969 is my guess.
---
They can simply have a pre-set list of sayings to avoid people being dicks.
---
Dude, if you used your perk points well you should have all of those by now, blame yourself.
---
“Technical debt” 😂
---
That would be funny 😂 goodbye Handmade Rifle
---
God I hope they don't add AWOL to the once an hour or half hour list. this cool down sucks so hard
---
No I've always had the problem. I just never made a thread about it, but yet once again you fail to even tell me how I should be grinding if I'm not allowed to do events or dailies since.im such a low level. Forgot that part of the game was for the level 100's and up.
---
Internet mobs are really powerful as companies are running scared by the threat of loosing advertising revenue or getting on the wrong side of social justice. These were minors so have the ultimate veto powers against adults.
---
It would be nice if my Second Helpings achievement finally popped. I completed it over 700 hours of playtime ago and it still hasn't given me credit for it. It's the only achievment that I haven't unlocked. Also, the 'catch the diseases' task is broken. It doesn't register when you catch all of the diseases. 👍
---
Better yet they send out some invincible robot hooligans to break your legs.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76 where you spend majority of your time min maxing you box till you bug a friend to mule stuff to a mule account lool
---
Naga please
---
Sigh....
---
They're fixing the cooldowns further for some events, more than the double amount previously mentioned
---
Yeah, but you're one of the good ones then, but the good majority of people I run across don't.
---
Have you been using most your points to move around SPECIALs instead of picking perk cards?
---
Also you don't have to do events back to back, there would definitely be some to skip
---
Just like in real life some people are just dicks.
---
Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean. when you level up, you get the random packs of perk cards that you can then choose from. If you don't get the cards, you don't get the perks, points don't factor in.
---
I had a prime meat event freeze as I was filling a legendary sheepsquatch with 5.56. Also annoying is the missing acid from all the cave crickets and smashy bears that came before it.
---
So true. And now we have greifers showing up and walkin in front of your bullets to engage pvp so they can kill you. Theres always somebody that wants to fuck up a good time for everybody else
---
That's why you put a snake head on a bipedal body and call it done.
---
Yes the random perks duplicates that you're getting in the packs is really enjoying I would love to have something similar to fallout 4 where when you hit a certain lvl no matter where you put your points you should be having all the perks and everything..
---
They were barely raiders, that's why it was so easy to kill them. They only cared about getting rich which is not a raider goal.
---
There's 205 perks in the game currently. You're level 251, that's either 250 (or 251 if you start at level 0 I forget now) times you picked a perk, plus an additional 50 perk packs of 4 perks each, so another 200 perks given randomly.
---
If you didn't grab perks you think are "key" that's on you.
---
Thanks for that. I totally needed more things causing poison damage.
---
You are right but when they journey is exactly like the last journey it loses its pizazz lol
---
I like that idea of the repo... not sure it would be enforceable tho...
---
Maybe if u didn’t payback the loan, you would have to pay a late charge to the “loaner” say 100 caps a day late. Also caps would be automatically deducted 1 week after being late at the rate of 50% of your caps per day until u repaid the debt...
---
Not if they pop up as fast as primal cuts event
---
Perk cards have a level requirements. Once you hit that level requirement it is given to you as an option to pick. By now you should have all the perks you need.
---
While I was reading this I was thinking the same thing. Some gangsters robots will come break your knees.
---
Liberty prime says..engage pacifist mode
---
Accidentally played on the same server for 4 hours yesterday doing primal cuts back to back to back to back to back to back....
---
So what are you spending your level ups on? You chose a spesific card when you level up or you can chose to move a special point.
---
Perk card packs are every 5 levels.
---
O I'm confused to what you are spending all the other level ups on.
---
Meat week is totally worth it if you are a merchant.
---
Don't put words in my mouth.
---
I did not say you cannot do dailies or events.
---
I'd make it clear, if you find yourself incompetent in lvl35, it's normal, and there is nothing to complain about.
---
You can still complete events as events awards you with stuff as long as you are there.
---
But if you can't even touch any mobs, it's because you are sub par, and that's about it.
---
Yeah pretty suspicious he left that out. Probably earned the name change lol
---
Yeah its completely max budget sadly.
---
I really chalk it up to poor parents, kids need to be taught online safety and responsibilities. But instead are given a tablet to entertain themselves
---
They said all public events would pop twice as fast. Then they said yesterday that some events would be tweaked further. but I think some (Free Range, maybe others) that should pop like Primal Cuts
---
Well thats dumb. When people say men they do not always mean men. Its attacking obviously neutral statements gender specifics that make people who don't understand lgbtq  not want to support it and why so many men are getting upset about aggressive feminist movements instead of empathizing. 
---
Im not saying this because im upset with you, im saying this because you need to understand.
---
It was Mexican joker.
---
Yeah never been attacked up here no need for any defense. An thanks!
---
You can also pick cards. Freely. You know, like every level over lvl 50.
---
This would make for some game breaking builds and would make some power armor mods useless.
---
Imagine someone in power armor sneaking around in full camelion armor. Or someone with 3 times the carry weight they should have. People stacking strength armor would make melee over powered again.
---
It is dying. Its got a die hard fanbase like sc2 but its dwindling. Wastelanders will help that. It is dying though.
---
Dude are you talking about Nuclear Winter? If so you should specify in the title or your passage.
---
And we even have a new system now in Nuclear Winter which is retroactive, I don't really understand your point.
---
I don't know about chems or bobbleheads, but charisma provided by unyielding armor used to allow sharing greater perk cards. My bloodied character has a charisma of 4, and regularly shared level 3 cards, though sharing would stop if I unequipped the unyielding armor (e.g. jumped into power armor). I haven't checked recently. Maybe it has changed.
---
Your right I am sub par. When it comes to a level 300 and it shooting rockets at the shit before I have time to even shoot them. Me complaining that it's taking xp from everyone else doesn't make me sub par, but it surely shows that your intelligence is.
---
The co-op content doesn’t need to be dungeons or raids, BUT I need more PVE togetherness content.
---
It's a terrible legendary effect that makes the gun worse than a vanilla version. Lower than base damage during the day.
---
When you level up you get to choose from the cards that are unlocked for that level. They should all be unlocked for you when you get to pick a card UNLESS you've been hoarding level-ups, in which case it will only show cards that unlocked at that level or lower.
---
Start using your hoarded level-ups and they'll show up.
---
Sounds like you got hacked.
---
As I said, you can shot them first, if your reflexes are too slow, or your damage is too low, then you fail because you are sub par.
---
I don't think that should be the case. As you mentioned on the original post, you can't even find no time to launch encrypted. And I've never seen anyone launch nukes today. That's what happens when events with some amount of rewards pop too often. People just do events and nothing more. What a boring game
---
Isn't stuff underground? 
---
Well that's whatvis assumed anyway because I see parts busted open inside fillies in with dirt and rubble and even a truck at some point
---
..and by difficulty; the payout is based upon what region the event occurs in. The bog pays out better than the forest, with all the other regions in between. The only quirk is that the savage divide is worse and the Ash Heap is better than one would expect based upon difficulty.
---
Only if I see them first, but when I don't have frog legs or a jet pack then I'm at a disadvantage. I can only see so much from the ground and they see a whole lot more while on top of building or lamp posts.
---
I'm not being a smart ass here but, If you fire a tesla, and that arc bounces everywhere, then why should it NOT effect eveything, inc other players ?
---
Yeah I have one mounted on the wall by the fireplace and it looks cool but every time I get close to stash cap I find myself thinking this exact thing.
---
I think part of it *is* supposed to be underground, but it wouldn't surprise me if they stuck interior windows on those bits.  Even taken individually, the buildings don't even try to line up with their exterior versions.
---
Totally exploitable. Alternate accounts pulling loans. Money gets funneled to the main. Delete alts and repeat.
---
Yes, it's been shared a few times, but I'm sure lots of people still haven't gotten the word. The earliest posts I saw was here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d4835l/dailies\_are\_awarding\_scrip/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d4835l/dailies_are_awarding_scrip/) 
---
This later post has a breakdown of every event:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5a1rx/daily\_quests\_now\_give\_scrip/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5a1rx/daily_quests_now_give_scrip/)
---
the hook is primal cuts.. not the cookout itself
---
camps at primal cuts are a fucking drag...
---
Yes and, perhaps, no.  Once I had my own high capacity backpack mod, I used my next 8 badges to purchase another, which I sold via player vending fairly quickly and for a very nice profit.  Then I started collecting new badges with the intent on doing this again.  However, this took a little longer than expected due to the glitch where dailies weren't awarding badges for a while.  Once I *did* have 8 more, however, I returned to the machine only to find the high-capacity mod was no longer listed.  So I'm wondering if one of the patches changed it to where you can no longer purchase the plans if you have already learned the plans.
---
It’s honestly *more* lore friendly than all the sparkly clean suburban homes that everybody builds.
---
I saw a literal toddler staring at a phone recently. I know every generation looks down on the entertainment of later children, but it doesn't seem like it's going to do them any favours.
---
Take Primal Cuts as an example, there are map markers, stay ahead at one direction and vats them, or just shoot, and you can always get a few shots.
---
Or Uranium Fever, just camp the spawn spots, and you can always get some shots.
---
I just don't understand how you can be so slow to see them.
---
Kids shouldn't be playing at all, but this sort of behaviour isn't acceptable. Did you get their names? Go throw a fit at Xbox until they improve.
---
I just got the quad automatic Tesla from the purveyor and it’s flippin’ awesome! Yes it arcs but I don’t see any damage going to anyone else (yet)...
---
Last night's play session had two cook outs, six primal cuts, an Encryptid, two AWOL Armaments, a Project Paradise and a Scorched Earth. Plus some rewarding stuff my group didn't go to, like Monster Mash, Uranium Fever, and Line in the Sand. I think it's important now that a player's play session feels full. The game feels boring when you have nothing to do but explore the same places over and over for legendaries
---
I never understood the popularity.  Yeah, 3 guaranteed legendary weapons, but they're always underleveled at 35 or 40.  Now if the supervisors where level 50 it would be worth it, but alas, 40 is as good as mole miners get.
---
No. This is a ridiculous request to say the least.
---
Definitely one for the scrip machines!
---
No, that's way too overpowered and makes no sense. You are encased in something that is on par or stronger than most armor in the game and don't have to worry about other things like rads.
---
There are cost/benefits of both.
---
What you need to do is just step out of the PA and only use it for specialized stuff.
---
As an addendum, this game should feel like a buffet and not a small course meal at a 5 star restaurant
---
I saw an idea a while ago that said the mr fuzzy ride should take a cap from the person riding it and give it to the camp owner. Add a "ride Mr Fuzzy if you liked my camp" sign and that'd be a neat way to show appreciation
---
I think what happens (if you already checked your pipboy and turned on the quest again) is that certain quests are "stuck" to a server. Meaning that if you quit or get dropped you will have to wait for that server to shut down. I've had it once but from talking to people at the worst you can try it again tomorrow.
---
And do check pipboy. Often quests get un checked so they are still there and still able to be done you just have zero markers on map or compass.
---
well, thats what i thought at first, but at the inside, you can see 2+ stories the whole way through and on the outside, theres only the first storie and even that isnt visible between the dmv and the rest, so there might not even be that
---
I still do what one person suggested on this sub a while ago; if I really like someone's camp but they don't have anything I'm interested in buying, I'll buy one single piece of ammunition.
---
Let's be real though teenagers have been acting stupid since the dawn of time. Technology just gives them a wider audience and the chance to have their dumbassery documented and archived.
---
https://i.imgur.com/qyqaZ3u.jpg
---
Oooh. I haven’t checked since the update... 
---
yeah I already have mine and want to sell my next one. How much you sell yours for?
---
Under the roads in the bog?
---
Learn to prioritize.
---
There is no build, really. I do have general pvp HW perks, EmProtocols Strangler PA with extra hotkeyed xo1 stealthboy torso, some nice weapons (E25, VE and such), use a lot of chems...
---
I'd say good/ strategic positioning, general awareness and playing smart (along with sufficient firepower) is the key.
---
To be fair, the "winter" aspect of a theoretical nuclear winter is caused by clouds of ash and dust blocking out sunlight for prolonged periods of time. With no sun, the majority of reptiles and other cold-blooded species would face extinction (see: the dinosaurs). Deathclaws are an exception because I believe the lore mentions they were genetically engineered post-war.
---
Already discussed in another comment. Some events only form of participation is DPS.
---
From what I understand that isn't possible.  As a compromise I suggest letting us save up to 5 camps. Give us the ability to sort them in a load order. Then when we join a server place the first camp that can be placed.  It should be very rare to have 5 unplaceable camps
---
I would be happy if the in game atom achievements worked properly.  I still do not have have the kill large creatures goal completed due to the SQB bug.  twice I know I struck the last blow on the queen since it was only myself and a friend at the event.  He backed off and worked on mobs while I went after the queen with my meat hook.  Still no achievement.
---
wut
---
I took mine, added the salty mod, and hung it on my wall with metal letters spelling the name "Old Salty".
---
Otherwise... no, not really.
---
It's not that I am slow. You do realize that those markers show for everyone right and not just me. When the creatures spawn a ways off and if the higher levels are on something they see them and can shoot them before I do. 
---
It honestly amazes me how dim you are how and how you don't get that I'm not the only one at the event. All those things you mentioned everyone else does especially the high levels. Were you dropped on the head as a child is that why your so slow at realising this?
---
If they used a credit that couldn't be dropped or traded it would work. You wouldn't be able to funnel the funds to an alt. It could get taken from your player weekly, with a working credit score lol. Also possoble to take you into minus rendering you unable to purchase anything for caps and if someone bought something off you while you were at a minus then it would immediately go to Bethesda.
---
Pretty fun idea you got pal. I like. 👍👌
---
Deathclaws that developed feathery plumage hunting us in large unexpected groups
---
Just everyone sell 38 ammo for 1 cap so people can say thanks by giving you money for worthless 38
---
That is just the silliest request i have ever seen in this sub.
---
Yeah it's gonna be fun for the first few days. Imagine having to do that for the entirety of the gameplay. Doing events over and over for months. Nothing else matters cause nothing rewards you more than AWOL and uranium fever and stuff. What's gonna motivate people to launch nukes or doing dailies then? Why take over workshops? Why do raids when doing events over and over is so much rewarding?
---
I just don't want it to accidentally trigger an attack on a neutral player. I get the semantics there, but it behaving like that means we can't use it around anyone. Which limits its usability.
---
I love lore videos, will definitely watch this one.
---
You don't have to do the events though
---
PA needs some love but not like that.  All it would do is force everyone to use PA 24/7 and many of us don't like PA.
---
Great video! the first part of his manifesto was part 6, so I was quite confused as to why he was "injecting his formula" into the mill, but this video explained it really well and was quite interesting! I look forward to any new videos you may create!
---
Check out WeDontPlay187's reply
---
You okay, buddy?
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
&gt;Could you imagine if they interviewed someone from QA?
---
"Hey Dylan could you pretend to be from QA for a video we're doing?"
---
By any chance do you plan to do Vault 94 lore video? I've tried few times to collect holotapes, read some terminals, but that's not easy during raids, even on the Novice.
---
Always thought it was funny that you have to strip naked to get into PA...lol
---
that's guaranteed scrip tho
---
I ran into the same issue, part 6 is what I found first. Found parts 1 and 2 next, but didn’t connect them in my head until I found 3-5. It’s a well tied together story when you have all 6. Thanks for watching
---
This will probably get downvoted but I'm really happy they didn't do it this time too. I play since the official release and *never* moved my camp out of the forest since I placed it there for the first time. It since became my second (virtual) home and if they had done this it would all be gone because it's build right by the forest prime meat location. My outer fence is nearly touching the barrel that starts the event.
---
It sucks I know but I wouldn't move my beloved camp even if it would prevent starting the event. I put so many hours of work and fine tuning into it that would be lost. I would get rid of my turrets if they would steal the other players kills tho but luckily there is just one and the enemies usually just run past it.
---
I've been running it automatic and it works pretty well.
---
with pacifist on you can shoot right through other players
---
I haven’t played this game in about 4 months, is this game anymore exciting? Got sick of the same
---
Boring quests and farming materials for ammo
---
Last time there was an invisible (actually it was blue but wasn't directly visible) perimeter around Grahm and the event. Is that not there this time?
---
&gt;Strangler PA 
---
Do you have the acid mod? I watched a video of player slaying with it. Guess I'll run some raids now.
---
Had this happen in Overwatch, because my team didn't agree with my picks, so the 5 man premade group reported my name as offensive.
---
I even raised a Ticket on it, to no avail.
---
My name is easily less offensive than kiddie TV on a Sunday morning.
---
Considering that game has 40mio active players, I find it sickening that 5 random douchenozzles can force me to change a name, that might be a vital part of my online identity.
---
I remember my first time. A lot of confusion, frustration, aimless struggle and borderline crying. But when it finally happened and I got the enjoy the explosion and afterglow it realized it was all worth it.
---
Could you imagine how much easier this would be for transferring caps between characters? I mean you'd still need a trustworthy friend, but you wouldn't have to go through a trade menu that has the possibility of glitching out.
---
The fact that you keep stating you can be faster than them shows how weak you are as a player lol
---
It's not that I am dim, it's that you are weak.
---
I personally never noticed much difference in the difficulties of the different silos. When I'm launching nukes I tend to hit silo Charlie first since it's closer to my camp. I'm going to have to do some experimenting now to see if there is a difference in difficulty between them
---
Werent doing anything, just checked our inventory and noticed it had changed.
---
It's not really guaranteed if you have to try to land a shot before twelve other bloodied yahoos. I'd rather do AWOL armaments. Or hell, a sheepsquatch in Free Range is more fun.
---
I’m starting to wonder if Prime Cuts is worthwhile? I mean, you gotta do two events to get enough meat for **one** scrip. 
---
In two events I burn through quite a bit of ammo and weapon condition, my armor takes a beating since it’s impossible to sneak (which also costs damage bonuses so even more ammo is dumped), and half the time there’s not even a legendary at the end. That’s a lot of time and resources devoted to getting 1/3 the scrip of a 1* wooden left leg.
---
I agree, I feel like a hypocrite but I seriously think too much screen time that young can be really bad for their mental growth.
---
I want to, but it’s going to take a lot of prep. I have a series of videos I call “Surveyal” (Archival Survey) where I capture what the sites look throughout development as the world will change and I want a record of what it looks like at every point. I captured the exterior before and after the patch that added the raid. I tried to solo 94 the first week to make a video on the site, but was not prepared with enough ammo and fusion cores so I had to bow out. Once I’m prepared thoroughly I’ll make a video on all three quests.
---
I knew someone could come up with a complicated system to try to avoid exploitation which could eventually work after a few patches. 
---
Can we just let Aunt Beth fix some game breaking bugs first?
---
I do wish you punctuated this with a Yeah Science, bitch!
---
But good points in all seriousness.
---
I don't think that's what they meant at all. They were talking about stash size, rather than stash boxes. Stash size causes server performance to drop in most cases according to Bethesda. That's why it takes a while to add because it needs optimized so it does not affect performance.
---
I'd love this.  There's so many times I buy random crap I don't need because I like a CAMP and want to say so.
---
Yeah, all those 2 and 3 star legendary dangerous primal beasts we killed last night were totally not worth it.  Extra scrip from prime meat turn in? Who needs it.  And only leveling 4 times in an evening is garbage too.  What am I level 100?  Meat week is such a let down.  /s 🙄
---
Thx, I'll add you to subscribed and will wait for other lore videos, good luck.
---
This.  After grinding Primal Cuts for a few hours yesterday... I had the same epiphany.  What am I doing!?!
---
Those people deserve a medal
---
That seems perfectly reasonable an understandable, it is the real selfish douche bags that know exactly what they are doing and do it for that reason, for the lulz just to annoy everyone that a perimeter restriction would help prevent. Just don't place a full quota of turrets :)
---
OP is talking about the prime meat locations that randomly start an event every 15 minutes. What you are talking about is the meat week location near the vault.
---
It’s hard to make a video of something that doesn’t work. 
---
Shocked how many people are giving this the thumbs up without actually trying to duplicate it. 
---
The OP is incorrect. The lights don’t work.
---
Tip jar idea is genius!
---
I don't give a damn about events. I care about legendary drops. And if those events reward you with legendaries, I will have to do it every time it pops up.
---
So, I never played the Nuka World DLC which means I was fully unprepared for a cave cricket. To me, those are some of the most horrifying creatures I've ever seen and I will honestly avoid known areas they inhabit or go the other way if I notice I am coming upon them. Not because they're difficult, but because they creep me out so much.
---
And that's just a cricket. A big spider? ...............I can't even
---
OP is referring to the Prime Cut events not Grahm's bash
---
It's not about being fast. It's who sees it first and if the high level with super weapons sees it first then it doesn't matter how fast I am. 
---
The fact that you fail to realise that is what makes you dim.
---
That would be wild.
---
that would be about right. need to be carefull where you chuck grenades as well.
---
Not looking for god rolls, Ive come to the conclusion that the likelihood of me landing a BE RW Gatling Plasma or a BE RW Handmade is whatever is than a "slim to none" chance.
---
I just want something worthwhile. And having to spend caps on serum recipe is just so depressing since the return on the serums themselves are so low.
---
Oki. Bye now.
---
Oh, its you again. Let the complaining commence.
---
Maybe? We have no idea what the story will be
---
It’s hard to make a video of something that doesn’t work the way they said it did.
---
Shocked how many people are giving this the thumbs up without actually trying to duplicate it.
---
I wouldn’t waste scrip on them
---
Maybe they should take away the guaranteed legendary spawns then
---
Same happened to me on Xbox,
---
although your username has to be against the community guidelines which my username was “CookiesCreampie”  now I’m JollyBunny with a bunch of numbers
---
BL3 has plenty of issues, my brother. Especially if you’re in PC. Look at their reddit and “lost loot from bank”, cloud issues that lose characters and character progression, frame rates in split screen, broken OP items and farming techniques (most of these seem corrected now), etc.
---
I’m playing BL3 now too. Few will ever reach the insane broken-ness FO76 has/had but it’s my all time favorite and most enjoyable train wreck to date.
---
No tag required was listed to release Q1 of 2020 so its going to be a long time till we see but would like it to include AWOL.
---
And...........
---
Its because BL3 is practically a cartoon. If you can't make a cartoon work then you suck.
---
Fallout is miles better, people know it. I have plenty of mates who started playing BL3 when it came out and have now come back to what they know is best.
---
The vault raids give special loot. The effect in the PA seems fantastic and I've seen the effect on solar. It is great as well, but the thorn set is very meh
---
They do require a good group to run, but lately they have been the only reason I get on. And I am very excited for the next set of raids so there is more to stay on for
---
Snack Sabbath is a good name
---
There was a bug that would allow you to do this at release but they fixed it because, as others have said, it makes for seriously broken builds. It would be nice if they made it possible to wear your armour under a hazmat suit so you could survive a nuke zone without using power armor or switching your armour for a hazmat suit though
---
That's awesome.
---
No, it'd make PA obligatory, while I don't like it that much to use almost all the time.
---
Oh and "Fallout Rules!!" 🤘🤘
---
How cannot you see them first, are you blind?
---
Camp at one spawn and you will always be the one that sees them first, then it's just you reflex.
---
The fact that you don't understand this shows how weaker you are.
---
Oh I can't see them I am blind the game sucks etc etc. You are a very funny and typical whiner.
---
That could be an idea. Or just make them spawn less so we won't have to bother in the first place.
---
Best way would be killing supermutants
---
You waited three months to drop a nuke? No wonder why there is so many damn bats still flying around.
---
JK, I hit the 3ish month mark to when I launched my first nuclearness.
---
Okay, can we pick some different terminology for that? I did it solo the first time.
---
All I see when I read that is, person who one shots everything expect to get better loot.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Thanks man
---
At least at QuakeCon the devs did stress that NPCs will "fully infest the map" - their words. However I have the impression that important ones that are killable will be inside the instanced areas like what I assume the Crash Spaced Station will become.
---
Good point. I only use it in Nuke Zones, so I really miss my Chameleon armor when I’m in PA. But you make a good point. Also, this would drive up the need for fusion cores, so there’s that, too. 
---
Maybe a better solution would be more mods for PA to keep some of those good effects. Love the feedback from this community!
---
Stop doing this. Your making borderlands fans look bad and your being an asshole.
---
Actually my camp is even helping other players especially those on lower levels as the fence I was talking about is a perfect protection from the yao guais and death claw. The npcs need to go all the way around it to get to the player and if they make it you just jump over it and they need to go all the way back :D
---
These are two of my biggest complaints with the game. Camp budget and stash limit. Im not coming back to the game until both are increased significantly.
---
Ok so the game is that good you thought you’d just pop by and say that. If I was enjoying a game that much, I wouldn’t be thinking about the last game I’d played.
---
This is why I always have 1 cap beverages in my vending machines stop by for a cold one anytime!
---
And once again you fail to realise that if I camp one spot killing monsters then everyone moves there. People aren't going to just sit back and let me kill everything and not get any xp. I know I've done it.
---
But as I've stated your apparently too dim to even comprehend simple conclusions such as that.
---
I’d say minimally that stash could reflect your perk cards played so junk could see a 90% reduction if played as well as ammo and chem weight reduction and also weapons. 
---
CAMP budget should increase but not size. I like a lot of the stuff in the Atomic Shop and don’t get it due to not being able to place it due to budget.
---
I'm only doing for Primal Cuts/scrip, ngl the actual Meat Week event is pretty dead gameplay wise imo. Just tap A and watch your character repeat the same animation for 5 mins...
---
It's not viable. The SPECIAL layout doesn't make sense for the perk cards chosen.
---
What's the idea for the character? I think with some more details and your plan people here could help you.
---
But no. That is not viable at the moment for anything but general playing around with the game.
---
Wow that's cool, i had no idea, i will try asap :D
---
Yeah, if you notice they're constantly nerfing our legendary spawns so maybe this is just the next logical step to that. Plans are the big draw for completing events anyway. That and getting resources. They can keep the non-legendary weapons and armor though lol
---
Most of the time weight problems can be addressed with simple change that allow backpack to work when using PA.
---
Most games do that over a years time. Especially when people come back and still get frozen and blue screen. i thought most was fixed when i cam back after a good time not playing.
---
I mean I'll probably pop in every now and then to see if it's any better after updates like I have been doing (and it hasn't been, really) but yeah, it's definitely not really worth checking on, all things considered. Shame really, I've had a lot of fun with it up until the last couple updates.
---
West Valley lumber... kill all the super mutants and they respawn pretty quickly and low level.
---
Getting that from the feedback to the request. Appreciate your thoughtful analysis (much better than just saying it’s a “ridiculous request,” which doesn’t really help for any learning to occur!!
---
A very good point, upon further reflection I also realised that npcs can already appear in game such as the insult bot and the Charleston robot vendor, but I’m not sure how scaleable that will be. Either way I’m excited for wastelanders and I think every 76 player should be
---
It sucks when you get that one asshole who one shots everything, but I've had groups of as many as eight that have been extremely courteous and basically tap the legendaries then leave them alive for everyone else to get a hit in.
---
Yeesh. Racist.
---
Grahm is the best. How dare you!
---
If they would have just did “more Fallout 4” and released Fallout 5, instead of trying something new and different, it would have less bugs too. Not one person will tell you Fallout 76 is perfect. It has flaws, but we have fun playing it. 
---
Why do you keep coming back and wasting your life complaining about a game you hate to a community that doesn’t seem to like you much? Do you need attention that bad?
---
If so, here’s your one attention from me today. 😂
---
I would buy this. Good suggestion. It could be like the bird one; the vault cog door as a pattern and every so often a little human silhouette coming out.
---
Yeah it should be implemented to all events. Would be interesting to see if it could be implemented to all events like Hordes too. Good idea, don't necessarily have to make those public, just the legendaries haha
---
The biggest thing they could do that would free up stash space for me would be to increase or remove the scrip limit.
---
^This
---
Same man I'm fucking pumped! Gunna be like a whole new game, and what it also means for future content is even more exciting.
---
We need some answers
---
He left it out for his image. Msoft won’t do shit against a clean name
---
Would be atomic shop obviously 😭 but imagine if Bethesda made some effort.. the cool hot tub time machine mini quest to obtain this camp item would’ve been awesome!
---
Absolutely
---
My camp was there first.  I remove a wall and floor so the barrel is showing.
---
PS4 here.  Played on the same server for 3 1/2 hours last night chain running meat week events.  Finally blue screened right before I logged cause I opened a trade window with the purveyor to dump some scrip to make room for more.  Figures its the simple trading with an AI vendor and not the hectic combat with 6 to 8 players and countless mobs that crashed me lol
---
The suitcase near the vendor in Watoga's train station is a common spot for people coming from the SBQ event. The trash can outside the Purveyor's train station also occasionally has some, as do other containers near other train station vendors.
---
Thing is, those will disappear after a while or if the server crashes. Adding donation boxes would let people throw a few caps at awesome CAMPs and encourage more people to build them and allow ammo dumping that can remain persistent across server crashes and logouts/logins for the donation box's owner.
---
Ok. I’ll see if that works.
---
You can go ahead and buy my “Plan: Metal Bed”
---
Ha! That would be an awesome build...lol
---
Does this prevent the event from starting?
---
That scrip is gonna come in handy next week for the sales legendary vendor. Plus you can make good caps on the event exclusive items
---
Go to feed the people, the reward is a consumable that gives you +5% experience for 1 hour. Get lone wanderer (extra XP when alone) or Inspriational (extra XP in a group). Go to any public event available to you. Another great method is defending workshops, but you need to remember other players can contest your workshop and engage in PvP. But there are some workshops in low level areas or with subpar resources that aren't as highly contested and you'd be fairly safe taking them.
---
I need this for my vault clinic CAMP, currently just using the blue one
---
1) Take out loan on Alt
---
2) Buy Ammo 
---
3) Drop Ammo for Main
---
4) Profit
---
There is no way to avoid exploiting this with mule characters.  You would have to disable the ability to drop items or place items in containers while indebted.  That would obviously be game breaking.
---
And you do realise people move around right? Not everyone likes to sit back and camp. Just because you do doesn't mean everyone else does. 
---
You failing to realise that people don't play like you is why I'm calling you dim.
---
The thread was about me asking for shared experience during events and all you did was show how little intelligence you had.
---
Oh yea. I forgot daily's now give loads of exp.
---
They haven't said anything in a while so I don't think they intend to. 
---
With camp budget they never really increased it. They just partitioned lights and turrets away from other items which made it seem like they increased it. Seeing as that is how they are going about it I don't see an increase happening. 
---
I wish the would do the same trick with inventory. Weapons and armor I can see taking up a lot of data but I don't see food, junk and ammo doing so. The weight limits there are somewhat arbitrary, so if they were to give us separate inventory capacities for those items, an increase shouldn't break the game.
---
Ghouls seem to be harder, and with the massive drop in legendaries it just doesn't have the same usefulness. WS was never a fun grind, but it paid well enough.
---
Sell everything off until you're under 100 of most things, bulk the junk together and sell it. You won't be able to bulk some of the stuff, like fiberglass spools and raw asbestos, but you can still sell them as is.
---
Since cranberry bog is one of two places where you get 5 primal meats, why is that place alway less popular than the one near pleasent valley train station, which only gives 4?
---
Shotgun is useless. Probably just scrip it or sell for caps at your vendor.
---
The other two are nice. People would probably buy them.
---
Yeah I was super happy. I had a long day at work so I didn't get to play too much, bit I did manage to get all of them done pretty easily except for the rubber scrap one which I didn't finish before heading to bed.
---
Use it to scoop Chally's droppings.
---
Honestly 76 seems to be bring back a lot of the classics, could be possible, they’re also adding the floaters from the interplay games or whatever they’re called (haven’t played the original fallouts in probably a decade) in wastelanders
---
Yeah I did it twice last night and didn't get any either.
---
Shotguns were nerf hard gotta be really close to targets unless you're using combat shotty. The handmade is worth keeping as for the gauss not so sure
---
That’s not a fissure......
---
There is no other server, there aren't enough people to open a second server.
---
(There's probably some region divisions, you may not be on the *only* survival server, but probably the only one for the area you're playing in).
---
Yeah that's true didn't even think about it.
---
Have you tried another game mode to see if that will reset it?
---
Gotcha. Thanks.
---
Show us the goods, what’s your build. It’s hard to give constructive criticism without it. I recently did away with my quality of life perks... 3x traveling pharmacy and 3x thru-hiker... after getting some good feedback here.
---
Ya last meat weak I had tons of legendaries.
---
We're all going to have to start a gang.
---
if you're specifically referring to Grahm &amp; meat week, i think he resets his inventory every cookout without server hopping. i'm not positive on this but it might be the case. otherwise, you'll have to server hop -- server hopping to the same server works. i've done this with friends &amp; the travelling vendor bot.
---
I invested 4 points into 1 handed and I regret it.
---
Ive wondered that myself, you figure they coulf have at least made a song with all the instruments playing. Rather than the random notes and chords
---
I hate PA, I'd rather be able to wear a Hazmat on top of my armor, instead of some other costume.
---
That's mainly what I've been doing but with 1 handed. I'll definitely take note of the top of the world tho. I just got there in the main quest line
---
I’d play this
---
&gt;You wouldn't be able to funnel the funds to an alt.
---
So not buying from a player vendor? .)
---
Did you just compare a real life tragedy to a fictional story? What’s wrong with you?
---
Much like Home Defense unlocks other turret options, a ranked framing perk card could unlock less common crops. And bees. We should be able to keep bees to produce honey.
---
I like these ideas, btw. I don't farm much in the game, but I can see the appeal.
---
I don't play the game much or often, but the other day a dude turned me into a pile of green goo through lvl 50 T51b power armor set and full hp before I could turn around to face him.
---
Thought it was a hacker or something, good to know it's shitty game balance instead.
---
I think something that would help out with this is removing displayed items from the camp budget.  Not to mention items in vendors not taking up stash limit.
---
that guy is a douche
---
PA if 76 is just a vehicle. It’ll get places but can’t do much else. Paint it , set it up and make it look pretty. That’s not to say it can useful or do good things. The end of the day non PA users have it better. Solely due to them having access to their legendary armour. 
---
If nothing else it’s kinda odd but it does help with mindset and understanding human nature in battle. 
---
Give Sun Tzu’s The Art of War a read/listen. It may be a video game but some of the stuff does correlate well.
---
actually, i'm not sure if it's still available in the atom shop. not sure if it's possible, but if you're on xb, i can make one for you. 
---
another idea for you is to display video games. it'll be tough to tell what they are because they show up so small in the display case but it's a suggestion.
---
I’m on PS4. If anyone needs to revive an ally, I’m happy to jump from a bridge for you!  Just shoot me a message.  dixiemomma1577 is my PSN.
---
Almost all the OP nonsense outside Tesla's is down to Bloodied Weapons and the Adrenal Rush Mutation. Balance those and an awful lot changes. Yes Unyielding is also powerful, but only because it combo's so well with those two.
---
I vote a big fat no to making AWOL public. I had it all to myself last night and 3 sweet 3\* legendary gutsys. It was wonderful.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cv0w6o/is_it_possible_to_beat_the_raid_solo/ey189yp/
---
Is it something you should keep? I think i ditched mine
---
You are underweight but need more stash?
---
Rewards should be split based on overall participation. Being a dick and killing everything instantly definitely should not yield a higher reward tier. The same goes for someone that hides in a corner and does nothing.
---
I wonder how they will approach the issue of tagging legendary enemies. It doesn’t seem fair for someone to go afk during the event, come back and collect the same loot as someone who spent resources like ammo, steel, etc by shooting at things and repairing machines.
---
;) saving it for my son.  He will love wasting scorched with a shovel.
---
Server hop for wood? No. Lame.
---
I remember to kill bots when I arrive at Watoga and I pick up whatever wood I see along my journeys. Oh hell no. Nooo, no no.
---
Ok, exploit the repair kit.... Oh wait you can't. If it was a system like the repair kit then it woukd work.
---
For example a loan of a thousand caps in the form of a piece of paoer, almost like a junk shipment like on fallout 4, but if dropped it disappears, it cant be traded either.
---
Also make sure you slap the prime receiver on it. It is probably the most efficient ultracite ammo to make.
---
And the durability is way better than it used to be, where I had to carry six of them because they broke after going through two plasma cores.
---
Agreed, it’s becoming irritating to try and find the icon for popular events.
---
I have the same problem at camps and popular map locations.
---
While I would love to be able to do this, I think it'd be too op.  Not to mention we now have legendary PA from the Vault raid.
---
You used to just tap the esc key twice when the screen went black. I don't think it works anymore. If there's a new trick, I don't know it.
---
Thank you for the report and sorry you're having so much trouble! Sent you a PM requesting account info and your Support Ticket #.
---
Yeh... Thats not what i said really..
---
I'm not that into Meat Week. I wasn't last time, and still not this time.
---
The rewards aren't very interesting to me, and it's very grind-y to get them. I already grind for caps and legendaries....I'll stick with trying to get Possum badges if I need more of that experience. I'm happy that it appeals to a bunch of other players though. Different strokes for diff'rent folks, right?
---
He was definitely vain prior to his brother’s death. I think he was probably always on the edge, and Billy’s death pushed him over. 
---
I get wanting justice for the wrongdoing, but what he did is inexcusable. It’s not even a cruel, but targeted revenge, it’s indiscriminate lashing out at everyone.
---
Yup 100%
---
I saw one for 25k and assumed it moved as well. That was when backpacks first came out.
---
Unfortunately the Gatling plasma just burns through condition. As the others said, you can help it a bit with Gunsmith 5* so it doesn't break as fast and Weapon Artisan 3* for repairs to get it to 200% condition. And keeping repair kits on you is handy. My BE gatling plasma breaks halfway through a SBQ fight EVERY TIME lol
---
Thanks for the reports on this. We'll investigate!
---
Basically this.  Every time I get something in the shop, I have to remove something else from my CAMP.  
---
Let's not even discuss the display cases.  I had to demolish one whole portion of my CAMP just for a magazine rack.
---
Don't use power armor. Seriously, it's trash. I have more defense than power armor in my scout armor, AND I get to have legendary effects that pa doesn't.
---
thats what i did, and i miss the spent plastic already lol
---
Your loss. I've got one star instagating lever action, and vampires combat knife. I'd say those are both very worth it! I barely need to bother checking medical containers.. and scrip isn't really that difficult to get.. it's only video game currency.. 🤑spend it! lol
---
Ok? So again... if you hve so much extra weight on your character... why do you need more stash? Just carry more on your person.
---
Thats not very kill, laugh, love of you. Perhaps Graham just doesn't like your attitude and didn't invite you to his cookout.
---
No. I am not. But the other person said they have so much extra carry weight on their person so clearly they don’t need additional stash... they can carry more on their person.
---
Applies to pvp in adventure as well. Turn your damage indicators on you will never hit for more than 110 no matter what weapon/build/whatever you use. That is why faster fire rate is the meta.
---
So now Bethesda will implement special vendor transactions as follows:
---
1) Player A kills a Mole Miner and pickup a Combat Shotgun
---
2) Player A sells Combat Shotgun to Vendor
---
3) Player B decides to buy Combat Shotgun from Vendor, but has no Caps
---
4) Server deletes instance of Combat Shotgun and copies its stats to Loaned Combat Shotgun with No-Drop flag
---
5) Player B mods Loaned Combat Shotgun
---
6) Player B earns enough caps to payoff debt
---
7) Server deletes instance of modified Loaned Combat Shotgun and replaces with properly modded Combat Shotgun
---
Alternately all items in game world that could be purchased from a vendor are updated with a No-Drop Loaner flag.  This includes editing all items ever acquired by players to date to apply said flag (default set to False of course).
---
Does any of that complexity, in conjunction with this games track record of bugs, seem remotely worth the effort?
---
How about if somebody wants to buy something, they just go grind out the Caps?
---
Some events it does. Exp should be earned, not given to people hiding in the corner not contributing.
---
I never worry. Now that is a lie.
---
I also noticed that it only happened when i went to NW first.  but if you just log into adventure mode first (idk if checking the challenges matters, but i do), then you go go and do NW.  they dont have to be completed first
---
🙄 better to spend on a 2-3 star. I’ve found better than that in the game without wasting scrip
---
It's kinda sad that the fanmade Fallout MMOs make more sense than the official one in regards to power armor
---
Hi! Sorry you're having trouble with this quest. If you haven't already, can you please [submit a ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) to our Customer Support team? They should be able to help reset your quest so you can get back on track.
---
I'm going to test this tonight and check.  but im confident that you dont receive the atoms.
---
Meh. It's ok I guess. The Primal Cuts event is good for grinding, but not exactly a big challenge. Good for a couple of Legendaries too. Also the scrip is nice I guess. But the cook out event itself isn't very interesting. I am very happy that travelling to the events is free now, otherwise I wouldn't bother. The rewards are ok, I guess.
---
I've got a mutants lightweight that does the same thing. I feel your pain
---
Damn it! Worth a shot 😂
---
Lol spot on!
---
They used to be separate buildings but then Bethesda redesigned a while back to make it easier to do Recruitment Blues, and, well, they fucked up a bit, I guess.
---
People seem to be expecting Wastelanders to do a lot of things, so I bet, when no increase in camp budget materialises there, reality is going to hit home for a fair few people.
---
True*. My theory for early on though, is you have less scrip. 1 stars are cheaper, so I just get those until I'm high enough level to look for something 3 star/ really good. Everybody has their own right answer.. lol
---
Sometimes I build stuff that I have that they don't have. Like, I'll add a basketball hoop.. .a Nuka Cola machine, add lights... upgrade walls etc.
---
Very good video, nothing I could critique won't improve with time. I subscribed to watch your growth.
---
i got t51b right arm and a t60 helmet plan from it, seems to be really rare drop rate though
---
If on xbox i will give you any that are not 100% for free
---
I too play Animal Crossing
---
Theres only one surivial server.
---
I’ll buy your Handmade
---
Yup, that part is done.  That would be how I know I cant buy them.
---
Indeed, getting to “endgame” currently takes a week at most.
---
Oh gods please don't give them ideas like that. My fiancee loves this game but she has a paralyzing phobia of snakes. The last thing she needs is giant mutated super snakes.
---
Well if you are on PS4 ,I'd be more than happy to give ya a hand steal away your innocence
---
I have the right number of each. I bought them from vendors, so not getting Atom credit, but I think I have all according to that.
---
Reinstalled the game just to get the free items lol. Didnt actually start up 76 tho 😅
---
Do you know what they're called?
---
How about the weeklies?
---
1. Do events
---
2. Do events while well fed and drunk
---
3. Do events in a team.
---
So just get well fed, drunk and teamed up and click 'em off one by one.
---
Oh yes :)
---
Its all the event, meat week n scorchbeast queen events. There are players who helped themselves to your dropped loots
---
We all know, that this will not happen. Do you really believe Bethesda would implement such a system with these many variables without fucking it up? I don't.
---
same here. they piss me off i have a two shot explosive  full customized gattling gun with over 1500 rounds of ammo and A super sledge just itching for scorchbeast blood. Just annoying that seems like every fight i have to deal with a scorchbeast. They are the Jehovah witnesses of the wasteland apparently
---
I'm actually playing on both consoles. Lol. But I'm not to that point yet on my ps4 character.
---
You don’t need more stealth when you’re bloodied and wearing unyielding.  I’d much rather have Sentinel or Cavalier.  Your stealth will be super high due to the Unyielding stat increase.
---
You would pay SO MUCH MONEY is a stupid thing to say, since they read this things and go crazy with pricing.... just like all the "Id pay atoms for x". Why dont you just ask for payed DLC ? Why SO MUCH MONEY?
---
Shhh
---
people use bloodied because they *want* broken builds. what could you possibly hope to achieve by doing the opposite? why make the Queen even more of a lead sink?
---
Might be lvl 25. I think thats when you start getting perk cards that pertain to mutations, like starched geenes
---
No, I like my guns... stop asking me to stop playing and start asking them to fix this.
---
“Do you have time to talk about our lord and savior?!”
---
I do it by just hitting them
---
The animation is currently in use by the ghouls. And they don't want to give up their new technique.
---
this should be BGS’s job, not other players’.
---
I launched my first recently as well! Wanted to finish the main quest before Wastelanders. But man did that suck up all my ammo, the Vault raid didnt even use as much ammo as this ordeal did, although I got confused on the pipe repairs and couldnt find the shortcuts even though I thought I hacked and lockpicked everything. Now I have spent the past week just farming lead and steel to get my ammo back lol, I was reduced to a knife for quite some time, and even had to use a knife for some of the queen fight despite having 2 friends and a bunch of people come help out. It was really fun though, I love the absolute chaos, scorched lvl 91 Deathclaws, scorched Wendigos and all sorts of other freaks. Now I need to look into where the best places to get flux are so I can build the decon shower. Also didnt understand the cipher AT ALL, had to just look up the code and cheat, because the game gives no guidance on how to decode the cipher. Or if it does, I missed it.
---
There does seem to be a new trick.  I've noticed people on my team moving long before I'm able to.
---
All the jerkholios are already 1 shotting everything.  I’d rather get something low level than nothing at all.   We all need scrip.
---
Chill
---
Likely as my son picked up a t51 jet pack plan for 150 at a vender not there so...
---
True, but legendaries are appearing in many other events, random spawns and workshop defense.  I do encourage people to switch to lower power weapons at Uranium Fever but the maturity level of players who attend is hit or miss.  Their behavior at Fever will give you a good read on that server in general, hop accordingly.  Also, join a cooperative faction or community that tends to take over a server and you will have a better experience.
---
No...
---
Maybe not quite as often as Primal Cuts. That pops a little too often for my tastes. I need a breather to scrap/sell/stash before I jump into the next one. The pace of this meat week seems more frantic than the last one. I do like the notifications though. Makes it much easier not to miss. But I wish it showed the region on the event notification so I don't have to keep checking the map. Maybe if they slowed it down by half it would be better for me.
---
It does but it isn’t a guarantee. Sometimes it’s junk
---
Care to enlighten then?
---
those are decent weapons. not the best but well above many. if you like taking headshots the. Limb Damage is actually good because head counts as a limb. ( i think ppl dislike limb damage cuz they see it too often)
---
Adventure only got the cap. Survival suffered the cap AND a nearly 90% damage nerf to all weapons. So unless you got vats crit headshots you could expect guns to hit 15 per shot, maybe up to 25 for bloodied players. Most people could outpace the damage with stimpacks. It was a mess, average players couldn't defend themselves at all. Such a shame they had to ruin it so bad since they had plans to take it down anyway
---
This would go great with my vault tec themed home.   I would totally like to see this!
---
I beg to differ.
---
Do this, and wait for the next double XP weekend.  I went level 1 to 123 in the last one.  I’ll be leveling up another guy during the next one too.
---
Ok first and foremost, why on earth are you purchasing serums recipes from vendors?! Even the most expensive of players don’t sell them for the price that vendors do 2nd if u insist on being a fool and buying them from vendors so long as you’ve done the enclave question you’d be fine, and if it something related to perks (which Is highly unlikely) it’d be Lvl 30 for starched genes, not lvl 25 like this other guy reckons
---
Just read my other comment
---
You have to have access to the bunker OR know someone who has access. 
---
If they’re on a team and have right perks cards played along with chems/armor charisma can help get price way lower.
---
i think they should go because their absence creates a greater challenge and forces players to plan their gameplay a little more. this game is too easy for anyone to pick-up in a day or 2.
---
And not listed under things they are aware of in the around the vault.  So no fix planned, I guess.
---
Radiation resistance
---
I'd be happy to help you out :) ign is Gr3ye
---
True, but Epic has Fortnite money to throw at problems, and Bethesda doesn't. Plus most of the community suggestions for them aren't as difficult to implement as they're using an engine that's likely easier to deal with whereas this is using what is still essentially the gamebryo engine, despite the face-lifts its gotten.
---
Do you have access to the Military wing? You have to be a general first
---
I will suggest however that if turrets are driving the need for minimum spacing between CAMPs then the developers should give players the choice.  CAMP spacing would be determined directly by the number and type of turrets at the CAMP.  No turrets, minimal spacing requirement.  More turrets, increased spacing requirement.  A fully populated town would probably not need turrets throughout its interior as there would be citizenry onsite to defend it from mobs.
---
The try hards have to be wondering how a PA player is smoking them. Nice.
---
Like clockwork some update videos are now up and they're, of course, just over 10 minutes long.
---
I'm pretty sure the plans are available - or they were last time.  I thought they were just super rare.  
---
During the last meat week, someone at Grahm's meat-week camp had already learned the plan for the Tenderizer, and had a second one that he gave to another person.
---
Believe it or not, not everyone uses bloodied, and there are a lot of people that want more builds to be viable rather than two or three amazing ones with everything else mediocre. 
---
It's also why I said there would have to be rebalancing of the mobs. Right now sbq is a sponge because otherwise bloodieds can annihilate it rather quickly. This would prompt enemies to start having lower hp since they don't need to counter cheese builds.
---
Magazines only count in challenges if you the player finds them. Buying them or halo games don’t count for atom challenges.
---
You just said a bunch of words my old arse didnt understand lol
---
Well if and when that moment comes and you are ready,let me know. We can take our time and go slow .... No words need to be spoken and we can just live in the moment....under the soft lights of our power armor.....bliss...
---
LOL, in all seriousness and creepiness aside if ya need a hand hit my up on PS4 , my GT is the same as my reddit name.
---
The Meat Week event is going on, I'd suggest you participate in it . It's got good exp, you'll level up quickly; each Primal Cuts event guarantees a legendary, so here's a chance to get some better equipment, if not just script it and save on script to use at the Purveyor.
---
Stupid angler killed Rufus the deathclaw yesterday.  I’m not ok.

People are just douchers in these events. Just switch to a low tier weapon. If you already have endgame gear, you're not impressing anyone by one shotting legendaries. You're just validating to others that you're a cunt.
---
Well I'm convinced. Pookinsxplosion is my gt
---
Seymour Butts is a legit name
---
For just having a camp near there at all?
---
Update:  Bethesda has announced this is coming in 2020 along with legendary players.  Both features involve changes to perk cards and perk management so it makes sense they will be released together.

---
Nothing. For some reason I can't get that to work. Just hop into any chat or conversation!
---
That’s crazy. No what I had in mind but read about people trying to brake under the map. There are a couple of location were this would be interesting to do🤔
---
You will eventually be attacked by a scorch beast, but it is very rare. Virtibirds will fly around you fairly often.
---
yeah, the stash limit is indeed to small. i'd say add another 400 pounds and then you can actualy keep some stuff around instead of having to decide if you want a handmade rifle or a combat rifle.
---
as for camp size limit, i totally agree. even if that's just because i want more sheepsquatch plushies around my C.A.M.P.
---
Im Sorry I dont have SO MUCH MONEY.
---
Block for session 3 or players on the map then change server's
---
There's currently an issue preventing the notification from displaying when you earn Caps and it seems it may prevent the Scrip notification from displaying, too. However, this should just be a visual issue and you will still earn Scrip correctly when you turn in your stacks of Prime Meat.
---
Check the Collection tab in the Pip-Boy to see your Scrip total, and if it hasn't updated correctly after turning in meat, try logging out and back in. Hope that helps!
---
So on my bloody character I would literally have 15 special on every one and then add my +15 from my unyielding armor. I would be maxed at special. Terrible idea
---
Alright thanks. But quick question I did one of the events and only got about 400xp and some meat, is that normal?
---
If you do the event Uranium Fever plz switch into a pistol or something shitty, nobody wants to see the jerk off one hitting everything with his dc gauntlet or creeping around in their undies stealth killing in one shot. They’re crappy lvl 40 mole miners take it down a notch would ya! And let everyone else doing the event land a hit before you feel the need to go Rambo on the place
---
You’ve hit the end game. Borderlands 3 just came out.
---
the vast majority does. the market reflects that. or do you think the sudden rise in junkie's popularity is because people enjoy crippling themselves with withdraw effects?
---
and the Queen has always been a sponge, bloodied or otherwise. the point is that you should buff things globally, not nerf them. bloodied and junkie's are far from broken as it is.
---
if you dislike "op" builds just use mediocre gear. don't ruin the fun for other people.
---
What is the best armor type? is it still Heavy BoS CombAt? I have a full set of this with unyielding and SP refresh 2\*
---
He didnt ask for your perspective opinion, he simply asked when he could buy them. Calling someone a fool for playing the way they want is none of your business. Your comments lack respect for anyone, hard to take you seriously. But then again thats what happens when children use reddit. Millennials...😒
---
Yeah same imagine it was public &amp; you had as many people as uranium Fever gets now... I wouldn’t even do it. You can’t get a shot at a legendary in Uranium Fever for your life (idc because they’re all under leveled) but if you actually get a 3* it’s valuable scrip. I get like 7 people per UF. Most I’ve ever had at AWOL with me was 1 other person &amp; sometimes 2 if my brother is playing with me &amp; we make sure to let the other person get a hit if so. We just need free fast travel to events PERIOD, no questions asked. Idk why they’re so bent on it it’s not like these caps are actually going to BGS’ already fat pockets lol. Same with camps I hate spending 15+ caps (so little but so annoying) to go to someone’s base &amp; it just has overpriced BS or just absolutely crap filled up in there like normal guns &amp; armor..
---
They've said the scorched won't be removed, though at present it's still a little unclear if Wastelanders will just be an update for Adventure mode, or if it'll be a mode unto itself. If the latter is true, then it'd be possible to keep the scorched without having them in Wastelanders.
---
Yes, this is correct. You should still be earning your Scrips correctly, but there's a visual issue preventing the notification from appearing on the screen after turning in Prime Cuts. 
---
If your Scrip total in the Collections tab doesn't update correctly (of if it incorrectly shows 0), try logging out and back in and it should update.
---
I know and I've already played through it
---
Build and maintain a beautiful camp. Get into architecture. Stroll around your garden and dance alongside your white pickett fence.
---
They did. I bet they'll release it there either with Wastelanders or some time after it, to help with reviews at least a little bit. Because in its current state this game is bound to have "Mostly negative" rating.
---
The best combo for me is over level 76, wear sunglasses and in a group
---
if only i had friends
---
Ask some randomers, most peopke are pretty sound and dont mind teaming up even if just for the challenges
---
As others have mentioned, there's an issue that prevents the notification from appearing on the screen when you earn Scrip. You should still be earning Scrip correctly and can check the Collections tab in your Pip-Boy to view your Scrip total. 
---
If your Scrip total hasn't updated in the Collections tab (or if it incorrectly shows 0), try logging out and back in and it should update.
---
Youd have to be over level 1000 to max all special at 15 with that method.
---
Only reason I do this event anymore is a chance at that sweet sweet jumpsuit drop 🤑 I don’t even try to kill the legendaries I just sit on the pipes &amp; chill till it’s over lol
---
My bad dude u wanna tell me what platform u happen to be on so I can merc u a hundred times over? I’m stating a obvious point that’d save him a fortune so excuse me mate but is there serious harm in telling warning someone if their about to make a big mistake? I’m sorry I didn’t realise that telling someone that they’d be throwing away caps to do what they were going to do. Sure my delivery wasn’t 10/10 but man I can’t be bothered what ever gets his attention. So what platform u play on? Cause your a realll piece of work mate and I’d love nothing more then to merc u so hard
---
Eh I just turned 30 and have mixed feelings. *sigh
---
I’d drop Demolition and Tormentor completely.  Drop Strength and Endurance to 1, and get more of the awesome Luck perks- better critical, four leaf clover, critical savvy, etc. If you put just 1 point in each these perks you get a pretty big bump.
---
Got it. Do you have any idea about the other magazines they're talking about above? It's kinda weird there's only 96 magazines if I'm doing my math correctly.
---
Why look at that your Xbox 1 how unfortunate
---
What does WWR mean?
---
I have bought them before because I have literally nothing else to do with my caps except buy things I don't need.  It's those or power armor mod recipes for armor I don't wear and wouldn't use those mods even if I did.
---
I'm pretty sure they said it will be on Steam before 2020, so I believe it will come around when Wastelanders arrives soonest or near December latest.
---
I don’t math very well. How many would I have at level 450.
---
Go around exploring and stuff if you have people to play with it makes it more fun I managed to get to level 60 just doing that before I even started doing quests past the initial beginning ones
---
Weapon Weight Reduction
---
I just buy something from there vender
---
I talked to a rep from wand. The have not abondoned it, and are working for a 2020 release.
---
Oh so you are threatening me? Thats enough for a ban. Reported
---
it is a song, all instruments sync up
---
I mean sure if u wanna burn caps that’s one method but honestly imo still not worth
---
Yes but no.
---
Its accurate its just pedantic and comes across shitty, you knew exactly what they meant when they said $7 fridge
---
You would have an extra 20 to use
---
I don't think being able to have 15 points on every attribute is a good idea. It defeats the purpose of creating new characters.
---
Also i wont block you. "Merc me" kid.... ill teach you what your daddy didnt😘
---
My bad I should’ve realised your a real fool, imaging reporting someone for threatening to do what’s comeptly fine in the game
---
I doubt that they play the game, and have more than 3 devs working on it.
---
I think Forest Scout is considered the best on limbs, and Combat is best on the chest, but double check that.  I haven’t gotten to the point where I focus on the armor type, I really only focus on having the best Legendary bonuses.
---
Yeah plus it gives you extra stuff to do when you’re at high level, maybe an option to redo the missions on a harder difficulty
---
Ah, thank you.
---
just do the main quests, I got up to Officer on Deck before level 30 on several characters
---
*Yes, that's what a public test server is for*
---
I get that feeling too
---
having to prioritize choices is good
---
There are actually a few players in survival that were seriously rocking PA and kicking ass. The major downside is that movement is slower, so it's just easier to empty clips into them before they can get to cover. But with the boost to big guns with stabilized they can melt players, as long as they position themselves well. Just takes a bit of practice, I'm sure they died a bunch of times figuring it all out.
---
Nice, thank you. That is nice info!
---
Oh this’ll be so much fun lmao 😂 your think little crappy builds gonna do anything to me? That’s hilarious, also are you threatening me that’s worthy of a ban? Reported
---
That would be cool to have different skins for tip jars. Actual jars, an upside down hat, a bowl
---
Did it last night on Xbox, got it on the first run, that being said, I didn't get one the first time they had meat week and i did it many many times.
---
It would be cool to be wandering around with a pip-boy on your arm after a terrible nuclear accident and have it really work.
---
Or, maybe not.
---
well, I have to say...I dont understand the legendar, exchsnge machine. How does it work?
---
Wanna go on a date? Ill be gentle😘
---
Just made an edit but you would have to be over level 1000 to achieve that.
---
Thank you everyone for all the advice given!
---
Mind you my strength, perception, and agility are already at 25-29 special already with my unyielding pieces.
---
I wouldn’t honestly need them
---
Gotta get some plans first
---
Awwwww you reported me? Look whos a hypocrite😘🤣
---
Still a hotspot... Try the mire, ash heap, north and south of the map, you Will almost never have this issue
---
You can trade in your legendary gear for Scrips which is a type of currency only accepted by the Purveyor at Berkeley Springs Station. It’s 5 scrips for a 1* item, 10 for 2* and so on up to 25 for a 5*
---
Would be nice, but I think it's it's a matter of rendering cost. Otherwise, it would take even longer for camps to load in.  Some of those junk models are pretty intensive to render.  I'm pretty sure different items have different impacts, including some cases where I could display one item in budget, but removing that item and adding a different one exceeds budget.  
---
Premade game locations can be full of stuff, since they're all pre-stored on the local HDD.  Player camps have to be stored remotely, with information about model specifics (orientation, placement, damage levels, associated attached objects, etc.) having to be passed back and forth via comparatively slow internet interactions with a central server.  (You probably knew all that, just covering bases for those that don't.)
---
I think there'd pretty much be a hard "no" on removing vendor items from stash limits.  We'd just see people setting up vendors with all their heaviest items on sale for 25,000 caps, which would be massively annoying.
---
I do kind of wonder about the choice to limit stashes by weight.  It makes sense for player encumbrance mechanics, but not for storage.  That may not be the best model to use for server load.  It's been a while, but I think Elder Scrolls Online limits their shared bank by total item slots, with stacks of identical items costing one slot (can't remember if stack sizes are limited).  Maybe a better model might be to limit players to, say, 1000 distinct item slots in their bank, with stackable items of the same type costing one shared slot.  That would suck for costume collectors, though.  Would also have player-market repurcussions.  
---
I'm not altogether sure how you determine how many slots should be allocated.  Seems like they could do a survey of current stashes, to see how many unique items are in the average player's stash.  That would seem to be a good starting point, especially if you threw out results for players under an arbitrary level (say under L20 or something), to remove those who haven't played enough to truly accumulate stash items.  That would also kick out mule characters, though.  That's either bad or good, depending on how they feel about mules.
---
(Aside: I know that ESO is a different company.  They have a free/pay model where monthly-pay players get much larger banks. Yeah, no thanks.)
---
In any case, I do dearly wish they could do some tweaking on the system to expand stashes and camp budgets.  I'm always sitting at the limits on both, too.
---
I don't really understand the new variant I'll be honest. Wasn't it an Atomic shop thing? But now that it doesn't have foundations it's a new non-atomic shop version or what?
---
I'll bring the dips!
---
Wanna hear the amazing thing kid? I didn’t report you 😂😂 xD I was pointing out how much of a hipocritical fool u are, tries to ban me for threatening to do what’s well in the lines of the game and then proceeds to do the exact same thing lmao
---
My current  pa build  is great  for pve but i melt and die in pvp before i can  even see the guy shooting me
---
Legendaries aren't guaranteed in Primal Cuts, just likely. I've had a few already where the final boss wasn't a Legendary.
---
Stop acting like a toddler and start acting like the Man U are mate
---
There are legendary exchange machines at all train stations. Always sell the ones you don’t want every day. There is a limit to how much you can sell in one day so do it often. Don’t stockpile them to sell later, it will take more time than it should that way.
---
It's an exploit don't do it
---
Agreed.  I think Atomic Shop items shouldn't consume CAMP budget at all, but can have a placement limit (like you can only have one punch bowl right now).  Also, items in the display cases should not consume BOTH stash AND budget.  A thing cannot be in two places at the same time.  I understand the developers don't want people to use displays to get around the stash limit, so that's fine, displayed items use stash only, not camp budget.  The display cabinets and racks themselves already use budget.
---
Three star items are 100 for weapons and 60 for armor. The pieces will drop according to your level up to 50.
---
Sentinel and AP refresh speed (AKA Powered). End of discussion.
---
Bloodied and junkies on their own aren't op, which is the reason why I don't suggest meeting those. 
---
However, right now you get effects that stack so some weapons can deal over 10x their original damage. All I'm suggesting is a rebalance so that more builds are viable in game. 
---
And I don't understand how better IG balance ruins the fun of other players. Just means people have to get more creative with how they cheese the mechanics.
---
Head is a limb, but limb damage doesn't do extra damage to the overall health of the monster, It just does extra damage to each individual limbs health,making it faster  cripple it. I learned the hard way after searching for an instagating  limb damage revolver and having no damage change over my instagating ffr revolver using concentrated fire headshots...
---
90% of the PvP ive been involed in has the person attacking me have god tier armour and loadout that i literally cannot kill them, as in, 2 shot fatman with demo 5 does nothing, TSE minigun does nothing, anti armor .50cal does nothing.  
---
This is with a heavy weapon build that usually pummels high level enemies in seconds, against these players i cant even tickle them but they can 1 shot me with their bloodied handmades.  
---
Really takes all the fun out of PvPing, for them its like a 25 year old guy walking into a playgroup and challenging the 4 year olds to a fight by smashing them with chairs when they dont expect it
---
Better than letting them disappear from being over the cap.
---
IMHO - I can imagine how the graphical client display performance is impacted by the number and complexity of CAMP items deployed but how it impacts server performance is unclear. I suspect this could be a non-linear situation just based on the download from the server to the client when entering the visual zone though. What I don't understand is all the BGS concern about stash size. Stash is just a list or an index of you inventory if you will. Yes more items takes longer to pull but all they are displaying is just a text list. Item codes don't actually weigh anything of course so using the arbitrarily assigned in-game weight as the key determining inventory value is disingenuous to say the least. I suppose there is an increasing chance of exploitation should data queries exceed some critical value but I remain convinced that there is plenty of room for BGS to increase the current meager allocations.
---
Okay but that doesn’t really answer my question... how many scrips does the surveyor charge? Am I looking to grind into the thousands or could I pick something up for a couple hundred? I realise it’s randomised but there has to be a bracket somewhere
---
that was a joke, i do have friends lol
---
The enemies in every wave of primal cuts take way too long to show up. Killing everything isn't an issue, but we're standing around for like 45 seconds after a wave starts to see any enemies. So many fails because we don't see the boss until seconds are left. Good xp, but no prime meat for scrip.
---
I mean true🤷‍♂️ personally I just blow my excess caps on useful stuff for low lvls and leave it in overseers, but more often then not I just keep making more and more characters to hold more and more caps
---
Wow, way cheaper than I expected. Can’t afford any yet but it won’t be long tbh
---
Just edited to answer. The prices are affordable. What’s going to stop you is the daily scrip limit. So the best way is to sell daily then wait for a purveyor sale.
---
I get almost all of my junk from blackwater mine, kill and loot all bodies .pick up everything you see and scrap it ,lead i get from weights found in the silos and a few other spots
---
I just server hop and kill them all to get ressources for my pvp characters
---
By far, the most efficient thing to buy from the Purveyor are 2* Ranged Weapons.  Wait until you are level 50, and then go nuts.  The only reason to buy from the Purveyor sooner is if you hit the scrip cap (1,000).
---
Yes, this. I just lost my second Mega Sloth last night. It was alive and well when I logged out on Wednesday night... I log in on Thursday and it's dead... No rhyme or reason. No structures to crush him on loading and no water to rad kill him... They need to make them invincible or, if they do die, they will respawn after a certain amount of time passes.
---
Also, I should be able to tame an animal from anywhere, not just specific locations. That's idiotic.
---
really? i was not aware of that.
---
Don't give them ideas. I rather have overpriced junk in the atomic shop than having to pay for an actual DLC.
---
There's nothing wrong with a slightly  edgy name honestly. Unless you're member of the ridiculously oversensitive *ones* .
---
you can do that by buffing things without nerfing others. no matter how creative you get, a nerf is a nerf.
---
I have generic lore notes and holotapes in a machine for 1-5 caps, I guess you could do something like that
---
That is very cool actually. Now you are really ready to cleanup Appalacia. Please start by burying all those nasty skeletons and petrified corpses standing around when you have a chance.
---
Right, so I’m only level 11 but was planning to get over there as soon as possible to get my hands on some better gear - is that not a good idea until I’m level 50?
---
Yea man, I was beyond disappointed, Soni started looking for vats crit weapons instead.
---
Pick up a book kid. 
---
&gt;hipocritical
---
Is spelled wrong kiddo. If you are going to attempt feeble insults, at least learn to spell. Still waiting on you to milk me.... oops i meant merc🤣🤣
---
Just go to one of your favorite areas and kill stuff.  Rinse and repeat until you hit level 100 or whatever.
---
So you gonna rethink jumping to report people and then continuing to commit the very offence you reported someone for?
---
2* ranged is 50 scrips. Recommend to start here as you get double the chances and first 2 are most important. 3* is a 100.
---
Armors always roll 3* star. And it will drop at a lvl you can use right now. So wait till 45-50 or just roll a couple and see if you get something nice to help you lvl up. Can always trun them back in when your max lvl.
---
Don't let the asshole get to you. What I did when i was low level was sleep until well rested to get an xp bonus. If you have enough caps (think it's 93 or something with hard bargain), go to the white springs resort and there's a gourmet shop with a vendor named Antoine (might be spelled wrong). Buy the recipe for cranberry relish. If it isn't there, just server hop til he has it. That'll give an xp bonus that stacks with well rested. Stick with easier events until you manage to come across better gear to do the more challenging ones. Fertile soil goes on quite often at the vault tec agriculture building. It isn't the quickest method, but it's super easy to farm levels to build up your perks to help take on stronger enemies. Keep trying public events and do the best you can to help kill things. Even if you don't do much damage, you have just as much right to be there as higher levels. A good non event farming spot is WV Lumber co. It's at the top west of the map. Low level super mutants and there are lots of them. There are also lots of scorched at Point Pleasant (far west on the map where it says mothman museum).That's all I can think of, but hopefully something I mentioned helps. Definitely get well rested before doing anything though. Even if you can't get cranberry relish, the bonus from that is better than nothing, and lasts 2 hours. Good luck!
---
It wouldn't be much of a problem if there wasn't always that one or three assholes who use automatic weapons full-blast with plasma and/or explosive.  It's gotten so bad that I don't try to defend the extractors anymore because I'm just trying to tap as many mole men as I can for experience, glowing meat, ammo, weapons, all those things that the one-shotters and full automatic players won't let anybody else get.
---
It is a one in 4 spawn on the bottom right shelf of the bookcase in the antique store near Fort Defience. There is also 3 spawns spots at the Ranger Station.
---
I agree. You don't need a boost to stealth with agility that high, but if you're in stealth, you're also getting zero benefit from sent or cav, unless and until you switch to a stand-up or run-and-gun fight.
---
Ah right cool cool, i see it a lot on here from people who arent joking
---
I have simply went back to fallout 4 with mods for all my base building urges
---
Oops still waiting on you to get offline lmao fool, sorry I spelt something wrong, end of the world isn’t it? God damn man your the most ignorant person I’ve ever spoken too
---
Or better yet, a TSE with commando and explosives beets that instantly and that’s without DPS
---
Pretty much same bud. Lived on the other peak for months. Never seen a Scorched beast anywhere near me. Vertibirds are fine they die super easy an come with a nuke card bot wich I sell the cards easily.
---
A dictionary would clear your confusion. Clearly you cant spell hypocritical so odds are you don't know what it means.
---
Go Wes tek/satellite array, harpers ferry, the burrows, big als steakhouse (AWOL Armaments if it is happening close to there), then white springs for shitty scrip legendaries.
---
No, they didn't. 
---
Deathclaw dropped a Junkie's Pickaxe during a Forest event this morning
---
It’s not even worth getting into a deeper argument with you, start acting your age mate your a god damn grown adult high time you start acting like one mate
---
Yeah it's hard, no doubt. Its definitely not my go to. I suck in PA!
---
Right... ignorant. But you can't spell.
---
Also I'm not online....that's why i would be offline.
---
I need a housecarl.
---
It all comes down to the build and play style. Different effects will work better for some and not others. PvP vs PvE can make a huge difference in your choice as well.  
---
Running +sneak in PvP makes it harder for the opps to vats you. Running AP refresh helps to always have enough points to vats them.
---
Then you really don't want to think about Whitespring Resort's location in relation to the bunker and the inside vs outside access...
---
It's cheap because there are so many item-types and trash affixes that your odds of getting something useful are pretty low. There are videos of people going through thousands of scrip (on multiple characters) and getting nothing useful. It's great in the long run, but it takes patience or luck.
---
Honestly it's not better than spamming Westek or Whitesprings but it's sort if interactive so I guess it's fun
---
Do what I did at level 40 last week or so. Explore and kill stuff. Do little side quests. Do events. Stash your junk and take a workshop. Make sure you have at least well rested bonus and some cranberry cobbler active at all times fir the xp boost. You'll be at level 45 before you know it.
---
The deathclaws also drop the deathclaws hide, which isn't wasn't dropped by any deathclaw before.
---
When are you gonna come by and milk me again? 
---
Ooops i meant merc🤣 sorry i keep missing that
---
1. At level 40 you're way to low to solo.
---
2. The trick I've found for keycards is to get help, not from other players but from NPCs.  If you're at Watoga the robots really, really don't like the SAC vertibirds and will occupy them and you can climb up high and concentrate on the cargobot.
---
Your aware how blatantly ignorant you seem right? You 1. Reported me for threatening to merc you, then proceed to threaten to “teach me what my daddy didn’t” threatening me, the exact thing you tried to report me for, like my god man how much more ignorant can one person get? Ignorance is truly bliss isn’t it? So ignorant you overlook your own hypocrisy
---
I’m currently doing the challenge but I’ll look for totals
---
U still hiding in offline? Let me check... yep
---
Still spelled it wrong
---
Same crap different day
---
Really? You sure about that little one? I’d have to disagree with you on that one 🤣run along before you trip on your ego
---
from my experience, exchange anything that isn't its final level until you reach 50
---
Wow you must be a leading expert on users movements. Im not home genius. Let me check if im still off...
---
Yup.. im not home🤣
---
I wonder how many explosive Tesla’s get sold on eBay.
---
About a month ago I was teamed up with a dude that was openly unashamed about buying a TSE GP for $80. It was weird. He killed himself almost as much as he killed enemies. That part was kinda funny.
---
dEaL wItH iT
---
Did that make you feel better?
---
Until you realise someone has goo'd/ash piled all the enemies on a server and NOTHING ever respawns
---
That's not how that wotks
---
Yah like this Scorchbeast community event, these are the kind of permanent affecting events on Appalachia that I'd like to see.  Things that were part of this game's theme and promised with rebuilding the wastes and reclaiming the wastes. Having a month long community event where we all chip in resources and do events on the map to secure and defend and repair the railroads to make them useable again. Ones that make the nuke reactors stable and secured as permanent power supplies. Then making villages or towns rebuilt in another big event, etc.
---
yea, fiends are the worst, idk why anyone would have them
---
It’s better to wait till 50 so it’s a chance it will be something you can use long term. You’ll be replacing things often while leveling. Also some quests guarantee a legendary weapon, it may be worth looking those up and waiting till you are level 50 to do them.
---
I think it’s a waste to do sooner.  You really don’t need great gear when leveling.  You might be able to pick up some pieces off player vendors tho.  
---
The issue is that if you buy from the Purveyor now, you still need to spend 50 scrip for a 2* weapon, and even if you got a great level 15 weapon in the game, it would probably be worth maybe 2K max.  That same weapon at level 50 might be worth 25K+ (or you keep it and use it for the next 200 levels). 
---
So spending 50 scrip now offers far less benefits, and you’d only use it a few days until you leveled 10+ levels. Plus odds are that for your 50 scrip you’ll end up with a piece of complete garbage too, as most Purveyor items are garbage.  Maybe 1 in 10 are decent, and even then it might not be for your type of build.
---
Man look at you omg 🤣🤣 I’m actually dying at how ignorant you are, go run along even arguing this long with a delinquent like you has made me lose some brain cells
---
Are you kidding? No matter what Bethesda does to the game, the reviews are pretty much guranteed to always be in "Negative" and nothing else due to all of the outrage culture against it
---
Well done! I enjoyed this and hope you make more of these. I usually don't pay attention to lore while playing so this is great.
---
Thanks for this!  It seems like there are is a fair number of outright supervillain figures in this game.  &gt;!Think the survivors are getting too nicey-nicey?  Nuke the dam and kill thousands to make a point.  Brother died in an industrial accident?  Poison several thousand acres of farmland.  Find out that air extractors can cheaply extract valuable minerals from smoke and soot?  Set coal seams on fire and choke several towns in black smog.!&lt; Seriously, this is Captain Planet level villainy here!
---
Did you catch the reference or do I need to spell it out for thick skulled self?
---
You are? Well its pretty clear considering you cant spell
---
Thanks, I’m glad you enjoyed it
---
Nope im just commenting to waste your time😁 your words are misspelled and meaningless
---
Yeah, but you stand up (or run) when stealth is blown and your are being hit.
---
If you're itching to try it out, give it a go! Just keep in mind the weapons will drop to your level, so you'll only use them for ten levels or so, until they're under powered. Once you hit 50, you're good. Just find a player's camp near the station, FT to it, once you discover the Station you can just FT anytime you wanna check it out.
---
I'd wait till 25 or 30. Even then don't blow the whole wad. It's nice to get something to help lvl but it's still a gamble. You're likely to get a bunch of bunk things and if they are under lvld then you can't get nearly the caps for them.
---
I rolled 3 or 4 times and got a furious combat rifle. That thing was a keeper till i was lvl 50 and could replace it.
---
Other then hypocritical which words have I misspelt? And if I did misspell any I apologise, I’m currently on mobile, it’s 2:30 in the morning and I’m wasting my time arguing with you
---
I had my gamer pic reported enough to have xbox change it. It was a pic of an unused perk picture from fallout 2 (I think) of fallout guy kicking a pregnant woman in the stomach.
---
What is the difference between nerfing something and buffing everything but that thing?
---
If they did my idea (which I don't care if they do, I just want to create conversation about it) and they didn't nerf enemies, then it's totally just a nerf and nothing more. If they nerf enemies because players are now weakened, is basically the same effect as buffing everything else. 
---
It also adds slightly to viability of crafting weapons/armor in game because these are not as terrible as before (but still not good). 
---
So, imo it's a difference of ideologies
---
Robco Fun
---
I don't like it. I don't even like swappable perks though so I'm probably all kinds of wrong...
---
There is only one Greenhouse (Atomic Shop) object but it now has two display modes, with and without a concrete foundation. The later is something that arrived in the last patch. The good news is that you can now use the greenhouse above soil to display plants. As the OP indicates though there is a bug with how the greenhouse door snaps to the new variant. I believe these two modes can be swapped as well but I haven't verified it yet. Here is an example of the new greenhouse deployed with a garden.

Boy the maturity here. From both of us. I really can’t be bothered going further with this we are both acting like bloody children over something that doesn’t even concern us
---
Yes you are! Because im purposely wasting your time. You are nothing
---
But still I’ve got your GT in mind just for some friendly PvP
---
Absolutely. I enjoy the over the top villainy we’ve see in Appalachia. Thanks for watching
---
Okay. So it's confusing, but since your pip boy says -2, it's taking down your actual charisma, but stuff like that doesn't affect your points where you see them in your perks. So in this case, you'd need 5 points in charisma to be able to share a 1 star card because of the -2 you have for your build.
---
Lmao yeah right. Coming from the guy throwing insults. All of a sudden its beneath you, huh?
---
Yeah, I'd seen it for thousands of caps before, so I grabbed it quick, fearing the player would log off.  I don't think I could have ever justified *spending* 15k, because I'm such a cheapskate.  But *asking* that much?  I think your justified; Possum was tiresomely grindy.
---
Thank you for the offer, but I'm going to give it a test drive. I was hesitant about it because I don't ever use vats, but perhaps I could use it with the SBQ. It's usually focused on someone else, so my old-man reactions won't matter so much.
---
Well considering they've not had any major delays releasing content.... I don't see why it would be expected to be delayed months (basing launch off of the road map, as ~November)
---
Then how come people can build greenhouses at other people's camps now?
---
Yes. Still sad, I don't even wana go back to adventure mode now. PvP sucks in adventure. Like I'm being forced to go greif workshops in adventure now. I bought this game for the PVP. I hate Battle Royal style PvP.
---
Ugh I just legit can’t be bothered dealing with u anymore I’m deleting all my comments cause I just cannot be bothered whatsoever to continue this pointless argument
---
Waiting to fix the game up more and make quality content to add to game as current state I see majority of players requesting refunds within 24hrs including myself and thats with the experience of being lvl 236 and having legendary enemies disappear after I kill them unable to loot them yesterday.
---
Thats cute. Ill take you on a date little girl😘
---
Look mate I’m giving u the opportunity to act your age, I’d suggest you take it
---
Oh i legit know bro.
---
Or what? Gonna milk me? 
---
Ooops merc lol sorry again
---
See, that's called speculation. Based off of one delayed feature.....
---
I would love this, most would hate it since its not about builds but lvling but I was always a fan of skyrim and fallout 4s lvling system.
---
Nobody came back to upvote me for being right the entire time, so I wouldn't worry too much about it, you win with the most fake internet points lol. "Kilograms is weight where I come from.", I mean people don't even know this basic shit in their own country and you're making fun of my country...
---
Yeah it's weird. Confusing since it doesn't show on the perk screen and it's easy to forget if you have an effect taking down certain points.
---
Start to walk down from top of the mire to bottom. its scenic and has cool monsters
---
Why did you delete all your comments? All the downvotes must be rough.
---
Survival at least felt like real risk and reward. No slap damage, always looking over your shoulder.
---
God I love how u find one come back and try to repeat it, it doesn’t get any funnier
---
Nay, just exacerbating the problem. Its like they don't even play the game.
---
The whole big 3 downvotes? Wowwowwwwww
---
Buying this game for PvP was a mistake. 
---
It was never billed as a PVP heavy game. When they talked about measures to limit griefing prior to launch, that should have been a big red flag for you.
---
I know right lol.
---
A great way to give incentive playing in the long term.
---
You cant count either? Wow. Ok im gonna pm you a link for hooked on phonics.
---
Have fun with it if you ever feel like selling it let me know.
---
Hey, you might know this: Have you found any lore behind the Mole Miners? We're told by out-of-game sources that they're miners trapped in their enhanced mining suits. But I've yet to see anything in-game supporting that or explaining how it happened.  I'm guessing that they're actually ghouls, fused to their suits by radiation and decay, but no way of knowing that I've seen.
---
I think it would make the overpowered even more overpowered. The game does not need godly characters.
---
It was said sometime in the spring that there would be a Steam release later this year, but nothing since then. I think if the plans did not change, then it is most likely around the launch of Wastelanders.
---
Oh my bad 4* sorry I wasn’t counting yours
---
Aw, that was really cool man and not annoying like oxhorn
---
Yeah. Now if only a camera would drop. 
---
Scrapped mine off ansel accidentally. Haven't found one in the dozens of hours since it dropped.
---
I don’t see you listed Awesome Tales #14
---
And that rifle and ammo might be 20ish pounds modded
---
Buh bye little one😘
---
I’d report him. It’s a community even. Not an exclusive douchenozzle zone
---
Look at you wanna settle this? Lmk when u get on, actually don’t I can figure it out for myself
---
I would be ok with it if the rewards based on performance are purely bonuses and don't (e)affect the base loot pool
---
Swappable perks make the game easier and way smaller. The only reason people create new characters Is for mules.
---
I would wait and scrip whatever you are not going to use. If you want some decent low level legendaries, farm the wolf pack event that spawns by the big ferris wheel on the map. Keep hoping servers till you find it. You get 3x 1* legendaries.from that event . Also since it's meet week the last monster in each wave will give you a 1* legendary. There's usually plenty of people at the meat week events to kill the monsters so all you gotta do is get.some hits in to get credit.
---
This is going to be a difficult problem. How do you avoid rewarding bad behavior on either end of the spectrum? It doesn’t seem fair for players to get rewarded for killing everything singlehandedly, nor is it fair to benefit a player that hides in a corner and contributes nothing just for showing up.
---
 
---
I honestly have no idea how they’re going to distribute wealth fairly without completely reworking the mechanics of most events. The whole point of the change is to distribute wealth amongst all participants to encourage team play, and discourage selfish, antisocial behavior.
---
any unyielding that gives +endurance....the only stat the armor doesn't boost naturally
---
Any what? Milk me? 🤣
---
I bought an Executioners reduced weight shovel last night. Seemed too perfect to pass up.
---
Yes Shhhhh ^^^but ^^^I'd ^^^pay ^^^too
---
Oh, man, the surveyal project is a great idea!  Given how dense the map will become with future DLC (assuming they don't add new maps, which may happen), they'll be unrecognizable soon.
---
Next tip, buy Borderlands 3 and enjoy a good game. :p (Salty as last 4 events legendary items dead bodies disappear before me picking their loot up)
---
Correct me if I'm wrong. The event starts with or without the barrel. The barrel is just there to start it before the timer counts down. Guys a dick though.
---
As I understand it if you know how to build an item you can build it in someone else's CAMP if you are part of their team. Modifying a weapon, armor, or clothing to use a custom Atomic Shop paint works differently. Those can't be traded, dropped (without destroying them), or sold.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f35886b&amp;d=sf2sq2s32sr2sg2pe2ej4c72ib4ir2a72a12la2l71lt2lu2cm2ce0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=&amp;nw=
---
unpopular opinion: hop servers
---
Sounds like a good idea
---
HOO WEE WILD IN HER'UH
---
well the primal cuts event will start even if you don't play the barrel when the timer runs out so it doesn't really matter
---
You definitely can't build atomic shop stuff in other people's camps, I help new people with building a lot.
---
No you can fail it you're there and cant start the event. Or it use to be at least. Maybe they changed it?
---
4/5 for me haven’t been legendary
---
A regular handmade does more damage than a missile launcher lol
---
Viable against what? I struggle to see what unviable build in PVE would be made more viable by decreasing damage output. You are not competing against other players. If you are just trying to stop people from oneshotting enemies then you have a jackass problem not a dps problem. 
---
If you are talking PVP then none of this matters with the PVP damage cap. You can take bloodied and other multipliers to the max so your weapon shows 10000 and it still won't hit for more than 110.
---
Insult bot and prize bot are tied to random spawn points. If your camp is close enough to spawn them, they'll seek you out. I don't think they're events linked to your camp.
---
They changed it, I'm pretty sure.
---
I mean why would I hop? I'm level 107 on this toon so I can go about without it affecting me personally too much.
---
Milk you dry of Caps sure 🤣 I hope that little shop of yours gets you enough income
---
If there was a tip jar, I’d definitely have a reason to get the bar from the atom shop, and redo my camp to make it similar to the dirty dancer in trailer park boys.
---
Oh well thank God for that. Would explain why some of the events start without me on the barrel. Okay sweet.
---
You also have like a 1 in 40,000 chance to get the weapon you want
---
People around here are always like, "Have you noticed that since X started server stability has really gone to shit?" No, I have never noticed. I get maybe one disconnect a month. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Did not know that before this post. I thought it was like it was before, where if you didnt sound off the barrel, it failed the event
---
Don't worry they added Survival Mode and NW mode to give it some life.
---
They’re both antisocial behaviors, so the end result is the same for everyone around them. It’s a wonder how some people survive to adulthood.
---
Higher level enemies/quest shouldn't be a problem at all at level 40. Almost all enemies are easy to take out once you get to level 30 or so
---
When I was camped next to the Whitespring train station for vending purposes I got this a lot. Finally I would stay on the world and then join a friend's world...that worked most of the time.
---
However, my normal (current) camp location is very remote and not once have I received the message that my camp can't be placed.
---
I feel your pain there brother but I'm soo sick of this map. I want new scenery I'm hoping for a map expansion soon paid, free, seriously I'll hump Todds leg if it gets the job done
---
Report them? Absolutely, but BGS should include a no-build zone around event trigger zones now and in the future. No excuses BGS, this is something that you should have planned for as it is pretty obvious that someone would do this kind of thing intentionally.
---
I’ve inspected one of their bodies fairly closely (they’re nasty), but I don’t know exactly what lies underneath, or why it is we haven’t seen these suits anywhere but on mole miners. Presumably we should be able to find one on a hook, or in a locker, but I have yet to see one. That being said, they do use guns, which doesn’t eliminate them being ghouls, but I’ve yet to see one of them twitch like a feral ghoul does. Doesn’t mean they’re aren’t any ferals, but it does raise the question of why we wouldn’t have seen one if they are ghouls under the suits.
---
They remind me of the enemies at the Sierra Madre in Dead Money more than anything.
---
Pvp should be More spartan in terms of mechanics. No legendaries would help. I mean... It Is silly that I can survive rockets to the face but die easily because of a mega unyelding Pipe gunner and His 10mm pistol and knife. It feels funny.
---
Thanks for watching
---
Just go get stuff if you want to. At lvl 11 it may be a while untill you hit 50 but you could find something good and low lvl you can use. If its junk thats no different to finding a lvl 50 junk legendary, the value is the same regardless of lvl.
---
I went at a low lvl and got some decent gear, id only say at lvl 11 you will get max lvl 10 kit, so maybe wait untill 15 and you can get a 15 item. Then again wait untill 20 to go back.
---
Purveyor is good, but it is random so dont expect a god roll. When you get better at finding legendaries to scrip you will have more to spend, meaning the potential loss of your scrip will be easier to swallow. 
---
There are a lot of low lvl legendaries for sale in vendors, so maybe get efficient at getting caps for now and buy them. People often sell low to help guys like you so look around. 
---
Id suggest lvl to 15 and start hoarding for the next sale. If its 50% discount you obv get 2 for the price of 1
---
I'm a Bartender in the "real world" and a tip jar is an idea I want to see happen so bad!
---
it was this same way last time if someone stands near the area the primal cuts will start when that first small timer runs out
---
Yeah, that's a dick move. I just did one in the Bog and a dude dropped his Camp device but waiting until the last Prime creature spawned and everybody got a shot in and then he threw down a 1 x 2 platform with crafting benches, stove, stash and a couple turrets.  I very much appreciated that, ran around and pulled all the stuff I normally wouldn't because I'd be overweight, scrapped it, and stashed.  Once everybody was done he picked it back up and I'm assuming was planning on doing the same somewhere else.
---
I understand why, I just don't think they should be as readily available. There is no consequence to a poorly planned build or any incentive to team up. Games don't need to be any easier than they already are.
---
That's just my 2 cents worth...
---
Nuke their camp.
---
Happened to me yesterday. I decided to wait it out, and was able to respawn at vault 76 after about 3-5min.
---
Fully optimized it hits very hard with a power attack. Better than many legendary two handed weapons. Some day hopefully we will get legendary variants.
---
Could have sworn I failed it for not activating the barrel, but i may have joined just as the timer was ending and the game read it as no one there so it quit the event out
---
Did you ever get this fixed?  I'm missing them in the Misc area in pipboy also but they annoyingly show up in my HUD still
---
What's the legendary roll? I'm curious
---
It’ll definitely change the field for the better if explosive launchers do get a buff. I want to feel my heart sink when I see someone using a missile launcher in my direction, forced onto the spot of A or B reactions, it’s sad to roll over a chuckle when I see anyone or thing with missile launchers
---
Cant lool. It's in the safe zone.
---
Depends on your build.
---
The 3rd effect can easily be Sentinel's or Cavialer's, which, again, depends on your build. 
---
The 2nd effect is a little harder because it has many viable options.
---
If you have a VATS build, for example, you might want to go with +1 Luck so that you can get criticals with every shot (yes, this is actually possible with about 34 Luck and the Critical Savvy perk).
---
For non-VATS melees, +1 Strength might make more sense.
---
I'm not sure how much AP regen the Powered gives you (or if it's any better than +1 Agility), but it works with almost any build.
---
If you don't need any of these, you could go with +1 Endurance for more HP or +25 Rad Resist, which is good for non-Power Armor low-health builds.
---
Yeah, definitely doesn't work for me.
---
I was there last night and a level 11 built a home "next" to the event, it sort of screwed with the spawning of the creatures coming from where the home was built, plus he built turrets all over it lol. Hopefully Beth can fix this in later meat weeks like they did for WS..
---
400 is decent. If you tag a lot of the enemies you get xp for them too. That's why these events are good for "lower levels" because you have half the server helping you kill things and get xp for it. Just killing as much stuff as you can will get you up to level 50 and you can start rounding out your character and using any item you pick up.
---
I’m 34 videos deep in it, mostly going NW to SE, with the exception of The Crashed Space Station, The Congressional Bunker, The Charleston Capitol Building, and Vault 94, and I’ve got before and after on the Capitol and 94. Missed the opportunity to get the airport before the big update unfortunately.
---
Tbh I can't think of a single game in which buffing killed the pvp, I can think of a plethora of games that have been ruined due to weapons/gear being nerfed due to pvp
---
Lol yeah ok. Keep stalking me, i love fans😘
---
Do the primal cuts even it's a horde mode kill event. You did the bbq one it sounds like.
---
They announced Survival will be nixed soon R.I.P. Survival
---
No video yet?
---
::Shocked Pikachu face::
---
Ah that's a shame.
---
No
---
Also thanks for making the time go by while im at work. You are too sweet
---
Yeah, I dont know why they didnt bother including a no build area around the locations just for the event.
---
I have a reduced weight Vampires Shovel. It's awesome no more looking for a Shovel to complete Buried with Honor. Other than that I don't use it.
---
Find a couple of workshops, capture them, defend them, swap servers, rinse and repeat
---
During double xp it took me 6 hours to level up my level 15 to 57 so it should be pretty easy for you
---
I like it all. Great idea!!
---
Still can't beat a Fatman though :P
---
Yeah, Im not sure what good the sentinels is doing me while I sneak nearly all of the time, but it's nice to just have the mitigation there.
---
Get a bunch of guys together and make some Sausage soup.
---
would love it too... tbh i just want to be able to live in a vault or build one for my camp.
---
I build an unyelding bloodied character during the last double xp weekend to test how broken the game was. And yes, it Is ridiculously broken. Don't use that character at all. Feels like cheating. You become a god. I cant imagine how overpowered it can be paired with sentinel, Cavallier, assassin and all that.
---
The dps is better tho. A fatman can do what 1200 damage per hit, a bloodied explosive handmade can do 1800 per hit or around there
---
Or just do uranium fever and make 1400 caps in less than 10 minutes
---
not even guaranteed to be 3\*...
---
I thought that was still broken... Put on a piece of +1 Endurance gear, it doesnt increase hp at all...
---
Not saying there is. But Phat Dastard sounds like something a teenager from the 90s would've come up with. Zero percent chance I'd want that as my username as an adult.
---
I did 3 last night before my internet cut out and 2 of them spawned legendary creatures in the final wave
---
bloodied doesn't have shit to do with PvP anymore I'm so tired of people saying this. If you're a bloodied pvp build at this point all you're doing is making your health lower in a futile effort to do more than 110 damage at a time, which isn't possible. You can be full health and do the exact same amount of damage.
---
Sniper rifles are shit in this game except for lever actions also those weapons you got aren't that good, you should try to buy a tse/aae one on the trading subreddit
---
I want to leave architectural reviews and scores
---
No shit sherlock
---
I think people should just learn the word "meticulous" rather than throwing around OCD all the time.
---
Nuking is pretty easy
---
You need to make some american friends and then join their server that way.
---
The OP makes a good point, sometimes a players camp really helps you out, and sometimes (not usually) things are sold cheap I'd rather give them a few extra caps.
---
One time i forgot to repair my gear, and it broke right as I was attacked by a super mutant behmoth. 
---
I ran to the near by camp its its defense obliterated it, and I got great loot. Would have been nice to be able to say thanks.
---
Stay tuned! After a few more hours of play I got my character to level 76. So I'm leveling a *new c*haracter who's going to build the ultimate MEAT week camp in Cranberrry Bog.
---
Good to know but unfortunate. All hail the Atomic Shop.
---
A TS Fatman can do a nightmarish *2500* damage per shot. 
---
While a Handmade can do better DPS overall (y'know, since the Fatman has only one shot), a TS Fatman can accomplish doing that amount of damage without having to dedicate a specific build (just Demolitions Expert if you want to further increase the damage and Bear Arms to decrease weight), unlike a Bloodied Handmade build where you have to handicap yourself with low health and you have to dedicate a bunch of cards to increase the damage
---
The best damage in the game is bloodied followed by junkies than automatic rifles/heavy weapons then stealth riflemen with explosive heavy weapons, pistols and shotguns coming in last.
---
Scrapper is your friend :)
---
&gt;exclusive douchenozzle zone
---
That should be added to the game as a fourth Mode. Unlock in the Atom store.
---
Yeah but that damage is still laughably low
---
Because they also gave to build some way to store it that isn't using a dll that hooks random functions in the game to input and output file information
---
There are a few items that can be built, though fewer than there once were. You can still build the satellite dish, and the floor-less version of the greenhouse. There were some raider items that were once buildable, and the theremin as well.  Those are the ones that I know of that are coming to mind.
---
You're not \*meant\* to be able to, but what does that mean in Besthesdaverse? :)
---
No, buffing has killed shit tons of games full stop. 
---
Bringing everything else up to OP standards  take more effort than needing a small subsection of items. 
---
NERF gear only kills games because people cry that their OP toys were taken away undoing all the time/ money spent getting them.
---
Idk, I kinda enjoy leveling up a few times an evening and getting a bunch of legendaries to scrip plus extra scrip from meat and hanging out with Grahm and Chally, having something fun to do in game with the bf.... the list goes on but yes, no reason whatsoever.
---
*2000* instant damage that covers a pretty huge area is 'laughably low??'
---
Name 1 game in which buffing has brought games to a full stop. 
---
As for nerfing, b04, destiny 1 and 2 have all been extremely hurt by nerfs
---
Huh, weird. Thanks for the info
---
I think they sell in vendors
---
Free states vendor, as well as some others, sells them
---
Yes it is laughably low. That is why no one uses fatmans, they are practically worthless
---
I have seen camps on those spots before. I guess these people are just supposed to move their camp or not play for a week ?
---
Most people you see bitching about F76 haven't even played it and you need to own the game to leave a review on Steam. Granted some haters will buy it just for this purpose, but that's a drop in an ocean. [Look at the like/dislike ratio under Wastelanders trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2XdwS4lcZM), no matter how vocal these little shits are, they are the minority, always remember that. So unless Wastelanders will end up being a steaming pile of shit, Bethesda has a pretty reasonable chance to leave mostly negative range.
---
Look at F4 for example, it's sitting at mostly positive even though the very same people who now circlejerk about F76 were portraying it as a Satan's job. Hell, even ESO, which had even shittier start (Game was basically dead for a couple of years), has good reviews now. BGS just needs to get their heads out of their assess, patch up the game and fill it with more content, then no amount of insecure kids will be able to prevent it from getting good rep.
---
Damage output is but one part of the build.  Unyielding armor can help to get your PER and AGL to super high levels which gives commando vats builds a huge advantage in PvP. 
---
The bloodied player is especially susceptible to a gamma gun. I have to run Radshied constantly or get melted
---
DRUGS. 
---
Just kidding. The OP said they are on PS4.
---
Phat dastard
---
At least it will be nukeable.
---
I agree (trying to down play myn OCD...)
---
Either 
---
A) instead of actual caps you could get a note that's untradeable and can be used only at robot vendors
---
B) the loans are account wide and if you take a loan with 3 alts you have to pay it off with your overall cap collection between your characters
---
Ps4&gt;Xbox 
---
For some reason, theres more adults on Sony's platform. Way more seasoned players. Ive met more 40+ folks then i have kids.
---
It's happened before with other changes. Some people had to permanently move their camps. Least this would be temp
---
That's fair but we all have our style and likes. I like to be unique and I can't tell you how many positive comments I got about the name.
---
&gt;They are not dead they are all scorched now.
---
Beautiful words, sir. I will have it made into a tea-towel.
---
The fact they didn't just add tabs to our camp builds to craft placeable junk items is honestly so dumb. like you cab buy all these little plushies from the atom shop, but if you want to display a mr fuzzy it has to be in a glass box? I can display a screwdriver, but in a glass box? let me just craft one as a camp item to set anywhere I want, and make it cost 3 steel. You cant pick it up or anything its just a camp decoration.
---
pics?
---
Sorry guys, trying to remain engaged between meetings at work lol.
---
It is still better than mutants but not as good as aae
---
question: don't have the option to check for myself right now. under what vendor category does magazines show on player vendor - misc?
---
Who knows, maybe this is the prestige system that's coming soon (TM).
---
FYI - there are toons out there who are at or close to level 1000.
---
This is your answer to make it harder? how about just use level one items if you wanna just truly inconvenience yourself.
---
Hmm idk personally I guess Mutants vs Two Shot is really just preference, personally I’d prefer mutants just because I can’t stand the accuracy nerf that comes with ts
---
When they came after the..  not gonna do it lol. But really did they? I bet you smiled when you saw the name, at least a little
---
I would avoid it like the plague.
---
That talking in the background is super creepy. It's very distorted and pretty quiet so it sounds like something straight out of a horror game.
---
Winner
---
Don't give Bethesda any ideas.
---
It would be interesting for high levels but the low levels would be screwed.
---
50 Mini Nukes and one Two Shot Fat Man! I will die in a blaze of glory!
---
Keep wishing
---
Harper's Ferry vendor
---
No but a good option
---
It's just Dm.  I can play the guitar part and I also made up a song to go along with it; The Wasteland Blues.  Only two people besides me have heard me sing it in game.
---
You’re living in the generation of minority rules and over sensitivity.
---
Absolutely! And also running solo...
---
It's the only ps4 game that comes close to the style of gameplay I like. No other options on the market. Trust me i have looked. Pc yes. Xbox yes. Ps4 sadly no
---
I had 23.
---
I’d pick up grenadier and fire in the hole under perception since you’re already rocking explosivex5, I think endurance and charisma are worthless, I have 2 and 3 respectively... Perhaps think about moving those points into Gunsmith and/or Adrenaline x5 would help a lot with up to 60% more damage...  In my experience, all the bloodied damage in the world gets reduced/capped to 110 or so. That will kill players in prob 3-4 hits max. It comes down to placement/accuracy. My two shot auto nade absolutely saturates an area with damage... accuracy not really needed.
---
The point is the kids didn't give two cares about his name. They were salty that he didn't trade with them.  His name isn't really important to the story.
---
I'm willing to try anything.
---
The accuracy really isn't that bad and is negligible if you use vats. Mutants is a measly 10% while two shot is 25% junkies is up to 50% and bloodied is well bloodied
---
Nooooope! No thank you.
---
Ya the face down bear is soo sad looking. I put it next to the threadbare sloth in my display case of lost things.
---
What makes you think I was specifically referring to just online games?
---
Good news: they're going change events to make it so you don't have to tag legendaries to get their loot.
---
yes. my answer IS to make the game more difficult. the game is simply repetitive, there’s zero challenge beside PvP.
---
I'm not the only person who's been paper leaving bags of spoiled food on the pillows/tables of people's C.A.M.P I don't like, am I? You could just as easily leave a few beers or sodas in places you like or low level hovels, but a mail box/guest book would be great anyway.
---
I completely agree on keeping your armor while wearing the Hazmat Suit! That is actually the better ask for Bethesda!!
---
For a long time mine was hangthepedos but I got reported too smh
---
I'll have to find the link but they've addressed this by the fact that they are working on not having to tag legendaries at events to get the legendary from it
---
I get locking off most off your base, but leave some basic stations outside.
---
The worst is when there isnt even a stash box next to the vending machines.
---
No xbox
---
Because fallout 76 is an online game
---
well, i should say this should be a separate mode, like Survival. I don’t think the game should be super difficult for others but it’s too universally simple in its current state. we’re all a bunch of super heroes come level 50-60.
---
Prime Behemoth in Bog hasn't dropped any legendaries this time and I haven't seen any legendaries spawn, but people are saying they can.
---
Customer support can't restore the items. However, the devs can as seen in the multipart series of the user who lost their gear in the raid. Even then though, a lot of attention was given to that issue, so it may have prompted (pressured) elevation.
---
How did your inventory get bugged?
---
You act like people complaining about the game don't have ground to stand on.
---
Guess memory didn't serve me well; thought it had them all the time. Got lucky last meet week then.
---
yeah that’s what i use now but not because i perceived limb dmg as a poor attribute.
---
Nope,Just....Nope.
---
the type of builds one can use are already fairly limited, with most builds being just mild variations of the same standard \[weapon type\] build. this change will encourage players to pick a build that allows them to get the most out of events, meaning even less builds will be viable.
---
a bit of a roundabout and odd way of explaining, i know. i'm never good at explaining my opinion in more than one sentence.
---
My headset mic was randomly on an my girlfriend was watching something like 5 feet away on the bed.
---
A cap for a cap.
---
You can buy them from Vendorbots. Although you might get lucky and find them at Player Vendors for cheaper! Or a friend could build you one. Xbox?
---
Prestige/legendary was originally slotted for mid/late summer
---
Apparently the sale is late october, and if we complete the 3rd stretch goal it will be 50% off. Next week is just the 'Mystery Pick' option at the purveyor 3rd-7th
---
Never go there again
---
camps at primal cuts fucking suck..
---
I love how Mole Rats burrow in the 2nd and 3rd floor of Fort Defiance.
---
I'd make a lot more orbital strike beacons and mini-nukes.
---
I'd like to directly apply perk cards to the stash. (Which may be what you're saying too.) Whether it's weight reduction or Strong Back, let me choose perk cards to specifically apply to the stash, even if I also have copies applied to my character.  Maybe a limit of 10 cards or so if limits are needed.
---
I don’t have explosives I throw so Fire in the hole won’t do anything for me, and Grenader is be useless as I am switching to a FFR one soon, as for gunsmith that’s IMHO another waste of points and it just lowers the rate of weapon durability, I have tons of repair kits and enough junk to get all my repairing done
---
It should actually be possible due to them having a center for the camp location circle and can just calculate if anyone is placed in the range that camps can't be placed around
---
I agree - the difference between the Vault raids on a freshly rebooted or very low player count server vs one that's been up for a while, has active nuke zones, and is full is night and day.  
---
Wound up on a desolate server last night with ny team and it was the best Vault mission runs I've ever had.  Zero lag, everything went smooth, completed on expert with only 2 pump codes which is f'in hard normally as lag will almost universally kill you without at least 3.  
---
After while doing some crafting we realized -  We somehow landed on a server with only 1 other player outside our group.  Only 1 character dot and zero other camps on the entire map.  
---
It shouldn't take an empty server to complete on expert :P
---
What if he all of a sudden had to take a massive dump?
---
Your on xbox, send him a message. I don't see why people make public posts to direct 1 person when they have the option to just direct message.
---
I've been playing this for a while and I don't understand, what can people take from your base that makes it so you need to lock it?
---
Yeah, this happened to me in EQ 20 years ago they made me change my name from Blumpkin
---
Its really great that some of u still enjoy it. Im genuinely happy for u but being a dick hole about it isnt necessary
---
No clue. I noticed some un-droppable and un-scrapable junk in my inventory. The rifle I lost was set on key "3", as a favourite. During a Prime Meat event, I wanted to select my rifle with that button, yet my char didn't swich to it. This is when I noticed it was gone from my inventory. Did a re-log, the bugged junk was gone, as was my rifle.
---
Those things were mean!
---
Even better we should have Whitesprings defended by armored Cazadores... they we can ride into battle like glorious Apocalypse Knights!
---
except you're not just suggesting they nerf enemies, you're suggesting they do that AND nerf how effects stack, essentially nerfing bloodied builds.
---
if the end result is that bloodied is still just as effective, if not more, due to the weakened enemies, then fine. it's a global buff. but not if it ends *less* effective.
---
Ty, that was the real issue I had. It's an exploit of sorts I guess in the ms morality police system.
---
I was able to do the event last night just as a prime cut event happened. No one showed up. 
---
#IT WAS PURE BLISS!!!
---
The amount of Glowing meat/blood I got as well as being able to get 3 legendary items was so wonderful.
---
these workarounds should not be necessary.  Other games have quests with timers that seem to work just fine, Bethesda needs to look into the lag and find ways to mitigate it.
---
High lvls would be screwed too. I'll take it. Among death claw packs. Every death claw spawn should be 2 or 3 of them.
---
I absolutely agree. And I really hope they find a way to improve stability BEFORE they remove survival lol
---
or a lot of stimpaks
---
100k .50 cal bullets is the only friends i need &gt;:)
---
I've seen it for only 240 at the vendors. Which seems cheap for how awesome it is. Chad at Camden Park usually has it.
---
Twice I was burned after spending 3 hours I was 3 minutes from launch and the game crashed both times.   Triple a title everyone.   I don't play anymore.  Fuck this game.
---
Wouldn’t you want the option to do them though? I feel I NEED to do certain events now because they’re so rare. Because primal cuts was cycling so fast I was skipping one here and there. Doing other stuff. Returning. It was nice. 
---
If some events spawn right now, I drop everything and go do them. I let my food get cold. I don’t go to bed for a little longer. 
---
I’d like the option.
---
Bethesda should have treated it like the "Your camp could not be placed" thing and just not place it until the week is over. But as it is now everyone who had their camp in a legitimate spot is a fucking prick?  Im sure not everyone is an asshole on purpose.
---
What if I broke my games CD in half and went outside for once?!
---
The best achievement is grinding for 7600 hrs for 40 atoms. I think you should get 5000 atoms for all  the bullshit we have had to endure since Launch.
---
Yea but let’s not forget if we are talking pvp then 10% is probably all you need, that damn 110 damage cap gets on my nerves as a bloodied build, which is why so many people have been switching to AA or Junkies  recently, but  because of Unyielding the metric ton of AP because of the Unyielding  AP,  serendipity and the other low health bonuses I’ll always keep loving and playing bloodied, like sure that 110 damage cap is insanely frustrating, but I also means I don’t need to use any chems etc or even Vats heads atm or for that matter Vats crit other then to ignore armour. But because bloodied also allows for a ton more bonuses it’ll always remain popular. God I went on a tangent, basically mutants May be all you need to hit that damage cap in pvp depending on your enemy and TS would just basically be destroying accuracy for nothing
---
I got the cherished rolling pin drop. But it's 3 stars so good script, not bad really now that script is an option.
---
I think it's going to be in the new Douch-landers update in Nov.
---
I have done it several times by myself or only maybe 1 or 2 others showing up
---
I've seen multiple Bog bugs so far, and the Behemoth didn't drop any for me either, but I only did one event there so far
---
would probably cost 700 Atoms
---
That sucks, Keep calling and be persistent until they give a proper response. Have to let these companies know they shouldn't just do this crap
---
Open guitar case ftw
---
Yeah that aspect was my absolute favorite. I loved how tense and scary the world felt, having to listen for footsteps and watching your back. For once I understood what all the npcs from previous fallouts were so afraid of.
---
too little too late..
---
fukka hate monger...
---
Take note that the items will match your level.    
---
If you are a "smell the roses" type who likes to explore and take your time leveling up by all means spend some scrip.  
---
But if you are more of a "how do I get to level 400 ASAP?"  type you might want to wait until you are lvl 50+ to spend scrip so you will get max level gear ;)  
---
Not that it matters all that much either way, just fyi.  Also, there's a 50% off sale coming soon so you can get 3\* weapons for only 50 scrip and armor for only 30 thanks to that community challenge we completed so saving up now might make sense so you can splurge once that goes into effect.
---
Except it’s not. Is it a $2 emote also? No it’s 200 atoms.
---
Oh yeah that damage cap is bullshit
---
You earned that one. There are plenty of crass Vault Boy perk icons, and you picked Babykiller
---
Try it in PvP and your opinion will probably change.
---
What if someone forced you to change yours?
---
W, is that you?
---
Oath it is, I’m fine with a damage cap, just not one that’s so low like my god
---
Change Horde events so that you don't have to hit the leader to get rewards.  But hitting any of the horde members qualifies you would be a positive change.  
---
Encouraging people to compete within an event on a damage level sounds like a negative change.
---
How can you do that if you're not teamed?
---
The Executioners Explosive handmade could fetch you 25k if you get on some forums and someone needs one bad.
---
Come on dude dont double down on this shit you already come across as a cunt, it is 200 atoms for an emote yes, but the value of atoms as placed by bethesda is $1 for 100 atoms, therefore it is a price tag of "$2"
---
not the same thing as Padded/Dense
---
I stayed away from one-handed.  It's one of the weaker categories next to most energy weapons. 
---
I did eventually get one handed perks at about level 150 and love the 10mm silenced auto pistol for low level areas.  I give a maxed out version away to low levels because there is lots of ammo and the 10mm weapons have a lower drop rate.
---
But personally on any  heavy gun that isn’t the Gatling gun, in particular legacy gat lasers and plasmas I’d say Vampires is the best, just add beam splitter in the plasmas case and you never die
---
Literally the first person who sees it will buy it for 1000. I sell a 1\* handmade for 1200 in my vendor if it has TS, AA, Furious, or basically anything besides like the ones that do damage to certain species.
---
this^
---
I’ve gotten sludge lung several times from the Grafton Monster
---
No. That is the value of getting faster atoms. For people too lazy or impatient to do challenges. 
---
I earned 200 atoms today in game. East. It didn’t cost me $2. Also I don’t have the ability to cash in my 200 atoms for $2. You know why? Because 200 atoms does not equal $2.
---
Rather than rebuild try picking up your camp and placing it back at the same spot.
---
Usually let's you restore for only the cost in caps.
---
Gratz on stomping those guys :)
---
$49.99 coming to the Atomic Shop soon!
---
Personally I'm glad power armour is not objectively better, really dislike the change from a regular suit to a actual battle tank thing. Would much rather it functioned like 3 and NV.
---
On my experience pvp comes down to positioning, you need the drop on your opponent. Straight up fights are super rare.
---
TS fat man. Upwards 4k damage. So even if you max out your fire proof and use a dense plate bringing you to around 90% reduction... still around 400 damage with direct hit. Pretty fun.
---
I agree and its not enough to get me to watch his videos for informed opinions on anything. But as much as I shit on him for horrible coverage, I figured Id be a hypocrite if I didnt acknowledge when he did something right. But its not like thats enough to get me to link his videos.
---
Dude you seem chill as, my GT is EazeWIN if you ever want to hmu
---
Yes the more the better
---
I heard it's related to system specs.
---
I thought about stash perk cards but I later thought the character cards carried over might be easier to configure since they already exist in game, it would just have to apply to the stash as well as character. 
---
Unless you’re saying to have a new character perk card that would be 1-3 stars lowering over all stash size. That would work as well.
---
They are holotapes with the games. wasteland,  pipfall or something like that are examples. Don’t know if you can put them on racks. Haven’t tried
---
Grahm
---
When the Brotherhood and the Raiders agree, you know it’s a winner! 😂
---
I'm not so sure about that. The word murder is all over this game, half the songs on the radio are about murdering. All those little SPECIAL videos they put out before release reference murderous players. I thought open world PVP was going to be a major part of this game based on that and the trailers and I was really excited for it. If they never intended for us to PvP each other then they really gave a lot of mixed signals.
---
This is how you earn a sub. Thank you for doing this one, and here's to more in the future!!
---
Excuse.me? My ts hits for around 4k.  You can take all the perks and upgrades and still get one shotted by a direct hit.
---
I can take on deathclaws no problem, but those *things* scare me
---
I think the Marine Wet suite is the best underarmor if you don't already know it. I make and mod them to sell in my vendor to make a few extra caps. I've had someone pay 100 caps for the plan before.
---
Nah, clam chowder!
---
I completely agree! You guys have the Timber Rattle Snake, you also have the black widow spider, mountain lions, copper head. Just to name a few of the different predators that lurk in the West Virginia hills.  I think it should be added, because it would make for proper lore for the game.  
---
I wish you and everyone the best.
---
At level 40 you should be able to do any quest you want
---
The only way a ts could hit 4k is if it was a The Dragon and you have a fully crit build and got a headshot
---
I carried  my charecter over from the Beta and played every single session. The with the stash limit being 400 and the vendors carrying so few caps, I dumped a lot of my stuff off right at flatwoods church. I did the same again, mostly ammo during free play week.
---
It's not a reliable place now because there aren't a lot of low level players except for people's alts.
---
I definitely would like to see a community wide established donation area.
---
It would be a lot better than listing stuff for zero in my vending machines, because usally I need that space and those items usually just get tossed out.
---
I’m glad you enjoyed it, I’ll add more lore videos soon
---
My group walked in once and walked right out.  I had rather farm legendaries, events, and explore.
---
Scorched Snakebeast, with wings, it would kind of be like a serpent. Lol.
---
Whitesprings vendorbots
---
Assuming you mean the Prime Cuts Events?
---
Under Aid
---
I have the same issue with exotic foods that give better buffs, like yao guai roast or pretty much anything that takes more than 1 piece of meat and 1 wood to make.
---
&gt; Getting rich which is not a raider goal
---
Here’s a song from Red Eye’s Raider Radio in Fallout 4. Getting rich is definitely a goal shared among many Raiders out there.
---
It's a reflection of the fascist narcissistic society we're headed towards, nothing to see here
---
does anyone know if it’s double xp ?
---
Was just talking to my dad last night about how nice it would be to leave a note at someone’s camp letting them know their work is appreciated. Hope this happens soon.
---
How is it better than a shielded BOS Officer Suit?
---
I feel like we are kind of saying the same things in different ways. I wish primal cuts was less often because of the huge FOMO that I have to do every one or miss out. So it kills my life for the week. I run out of ammo because I'm not doing scrap runs, my dailies don't get done, etc. The normal every day events need to be sped up so it takes away the rarity, (saw uranium fever for the first time last night since the new system) but having them pop as fast as primal cuts does now would be a little much, imho. Make sense?
---
Shotgun+enforcer perk+concentrated fire+limb damage= crippled EVERYTHING.
---
My GT is Soggy Cream Pie. I’ve had it for 2 years and no one ever forced it to change.
---
If anyone reports me, i have a masters in computer science and i will know who filed it. I’ll then proceed to spend all of your credit cards to buy my fat ass some food 🎂
---
I wish I knew one handed was so weak when I started... Should I just start a new character 😂😂
---
Salted so you can sprinkle some salt on the wounds of your enemies.
---
Tagging /u/Valseek &amp; /u/Ladydevann
---
Yes, having public events as often as primal cuts from meat week would be perfect! Non stop action. I also like the idea of having 3 public events at the same time for easy, medium, hard difficulties
---
Complaining is one thing, I do that myself all the time, that's why I've said that in it's current state this game stands no chance. But creating a freaking crusade against Bethesda and all their games is a completely different matter, people I'm talking about don't stop at F76. 
---
Remember, I don't know, Skyrim? The game which completely conquered the internet and made it non-stop orgasm for at least a year? It was everywhere, hundreds of awards, victories in all user polls, tons and tons of awesome fan content and memes. No matter how unrelated the topic was, Skyrim would still find its way in somehow. I haven't seen a game which had an impact like that on the society before, nor after. Seemingly everyone was in love with it, hell, most people still are. 
---
Well, apparently it was a total garbage, or so these nutjobs say. They have a long-brewing vendetta with Bethesda, not only they're not interested in success of their games, they want them to fail, every single time. And when the game which actually deserves such reception was released - the flood gates opened, people weren't laughing at these dorks anymore, because this time they were actually right. But now that they have a voice, they use it, as I said, to slander everything Bethesda ever touched. It's not a critique anymore, it's a purposeful slander.
---
lol, in the kanawah nuke plant r "blank feedback forms" which i sell for 1 cap, tehre r others which rate everything 10/10/10 tho haha.  
---
also, alpine river cabins spawns a "guestbook" note, thats cool for 1/5/10 cap.  otherwise, have a nice quantum nuka now only 9 caps!
---
This should be a new skill you can learn.
---
Honestly the fucking thing that pisses me off the most about that is that I can't launch it from Steam normally, I won't get a free copy to compensate because of that, launching from Steam from the Bethesda copy makes you have to log in every single time, and honestly the Bethesda launcher sucks major ass.
---
I will only buy it if it has jets, and different color lights, and it comes with water. It not like it's not already introduced to the game.
---
AWOL and One Violent Night have provided decent drops for me.  Uranium Fever is so overrated.
---
that's right! Tunnel Snakes Rule!
---
And I'll keep watching and liking. Great job.
---
I sell them for 500 to 800 caps each. I usually pick up 2 or 3 plans a day on one of my spesific runs.
---
Your name might be considered offensive to dogs with legs you need to change it you bigot
---
Then i should stick at pve , its not a big problem to be honest , survival was tempting but as is nuclear winter.
---
Use commie bot flyers. They're pretty easy to get, have no use or value, and weigh 0.
---
Not gonna happen
---
This happened to me couple days ago... The entire event cycled thru and they were all empty
---
This offends me
---
It just happens. In the case of my teammate, her camp location preceded that event
---
It's fine if it doesn't interfere with the event. As long as the enemies aren't being killed by the camps turrets or keeping it from going where it normally would, I would say it's fine.
---
It’s turret camping all over again.  Fuck those players.
---
I think the main problem with events are that they are too easy. Enemy health and damage should scale with the number of people at the event. The rewards should scale up as well.
---
It really depends on the server. I ended up on a server with a total of 4 people on it last night and every primal cuts was empty and meat cook failed with just me in it.
---
Yah makes sense microsoft is pretty clean when it comes to tgat stuff nowadays one time i got a vid in skyrym removed all it was was a naked body tossed down a mountain somehow offfensive
---
Thanks for bringing this up, I spoke with the team and there is a fix coming up for this one.
---
How *dare you*
---
As I said in the post there was no vending machine
---
I almost made a comment on this third video to thank him for semi apologizing...he was such an ass in his first video.
---
Then why would anyone ever take a Hazmat suit off?
---
Wouldn't this result in literally everyone wearing a Hazmat suit at all times?
---
Really, that is just down right ignorant. I would have destroyed his camp, for being stuck on stupid, and have some one kill me and leave my loot.
---
If you still want to PvP in adventure, ranged is always better simply because by the time you reach someone, you dead.
---
I don't get why people are just complaining that "people are just running around". Unless you have your thumb up your ass playing drums or working the spits, you are running around doing all of the other things Grahm mentions...
---
Thats exactly what a hacker would say
---
Cazadores and Nightstalkers, that would be something.
---
New rewards would have been nice, but honestly I like meat week more for all of the snallygasters, honeybeasts, and yaoi gais who drop acid.
---
They also work for the Tadpole badge photos if you still need them.
---
I make the shielded marine wetsuit. It's my favorite
---
Even better
---
ten
---
Usually they are a good thing
---
Shit
---
This, as it is power armor is pretty weak compared to legendary armor.
---
I press the button and there is somewhat of a delay, but for me, it always opens.
---
The critter chunks go in the shopping cart full of meat, its to the left of the Stashbox-looking cooler for the Greens. If you're referring to the Prime Meat, it goes in the thick soup pot next to the Yao Guai on the spit
---
I believe they nerfed shotguns a while back to be like this. Also exploding shotguns have a bug where they heal enemies. I had a stupid good combat shotgun an I gave it up because its constantly got issues with the bug etc.
---
Some.  
---
Hacking.  
---
Is.  
---
Takingplace.  
---
  
---
I knew it, bake him a tray bois
---
That would be amasing, i have a "guest house" at my base w/ bed, stove and weapon/armor bench. Even having a counter of people that used it would be fun XD
---
You need to find the Black Powder Rifle  bayonet  **MOD** and scrap it yes, see almost no one knew that!
---
There's someone with a camp at the Cranberry Bog site who was what I feel quite courteous; the camp is nearly entirely elevated catwalks and stairs so one has a view on the radscorpions that make a beeline for the forests. Their vendors were full of ammo, including lots of 5.56mm. They did have low level MG turrets which helped a bit with the stingwings.
---
But then it just weighs more with added plastic and you still have 2 stacks as soon as you pick up more junk or don't have perfect amounts.
---
I guess but seems like it's not really a bug and more of a preference :)
---
If your camp is in the primal cuts spawn, it's polite to not have turrets and to make sure the barrel is accessible. It can be really useful to have a workbench or two and a stash and even a vending machine on the spawns but if you're there with 20 missile turrets you make it tough for everyone else to participate how they may want to
---
Nice, the Two Shots break fast which sucks. But explains your durability issues.
---
That's a lagey server. I had that happen once.
---
Huzzah. Had no idea!
---
Wow, thank you! I am one of those guys that crafted a ton of rifles and scrapped them to no avail.
---
Such a good idea. I made a more in depth post on this early morning. Got a lot of people saying "too frequent" but as of now if I miss a certain event, say good bye to seeing it so I HAVE to do them right then or risk not seeing them for a while. If they made events last every 15 minutes then I wouldn't mind missing some. The game needs to be a sit down casual buffet, not a small portion fancy restaurant
---
People just make up their own definitions of things, it's funny.
---
Hello and thank you as always..  
---
\-Quest item?  
---
\-when looking at what something scraps down to&gt;?  
---
\-The Duplicates are a bit crazy..
---
\-Agree   
---
\-Agree  
---
Will post in a bit
---
The fix is coming, it will be in the 4Q of 2020, sorry for any inconvenience. Lmao! Sorry just being a smart ass. The truth is as long as you don't lose your character than it has been fixed. 
---
To be serious, it should have been fixed after the last patch, the problem is every time they say they fixed something, it actually never gets fixed. 
---
The game still crashes, I still get stuck in my power armor, enemies still slide on the ground, and disappear after you kill them, my fruits and vegetables still float or disappear. Bethesda has repeatedly said that these same issues have been fixed after every patch since the beginning, and we are still dealing with the same bullshit after every patch? 
---
Nonetheless, I wish you and everyone the best.
---
Nuclear winter is a lot of fun
---
Our event team is taking all these things into consideration when it comes to the performance-based loot changes. Please keep sharing your thoughts and idea's on this while they continue to iron out details!

I only have 23k at the mo but I'd pay 30k+
---
lol downvoted for the TRUTH. WHERE'S MY TENDIES MOLE MOMMY I HAVE MY GOOD BOY POINTS REEEEEEE
---
What u/AlpineYJAgain said (and thanks), basically the recipe for crafting something, as a record it's shorthand is COBJ
---
Thanks for the update! That's good to hear.
---
You wanted somebody to comment on your post, remember??
---
Hmmm did that bug creep back in, where weapons only partially load&gt;?  
---
Next time it happens pay attention and see if the reload was interrupted (Stagger, running, something else)...  
---
Let me know and thanks for the comment.
---
Keep doing that! Thats where I got my 20 of each Fasnacht masks
---
Dont worry ,I was a late bloomer too.
---
But when the time is right you'll know.
---
You'll push through hard and fast and with a big explosion you'll drop huge missile all over the scorch beast queen.
---
I don't run those perks. I know they help but I never have and I've noticed a difference recently.  I'm commenting on the change. If you run those perks though you probably wouldn't have noticed.
---
Enjoy the Silver that was a awesome gamer pic. It's unfortunate the PC crowd got it removed.
---
I dont understand why people do the mass turret thing while going AFK near mob spawns. If your turret kills an enemy that you never shot, you dont get xp, right?
---
maybe it's you..
---
so the durability loss is ammo spent related, in such case is better a slow paced mod.
---
I will find you.
---
Spot on.
---
If it is not already possible, perhaps it should at least be allowed to wear underarmor with hazmat suits and power armor. It does not give much advantage, but it is better than nothing, and why should one have to be naked under those suits/power armor?
---
The trick is to be the only one on there Fisher price servers, that way you get consistency and  stability on the server. Lol. 
---
I wish you all the best.
---
Thanks for the comment!   
---
I've got the fast travel bug documented on this page.

[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 13.1 | 09/17/2019 - Hotfix after QoL on “Public Events.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d7yabb/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/)

**Bug: Mr. Messenger:**
---
Hmmm was the server laggy at all?   
---
**Bug: Heart of the Swamp:**  
---
During the fight it just vanishes?   
---
**Bug: Plasma Flamer:**  
---
New one, I've seen the reload glitch where a weapon can take the ammo quantity of another weapon, but never 999, anything unusual happen that login? (Ask questions to try and replicate or isolate)
---
Pre patch 13 and maintenance I was blue screened 2-3 times an hour on ps4.  Post patch it happened once in 4 1/2 hours.  Not sure about what happened for you, but the game seems to be in much better shape than it has in a long time.
---
I love this idea. We definitely need a sort of Donation Box. I don't know how many times I've tried to give newbies stuff either by trade or leaving it in the ground only to have them run away, lol.
---
I can't imagine what it's like to have a buggy system.
---
i'm 203 and still haven't dropped the bomb; i like taking my time with games like this haha
---
Thanks for the comment...  
---
The Scraptron seems to be a little "special", I'll try and see if I can't find and replicate the issue.  
---
The Handmade Rifle have a vanilla paint, it's a placeholder that vanishes when removed, annoying but it will make sense once there are more textures available for it.
---
REEEEEEEE
---
Next update: Atom shop exclusive meat freezer... but it only holds radroach meat and for some reason royal jelly.
---
What about dogs?
---
Iirc Durability is based on the amount of times you hit your target. 2 shots hits twice and breaks twice as fast.
---
Nah I like their meat
---
You must be incredibly unlucky then because i play daily on ps4 and literally only experience minor bugs every few hours or so. You're obviously over-exaggerating. Nice Try.
---
That’s my guess as well, like a game relaunch with new big content (new main quest) and official steam release.
---
Angry Joe's thumbnail had the reg helmet up.  Great job doing 5 seconds of research on his part.
---
Incredibly annoying. People are putting them on top of the one in the Savage Divide. I fast travelled to it, spawned stuck inside his structure and had to fast travel to the train station to get out. Also screwed up respwans when dying. Just move it a little bit further. Dont need to be on top of it.
---
Yep and that would make weapons that do radiation damage completely useless against other players
---
It's  coming in the late 4Q of 2025, Because Bethesda is still trying to figure out server stability. 
---
What is this...
---
Cazadores are evil and they do the devil's work.
---
Got a lot of people saying "too frequent" but as of now if I miss a certain event, say good bye to seeing it so I HAVE to do them right then or risk not seeing them for a while. If they made events last every 15 minutes then I wouldn't mind missing some. The game needs to be a sit down casual buffet, not a small portion fancy restaurant
---
It's cazadores, nobody wins and everyone dies.
---
It definitely makes the game less boring being able to go from went to event especially when you’ve completed the whole main story
---
Also 2 shot still only uses 1 ammo per "shot" basically it fires two rounds per shot each round is half the weapon damage. Both shots have to hit the target to get full damage.
---
If you turn on the damage numbers you can see this in action.
---
They should have little Mr. Pebbles running around.
---
I sat there for quite a while, trust me I know lag. I'm on satellite. This was just not accepting the meat.
---
Shotguns are just useless in general
---
At that point power armor loses everything that makes it unique in Fallout.  In 3 and New Vegas it was just a metal suit.  The US army pre war wanted power armor to take the position of actual MBTs so a battle suit makes more sense than...  Well, medieval metal armor with modern aesthetic and a few other buffs
---
If you only want it to display because it looks cool, why not just use a non-legendary version that every other super mutant drops?
---
I would add one or two pieces with poison res on them with how strong poison now.
---
Oh, well, I had that happen to me once. I cant tell you why then.
---
I should clarify that I do not STAY at those workshops. I cap them, set up my stuff and then go do other stuff. I defend against mobs, but generally don't wait around for players to attack. A lot of the folks who contest to initiate pvp don't even follow through on capping the workshop, and sometimes you can sneak back in and get your materials even if they do. (don't lock your extractors).
---
Sitting there and getting nothing cause you did nothing isn't leeching, sitting there and getting the exact same as the ones that did something while doing nothing is leeching
---
Yeah well I would say going to the Grahm event after 3 clicks going nowhere and then 10sec after getting there is a server disconnect and then 10 more minutes to get back online and then all the events are done, is the exact opposite of a positive experience.
---
Then going to an SBQ event got zero loot, waited 10 minutes still zero loot
---
So
---
they
---
can
---
suck
---
it, nothing positive to see here
---
If you're on PC you can have it if I get one. I got like 3 last time but they're so stupidly heavy I just scrapped them, of course people were selling them for 8k and crap lol O\_o
---
Ever seethe movie 40 year old virgin? We could do a rienactment,except with nukes!

" What does pushing a the launch button feel like?"
---
"Yeah, it's nice. You know, when you, like, you push the button and it's ... And you feel it and ... It feels like a wet bag of sand when you're pushing it."
---
I have PvP with a passion, I loath the idea of playing survival.  Games like fortnite turn me off so much.  Even games I love that push me into PvP even for little things make my blood boil.
---
I kinda enjoyed NW.  If you're at all a fan of PvP, I'll bet you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of it (if they ever fix all the exploits at least).
---
Honestly it’s weird most of the complaints on this game are all about bugs but for me I think the game just really lacks content I’m not really that bothered by some bugs tbh I just hate getting bored when this is the game I want to play
---
I never seen a non feral dog before, but add normal and inmortal dogs to pet sounds good to me

---
Has anyone seen a double or quad fat man? That's what I'm looking for, I wanna rapid fire them fuckers.
---
Meh. 
---
Ultracite would be a deal breaker for me.
---
Cat meat is so delicious though
---
There is one domestic dog that sits on top of the hills above harpers ferry.
---
I think that Bethesda issues are there servers, due to the amount of Items in game. It causes severe instability because of the amount of codes that have to be processed. The only way I think they might be able to get around this issue is to allow you to store this information on your  platform harddrive. 
---
I wish you the best.
---
It's not the lore perspective, just the implementation. I don't like the Hud, the clunky nature of it or how slow they are. Very much a fan of not feeling like I need to wear it.
---
I think given its current implementation they should dramatically buff it but make it supremely difficult to keep up. That way the overwhelming advantage it could offer would be offset by its very low endurance.
---
i would imagine it would also necessitate an overhaul of the events themselves.  meat week has shown how lots of little, disparate tasks share the load for an event's success.  the pylons on encrypted are another example of non-direct fire contributing to event's success.
---
You completely missed the point of my comment.
---
Have they changed it so you can even mod the weapons? Voice of Set seems cool but you cant even add a fucking long barrel or scope or anything
---
I was actually convinced the long con was on and the next post would be an apology about taking care of his sick girlfriend and “video coming tomorrow” etc.
---
I wonder how many players were long/short/rapid pressing the light button or key to test this :D
---
i hope they can add modifiers to events that are level appropriate to each unique event.  a low level can engage in action X, while higher levels contribute Y damage
---
With all the negatives about Vault 94 I don't think it is worth it at all to go in there. I won't go in there until Bethesda fixes it and it works the way it is supposed to work.
---
I’d settle for just letting you immediately return to what armor you were wearing before you put the hazmat suit on.
---
I thought it had a list of specific chems you had to make
---
eww, bug jizz everywhere, eh?
---
oops responded to the wrong comment
---
I want one that I can display when I'm not using it then take out of the display when I want to. That way I can alternate weapons for display racks and use less storage space on my character/stash
---
cute, when you know for a fucking fact this game still isnt stable
---
maybe its bethesda (ps- its bethesda)
---
Is it on the list?
---
I can see why it’s popular. You can potentially walk out with up to 120 scrip in less than ten minutes with 0 danger involved and minimal resource expenditure. It’s very low hanging fruit, and people can be astonishingly lazy. Since it’s so easy, there’s nothing to scare off even the most casual player.  
---
Not that there shouldn’t be entry level content, but the introduction of scrip has bastardized that event. It used to be an excellent source for earning some starter gear to make it easier to farm tougher enemies, but scrip turned it into a turkey shoot for players that should be hunting much more dangerous game.
---
Legendary scorchbeasts would be really nice. At least the risk of people one hitting them would largely be eliminated. It’s easy to step off the gas even if you have a bloody prime LMG. A bloody gauntlet build just needs to stop sneaking to not kill it in one hit.
---
Still a lot of negativity, not like it's just starting today for instance, trying to Join the Grahm event after 3 clicks but going nowhere and then on the 4th attempt got there and 10sec later there is a server disconnect and then another 10 minutes to get back online and then all the events are done, is the exact opposite of a positive experience.
---
Then going to an SBQ event got zero loot, waited 10 minutes still zero loot,
---
cant imagine what it's like to ignore problems in a game over a year in
---
It sure as hell is a lot more stable than you claim. Lol
---
10/18 range/accuracy sounds like a bug.  The 2 shot modifier reduces accuracy but iirc not by \*that\* much and it doesn't affect range at all.    
---
Some mods will also reduce range but getting it all the way down to 10 seems like a stretch.  I've seen shotguns get down to the 30's, maybe a tad lower, but 10 is crazy low.  
---
The Explosive bit doesn't matter so if you can compare to any other same level/mods 2 shot pump that would confirm if it's a bug or not.  In the meantime I'd probably send a ticket to Bethesda though I doubt that will resolve it even if it's bugged.
---
You made my day, thanks you I needed this XD
---
Well considering BGS has a habit of delaying things the game needs desperately we’ll see! That feature should’ve been here since launch that’s all I’ll say :-)
---
Ya, honestly most the big youtubers did a horrible job on this story. From what I saw Juiceheads first video was the quickest with the accurate info and mrmattyplays also had a quick corrected info video.
---
If your crops are destroyed, and you dont have it's to repair you can scrap them and it will give you whatever it was. (You may the need scrapper perk equipped). That way you can simply replant it without hunting for replacements. Saves a lot of time.
---
I'm a sneaky sniper and melee. Having 20+ Strength helps a lot.
---
PS4 as well... I see maybe two or three bugs a week.
---
The game challenge gives you a list of 10 or so items.  You pick 5 of them. Psycho is usually not one since it’s not a healing item.
---
I think that it would be nice for us to be able to equip perk cards onto our CAMP module, to a maximum of three stars, to change how objects weigh in our stash, even if your camp isn't currently placed. 3 one-star cards, or 1 three-star card or whatever to reduce the weight of stuff more important to you in your stash. Even the card that changes food spoil time could be used here.
---
There aren't a ton of weight reduction cards to pick from right now, but picking which ones and how many stars you want to use would at leave give us some choice and flexibility in how we manage those resources.
---
Plus there are some items that really could have their weights changed so we aren't as punished for collecting them, there is no way a bobble-head should weigh a whole pound for example.
---
Right which falls in line with what I’m saying.
---
If your camp is one of those camps then just store the turrets for the week, no biggie.
---
What I gathered from that was they are able to restore an old save of the character so newly acquired items means you're still shit out of luck.
---
I agree with that. We're also due for it in Q1 2020 so it's still a while yet. Maybe one day Bethesda's ass will catch up to their face
---
Damn..I had same thought lol
---
Bethesda aren't the ones getting dunked on up in here...
---
See theres assholes on both sides
---
same happened to me only at the forest finally got my backpack a little while ago finally a possum scout
---
Do you have a suppressor on it? Because that will definitely reduce the range to about 10 iirc. Shotguns are basically melee weapons with ammo in this game, it's just how she goes.
---
Thanks mister, that's pretty spiffy. I miss seeing it every time I turned on my xbox. Now I have to settle for a pic of vault boy doing the Michael Jackson crotch grab.
---
Hey buddy I'm not tryna diss you or anything but if you're in the endgame you really shouldn't be concerned with fast travel caps. At that point in the game you should have enough caps or at least know how to make enough caps daily to barely even notice the price of fast traveling. Are you using travel agent? Also events should be paying you enough caps to make up for the price of the travel.
---
I'm doing some assuming here, but there is a story down in Beckley there was a sandwich shop selling burgers with cranberries in them that became very popular, a competitor moved in and started selling the same sandwich cheaper. The owner investigated and found they were bringing in the "diseased cranberries" from the bog that's been being nuked to make ultracite.  
---
The miners where all over those sandwiches and it started them on their path to mole miners.
---
I also like the theory that they are the children of the coal miners who were evacuated into the mines during the great war and then grew up into the suits.
---
I don't mind other people's turrets killing the minor mobs at all.  It's helpful.  Goal is to finish all the waves to get the prime cuts.  If I miss out on the XP it's nbd.
---
The big prizes the alpha, especially if its legendary, and the prime cuts.  All I want and the turrets aren't going to keep me from those.
---
&gt; Most people going around picking fights have a group backing them.
---
That is what cowards always do.
---
Kill. It. With. Fire.
---
i can tell you that it happened to me, and if i had recorded it, im sure you'd say it was edited to make them look bad. stop being a shill
---
Hahaha, I get that they’re focusing on Wastelanders &amp; I want them to because I feel like this is a make or break dlc point. If it comes out &amp; it’s buggy as hell &amp; the serves can’t handle it I feel like this game will lose a very large amount of its player base. But they can do minor updates that add small things like not having to tag a legendary it’s not like we ever get anything good from them anyway it’s just good scrip😂 also why not raise the daily scrip amount? I see like MAYBE 5 posts a month on here about something good they got from murmur sometimes even less. I’ve gotten one good role ever &amp; since that BE .50 cal I got it’s all been scrip from the lady 😂
---
I've had a lot of weapons and aid items showing duplicate amounts in my inventory lately. I can inspect one but the other just shows the 308 ammo box. It usually gets fixed after switching servers but it seems like the servers are having a lot of inventory issues.
---
Just for some perspective: I have literally 150+ hours in the game and have never crashed or blue screened once and I’m on a regular ps4
---
Are you a Brotherhood spy?
---
Thanks, didn't know that.
---
Some players will put lower level legendaries in their vending machine, usually at a reasonable price.  
---
You may be better off not trying to rush the game - its going to take you some time to level up - and there's more than one quest/mission that will provide you with a level appropriate legendary.
---
There are 96.
---
Yeah. Pretty cool to cripple both of  a deathclaws legs. It just lays there.
---
One issue with being a gamer dad is realizing that when I tell the kid he needs to turn off his Switch, I can't sit there in the same room logged into discord and playing 76...   
---
\#adulting.  
---
\#ouchy
---
Haha yeah not sure why my camp would offend-has defensive structures for fighting but no turrets and weapon/armor benches in case someone’s gear break~also not in the way so I hope OC considers this next time they decide they wanna get off
---
check the list first my man
---
on another note do you guys know how can I buy drug recipes?
---
What where the effects on it?
---
My husband and I have been attacked twice. Both times we were forced to fight it. There’s still partial damage on a lot of conditions bars.
---
They can’t restore item all they can do is give you much older save of your character.
---
You're describing a mule.
---
I like performance based loot, but the loot is the same for everyone in the event. Make the event harder the more people that are at the event. The more enemies, or waves defeated make the loot better, but let everyone get the same loot. Yes, it opens up problems where some people do more than others, but IMO it is still the best system.
---
Once you read (pick up) a Robco Fun magazine you get the stat boost, the magazine goes away, and you are left with just the holotape game. 
---
At least that’s what I remember.
---
keep exploring. 
---
Sell junk, unwanted weapons, excess mats and aid to vendors - you'll need the caps :)
---
It might be convenient to have an option that makes non-hostile creatures not targeted by VATS. Although turning that off is also useful during the meat cook event. But normally, it is just an annoyance to get a random squirrel targeted instead of the attacking deathclaw or other monster.
---
They are doing the legendary special stat/perk thing coming with wastelanders. For every 50 levels you achieve, you get to make a special stat legendary, and choose a special perk card. This card will be to be used on alternate charecters.
---
I haven't seen much clarification from BGS as to whether each special can be legendary multiple times, or if the perk card takes points or not. 
---
It's not a raw special stat every fifty levels like OP suggested, but it sounds similar to me.
---
for perspective - I've been playing since beta on a regular ps4, and i've had so many crashes and failure to loads, freezes and other issues that It's not even fucking funny. 
---
grow up.
---
[Yes, of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W4tWPI1o1g&amp;feature=youtu.be). I checked the list before.
---
There's the man of the hour.
---
We are already getting something similar to this next year.  
---
Also, allowing players to increase SPECIAL ranks further is a terrible idea.  Sounds cool until you realize the builds that would be possible.  It would trivialize endgame content to the point of making the game so boring that it would lose all appeal.    
---
If content then gets created to challenge these high level god tier characters, it would be too hard for anyone else to enjoy.    
---
It sounds like Bethesda is actually going the opposite directions - they are planning to make high level characters weaker and low level players stronger so they can all play nice in events.
---
Maybe you need a better internet connection.
---
Second roll?
---
You would want probably tripple that to even get a chance at obtaining any legacy energy weapons.
---
its not the internet connection, no other game does this across any of my other systems. its bethesda.
---
There isn't a built in messaging system.
---
There are markets for fallout that you can price check and people will tell  you the value.
---
I can’t really take this suggestion seriously because if you don’t have the self control to just not spend, a “savings account” won’t help you. 
---
That second part is just you asking for a cap limit increase, which they just gave us.
---
Executioners Gamma Gun. Nuff said.
---
Yo a tip jar would be kinda cool. Or like even “hey this camp is pretty cool, here’s a few caps”
---
so what you really want is a rise in the cap limit
---
A sliding scale would be nice. Over the course of the past couple months I’ve noticed more and more players complaining about no queen loot during Scorched Earth. Considering that you need to deal 1000 damage to get her loot, and the increase in bloody prime LMG and explosive auto lasers, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for players without top shelf guns to deal enough damage before she goes down.
---
That being said, a lot of those players are well over level 100, so I don’t know how that issue could be solved aside from reducing the damage/loot threshold to 500 or even 100. On the other hand, I’d only need to shoot her once with a bloody prime hunting rifle and then I could just camp out. 
---
The disparity in player strength is the larger issue, and it’s pretty common with all multiplayer games. How do you challenge the top 5% while not excluding the other 95%? I don’t think creating tasks for casual players to complete while Bloody Joe mows down everything that moves is fun for everyone. We play games to be heroes, not custodians.
---
This sounds cool. Just want some incentive to keep leveling late game. I usually start a new character after getting into the early 100s
---
Depends on what you are looking for.
---
Personally, I go for the one that doesn't bloat the weight by an even more ludicrous amount than it already has... can't remember which one that was.  The other two - apparently bolting those shakers on the side adds like 8 WT to it.  Who knew?
---
This would be more op than PA + armor.  Legendary armor effects already vastly overpower PA and adding permanent 1000 rad resist + the inherent rad damage reduction bonus from a hazmat suit would make rads a complete non issue.  
---
Only players that would run PA would be heavy weapons for stabilized or people who just like the aesthetic/role play aspect of it.
---
Yep, we're on the same side.
---
5 healing items. I was shocked to find beer didn't count either.
---
Dude chill out
---
Yeah, spend real life money so you can store more fake videogame money.
---
No. Something that doesn’t require you to swap out and trade items and caps. An idea like this removes the need to have mules for caps.
---
If it's there as a convenient workbench/stash point, it's fine to me.
---
If it's loaded for bear with turrets blasting missiles constantly and luring the enemies over to it, I'm not.
---
Perfect opportunity for new recipes, plus it seems like they kept the scouts open with another scout level too? There's banners for Tadpole, Possum, and Squirrel. Would like to see more of this AND the rest of those mounted heads. Maybe they could even give us a new food item that won't spoil. Like pre-staled popcorn. I don't think that they're done with this faction, gonna add onto it with the rest of them hopefully
---
yeah, that hit me after i spent a few minutes rebuilding all my PA. (its been that long since ive been in adventure mode) and touched the map and realized. "holy shit, there's still nothing to do"
---
I had a camp there for a while, to keep that dog company. He didn't really seem to care so I left. He still didn't seem to mind.
---
Would be nice to be able to leave ATOMS, too...👍
---
I would have a camp there and my recording device on to make salt for my fries!
---
It just helps when something goes wrong, stealth is broken, and 3 guys are shooting at you. You stand up, and aloof a sudden you are more tanky
---
You say all this as if it's not intentional so they can pump out more garbage for those sweet, sweet clicks.
---
With the addition of NPCs it would be REALLY easy to open a bank... just sayin Bethesda.... just sayin.
---
Barely.
---
This sounds way too entitled. 
---
So long and thanks for all the fish.
---
I stumbled across it by accident......June  over sixth months after release. I was both happy and mad at all the time I wasted not knowing about it.
---
So that's where my deathclaw went ):&lt;
---
I'd settle for  being able to cross the river.  A lot of empty map already visibe to the west...
---
Coming soon to the atom store for only 800 atoms!
---
 Cool may take you up on that, that the only task I need to get my backpack. I’m geo4 on PSN
---
I'm not sure it's the exploding effect specifically that does it... although it doesn't help.  The game struggles to deal with all those pellets striking an enemy at once.  My Bloodied Combat Shotgun is just as "useless" as my Instigating Explosive for this reason.  The exploding effect just doubles the amount of hits to figure out.
---
A donations 📦
---
Idc about a cap raise I have litterally never even had 10k caps I just thought that a lot of people wanted it
---
lol, sure why not.  It would spice shit up at least though I can hear the whinging already about how hard this would make the game :P  
---
In the meantime plenty of stingwings in vault 94 :P
---
You must have never had a mob spawn inside someone’s building and be unable to get in and kill it to complete the event?  
---
It’s rare but with the prime meat events going on this time and last they should have learned and disabled the area.
---
It's a fantastic idea, basically "disassemble" the original mod to learn the item, and for things like bayonets etc, it would be nice, but it's the ONLY one of it's type in the game.
---
[Obviously I checked the challenge list what to craft.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W4tWPI1o1g&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Happy to help and this proves it's an issue :)
---
I did and thanks :)
---
Haha. I thought the same. He’s got everyone with controllers holding, tapping, smacking, and banging their B and Circle buttons like it’s going out of style. 
---
Sadly none of that turns on the cool lights
---
I agree, I like that idea
---
I have a camp just south of the Mire event and last Meat Week, if people didn't kill things quickly, they would just come to my camp and destroy it lol
---
It amazes me. In a video game, you can be whatever you want to be. Yet so many people still choose to be bitches. Lol.
---
Tomato / Tomatoe....   
---
Some of us see the fact the Bulks exist, but we cannot craft them as a bug, others, well, not so much.
---
It almost gives you more incentive to keep starting new charecters  since the xp requirements go up with each level. You could get more  legendary specials to share amongst your charecters. 
---
So now that I think about it, it's not thatbsimmilar to your idea after all.
---
I personally am hoping for a few more special points   
---
with wastelanders. I'm assuming charisma will more valuable and mine is at 3.
---
Don’t say that. They’ll do it.
---
At least give them 8 respawns.
---
Yeah, that is true. Usually I just sprint for cover but that would work also
---
I got teamkilled in a rank match for Rainbow Six siege at start of game, the kid laugh so i called him a fucking cunt.  
---
Anyways i was banned for like a month.  Would still call him a fucking cunt.
---
no suppressor on it
---
If that’s how you play, Cavalier is probably superior.
---
I've seen this posted before but either way its such a good idea!!
---
It would be cool. But someone better explain how they cross the whole of the  Continental USA.
---
I honestly don't think Bethesda wants you to make a new character. I think they want you to earn your keep, the more you play the better your selection are for multiple percards. 
---
For example I  am  a level 350, I have enough percards to make pretty well every build, in addition I am able to have multiple percards that are the same, so I can level up or down my percards as I need to. 
---
Example,
---
3 percards that are the same, card 1 has one perc point, card 2, has 2 perc points, card 3, has 3 perc points and so on, and so forth. 
---
Is it a pain in the ass yes, because you have to constantly  switch your loadouts, but if you are organized and diligent it works well. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
bloodied is by far the easiest build to defeat in pvp.  
---
Legendary effects I think would be fine so long as you could only use 1\* items.
---
it would be the counter-move to the bloodied meta. so plz no.
---
It is certainly not that easy to fight in PA with seasoned pvpers; gets wrecked fast. So I try to stay as far as possible, crouch, cloak, move often, deploy PA frames (great decoy)... Probably the worst thing to do is to run straight forward.
---
You can't be VATSed in active stealthboy torso and people relying on fallout aimbot are often bad shots. I've spent quite some time in various mp fps, so got that going for me. Also certain HWs hit surprisingly hard and accurately - if you can, get executioner's FFR/explo gatling or 50 cal for long distances and some nice LMG for CQ. Also explo harpoons and certain legacy thingies wreak havoc, but those are obviously much harder to procure.
---
Guess they really have it out for you guys.
---
nuke it.
---
Yeah, didn't work for me [either](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/da43d1/crafting_psycho_does_work_in_todays_craft_chems/). Had to hunt for a new recipe as I only had 3 Mentat-based, Psycho and Overdrive.
---
My main is melee, so I have like 2 Cav and 2 Sent on him and I just sorta adopted that gear specc because it worked well for him. Obviously Bloodied Stealth is a lot different, so likely just my failure to really consider what I need for my stealth guy. He uses pneumatic chest mod, but I may go with dense as some others have mentioned.
---
Really depends on that second star.   If it’s FFR you have something worth caps.
---
Lol hell no😁
---
He'd be better on the radio.  His lips don't move.
---
Double Gauss Rifle +25% ROF +25% Quicker reload, PC
---
no way! F those things.. lol
---
Yeah, I think a mixed set is probably better for most people unless you are super disciplined and do exactly what the armor is built for every time.  Meaning standing in place, or sprinting.
---
That same guy who brought the sloth to west Virginia brought a jar of bees.
---
Mad Mex!
---
Because balance. But I feel ya. Maybe it does that but lowers you base weight or something to counter that.
---
Which is a really sad story, Bethesda
---
It's really good.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
The game needs more cap sinks, not less. Caps are already worthless as is, removing these sinks will just devalue it even further.
---
Let's grind them with power-possum badges
---
I show up with an underpowerd Tesla and just shoot the other players so it chains and tags the mole miners. I usually get hits on 2 out of 3 legendary
---
maybe it's maybelline..
---
Server stability is paramount.  Any change that might add more lag is a bad idea.  So yeah I agree but it's clear they need to further optimize the game as reducing the frequency of events has clearly made the servers more stable (though still not as stable as one would hope).
---
You do know that cazadores are made in the BigMT by their scientists. Also we don’t even know of their exist creation.
---
I would rather they spend the time improving the game and fixing bugs rather than waste it on something stupid and unnecessary.
---
That's just nitpicking I barely notice that lol
---
The Tesla’s good, but you also have to watch out for griefers that purposefully leave the event and try to kill you once you tag them by accident.
---
That is a tough loss. I've got a quad aim damage gauss if you want that.
---
It sould be no different than the Double or Quad legendary. The only difference is that you would have to find the Plan and craft the mod. Have like all the other mods where is cost stable flux to craft.
---
I just buy something small, as a tip
---
Just let me know when on. I’ll be happy to help.
---
That's really nice of you, what's the price? My ingame name is Cephei\_27
---
I don't know, after the public events change my game crashed more. Then the maintenance from Wednesday helped it out a LOT. of course this could all just be placebo
---
Unless you're using enforcer
---
I'm telling you that it's on your side, otherwise it would be happening to literally everyone
---
No worries there I run pacifist
---
The problem is that most builds have zero viability in PvP. And generally speaking it doesn't even come down to the actual build but is crutched on the equipped legendaries.
---
PvP is not balanced regardless because there is no balancing it. If someone just playing the game regularly can be locked out of an entire gameplay mode and field of player interaction by something as simple as the way their character is, the PvP is fundamentally flawed.
---
In many games there are different character builds or classes that perform better or have different duties in a PvP environment. That is a successful and balanced experience.
---
Here, if you haven't managed to make a specific type of cookie-cutter build with certain legendary drops...then you're outed from effective gameplay.
---
I dabbled in it. It's garbage and my gameplay experience is better without it. I can only hope it finds balance in 2020 with the release of factions. Otherwise, it's just a hilariously broken system to grief each other and grief your fellow griefers.
---
No skill, no fun, just rock-paper-scissors where you lose and gain caps.
---
Uhm, survival mode is being terminated. First off, and second... why did I get downvoted? The main story line takes a couple of days with friends to complete. It’s stupid quick. I was really bummed when I finished it. I wanted more. Exactly as the OP is saying..
---
Even if it's not, it's still worth caps.  Several, in fact.
---
Correct, but you can loot it.
---
True, I forgot about that. I’ve noticed that despite the option being there, not a lot of people turn it on.
---
Horde events are way up there with events that need shared legendary loot. Usually the first person to find the boss gets the loot. 90% of the time they’re an insanely squishy low level enemy. I can’t even hit most horde bosses with the backup vampiric hatchet or Molotov that I carry as tagging weapons. 100 damage will kill most in one hit. Even the splash damage off an explosive bullet could be lethal.
---
It’s very frustrating when you’re frantically sprinting towards a horde boss and some random super mutant squashes it as soon as you load into a building. At least one person is happy when a human player kills it. There’s no winners when it gets killed by AI.
---
I'm triggered by this lol
---
How are you staying connected that long...I only get a couple hours at a time with sticks banded in photo mode on the drum before it kicks me...I guess someone could always have led an enemy to me. But I am always disconnected after a few hours.
---
Mines one too of it and it still starts. You don’t need to hit the drums.
---
probably clinique
---
Yeah so true, they need to fix this one the most. There's only a few guaranteed legendary events not already on the public list. Just make it so all legendaries can be shared regardless of event type
---
/r/Ooer is over that way ----&gt;
---
How reliable is this? I played for almost 3 hours and only saw 1 that iirc started around 9:20 central time. Checked back at 11 (waited until 11:10) and no cookout.
---
Dunno much about xbox, but on pc basically no one will sell legacy for caps (as caps are pretty much worthless for traders), only trade for another one or 2 - 5 non-legacy legendaries, depending on their rarity...
---
You have to decide what you want, then fit it all in.
---
I combed through my camp and found some inefficient wiring. Cut down on turrets, actually made the defense better in the end. Fit in the scrap collector and quest computer, even had room for a couple more lights and a few magazines.
---
Does each event have a legendary?
---
I dont have this issue on my one x? The other games you tested are they online worlds? Could it be your internet?
---
I know shotgun where nerfed, but I have also seen other people TSE shotgun with much higher range and accuracy. My brother I has a TSE combat shotgun that has much more range and accuracy then my pump.
---
Yeah, I havent been able to message players at all on PC. This needs to be fixed immediately
---
If I still have it free. It was a drop.
---
What?
---
It is still really useless unless you just like laughing at the mobs at 95% health that are 100% crippled.
---
Bethesda 2018 "We making atomic store so we can give everyone all the dlc for free"
---
Bethesda 2019 "Due to popular demand we will be selling dlcs"
---
Surely there must be something you want/can use. When should I be rdy?
---
I have one of those, I like it a whole lot. Prime it and you've got yourself a SB and SBQ destroyer.
---
Yep I'll agree with Underarmor for both Hazmat and PA.  Not OP and makes total sense.
---
.
---
So basically a plan version of quad legendary effect? Even with f you could tailor that idea down a fair and effective thing. I highly doubt it could be added. It’s too free in terms of what it does.
---
You don’t have to do every event. If you know it’s going to cycle back around in an hour, it’s no skin off your neck to skip one because you’re otherwise occupied.  
---
I think we need more things to do, and the Primal Cuts frequency is great for that. You can skip one without worry, because there’s another one right behind it.  It’s not the end of the world if you miss a few while doing your daily quests or gathering guns at Harpers Ferry to clear your daily 1400 caps.
---
Won't be for a few weeks. After meat week is over we will start part 2 if Clean Appalachia. Once we finish that we will get the sale
---
I got nothing
---
What your build?
---
The pump is pretty terrible, the Combat shotgun is not bad, I dont know about the double barrel. I got a TSE pump awhile ago and it was the worst, all it does it like 2-3% damage on a creature and cripples the fuck out of it. But someone bought it for 8k off me, though, so that was nice...
---
I've had zero disconnections since the last update.
---
Only random blue screens usually on SBQ events.
---
Wouldn't it be better to be afk on thr drums?
---
Bloodied level 10 sniper rifle will take you to 45 in the bog, on survival. Put your camp back there and sleep, make cranberry juice.
---
That would be a great idea.
---
To be precise, it's slated for the 21st. Assuming we clear the goals for part 2.
---
Figured we would be able to get the Tenderizer plans for meat week, and thus unlock Legendary versions at mole mama. Thusly then able to turn in our good boy points (scrip) for tendies (Legendary tenderizers). This faith was misplaced
---
Maybe a better solution to all of this would be to have different versions of Hazmat and/or Mods for Hazmat.  More grind and more content.
---
Armored Hazmat (suit or Mod) +50 DR/ER
---
Large Pockets Mod
---
Camelback Mod
---
etc.
---
I very rarely have disconnects while playing I was referring to your AFK method. What is your method?
---
Play smart. Cloak. Don't run into folks; engage from as far as possible. Use chems. Change perks to max dmg/def. Get suitable pvp heavy weapons and torso mods.
---
Power armor is great fun, but you really need to make it work for you.
---
What do you play on? If ur on pc what's ur rig?
---
I haven't encountered problems in adventure for a long time, server stability and all. I play on EU servers on pc.
---
I'm good. I've got plenty of gear, junk and caps. I'll be on in about 2 hours.
---
camps at primal cuts fucking suck...
---
Pretty sure not, but you could test and report back, find us our loopholes
---
Same thought I had
---
It would make power armor almost valid when you think about it from a Legendary armor sets vs Power armor. You still have to buy/craft/find .50/5mm armor. You already get double ammo capacity just equipping the power user for the gatling laser
---
Glad in not the only one who was traumatized by these
---
drums or the spits.. same difference
---
No. It used to work for Mirelurks [but then they patched it](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfsfnf/psa_which_enemies_are_affected_by_versus/).
---
Start the grill and wedge the right stick to the right.
---
Ah yes, nothing wrong with an image of Vault Boy kicking a pregnant woman in the chest
---
Literally any other perk would have been better, including Cannibal
---
Agreed. I’ve personally been in two situations where camps forced us to quit. Once a yao got forced into the camp and another for the deathclaw in the forest region.
---
If you had OCD, you would not have let that last sentence post.
---
What happens if you get a quad heavy gun and this pack does the same thing. Quad quad ammo. I’m othis would put PA/heavies way too high up on the meta.
---
I like this but i hope the take in consideration peoples lvl im only 25 ill shoot  but i know i wont do as much damage as others so i hope they have some way to tell
---
Hunger and thirst will reduce you about 25hp if a critter or flames kill you could cause disconnection I guess or random server crash
---
Not tried it, the grill seems to work well for me.
---
yeah man.. it's a drag
---
in my experience on PC I see these more often in the forest than the others
---
Ya i kno, the cynical side of me definitely believes that, but i like to think some ppl out there still got some ‘tegridy. Maybe thats too optimistic lol.
---
That is a fab idea
---
Yup. Ash heap an cranberry bog are worthless in doing so as radscorpions and mole rats can burrow out.
---
funny thing, 90% of my events had amazing fellers who stopped to emote everyone else to leggy's location while everyone's trying to do minimal damage to it to make sure no one gets left behind.
---
Completely random. Took me roughly 2months of scrapping Power Fists whenever I found them before I decided it would be better to just server hop until I found a vendor that had it. Probably went through about 40
---
I just want to say that once I thought I was killed by a cheater; one-shot to the head while I was moving and cloaked by stealthboy. But after death (last on my team) it switched me to my killer's cam. They weren't very impressive and eventually got killed while frantically running for cover. If they had an aimbot or something I'm sure they would have killed the player chasing them.
---
A system that actively decreases the rewards for everyone who doesn't one shot everything has got to be the worst idea in the history of multiplayer gaming.  
---
People already one shot enemies in events and it's a pain in the ass as it is.   
---
That said I think the easiest solution is to just reward people for the number of shots they land as opposed to the amount of damage they deal.   
---
But imo some better options I can think of is to rework events:
---
* Give all events a "boss" enemy at the end that uses a damage mitigation and huge health pool similar to SBQ which iirc has a flat 90% damage reduction and over 30k health.  
---
   * Event bosses wouldn't be as strong as SBQ but maybe 70-90% damage mitigation and up to 20k health depending on the event.  
---
* Even still endgame builds will kill them quick so make the threshold for "performance" to get the best rewards lenient.
---
* Throw in credit for non combat objectives like repairing the speakers at guided meditation, repairing broken uranium processors in uranium fever, etc.
---
* Also throw in credit for the time spent in the mission.  Not enough to afk and get good rewards but some so that under geared players don't get screwed by end game players one shotting all the things.
---
Rename a level 5 pipe gun "Donation" and charge 50 caps for it.
---
Oh wow that sounds familiar,  that actually might have been my home lol. I've had my little home there for a bit without any knowledge of how this event work(first time playing it), then all of a sudden people just started showing up at my camp and thought I was about to get jumped or something lol but I finally figured out it was an event so I joined in. A prime deathclaw ended up spawning twice in my home lol but it still gave us our reward tho thankfully.
---
To confirm you cannot lie, how about a picture of your level 1s decked out in gear and wearing perk cards?
---
We need two of your tears to confirm your feeling of sadness as well.
---
You can never be too sure nowadays.
---
I think you should run a build that is fun and satisfying to you and stop worrying about what other players are doing.
---
Display items still use stash weight
---
I'm near the Savage Divide spot, cave down the river a bit. I've noticed sometimes the event won't spawn at all, even if there isn't a camp there, I've double checked to make sure vendors weren't switched off too. You can see it from my gaff anyway.
---
-
---
Probably someone had logged out before I joined that server, but it went on for over an hour. It's always been a very popular Camp spot, I've always had neighbours there.
---
Use your fake low level guy to make people think your weak and take workshops. Then destroy them.
---
Make some water filters
---
Sometimes I think Bethesda does not deserve this community. Thank you.
---
All I can think of is something got corrupted and a fresh re install will fix it
---
I would totally love a more automated camp style, just dump a bunch of dirty water into a boiler, wait like thirty minutes, presto, water's done. Maybe add some lossage and fuel requirements(give coal a usage, or nuclear waste in a higher tier). Maybe like out of boilers and all, you have a 2-5% chance of losing one boiled water(evaporation)
---
Which is why it would be a Power Armor only effect. Not having to reload in PA VS  bloodied build Unyeilding Sentinal/Cavalier armor sets. Who's higher on the meta. Aside from the Legendary effects on the gun and higher ammo capacity, a power armor heavy would still be lower on the meta vs a decked out legendary build.
---
It doesn't, but with that logic Hunters should work on anything that would fall into the kingdom Animalia. Assassins would be pretty worthless at that point.
---
I was at that spot last night. Someone’s camp was way too close and we never got the event to start. It was only after everyone left and the hermit crab spawned and died insta failing the event.
---
I would rather a system that gives everybody rewards over one that encourages people to take the rewards for themselves, which is what will happen if you make the rewards performance based. I don't see why they don't just add legendaries to everyone's rewards at the end based on how many legendaries were killed. Sure you may get players that AFK at events like you do for meat week, but honestly who cares? That person crouching in the corner with their stealth boy isn't hurting anyone, but the one-shotters are actively ruining events for everyone.
---
You must do what you think is right, of course.
---
And people thought my snakes idea was scary.
---
I don’t know how you got that idea, but caps are far from worthless. There is a huge market between players, and every cap is worth something.
---
They are mainly cosmetic. Doing that would make them lean more toward p2w and people would whine and get negative press.
---
What the hell did I click on?
---
It really is a shame such a shit company made such an amazing franchise :( I'd love to see them just drop all they're projects and find a new engine to build on. I'm no programmer but from my understanding fallouts engine is outdated and they just keep reusing it.
---
 Clearly we aren’t on the same page. And aren’t going to be. 
---
So long and thanks for all the fish.👍

Bethesda: [I'll fucking do it again!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgEzxQ9qdHk)
---
Mr.Messenger: Not that I noticed, saw it happen several times over several days/servers within the last week, often enough that I've stopped even going to the event as it was a waste of time and caps.
---
HotS: Yup, seen it personally 4 times, Three times it happened when the heart closed for the third wave of strangler creatures. I was using a melee weapon and hitting it for ~1500 dmg, so the HP of the heart was bouncing up and down, on the third close it just vanishes and leaves a big empty spot inside whatever structure it is growing from (Plane, rocks, etc) It never comes back, event stays open until it times out. The 4th time, I'm not sure what caused it, it was already missing when I got to the event (someone else had started it, event had been going for 8 mins and they had already left)
---
Plasma Flamer: Not sure exactly, I noticed it during a meat week event last night, I was swapping around weapons (Flamer, Tesla, AGL, Plasma Flamer, minigun) looking for a good weapon to get my hits in on Prime Beasts while also allowing others to get their hits as my Mole miner would just wreck the Primes and I don't wanna be that guy) was getting low on flamer fuel but still had ~3500 plasma cartridges so I switched to that and was burning for a bit before I noticed the 999/0 and thought that's odd, normally it's XXX/999. Persisted through weapon swaps, and putting weapon in stash and re-equipping, stayed bugged for rest of play that session, next session I logged in, it showed 456/999 but once I took it below 306 (my mag limit with, I want to say gamma wave emitter?) I was able to reload normally.
---
I sell em for 80 caps. It spawns, with some other plans in the mix, in very specific places, so it's just not that difficult to get. You may have to server hop a bunch of times, but eventually you'll get them. Hell, I found two of them in one 3 hour play session that had me visiting Harper's Ferry, and then Watoga. Anyways, I'm sure you can get more for it than that, but it's no dense torso plan.
---
Just get a girlfriend jeeze
---
I once had to pay 71 caps to fast travel somewhere, so yeah, I stand by my point.
---
Yup.
---
I can't tell if this is actually asking for proof or being sarcastic about people who ask for proof. Of course he should have proof, people lie about all sorts of things. Not to mention that Bethesda would be more likely to respond if he had proof, remember the vault 94 wipe bugs?
---
My Xbox Gt is the same as my Reddit name, check my last video and screenshot. My radiation was glitched too, I run a bloodied build.
---
Wow fuck all of you. Just play the game or turn it off you lazy scum.
---
So do you have other secret plan learning tidbits? Haha
---
That answer is completely unknowable.
---
And now we gotta wait til 2020 for the revise patch
---
I like the luck end of it. Bloodied has an easy time with or without vats. The thing with luck based vats cards (like psychopath and grim reaper), it messes with accuracy. In my tests I couldn't hit heads for the life of me running those cards, it might be server side calculations who knows. Tormentor is a must if you're doing anything spongy. The handmade is really all you need on a bloodied build for pve, it makes other guns look silly including the lever imo.
---
A bloodied dragon is fun to one hit scorchbeasts. The sniper rifle is even redundant compared to a scoped handmade. From tests I've run chameleon vs unyielding, the chameleon is better but you need all 5 pieces. Couple that with the fixer and mobs don't see you, even down in the bog, the scorch there run right by me. Made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTtzNY09bQw) of what I'm doing at westek with this setup.  Unyielding has so many perk boosts though, like luck and str. You kill so fast with the b handmade, stealth isn't that important anyway. Shankwelle seems to have a good handle on staying alive.

I think Collectrons are already a little too useful. Like if you have 500 atoms then it's a disadvantage to NOT buy him. Tbh they should start retroactively adding useful effects to some of the atom shop stuff to keep them on par with Collectrons
---
nope, they have to be outmortals
---
There is a lot of ripping on shotguns here and I don't understand why. My level 50 TSE with enforcer can put dozens of ghouls on the ground using less than 16 rounds. Clean them up using a melee weapon.
---
The best part is when I turn around and a lower level player is watching all the downed ghouls writhing on the ground, who pulls out a knife and we share in a boatload of XP and junk.
---
But using that shotgun in Westek is an easy way to waste 200 rounds.
---
yup me too
---
Years of nuclear botox lip injections really restrict movement. Tragic really.
---
It's weird, I've had camps that were pretty damn close to the barrels and it would be fine. Then other ones which were closer and/or further away and the Event wouldn't even announce at all.
---
Which way are you going with the sarcasm? Like "it's easy to have all the display shit and a decent size house, i've seen it" or making fun of the people that complain about how much budget it doesn't really eat up ?
---
Sorry it just makes me want to piss my pants in her train station

I have been using this, works great  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32)

Idk what did it, logging in and out enough or whinning to Reddit, but it fixed itself somehow. I'm scared to even to the event now, I've been playing mainly this since the beginning of Summer, I don't want to lose my progress..
---
Were you traveling from corner to corner of map? If not you should really be using travel agent. But you can also get max vendor caps from selling all the assault weapons from one run through west Tek. With that 1400caps you won't be hurting for caps anymore. And if you do that every new day you get on you won't ever worry about caps again.
---
I'm not here to pick a fight, but it will launch from Steam, even without Bethesda launcher running in the background.  Look for the Fallout76.exe as the Add non-steam game file.
---
It will launch from Steam, then in-game it will ask you for your Bethesda username/password.  The only time it will boot you is \*if\* there was an update and you didn't have Bethesda launching to update the game.  If you just leave the Bethesda launcher up, that step can be skipped after an update since it will auto-update.  This is how I've had it launching from Steam since the initial rough release.

I’ve put a lot of effort into my prime cuts themed camp. It has everything a prime cuts participant would need. 
---
The only issue I had (1 out of maybe 25 runs so far) was a Yao getting caught inside my small building that had the fusion generator inside. 
---
I think they can be overly attracted to generators. So I removed it and replaced it with a small generator (for just my vender). My camp doesn’t need much power.
---
Some people do, but Yongyea ain't one of them.

Then go away. The community will not miss you at all.
---
Someone built one for me and I think I still have it's blueprint
---
Bethesda wants to know if you got the money for those boilers.
---
I see your question has been answered but it’s still a atom shop item - just like the walls (door, window, wall) it has a variant model (foundation / no foundation)
---
Holy hell, the pay-to-win folks would have another aneurysm if this was implemented.
---
Yeah, that's definitely a theme now a days. "If I don't get the same opportunities as everyone else, then I should be compensated"
---
Until then... I leave tokens
---
My New Vegas PTSD is triggered.
---
Appreciate the response. Have a good day and a better weekend!

Assaultron comes round the Camps with some "cookies".
---
I don't know how to view your Xbox screenshots from a phone. Is there a way to export whatever you capture to a website somewhere and just copy and paste a link?
---
Lol stop picking locks after the first week.
---
it would be totally unfair just to oust someone off their personal camp, some camps take a-lot of effort to build..
---
It was a great evening. I joined a server and found my camp spot to be in use by someone else. Meh that's fine I thought as I didn't plan to use my camp that evening anyway.
---
However I then found a beautiful house, garden and even a nice swimmimg pool really close to where my camp used to be. 
---
It was so magnificent I just had to take a quick peek inside. Luckily there was no locked door and one corner was even more beautiful than the other. With great joy I was even able to use some workbenches.
---
I wanted to hug the owner for this nice mansion. Luckily I then even got the chance and enthousiastically waved at him. But unfortunately.. I was on survival mode
---
The screenshot of my perks equipped but every stat at level 1 is on my Reddit profile. I'm not sure how to rip the video I took. Let me check
---
Tip box, yo.
---
Reasons.
---
What most amusing is that I've seen the word 'tendies' at least 5 times today on reddit, and your post wasn't the first one.  I think the last time I heard that word, my boss's 10 year old was talking about a Publix sub sandwich, probably a year ago.
---
would join out of the interest at just having a regular team to level, but sadly im PC
---
Thanks so much! You too!
---
I scrapped over 100 leather left legs to get studded... so you never know.
---
Lol control your spending and buy out your vendors each day. It's really easy with all the junk and meat from this week
---
Oh, it's fun too. Nothing like dropping people from three stories high. I have a bunch of those clips :D
---
I really have questions for people that have pet [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula\_hawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula_hawk) 
---
Sloths sure. Okay, maybe a scorpion but I'm frowning at you. A tarantula hawk? I've got nothing.
---
I've had this happen in a few different events, it seems to be related to the respawn timer. Sometimes if you wait like five minutes or so it will clear, others you have to quit. It really sucks because if you die during or after the event rewards screen, your junk will drop in a bag and if you have to quit, it's gone unless you have friends on the server.
---
What recipe requires the antifreeze bottle and abraxo?
---
In fo4 you needed abraxo for mentats and the antifreeze for mirelurk jerky, but the recipes are different in 76.
---
Also, side note, why does mirelurk jerky have a condition bar? It should be shelf stable, like the pemican.
---
Donation box when
---
Or any melee build.
---
Melee just smashes the shit out of them way faster than any ranged weapon without needing to remain hidden to actually do damage.
---
I wouldn't consider myself exceptionally geared, I do have all three star armour and weapons, but it's a mish-mash of stuff, usually weapon/ammo/junk weight reduction with stim on death/cloaking/harder to detect.
---
Not even "properly" melee spec'd anymore as I've been enjoying just derping around and have a lot of ammo/chem/food weight reduction perks so I can actually play them game without being max weight 24/7.
---
Naw bud. 7600 locks for the challenge
---
That was great!
---
Having a support camp for the event is fine. Down the road.  It right on the area is too much. Causes more problems. Intentionally or accidentally.
---
Blows my mind that people somehow know about the sale, but missed when it is.
---
Another reason to use a PC instead of a console.
---
If you buy my ridiculous number of bobby pins that I have for sale or any other oddball stuff that no one would normally want, I absolutely take that as a compliment or a thank you.
---
Heck, if you buy anything at all, I generally smile on appreciation because most of my stuff is not priced to sell fast.  I don't enjoy restocking the vending machines and I hate running out of stuff to put in them so I try to keep them at a rate of sale that is slightly slower than my rate of accumulation.   I drop all the excess for free in paper bags at the top of my stairs leading to my vending machines for anyone that wants the excess.
---
I found that I didn't like having low prices because it ate up too much time to put stuff in.  I lower the prices on the stuff that is easiest to come by.  That seems to work well for me.
---
Yes, yes! Make it happen!
---
Tendies is a green text meme where an overage manchild lives with his mother. He exchanges good boy points, which he gets from doing normal tasks like performing basic hygiene and cleaning his room, for his favorite food, Tendies, which are the only thing he eats. If he is refused tendies, he flies into a rage yelling 'Reeeee' and pisses all over his mother while cursing at her
---
Sounds like it's a problem more on your end, dude. Might need to check out your console or your internet connection. Not saying the game doesn't have its bugs, but it's nowhere near as bad as what you're describing
---
Yeah, but if the camp is on the Drum (that starts event) then something else needs to be done, like make the camp unavailable as they do when you log onto a server with somebody else in your spot. Or allow it to be started anywhere within a certain range of the Drum like contesting workshops within that area.
---
I have a two floor house with one of each work bench, 4 vending machines, a full bobblehead stand, all the magazines on display, and all bears on display. I also have a bed, couch, tv, desk, lights, 3 turrets...
---
In my experience most players know they should let the other players get some hits in. The problem is, it takes only one player to violate this rule in order to ruin the event. And thus the more players in the event, the greater the chance of it being ruined. If you see a lot of players there, don't get your hopes up.
---
Not sure why I have to rip out a section of floor every time I want to stick two more bobbleheads on my stand...
---
A few more (PC, Adventure)
---
* From within the Enclave Bunker, I tried to join the "Swarm of suitors" public event (the event card came up and I clicked join). Instead, I was teleported to a "Surface to Air" event at Firebase Major. The "Swarm of suitors" event was still available - the two locations are nowhere near each other so no random misclicks.
---
* The daily challenge "Craft Chems" lists Psycho as a possible option but [crafting one doesn't count](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/da43d1/crafting_psycho_does_work_in_todays_craft_chems/).
---
* Crafting a Healing Salve (Forest) for the "Craft 5 Healing items" challenge still counts as if crafting a Stimpak too.
---
I like the radio without a host.  I got SO sick of Travis saying the same shit over and over and over in FO4
---
Xjx Speedy xjx  is my gt id love to learn new morgantown map im lvl 111
---
You can build pretty big, and have loads of decorations and stuff, if you keep the bigger objects or items that do things to a minimum. Especially foundations, defenses, lights and crops.
---
Use camps and workshops as freebies. Workshops do t really pay for themselves anymore tho if your really tight on caps. But to answer your question, yes selling cool stuff out of my camp makes me happier than anything else in this game. Maybe because I havet gotten any nice rolls on legendaries and dont pvp, but the vendors definatly make up for that :)
---
I literally bought a QE RW Ultracite laser two months ago for 7k. You just gotta find the right person who's selling for cheap
---
Or make all horde bosses max level outside of the Forest.
---
who knows, the whole thing is confusing as hell and half the people have no clue what to do and y es I know graham tells you what to do but I couldn't hear it ever... ugh this game
---
How would that help multiple people fast traveling to the horde event ensure they all get Legendaries?
---
Hard to say. I got it first try. The same with extra Hooks for the meat hook. But I have scrapped 50 lever action rifles and still no hardened nor silencer.
---
PVP damage is capped at around 110.
---
This is the best I can do on the video I took

I don’t think you can get quad on a heavy gun....

Quad
---
At least rando enemies wouldn’t kill them for us, and it would be possible to tag them without killing them outright. It wouldn’t be perfect, but it would be a big improvement.
---
Is "week" that hard to spell correctly?
---
True, my b
---
They need to hurry up with tweaking. Meat week is just a week. After it is gone, again we have nothing to do.
---
The amount of sunset drinks I took just to counter the poison was ridicules
---
Fuck, alright hopefully it doesn’t take me that long
---
I mean if cats survived bombs and radiation, they should be able to survive anything.
---
Its not a guaranteed spawn. They have a handful of locations(I think 5) and only 3 spawn at a time. I dont think it has anything to do with their camp being close.
---
Which is why if they make it dynamic it would change it up like announcing if there is a rad storm in a certain region or if a nuke went off
---
Hey I'm gonna bring a jar of tarantula hawks to west Virginia what's the worst that can happen?
---
If your xbox you can check it out. GT Zartu. I had to step out but should still be AFK as long as I was not kicked yet
---
I used to have the gt: golfbutbetter17.   It was a inside joke with a few of my friends. I apparently pissed off a streamer because when I got back online one day it was banned. Called customer support and they said I had over 300 reports on it within that day so it got automatically banned. Also had some hate mail that I tried to report but ended up having to just change it. According to Microsoft it was my fault...
---
I still don't understand why we can't boil purified water?
---
The Savage Divide event spawn is right on top of where I've had my camp for 9 months. I've just stopped playing for the event duration.
---
I see the screenshot. Hopefully you figure out the customer service thing. I'll pop you an updoot invade a community manager stops by.
---
Yes you can. I get quad miniguns and cryolators and missile launchers all the time.
---
I have a kind of a lot of crops and two water purifiers, and 4 turrets. But other than that my place is pretty modest.  An open bottom floor with one of each work bench, and an walled/roofed upper floor with a bed and a couch.  Nothing crazy.
---
Why stop?
---
I hope that person was savagely beaten with muskets.
---
Looks stayed the same in my opinion, do you mean the darker nights?
---
See all above. That, plus too many repairs and impairing the event. Event fails when even one mole rat gets stuck in a generator
---
Why does the image for the Salty Tenderizer show 105 damage and say "superior damage", while the image for the Peppered Tenderizer shows 118 damage and says "increased damage"?
---
Its every hour on the dot
---
If you can supply the mats, I can do it
---
I’ve never seen a quad auto grenade launcher or .50 cal or mini gun. I’ll take your word, but I follow the trading site quite a bit.
---
Not sure I've noticed a difference since playing the B.E.T.A. honestly -
---
if it IS different though, I wouldn't be surprised if they kind of just pulled what Anthem did and made the trailer/gameplay look flashier to announce the game
---
This is a good stuff.
---
Hey Beatdown! Sorry I missed this tag I was out sick yesterday. I'm sending you a DM.
---
What do you need?
---
Cave crickets, the real end game boss.
---
I mean you could just move a yards away.
---
Totally on board with this.  Tip jar is awesome, we can already make one but can only fill with frogs lol
---
Theyre stronger than the queen!!
---
Not just nihhts, early trailers and videos just show the game to be darker on general, with stronger shadows.
---
This makes total sense, cheers. It wasn't starting for over an hour though, but I suppose if folks camps were slap bang on the barrel that would be a nuisance.
---
I refreshed Windows 10 and re-downloaded the game, it now works, took 6 hours :D
---
Thank you

Rifle grenades would be cool as an alternative.

It spawned under the camp I've worked on since beta. Not moving shit.
---
I have a character that does this. Portacraft platform that I drop after major events. Not before, though.
---
Someone set up a little workbench area with a STASH near the Bog location on a server I was on last time, but it was out of the way of the event and they didn't have any turrets or even walls. It actually came in handy for the few hours I played that day and was fortunate enough that the server didn't crash and the person didn't leave.
---
Blocking the drum or spawn points or building turrets should be reported, though. After a day or two it's clearly just griefing if they don't move their CAMP. The events trigger often enough that's there's no excuse for not knowing they'll be there if you were unlucky enough to have placed a CAMP there prior to Meat Week starting.
---
You need to RAM bread through toaster PCs.
---
A strong NAY. Min-maxers are way more powerful than the rest of us, we'll get no rewards...
---
It was almost the bare necessities too, I think the only part I skipped was the mutant killing montage. Tolstoy would be proud.
---
Yo on PS4? Cuz that last bit seems like sumn that happened in one of my servers.
---
Interested in people expierence. Even one foundation floaters can have problems replacing...
---
They tweaked a lot about the event, it was awful the first time around. Events would fail because the timer would run out just because Prime creatures would get lost chasing something else and the timer would run out before anyone could find it because the markers on them didn't always appear.
---
I just place a water pump in my camp.  Press X to drink.  While the drink animation is going I spam the collect button (square).  Then repeat.   I can get 6-10 dirty water each time.  You just have to watch your rad level.
---
Don't forget OCD #1 Crazy Kids Do Crazy Things!
---
I built my base under an electric tower since most have flat ground and planted 16 tatos, corn and mutfruit along with 7 water purifiers. I then build around it to prevent anyone from just wandering In and taking my crops. I have a small shack on top for crafting purposes, four heavy machine turrets and two missile turrets. Finally I built a pen up top for a Brahmin and complete  with AstroTurf floor. My budget is a hair from maxed.
---
My camp was literally in the primal cuts spawning point so when it first came out I literally could fast travel to my camp being attacked by the event. Plus it gave people a little place to hang out afterward.
---
Maybe you can’t.  I know just scrip’d a quad cryo and mini and missile last night from UF.
---
I've had my camp, in one of the spots primal cuts starts, for 3 months now. I've just removed my floor to get to the drum, but all the enemies spawn inside my house so I'll have to move.
---
Well, besides the occasional turret farmer, I for one really love being able to camp over events like this. If there are problems, the camp owner should do whatever they can do stop the problems. 
---
Have you really run into this kind of issue a lot? Im actually disappointed that so few of the prime cuts spawns have a camp this time. 
---
Surely you could served hop and odds are the next sever won’t have a camp?
---
I’ve seen quad cryos. Missile launchers have a quad barrel mod. Never heard or seen a quad mini. I think that thing would fetch a hell of a lot of caps/trade.
---
Where are you finding them mostly?  Need to farm acid
---
YES! It sucks having to hit Escape, then V, then click on "Challenges", then scroll down to "World". You should be able to tag which challenges show up on the screen, like you can do for quests in the pip-boy.
---
I wish there was a log book to sign and leave a short message to the owner.
---
Honestly everyone should have turned off passive mode and throw their orbital strike grenades at his base.
---
Bethesda please give us a bot that performs every task in the game for me so that I don't have to do anything but watch grass grow.
---
I mean, there's no reason to boil purified water. It's already purified.
---
It would be nice if we could use it for recipes... but that runs the risk of someone making a bunch of Corn Soup without realizing they're destroying all their purified water.
---
WTF do we do with shovels?
---
Loads fatman with malicious intent

I don't think so.

GT: SapphyChu
---
They should definitely make like a new enemy for the Savage Divide/Mire/Cranberry bog that’s like a copperhead that mutated to boa constrictor size or bigger. It’d be perfect
---
Yes*
---
I guess there’s just a bunch of miscellaneous quests the game puts on your hud but not in your pip boy. You can get red of them by hovering over them on the map and hitting “stop tracking”
---
yeah but imagine being able to put 15 points of cards into each perk after level 1175 or whatever. Imagine the cheese you could pull with nearly double the perk cards equipped!
---
I'd like a dimmer headlamp so I'm not blinded every time I get close to something..
---
Hopefully some info pops up, they've been one of the most curious groups I am really wanting to learn about!
---
Dropping a nuke in the now infest resorts results a cazadore queen coming out. And into a killing spree. Has a similar style to the honey beast releasing cazadores spawns, but this queen also flies around.
---
That would be super cool! I've visited a couple camps where they have posters of food or wordings next to a table with cooked food for anyone passing by. It's a Great Idea, A tip jar would be nice!
---
A similar bug exists in FO4. Your client will occasionally respond if you spam the “exit” button, but YMMV.
---
I believe I have that, GT: BiggBoi JDT
---
I was a melee/sniper, but have changed to melee/heavy weapon.
---
Reason is nasty flying things.  Got to a point where there sniper and combat rifled just didn't do enough damage, so I swapped out for stabilized3 and a couple heavy weapons.  
---
I still melee most everything that's ground based, but flying things are generally no longer a problem
---
thank you, i’ll try that because i walked around for a good hour around the ash heap and no luck
---
I had this when I was using IPv6. After switching to IPv4 only it no longer happened.
---
Maybe we could fill it with oil and lounge around in our power armor too.
---
They announced it rather early, to be fair. 
---
When they did, I started saving up scrip. I figured I would get to 1000 right when the sale was. 
---
Here I am, one month early...
---
This is a great suggestion!
---
Absolutely, I’m hoping some more of the mines in the Ash Heap open up and we gain access to their society and history. I am hoping there are more like the purveyor out there.
---
It's up to you. I found that by using the super-sledge while wearing power armor, I could go toe-to-toe with the enemies in the Forest, Ash Heap and Toxic Valley. Those areas got me leveled up enough to get the perks so I could go to the Savage Divide and eastward.
---
I play by myself almost exclusively.
---
Fallout. Its a bitch

Join on my GT    SapphyChu     when your ready

this site is the only one i can find that lists all of the magazines:  [https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/12/13/fallout-76-magazines-locations-what-the-magazines-do-2/](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/12/13/fallout-76-magazines-locations-what-the-magazines-do-2/) 
---
looks like there's 96 magazines. technically, there's 104 if you count holotape games, but the magazine you pick up doesn't get added to your inventory.
---
I second this!
---
The people drumming and spinning are ensuring the people doing other tasks have enough time to complete them, if everyone is doing tasks without one of those it will almost always fail
---
Yes but this person purposefully blocked the barrel. It’s not like they’ve had their camp there for months and just happened to be in that precise location. It’s a purposeful dick move.
---
There's enough budget for both.
---
Even the normal skeletons in dresses and stuff?
---
I have noticed this also...
---
But there were two on drums when there could have been one
---
They asked for ammo and guns from the free states and responders but they were very reluctant to give anything, you can’t just sit around and be the nice guy when giant mutated bats and mind controlled diseased creatures and ex humans are threatening to wipe out what’s left of any survivors, especially if you’re the only one fighting them
---
I think so
---
Great suggestion! It wound't be p2w since you can get free atoms for doing challenges.
---
After spending some time trying to think about how one could spin that joke, I have decided upon 'Phat Dastard. I'm leet because I'm unhappy, I'm unhappy because I'm leet'
---
Nuke  
---
Nuke
---
I have a decent sized base with a fair amount of decorations and two vendors. Even though I eliminated crops and turrets and cut back on lighting, I'm still at max budget due to my displays. I guess it just works.
---
It wound't be p2w since you can get free atoms for doing challenges.
---
I have a legacy weapon and a squeaker came up to trade saw what I had and demanded I trade him for it. I said it wasn’t for trade or sale as it was something I both earned way back and I use it for my build. I also heard in area chat during a nuke at white springs to report my gamertag: A Vaping Badger, nothing wrong with it, I vape and people have called me a honey badger for 8+ years. All in all Microsoft had changed my name and issued a warning of my name to my email. After the two week long process of an appeal and everyday calling support it was reversed. 
---
I know it’s useless to say this but it’s a M for mature game with snowflake children still being hateful when they don’t get their way, I think an ID system should be put into place and the parents who buy the games for their kids should be fined for harrassing grown adults. I’ve never had an issue with people my age in a game but the gaming community as a whole has become more toxic due to parents who use video games as a way to babysit their kids, not all parents so don’t get upset about my opinion, but a good amount do.
---
Shall they run around naked after the war?
---
Throw a fit, it does work if you call and have your case number for your daily calls to support.
---
No way I would still be playing this game that long. I’m struggling to find anything to do now let alone another 900 levels.
---
Or, you know, like the real life postal system.
---
How do you keep a vault-dweller busy?  Follow this sign for the answer...
---
I've had scorched and mole rats spawn in my foundations a few times. I won't place my base near events because of all the issues it can cause.
---
Interesting...maybe the quest marker glitched? Will check tonight again. I me some meat to turn in!
---
Well no, there are some skeletons that to me, look like they were just going about their day and suddenly died. Not hiding or attacking but just sitting in a chair or something. Probably just for atmosphere.
---
I believe it, and you gotta punish everyone cuz of a few assholes. My point is that there are other things they can do to prevent this being an issue, like not even having a physical object you have to interact with to start the event.
---
Seriously, why can't we just use purified water for recipes? And why do we only get half the water after boiling? It would be better to have a new recipe for the brewing still.
---
Yikes that’s unfortunate
---
File a report. Tell microsoft it was mass reporting.
---
&gt;Comment 
---
That and the fact the bots do the bans. 
---
Then a real person reviews it after.
---
I've still got it. What mods do you want on it? Ign is newt341.
---
you can do that quest way before the brotherhood quest. when that part shows up in the brotherhood story line, you can skip over it -- sometimes it'll make you go Camp Mclintock &amp; talk to the sgt. &amp; it'll progress.
---
Yea I imagine this all took place after the war. People went on living. Not all became responders or raiders.
---
You also find somewhere a couple in their house at the kitchen table with rat poison. They were sick of this new world and ended their lives :/
---
Each person on a drum or a spit contributes, in fact I had a whole team that jumped on spits and drums and the bar only kept rising
---
Bethesda Marketing: “we got to pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers”
---
This is what we need
---
A nice problem to have.
---
They are just fine.
---
I don't think they ever actually nerfed them from Nuka world in FO4
---
Any chance of an AMA with them?
---
I like to imagine the glowing sea in fallout 4 is the closest nuke crater to 76 and also the nukes in D.C.
---
That’s not the point. It’s a public event. People should not be forced out of something because one person has chosen to do so. I personally have twice. But have seen it happen at least 8+ times during the last meat week. 
---
Again it’s one thing if your trying to help. It’s another if your trying to deliberately sabotage the event for others or even trying to self contain the event for your self.
---
Use your camp and vault 76 as freebies
---
You talking about the Forest Asylum Uniform?
---
The feature has still not been added so repeating the same thing over and over isn't doing anything.
---
I'd unequip all my gear, put it all away in my stash,  and attack unarmed melee.
---
It would be a glorious 0.8 seconds.
---
They do. I’m just not into making tons of caps.
---
Fire breathers? Mistress of mysteries? If you already did those it’s time to explore and find random encounters.
---
That is still something.
---
Good. My camp is place in a possible area for death blossoms but the plants can’t spawn in foundations so I’m safe all times of my intrusion.
---
How about no.
---
Once it's placed and / stored in your C.A.M.P - you can always re-place the 'glitchplaced' items so long as you do not scrap it.
---
Once you scrap it your boned - so I'd recommend keeping that around.
---
The same rules applies for the Deathclaw / Cat Topiaries, the Future-Tec Globe, Satellite Dish, and I think Theremin *(I don't have that so can't confirm but it seemed to be affected by the placed-by-others glitch during MT WK1)*
---
lol, hop into vault 94 :)
---
The scorched would have no chance
---
I guess it's better than nothing
---
As far as my playthroughs go its okay to continue this way. Just don't expect to go full in with guns blazing and try to pick some off one by one. 
---
You could also grind some more events to gain some levels (perks) to help you on your way.
---
Dunno which platform your on, i could help you if you're on pc.
---
I’ve got some friends from college who did this last year-said it was really cool-curious if there will be a high concentration of blue jumpsuits this year
---
You can contact other players via clicking on their "circle" on the map or on their name under the Social bumper/button.   It worked; now it doesn't.
---
nuke the camp.  problem solved :)  Plus now you get glowing/legendary enemies from the event and you can farm masses and flux.    
---
It's a win/win!
---
I did fire breathers but the mistress of mysteries I was doing but when I went for the sword it was surrounded by lvl 65 gouls who just wreaked me
---
Maybe have a wee wonder and explore some places, Toxic Valley up north, check some of the posters at train stations for side quests (there's also small notes pinned to the corners at different stations for more!).
---
L25 is the perfect time to start Miner Miracles quest, obtain plans for Excavator Armor. South East Ash Heap.
---
Head North, then South, read all notes and holotapes, create your own journey! Then continue main quest L50. :)
---
Do you know when it started?   I can't even figure out how to submit a ticket.   Can you?
---
With my camp in the Savage Divide and Vault 76 as a free fast travel point the most I ever pay is 29 to the Ash Heap or 22 to Watoga/Mire. Travel agent is worth picking up if only to swap it in before fast traveling.
---
Think i found it by Googling, must be the " Forest Camo Jumpsuit " was sure it was in two pieces, but must be wrong.
---
probably very hard to find one though :(
---
Great idea. 
---
That wil be 1000 atoms.
---
Goodbye
---
I didnt know that about the posters I will have to check that out
---
Would be great as an in game event, too!
---
Thanks for this!
---
There's a big variance of valid builds, theres a whole realm of diversity when it comes to PvP, its just considering how Falloutish effects have to work, if you concentrate all of them for a single purpose, they get fucking bonkers :D
---
Its a world where you adjust to survive. Its only natural that the majority is the livestock when selected few are the hunters. The fact that you were unwilling to adjust and learn means nothing about the mode. Effective killer can be built with 1* items. Powerfull killer can be built with 2*. I took a good build with a decent items, lacking 20 levels till completed, and went straight to killing at level 50, and were succesfull at that, despite the fact I completed the build at level 70. I just knew what I was doing.
---
The fact you're unable to overcome the challanges within F76 PvP doesn't mean its not challenging. The truth is that you haven't had a chance to taste it, and are commenting on something you're not knowledgable about. The thing is that in this particular competition, knowledge is your main asset and main weapon.
---
If you would like to get help on how to make an efficient killer cheaply, I'll gladly share what I know.
---
I'm on xbox unfortunately and do events help to level
---
Yes yes yes please.
---
FOMO when RNG is involved.
---

---
Ah.   Howeverm it worked before and now it doesn't.   And Alienfister, on a PC, reports the same.
---
Faschnacht is a Christian holiday like Easter, I think it's meant to start on Good Friday. There was datamined event steps for pranking the Whitesprings. Looks like a Halloween event
---
I have that weapon primed on a heavy build. It kicks ass.
---
Main highway from mire to bog will either have quite a few crickets or rad rats. 50-50 shot.
---
Your more than welcome!
---
The Fixer is such an amazing gun
---
I’d like perks that favor wearing all one tier of armor like: 
---
wearing 5 pieces of light armor increases stealth damage and movement speed
---
Wearing 5 pieces of sturdy armor increases AP regen and increases vats damage
---
Wearing 5 pieces of heavy armor increases explosive damage (applies to explosive effect) and radiation / poison resist.
---
This. This right here, there's been times where I want to leave things especially to low levels.
---
No worries didn’t think of that actually I tend to stick to myself in game
---
Aye follow that for a bit. You can now also get a small backpack from the upstairs bit at Morgantown Airport Terminal.
---
That sounds like a fun time.
---
Yeah I was afraid of that. I mean the community events are cool I guess but are they content? That's kind of a stretch but as long as they actually release wastelanders in November i guess it won't be too bad. With all the pushbacks to every thing else I'm getting skeptical for a Nov release.
---
It was very stalker feeling in beta. Dark dreary and desolate.
---
I have 2 mobile missile towers that do work, if be sad I I couldn't throw em down
---
It really is!  I hope they use the catapult this year again! That was pretty awesome to see people get hurled over the bridge lol
---
Yeah heard thats the best one but hate climbing that tree haha
---
I think you're reading too much into what they said. PC has never been able to send messages to each other inside the game. And it might just be that they just aren't replying to you.

---
Yeah they'll well do a Halloween thing. Wreck Whitesprings perhaps?
---
That's not the issue, the issue is people being insta dead in cars and other areas like you'd find in FO3 &amp; 4. As if a nuke hit nearby
---
They rewarded us like content I guess
---
Yes!! That would be super awesome!
---
Yes I agree. I’ve seen the pathetic turret farmers as well. There should be a no turret radius around the event.
---
Tried to do an event earlier and the FT zoned me into the foundations ... sigh ...
---
Most likely nothing new until November.  Seems like they're focused on bug fixes currently, always a good thing.
---
I fly solo myself. Just do the 'encryptid' event  or if you've got a decent suit of power armor get in on a scorch beast Queen event. there will always be somebody that needs reviving at those events. That's how I got mine
---
I use vanguard armor and they don’t really do much. 453/453. Just save your money and vendor hop until you get a full set, if you are a high health build. 
---
It’s misleading because the effect stacks and it’s not reflected on the individual armor pieces
---
Yeah im semi the same way but have to talk to some of my customers lol. Theyre not on all the time tho so i have to think outside the box. Any event really would be a great place or follow a low level around lol. But since meat week is probably the most enemy ridden event right now and theres low levels everywhere trying to particpate...even high levels die at these. Good luck! Sorry again, i had good intentions lol
---
oh yeah, ok I see what you mean
---
Absolutely not. 30k worth of graham plans can sell for 100k+.
---
You can yes!
---
A lore video not by Oxhorn? Wha...?
---
Nice work dude :)
---
If you open up the option to view your weapon on the bottom Left it gives you the option to rename your weapons hope that helps :)
---
Oh cool
---
I really think with wastelanders we going to get Radio Hosts back one each for the respective main factions of wastelander Responders &amp; Raiders
---
Dang seriously lol I'm checking that asap when I get home thanks
---
Thanks, but it's tough to do that, as I have stuff in place for many reasons. Easiest for all if I just don't log in for the duration of the event. I'm thinking of starting a new toon, however. And he can camp out wherever the hell he pleases!
---
You can still wait until the event is finished. From what I've experienced, his plan availability is player-specific; for example, a friend saw Signs and Letters on him but didn't buy it last night, and when I initiated trade with him right after her, I didn't see it. It's selfish to just stand there and trade while other players are actually trying to complete the event.
---
Yes, go to the item, click inspect and then click on rename.
---
🎶Cha cha real smooth 🎶
---
Holy crap, I was so bummed out you couldn't rename weapons.  It was there the whole time?
---
Thank you very much for sharing.
---
yea. because the low level players in the low level area have a lot of fire power.
---
There was a huge house placed in the middle of the event that caused soo much lag in the forest shit refused to spawn so it failed us everyone of us at that event on xbox were pissed
---
only for $7, really people they just back handed slapped you for your last idea that came from reddit. don't bother requesting /offering ideas if they are just going to charge us ...again.
---
Check grahm, he sells it too. Just picked it up on an alt about an hour ago.
---
Hello, I just hopped back in the game and it is in fact only loading 13 after emptying. I was standing still and also not in combat.
---
&gt;Here's a list of the possible Legendary rewards you can earn
---
hmm 🤔
---
Yeah. You can get it from the event Collision Course
---
I think i will give a try to the commando one , maybe mixing it with the power armor somehow  or something like that
---
Sure, but in the meantime they should be nuked!
---
Yes, [PC] interesting... how much?
---
Cap stashes would be cool. They stay at your camp and plan would be hella rare. With like +5k caps you can't keep on your person.
---
A berserker weapon has lower damage, the higher your defense, so it's because you have decent armor.
---
Got me a fancy disco ball off of Grahm as well!
---
Nice to have him in a known location for a little while
---
on desktop, On the right side is the community menu, under "Join" and "Create Post" buttons is "Community Options", you can edit user flair there.
---
Yeah but it's almost been a year and pa still glitches and I saw a ghoul slide across the ground the other day haha. They don't care as long as people keep spending on the atomic shop
---
Might be a little hard getting Jimmy Dean. They'd have to get involved with the sausage company and all to get the rights to his music. It would be mighty mighty fittin' though, youse got a good ear
---
I’ll add them and see when they’re on
---
Lucky Hole Mine is where i usually find them.
---
Which is perfect because thats where I go for lead.
---
Ah I see, I had taken off my armor before to check that but didn’t take into account my damage cards; thanks for the help!!!
---
ANY DR/ER you have on will lower the damage instead of raise it.
---
if your armor is not broken, you need to break or unequip it to get the zerk benefits.  its legendary effect adds dr or er that's also a no-go
---
take off iron in endurance, perk DR counts toward zerk DR.
---
We just need a security box wit a keypad on it , idk whu the devs didnt Hear the good advices like this one from players
---
Have to start screenshotting everything with your name visible via Inventory Menu, best way to not lose items and gear is by giving the game a few minutes to auto-checkpoint your progress before venturing out again, especially if it's a tastey roll. Usually every 3 minutes or so is a checkpoint save(doesn't always appear on screen).
---
Getting lagged out/blue screened/Disconnected before a checkpoint sucks and you are likely to lose what you found a few minutes prior.
---
If this doesn't need to be placed in water, this is also especially useful for people that have their camps in mountainous areas away from water scores. It makes it so I don't have to spend a whole three minutes collecting dirty water from a water pump.
---
He's also been handing out legendary armor depending on how the event went. Have gotten a few heavy combat pieces over the past two days, only one worth keeping so far was a 1-star Unyielding heavy combat right leg (max level).
---
I keep my camp next to the logging camp aka tick vill in the forest so im not near enough to the event on xbox so blast away
---
Blood washed combat had a gold trim and goldish base with of course blood spatters.
---
Have to use your imagination a bit.  Post war ppl that died of any number of things.  Guy in a car?  Could have been a heart attack hearing of events on the radio.  Also could have been robbed or whatnot soon after the war began by people panicking for their own survival.
---
I was leaving luck hole mine this morning and went to a nearby camp. The owner was there and after I made my lead and ammo, I noticed they were missing some bobbleheads from their display. I dropped them two that I wasn't needed and gave  them a thumbs up. So if they're there you can still help them. A mail box would be great too.
---
Whats the safe zone? My wifes camp got nuked and she's got her CAMP right under that town with the airport
---
You can do this. Go up to the vending machine and leave some caps in it, you’ll get items based on how many caps you put in
---
Preventing people from putting camps around event locations is not a punishment. It’s a courtesy to literally everyone else. There is no point building around these places. Just put a large no-build zone around them and call it a day.
---
That's like some paranoid lunatic yelling "buy and get out" at you from behind steel bars with a weapon posted at you while you're shopping
---
It kind of looked silver in the shop.
---
 But thanks I'll give it a try. I have a bunch of atoms left from the challenges anyway.
---
I'm just going to play Outer Worlds several times through when it comes out and not worry too much about what free shit they add to this game while I am doing that.
---
I disagree with Legendary Armor being lower on the Meta for Heavies than PA.
---
Especially if you rock bloodied.   The ability to stack Nerd Rage and Emergency Protocols and Adrenal Reaction far outway the benefits that a bolstering or unyeilding set would offer, because your stacking way more damage.   You also dont get stabilized benefits in legendary.
---
And with Ultracite, you can still equip a jetpack in your head or arms or legs slots.  Now you have EP, AR, NR, and a jetpack for mobility.
---
For PVP you may be better in legendary, but only 2% of the population PVPs regularly enough to be concerned with that.  For PVE, PA still trumps non PA for heavies
---
class freak but no starched genes makes zero sense ;)
---
Is there any information on the legendary players thing that you know of? All I can find is speculation and it’s the thing I’m most excited about.
---
One of them is Psycho. It just didn't work.
---
BIV and Grafton Mayer😖
---
I see people were dumb about you not getting it to work. As if we wouldn't check the freaking list to make sure it should count before make threads.
---
Then we play on different servers, the forest event usually has multiple level 100+ players at it on mine
---
Check out Captainoob on YouTube. He has a video that shows his sneak commando build. If you go Bloodied, you just have to keep your junk stashed, and not mind dying a lot more than normal. 
---
I’ve been running my Bloodied commando build today for meat week. People that were level 200 were emptying clips into the bears. I take 3-5 shots to put one down. SB’s go down in under 10 shots.
---
Equip enforcer. As stated below. It’s like night and day
---
Something is wrong with your settings then. 
---
Night is incredibly bright, to the point that visibility is almost the same as day.
---
Yep, you're right, dunno what I was thinking, thats the only possible option. Thanks
---
Well most players are focused on meat week atm
---
Didn’t know that part - THANK YOU!
---
Hush your mouth lol
---
Aren’t there two airports? There that workshop near Charleston and the Morgantown airport. I’m pretty sure Morgantown is in the safe zone (?)
---
I've actually experienced that.
---
Since the games recipe doesn't allow this-or-that, then the simplest solution is a recipe for purified to boiled.
---
I posted about it here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d9ncsu/psa_legendary_player_update_delayed/
---
Definitely not alone lol
---
It might not be exaclty what you're looking for, but [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/43?tab=description) mod makes the visuals bearable to me. I don't know what they were smoking when it comes to lighting and contrast.
---
I dont know what were all sick of more 1mole rats 2 crickets
---
Funny enough that the code for the companion system is currently present in game, I remember a post a month or so ago where the commands popped up for a guy for people in his party. Only command that worked was to open a door.
---
You just saved me much time wandering aimlessly and crying as it got dark. Thank you.
---
How the hell is taking away nukes and death laser satellites hindering other factions of surviving? They devote most of their attention to wiping out ghouls and mutants to help those survivors but of course they’re gonna develop an attitude if you  refuse to work with them
---
The games recipe system only accepts exact ingredients though, not this-or-that. Therefore just adding a purified to boiled recipe is simpler than adding additional recipes that use purified water for every single current recipe that uses boiled.
---
Good on you!
---
Renamed item names do not show up in player vendors.
---
Thanks! Managed to find him and picked the power connectors up.
---
Justice for Mister Cheswick!!
---
Well thats a bummer
---
Quickest way to break armor is to go find one of the SBs and let it do it's stupid Sonic attack, that breaks most armor pretty quick. Or you can get a friend with an explosive weapon to VATS target your individual limbs and hit them, but that's means one of y'all will be wanted or have to be in survival, which is annoying enough on it's own. Either way store your loot and bring some stims.
---
The Fallout 4 Brotherhood Combat Armor was Copper not Gold.

---
similar to my own setup.
---
It would go great with 16 Tons
---
I just lock my Brahmin away because people just love to kill my gentle Mac'n'Cheese.

---
I leave everything unlocked apart from my silver collector; no need to give away caps for free. My front door has the pressure plates on a powered door for entry and exit to the whole house and the only trouble I get is molerats endlessly chomping away at the brick wall between them and my generator. There's no need to lock anything. If a stranger slept in my bed while their friend sat on my sofa I wouldn't care, it's meaningless
---
Happens to me all the time on Xbox
---
Real life or in game?
---
Most important question: What are you pricing it at?
---
I have a Short Gatling Gun with a Bayonet mod that I've affectionately named "Mr. Narwhal."
---
Fastnacht Sausage Soup eyyoooooo
---
There are two airports one is north and basicly on the edge of a town.
---
I actually have my camp by the southern airport (actually closer two the Power plant tbh) so we can bounce around the map for free or just have cheaper travle lol.
---
But yeah one day someone nuked her (and a few others) camps and a good chunk of Morgantown donno if the used a bug or what.
---
I want a radio host voiced by Clint McElroy, but Grahm sounds like a good idea too!
---
I went through 3 events without scrip appearing before it finally atarted to accumulate.
---
I think I’m gonna be launching some nukes tonight
---
Base Jumping event in FO76 please
---
Hahaha. In the game.  I probably should have clarified that one.
---
Is it not possible to input this-or-that? Probably harder than you'd think but from a layman's point of view it should be pitifully simple
---
Yesterday someone in the forest built a huge ass 30 concrete foundation fortress covered in barn walls that caused so much lag that nothing would spawn so we were all verry pissed on xbox one.
---
Actually I remember something about Morgantown being nukable. It has pretty good flux yield and quite a few ghouls to irradiate.
---
If it's overpriced people are probably turned off by the fact it's not max level and a vats cost tertiary effect is what really puts this item into god tier.   
---
The other factor dragging the value down is most people like this weapon for PvP but with the demise of survival mode demand is down for anything related to it including teslas.  
---
Still though I'd imagine its worth at least a few thousand caps
---
Inmortal*
---
I should’ve added that for the daily challenge craft 5 healing, you can do it on that run. As you go pick soot flowers for healing salve. Also pick the green fungus along the river for Radaway and then just dilute a Radaway and stimpak. 10 easy Atoms.
---
If they purposefully place stuff over the barrel and make it so you can't access it? Nuke'em. If they're just by it, and you can trigger the event like normal, it's not a problem.
---
Can't nuke the forest.
---
U will if I see it because I'll nuke that bitch.
---
🤯
---
That's nice and all and I do use mods but this really shouldn't be a third party feature.
---
I'd have left that camp without even looking at the machines tbh
---
ok chapocel
---
The max i left my xbox is 30 min but it still showed me on the drums when i got bk just had the dim screen and norm pop up
---
I've never seen a camo dress, I would love to see a screenshot of what it is.
---
The whole world was nuked radioactive particles are in the atmosphere, air can become deadly even if you don't get directly nuked. oh shit a nuke get in the car drive as far as I can oh no the fucking ash and debri in the air (and now my lungs) is radioactive guess im dead.
---
I would like a way to collect water for cooking while not getting rads..
---
I love that idea maybe even if its just leather still because i hate having to choose between not dying from rads and not getting one hitted from enemy's
---
That would be awesome! So if a jerk comes by and posts slurs on your walls, it wouldn't actually show for everyone to see.
---
I agree there are plenty of camps that have vending but no stash boxes and or benches for their customers......
---
The forest has been nuked in this last week u just cant nuke next to the valt
---
Wait how do you tag materials?! 
---
It says you can set the collectron for certain thing but the only options I've found are junk or scrap.
---
Yeah, the verbiage seems incorrect to me as well. *Event specific items* would be more accurate.
---
Right on, even the combat ones could be more nuanced.  So instead of raiders just outright attacking, one walks up and tries to extort the player.    
---
"Nice place you got here, it would be a shame if it got all shot up, me and my buddies over there will protect the place for say... 500 caps per week.  whadaya say?"
---
Save some snark for the rest of us. Please elaborate how letting people build camps in places like this is a good idea? What benefit does it give? I’m genuinely curious.
---
Yup ,not my job to see if you're turret farming.  If your camp's at a PC Event site ,I'm nuking it.
---
No, just hop server.  Let him have his jollies.  You a Raider, toughen up!  If the player is following you server to server that's different.
---
/signed
---
This would save a lot of time and caps. Hunting for that one specific armor piece is a pain, and running into camps that have *nothing* but cosmetics is quite frustrating. Would love to see this happen.
---
Can't be as bad as Rose's station...
---
LoL,name noted,hehe.
---
The same is happening at campfire tales and other events. People are not thoughtful about others and you dont gets a chance to even hit the legendaries unless you are right next them when they appear....
---
Wow I have yet to have that happen for me. Good to know tho!
---
hear
---
Killed a legendary prime beh today in bog pc event.
---
Please!!
---
Can someone explain what meat week actually is? I’ve been away from the game for the last like 6 months so been pretty out of the loop
---
It would also be nice if it seperated legendary and non-legendary items.
---
"Nooooooo make stinky pile in studio Chally"
---
I don't think they are going to ease up on the grinding.  Keeping you playing is keeping the revenue coming in.  Perhaps we should look at this from a different angle.  Why are you boiling all this water?
---
Good point.
---
It would be nice in the pip-boy and especially nice in the stash. It takes a while to scroll through my collection of outfits to find the armor I’m looking for. 
---
Or even if they added at category filter after value and weight so it would group like items together.
---
Add a star for how many legendary items as well! I’ve seen a toon of those asylum outfits and I don’t see anyone wearing them...lol
---
It would take an amazing coincidence to place your camp exactly so it happens to bock the drums behind locked doors with no way in :P
---
Somebody said he came from New Orleans
---
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
---
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
---
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, 
---
Big John
---
Great tune.
---
Mission 3 is possible to do solo on novice (from my experience) however, every mission above normal will be a very difficult challenge
---
I’ve seen them twice at Breach and clear in adventure.
---
I think this community is now looking to nuke the Mayor, probably not an ideal longterm radio dj.
---
People like you are why I love this community so much. 💕
---
Given the time to climb the tree and time to kill all those crickets and the time to server hop...
---
I find Larry’s Meat ‘n Go to be a lot faster. 15-20 acid from the three snallygasters that go down quickly with the right gear. Then just hop servers and repeat. 
---
I hate those crickets.
---
I’ve been grinding for two days for a few armor pieces and I’m only seeing the same crap clothing. You can almost tell by where the camp is located if it’s a lower lvl but it’s not an exact science lol.
---
Thanks for the response 🙃.
---
In your pipboy in the Junk section.
---
Yes it would maybe a number of stars next to weapons
---
Lol I didn't think about people using any letter sets but yeah I could see that lol
---
I thought 8-10k was fair. It has a 3rd vats star, I forget what it is. I'll look later and edit this. It pc for more than that.
---
All good. Welcome back! Meat Week is a special event hosted by Grahm the friendly super mutant (and his pack brahmin Chally). 
---
There are mini-events called Primal Cuts that pop up on the map; at these, you kill 4 waves of enemies, the last being a big enemy (deathclaw, sheepsquatch, scorched beast, depending on your location). These events spawn roughly every 15 minutes. Your reward is prime cuts, which can be used at Grahm's meat cook.
---
The meat cook is the big timed event, where players gather to complete the tasks listed in my post. It's fun, and it's a way to get unique rewards like the Tenderizer, a special melee weapon. That event is up by Vault 76 and occurs once an hour, on the hour.
---
Haha they’re great! Aren’t they?
---
What’s your progress been like? I’m starting to get worried, especially for my Sunday night sleep. I only have 11/25 so far.
---
As far as I'm concerned both are active on my router. Is there a way to force Fo76 to use only IPv4? I'd rather not disable it entirely as it's usually a benefit.
---
that's the hope at least and would be awesome for those like me with a serious alt addiction problem :P
---
Thanks!
---
Absolutely not. This kind of thing is annoying enough in a PvP space, but bringing it in to cooperative events is just asking for trouble. Shouldn't even be considered.
---
I stood there and used the puke emoji a lot.
---
If you dont want players near your camp, turn off your vending machines.
---
There not a rarity anymore and some are out of there minds trying to charge 5000 a piece for them. Kills me how ppl over price things that you get often, even legendary items.
---
Well, as long as he doesnt talk about his stupid buried with honor. Id like campaign ads for him, and him being guest starred for political questions
---
I really find mole miners interesting as well. They've somewhat tamed molerats somehow, have an impressive arsenal of weapons at their dispsposal, and for some reason the only friendly mole miner we've met is set up in the mire, very far away from the ash heap.
---
In hoping vault 54 gives some answers since it isn't listed alongside vault 94 in the challenges.
---
If you manage to land all flechettes (Formula P helps with that a lot) with one or two shots, residual poison dmg will kill everyone in few seconds, even sentass folks. I do have QEH, too; it was one of the best weapons even before, now on raid PA it's very much op.
---
Yeah thats exactly what ill do thanks man
---
Maybe try drinking later in the day, thanks for the info though!
---
The same guy that keeps a pipe pistol in his safe.
---
Generally p2w models doesn’t mean you couldn’t ever get everything just by playing, but rather just that the deck is stacked so far against you that you’re highly incentivized to pay. And those purchases give you an inherent advantage over other players. (See CoC for excellent examples)
---
No idea what the criteria is to make it happen, but it's been a pretty consistent thing for the events I've been in
---
Haha glad you can get off somehow, hehe
---
I think that that is a fantastic idea!!
---
I second this and raise a Leroy Brown
---
Honestly having the McElroys in Fallout would be a dream! (Besides Pam's house)
---
And cant bring himself to build roofing over any of the stairwells in his home
---
No. Where else am I going to get yarn at?
---
It’s a trap for the wounded... and illiterate.
---
Or you get that one dick who blocks everybody out so they can’t get a shot off. As bad as a griefer.
---
This wouldn’t have been purposely hit by the enforcement team if it was reported. What happened was that the bot system that they implemented probably picked up on the multiple reports and forced changed your gt. All you have to do is send a ticket saying what happened and even though I think your gt shouldn’t have been hit either way, they’ll change it back for free.
---
“Phat dastard” isn’t against the guidelines. 
---
Former enforcement team member
---
Hahaha what a legend, im gonna do that too now!! I love ruining peoples games, your a bit of a twatt for reporting him imo
---
That’s my dilemma! I spend 95% of my time in BOS Heavy Combat Armor (mostly Chameleon) with a stealthy Commando build outside of Nuke Zones. But the rads in Nuke Zones are quick death. 
---
Then I have to ditch all that gear to throw on PA (which I have actually upgraded nicely with a Jet Pack, targeting HUD and calibrated legs). I have some perks that help maintain stealth (Escape Artist), but I hate giving up all the armor perks. 
---
(And yes, I know I could do a Stealth Boy on the PA torso. But the jet pack is so sweet.)
---
If I know someone is at their camp while I'm using it I'll usually drop some loot for them.
---
Has one gotten the mods for the tenderizer? Or the tenderizer itself yet? I’m having issues getting either.
---
Another tip for renaming things is to put an underscore in front of the name. This moves the item to the bottom of your list so your good stuff isn't mixed in with the fluff.
---
What about armor that doesn’t have light, sturdy, heavy?
---
I would love to see this,  I'd also love to see some real  West Virginian radio talents ( specifically some from West Virginia Public Broadcasting) given this opportunity.   Mostly selfish wishful thinking but whatever.
---
They do seem to have their own society, I hope we get a look at it
---
Good lord, not even close to subtle lol your gt is without a doubt against the community guidelines for sexual reference. This is where you went wrong:
---
You tried to correlate “CookiesCreampie” with cookies known as Boston cream pies. 
---
You misspelled “cream pie”. “Cream pie” with a space is okay within the community guidelines. “Creampie” with no space is undoubtedly a sexual reference. 
---
Thus, your gt was properly enforced. There is no way you can get that gt back.
---
Along with the unwanted name change they should have given u a free name change, if they did try to change it back
---
exactly, they already have the tech to check anyway so just let it check when it 'found' a server before it actually tries to load one in
---
please explain how that would influence \*your\* loading time :D
---
Yes people can use voice messages as evidence to report you. “Fucking cunt” stacks according to their enforcement policy. I’m not sure what the lengths for each stack of profanity is as of now but yeah you were properly enforced.
---
Or just use wood armor instead?
---
no, im afraid not
---
I don't play anymore but it's funny reading this nonsense. You lose gear for exploring content, a first in mmo history.
---
Yes.
---
It's like grinding for anything else in the game. Some days you get the 3-star dream piece, but most days it's pipe pistols and weathered asylum hats...
---
I try to limit my clothing sales to pieces that people might actually want, but still it would be nice to have a category for them that was distinct from "armor".
---
One of my favorite responses to this was the guy who said "If your vending machine contains nothing but herpes, I'm killing your Brahim!" That made me chuckle.
---
Are you surprised? lol players are not allowed to use any form of “pedophile” as their gt. Also you included reference to violence which also is against community guidelines.
---
Nuke em all, let god sort them out.
---
I don't even have walls now, so I could have two magazine racks and a bobblehead stand.
---
Me too. Where is my damn dog Bethesda!?
---
With a ticket submitted, your gt should have been changed back by a real enforcement team member IF your gt didn’t go against their policies to begin with. They review all reports.
---
Not trying to be a downer, but other than the legacy 'double' prefix, that gun is not worth keeping anyway. What platform are you on? If PS4 or PC I can hook you up with something good.
---
Yep you can totally nuke Morgantown.
---
I'm at a perfect spot for my camp, with no water anywhere near it so I have to use my water pump. God is it so slow.
---
If they added canning, they could make it so you could only deposit canned and pre-war food.
---
Not sure what you mean by can’t keep on your person. How do you use it then?
---
Maybe you mean like an IRA where you have to wait a certain period of time for it to “mature “ before you can access it? That would be a hot mess with players screaming It’s MY money and I want it back NOW!!!
---
Bottom line is that the only realistic way to bank caps is to use a trustworthy friend to hold them while you bring in a mule toon.
---
Suggestion: spell Grahm’s name correctly  and make him happy.
---
Lol my son and one of our squad members said if we didn’t all hate griefers so bad we raise hell at their caps when we see 31 asylum outfits.
---
Of course your gt got reported and was appropriately enforced and changed. Your gt goes against community guidelines as it references a pretty vulgar sexual reference. Easy open and shut case for them.
---
I don’t know You guys but I just read the entire text in super mutant voice by imagining how it would sound and it didn’t  felt right  .
---
In **NVIDIA settings** after adding fallout76.exe to the list:
---
Manage 3D settings - Virtical Sync to **Fast**
---
This for me removed micro stutters, especially when panning, may be worth trying anyway.
---
Guess I'm just unlucky this time around, I saw one every time at the last Meat Week, even if some jerk with a Bloodied build OHKO'd it.
---
Corrected me feel better now ? :)
---
Tbh it was probably fresh pure water 100 or whatever years ago but even sealed water goes bad.
---
I have had it hit and miss, most of the time players wait for one another. I usually pick up and use an assault rifle off a mole miner to get a hit on the legendaries so i dont kill them.
---
And the crater is radioactive. Regardless, WV is so close to DC, which was hit, the fallout would have covered the region easily.
---
Right now I’m attempting the tadpole challenges. It’s a bit frustrating but I’m getting there. Just wish I’d picked up chemist and pharmacist. Either way your farming route is totally spot on. 😀
---
I think you are correct, I remember gold trim but that was from the shop images, never owned it.
---
Take a look at the first responders at Chernobyl. They only lived maybe 2 weeks after the explosion.
---
Pretty sure they're refering to the blatant bomb craters you find around that are also clearly radioactive. That said, we know for a fact at least some tactical level nukes hit appalachia, since theres a random encounter with an unexploded one. 
---
...unexploded unless you cut the wrong wire trying to salvage it anyway.
---
I’ve often come across camps that look so good I’d like to leave a note that says “this is fucking awesome, nice work”
---
I had a glitch where I was on the catwalk of the bridge and 2 ghouls ran off the edge of the bridge and just kept running. I got a screen shot of one but can't post it here.
---
For the love of God save the greens for the last 30 seconds, DON'T PUT THEM AWAY AS YOU GET THEM!!!
---
In beta, my camp was on the outskirts of the golf course and had cardboard vault boys on the roof with work lights behind them. It cast these huge shadows on the grass and looked hella cool. There was a lighting overhaul which, among other things, made default PA headlights too bright and bright headlights completely wash out everything, and I don't recall my camp objects casting shadows since.
---
That'd be fucked.
---
YES, THIS TOO! I learned that last time around, and now I collect all the greens (or all the ones others haven't collected) and sit on them until the bar fills up most of the way.
---
Water doesn't expire, but the plastic bottles it is stored in does. That is when the water gets contaminated.
---
You could earn them the currency in battlefront 2 when it first came out as well
---
I will see you coming and pull plug from the wall, find me then!
---
Correct. 100% time if the user has no prior offenses and gt doesn’t even come close to violating the community guidelines, then their gt should get lifted from a forced change.
---
"How you have Meat-Cook with no meat to cook? Think about it."
---
We need him on Appalachia Radio to share more of his brilliant wisdom. He could even drop hints about the area he's in so players can hunt him down for his vendor services, just add a scrappy-looking eyebot following him around recording and broadcasting his signal.
---
Since they're getting rid of Survival and workshops will become even hotter PvP hotspots, they could also have Rose occasionally interrupt the broadcast when a workshop has been taken. "It's Raider Rose with breaking news for all you bloodthirsty cutthroats out there! Some jerks at \[workshop name\] wants AAAALLLLLLL that cool stuff for themselves! Are you just gonna let them have it?" But put it on a timer so she isn't doing it every two minutes.
---
Let's make cats amoral
---
I legit carries the event to steak because everyone was running around just killing critters. I saved all the greens, a few critter chunks until last few seconds, but before that I was the only one extinguishing fires, picking up chally's piles, and rotting piles. Ugh
---
Reinforced
---
Its been a problem for all of us for months
---
Properly enforced. Policy doesn’t allow gamer pics to display violence, especially an egregious one, towards in this case a pregnant woman.
---
Reported!!
---
Remove timers, completely.
---
It's the least they could do if they're gonna pretend everyone caught the stupid inside Vault 76 and forgot purified water works for recipes that call for water.
---
That's what I'm talking about. Critter chunks are great, but we don't need 6 out of 7 players there to be farming them. There are so many other things to do.
---
Ok sir chudalot
---
I 100% agree, I just wish people would listen
---
I accidentally killed a cat at the Meat-Cook today while I was VATSing for critters. They do not drop chunks.
---
I must forever live with my shame.
---
The vault 76 was only sealed up for 20 years, I believe.
---
we have the statistics to back up the idea that chapos are jobless, virgin teenagers.
---
No statistics for chud, a made up word that means nothing, though.
---
Also, legendaries seem to be spawning more often in Primal Cuts events. Have to be quick to get a shot in, though. Lots of high-powered one-shotters in the mix.
---
Recently acquired items aren't always able to be restored.
---
F uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
---
21 I believe. Theres only one server running rite now so it's a pain in the ass!
---
The check is much easier when loading in due to them already having everything placed.
---
LOL, I think of that more as "customer feedback" than griefing.
---
I really don't see what folks have to gain by artificially luring folks into their camp if it's full of hairballs and turds. It's not like someone is going to suddenly buy crappy items just because they are there...
---
is there an END perk that decreases negative effects from drugs? (i forget right now)
---
The community definitely makes up for the a lot of the games features lol.
---
Might've been murder. There were definitely suicides, both individual, murder-suicides and mass suicides found throughout the game. Some people may have just gone beyond the pale and started offing random strangers trying to go about their day-to-day after the bombs started falling on F-Day.
---
Honestly fallout4 looks better
---
Use xcell
---
I wish they would do anything with the radio. The radio was so popular in fo3, so they decided to almost completely ignore it in 4&amp;76. I dont get it. So many fun possibilities.
---
 Othing come no mind that we havent seen with deacons videos. Check out “gamer mom” and her places you can camp series she looks for prebuild areas and has a couple of really good places before deacon posted them.
---
Pretty positive you can find her like that if not ill send you a link
---
It's not a negative effect of the drug, it's a positive effect screwing up the whole mechanic.
---
Well it being lvl 40 is a whole diff issue as most who would go to venders are end gamers only looking for end game gear
---
With the pink wallpaper you could make mystic fingers instead.
---
Umm yes, I am aware of that, thank you.
---
You can’t, it’s in a safe zone
---
Thanks, I really like that song. Thats one thing I really like about Fallout games, they have a lot of music from my childhood.
---
“.. you die instantly once the drug wears off..”
---
I was interpreting this as a negative effect that you need to mitigate.
---
I'm not talking about graphical lag though. Plus changing any of the FPS related settings will break the game and I'm not really keen on that. Somebody above suggested using IPv4 as opposed to 6 but I'm not sure how to force Fo76 to use 4 over 6 for the network lag.
---
what is causing you yo instantly die once the drug wears off?
---
Must have been an unarmed build.
---
That is a terrible drug, does almost nothing and has the worst addiction.
---
Drugs that don't increase damage are useless.
---
Well I'm not a super mutant nor am I an expert lol
---
This but instead of calm and casual observations that somewhere is being nuked, the host should be completely terrified/horrified that it's all happening again just as the overseer was.
---
So, am I just out a 100 caps?
---
 Might be alime on this, but I'd happily give back 200 stash limit for an extra 25% camp budget.
---
Thanks never would have thought of that
---
With tip jars in general you could buy the park
---
Yeah I just see it from my perspective I guess. End game we all have caps to spare, most of us spend down daily. A level 40 isn't much difference in damage either, so I just wondered if they had nerfed it. Thanks for the response though.
---
Except raises all your perks 2 points... including strength. So yeah, it does increase damage.
---
They are [aware of it as an issue](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/364608/unable-to-craft-hazmat-suit-after-learning-plans/3?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Whether or not they fix it... another story
---
NO!
---
The temporary hp is greater than the 20% threshold so if it wears off you go into negative hp and die.
---
Tip Jara and reverse psychology boys!
---
aww I wanted to be your friend, are you on PC?
---
Drop Class Freak and run Starched Genes.
---
Drop ammosmith and born survivor for Dodgy
---
Drop Power Patcher, its a waste as PA degrades so slow, this is a waste of 3 points, you would be better with demo expert 3 since you use an explosive gun.
---
I would drop Bandolier and Full Charge and finish off Expert and Master Heavy guns. (the 20% dmg is worth it)
---
Drop sunkissed and finish off fireproof.
---
Move your unused Endurance and Cha points to Agility so you can rock Action Boy along with Dodgy.
---
Those are my suggestions.  There are a lot of QoL perks on your loadout, and a lack of combat effective perks.
---
Who's we, the incel police?
---
Hear* me out.
---
Use the bloatfly syringer to spawn bloatflys that will destroy his camp!
---
I fast travel right out as their waving lol
---
Feel better? :)
---
That was an accident and i forgot to remove it off that list in all honestly.
---
I think it might make more sense if he is part of a quest line to unite the super mutants with either the raider or survivor factions in wastelanders......however short lived that alliance be lol
---
So nonces then. Ps4 is just shit
---
Y'know now that you mentioned it I actually haven't checked her out in a while, I watched a lot of her videos right after the launch and then fell off. I'll have to give her videos a look see though, thanks man.
---
Feel better ? :)
---
An awesome fix would be to make the supervisors proper mini bosses.  Scale them up to at least double the size, and make them as durable as the alpha in project paradise.  
---
This way a simple headshot from your local asshat player won't insta kill them but it also makes the event way more fun fighting these huge ass super bad ass mole miners.
---
And then we will have enough money to retire boys!
---
In a nut shell till they fix the problems i bought mine in whitesprings so like u and others we all tried and failed
---
It also works the other Way too! Burrowing into solid metal dirt!
---
Better?
---
Cool dastardly deeds is what I get from that name, is there a way to appeal?
---
Any idea where the guy's cabin might be that he alludes to in one of the manifestos?
---
Lol was satisfying
---
10% vs 40% isn't a real choice. 2 to every special doesn't matter when most derived stats are useless.
---
Good I'm glad :)
---
The Appalachia radio is so underwhelming to me. There should have been some back story here. Fo3 and fo4 had very important parts to the story line in their respective games, especially GNR with three dog. It just seems weird to me that the 76's main radio has no announcer, no story... it's just on. Def a missed opportunity.
---
haha I was gonna say I'd love to check this out if he isn't obnoxious like Oxhorn, ill check it when I get home
---
So whats the right drug to use since furry psyscobuff dont work?
---
Psychotats are unfortunately the best option.
---
The PE buff is useless but there's no end buff to screw you up and it still has 25% damage.
---
You're talking Adventure/Survival mode?? I thought they just changed Fury in Nuclear Winter... goddamnit
---
Alright, Satan, calm down.
---
Ya, but do you know who don't eat meat?
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d2ckll/_/ezx1to1/?context=1
---
I said this in another post and was downvoted. I still stand by what was promised and what has actually happened.
---
fair enough, will have to do some leveling but that was the general idea, the class freak was a mistake i left on there but still. I thought that the demo perks don't effect legendary effects, but anyways thanks.
---
Well the drums do help but not as much as other activities so if the event is going good np being on the drums but if it's looking close to not maxing out then yes you need to get off the drums and do one of the other activities that provides more bar.
---
There are several things bethesda could do to alleviate this issue, but folks just want you to have to rebuild your whole fucking camp apparently, be it from being nuked or stored in CAMP menu when you log on lol
---
They brightened the entire game shortly after launch. Most monitors/TV settings make the game stupid bright now. I suggest messing with options to get a similar feel back.
---
No the chapotraphouse survey results showing that 40% of its users live with their parents and only 30% of them actually have jobs
---
Below Wade Airport and Morgantown can be nuked unfortunately, even though Wade is still part of the forest region.
---
Chally
---
I cant remember seeing one from the top of my head. Unless you mean the quarries..
---
Isn't that just a regular bomb?
---
Sometimes reading instructions is hard for people. Unless you’re playing in 3/4 time when it should be 4/4 then it’s all you.
---
....Then the server will crash and we can all join different servers where that guys camp may not be, good idea
---
I support this suggestion
---
as a primary user of explosive weapoins I can confirm that it does in fact affect the legendary effects.  
---
When im not using nerd rage, i drop it for Demo 5 instead of 2
---
Oh I got it on my first try. Is it that rare?
---
The other day, I saw Cazadores tequila in my local liquor store.
---
They're all high, but it mostly doesn't effect their performance.
---
FNV has nightmare material baddies. Those Deathclaws are no f'ing joke either! Dang nightstalkers chomping on my butt and those ghouls in the vaults were pretty terrifying. There was some screaming on my part a few times. I have to say though, the wendigos also do a number on me, so thanks for this terrifying suggestion!
---
The more i know.
---
Free to play is the right solution I think. I also don't think they ACTUALLY put all the servers together. I've seen twitch streamers get a lobby full of names I've never seen before.  
---
I've never heard an asian language spoken either, so that to me is more proof that all the servers aren't blended together.
---
Great! One more question: Who determines flair? I would like to ask for "Lone Wanderer" to be added
---
Hhmm. I would not know. I'm 57 and retired so...
---
Last time I use a bloodied unarmed build but died too often in part due to not being able to use stealth during primal cuts.
---
Since then I'm using a Junkie's unarmed build and I can still 1-shot most enemies with the bonus of not dying. I try to not one-shot things so that others can get their hits in but if I wait too long it can cause the evemt to run out of time. Especially when the animals take to long to come out to play.
---
I was struggling a bit with the Glowing Mirelurk Queen but now I use my Anti-Armor Explosive Combat Shotgun to cripple its legs and spouts. It just sits their helplessly while we whack and shoot it to death.
---
I searched the area and couldn't find any cabins outside the Kiddie Corner Cabins near the trailer you find the 5th installment of the Manifesto in, and nothing there matches his notes. There's also Black Bear Lodge, but that doesn't really work either. 
---
I've taken to assuming he referred to a trailer there as the cabin, but I can't confirm that, nor does it really work for murdering a hiker in terms of seclusion
---
not really though, using savage and forest.  both are on water access points for purifiers, as for the forest, the whole river stretch along the water has been vendor camps since vending came out.  thanks to water and 76 (free FT) being nearby.  
---
most of those are not built on the drum spawn.  which is my point. not everyone there or in range of mob spawns have done so on purpose.  its pretty easy to tell who is blatantly blocking and whos been camping a long time
---
Shit did they? I just remembered seeing the nerf.
---
If there's a lot of people, I play drums. If there aren't a lot, I do the other stuff. I refuse to run with 3 other people shooting the same squirrels
---
I could not possibly care any less
---
I understand the pain of this, I have my camp at a lead deposit sight that's also relatively close to where White springs is. Apparently everyone on the planet has the exact same idea so I would server hop multiple times. Eventually I just moved my camp to a junk pile and get the occasional lead. It sucks but it's the best alternative for the time being
---
Great! One added question: Who decides the available flair? I would like to inquire about getting "Lone Wanderer" added.
---
Try and team up with a few people in the event. When in a team you can loot each other's enemies so only one of you will need to tag the manger.
---
You must be within close proximity for it to work but that should be easy in uranium fever.
---
So get a little team and have each of you facing a different spawn point.
---
Yes the plan is SUPER rare! Like less then 1%
---
Congratulations you can basically get WHATEVER you want in a trade
---
That's not right, you either petrify or become a scorched ghoul.
---
Hey that’s totally cool too!
---
Knowing is half the battle!!!
---
Used to be caped at 190. Good ol days before cry babys comapined
---
You guys need better holidays.
---
Im pretty sure the holotape or terminal that talks about it says some people just die from it. Like 95% sure
---
Can you build a camp on the bridge? Would be cool if we could use the spring traps from there!
---
You haven't played at all hours of the day. You are reporting your experience during peak hours.
---
Holy crap, I've just had one lying around in my inventory
---
Water source. Train Station nearby. Easily defensible (attacks from one side only).
---
Healing items are only under the healing tab.
---
Yup if it is the Plasma Gernade plan!
---
I don't.
---
I definitely didn't the other day. I was 10 short of one of the big bundles when I started, then I was 10 short when it said I'd done 3 challenges.
---
I'm near Pleasant Valley Station, mostly for fast travel costs.
---
YES! https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6uccERg8HYxx78P07jhS9j/fallout-76-patch-12-notes-august-20-2019
---
Its under Nuclear Winter design changes, so only there evidently.
---
I have a Quad gauss for you if you are interested, monsterbug 1 is my tag
---
I am really sorry that you lost a legacy weapon
---
That doesn't make much sense, maybe someone knows what entry you mean. Afaik the skeletons died from unrelated things like the one on the bicycle near a ramp.
---
I agree that pricing seems to be outrageous with no standard yet on anything it seems. 
---
Sorry but a 3* piece of armor that increases lock picking for 3000+ caps chances are I won’t be looking in the other machines... or regular used unfixed items or broken for sale...or 32 chem benches stacked as plans...
---
I don't think you read what I posted.  I'm only advocating nuking bases that block access to the drum, thus preventing the event from working.
---
I hope that clears things up.
---
Well shit nm then.
---
nothing says shut up and cooperate like legendary items and piles of scrip
---
76 is a free travel spot and I make 100x more caps next to it than anywhere else.
---
I'll grab all the greens if I can, turn the spits then dump the greens right at the end.
---
I personally think we need a dynamic radio host that announces the going-ons of the world and the map, (events, new creatures that pop up, rare creature sightings, rumors about new adventures and quests that come with updates possibly) more than more songs, but if we could get both that would awesome!
---
got a quad gauss bash damage +1 perception for you if you want, monsterbug 1 is my gamer tag
---
&gt;survival game
---
You can’t be serious.
---
My GT was exactly what it is here, it's literally a word you'd teach small children instead of cursing.
---
I went and read the wiki about it, it doesn't mention them turning to stone either, just what happens to those who turn. Skin gets flayed, lose mental abilities etc.
---
But you might be right, I might be remember it wrong. We know for a fact it didn't turn everyone.
---
Camp 1: I was low level, still in slap damage or whatever it was, so found a fairly inaccessible cliffside between the junkyard and the lighthouse which had some Cu.  Defensible, out of the way, income and resources nearby.
---
Camp 2: still in slap dage times, so made a tiny camp in a depression in the woods by the ski supply shop and transmitter tower.  Again, low visibility and out of the way.  
---
Removed slap damage, camps became indestructible 
---
Camp 3 and 4 were for scenic beauty up on cliffs with a great view. Although Camp 4 is better suited for vendor traffic and lower FT costs, planning to pull up stakes and move back to Camp 3 on the west end of Toxic Vallet for scenic beauty and to retire.
---
Legendary items to the communities is like the adhesive to our weapons😂
---
Just aim the curser dead center on the yellow hexagon thing. Works ok on Xbox at least.
---
Water, herbivore mutation, close by to cranberries, safe from nuking, junk node, lv 1 enemies, very easy to make disease cures and healing salves
---
my argument is about the no build zone about it though.  if you read the original comment i even mention my favorite one to drop a nuke on.
---
I start on drums until I get a couple of participation procs.. then I add wood to the pile, dump my prime meats and chally feed.. also cleaning up any mess piles or chally poop or grass fires on the way.. 
---
after that ill pick up any greens nobody else grabbed and try to get some critters to turn in 
---
finally Ill go to the spits and turn one until it ends..
---
I have not been in a failed or less than maxed cookout since the first couple days when it ran in the summer..
---
I get your pain, long load times as well dont help either
---
screws and springs
---
I haven't confirmed this but I heart they are considered 'Animals' instead of 'Insects.' So if you have a set of Hunter's armor it *should* help. However, I use Bolstering Sentinel armor, Blocker 3, Lone Wanderer 3, Barbarian 3, Evasive 3, Incisor 3, Iron Fist 3, and a Junkie's Deathclaw Gauntlet. They do little damage and I take them out in one hit. Vault 94 however is a slightly different story :-/
---
its as close as i could get it to the overseers camp.. only thing i put down was a tinker bench
---
I mostly just use it for free FT
---
What platform? PC or console? 
---
This is first I’ve heard of this, if it’s PC, I won’t be shocked...
---
Radio tracks should be for the jukebox and the classic stuff played on the jukebox should be on radio...
---
Because knowledge is power
---
blueprint a huge staircase
---
Oh man, that would be so great! I know 3 Dog was such a great part of the journey for FO3, I totally didn’t even think about an announcer to be honest!
---
You say that like being anti-p2w is bad?
---
I could definitely see that working out. It would also help create cool little like music halls or dance halls by players and bars!
---
Avoid workshops like the plague if you want to avoid pvp.  
---
There have been a few reports of this happening.  They claim while you are in the boundary and pounce.
---
This was at 7am est hardly peak
---
How the crap do I do that? I don't even know how to build a wall much less an entire wooden fort knox just the NW mode.
---
One location in Toxic Valley that has lead and junk ALWAYS has a players camp on it as well as a few other locations... 
---
Use one of the Fallout 76 map guides and find a better less user location.

It is... though people keep pressuring them to remove more and more of what makes it that
---
It's not healing items, it was chems. Psycho isn't a healing item.
---
I cannot be the only one who wants changes like these surely.
---
ah i see what you’re saying now. yeah they overlooked that one.
---
Well, on of the definitions of "dirty" refers to radioactive fallout, so it may have been pure water and was contaminated. Since radiation cant be stopped by a thin piece of First Aid Kit sheetmetal or a plastic bottle, it became dirty after the great war. The End.

Just build a water pump.  Then you can boil it at a food station.
---
I  am on PC
---
Yeah. You were in the zone when he initiated it. He killed you then left before he claimed it.

il sprint the greens, if im lucky il get 15-18 of them, then hit the drums until the rest get about a 1/4 bar after reward 2, then dump greens.  that green dump on a good run will finish out the bar most of the time

Thats where i am too, great location if you like to cook a lot, there's a little bit of everything growing nearby so no need to plant your own. There's a junk pile north of the locked shed too so don't miss that. 
---
Nice daily deathclaw egg on the nearby deathclaw island. Few bobble heads nearby, some mags and an sort trip to the fairground!
---
It's an entire aspect of the game that I never have and never will have any interest in  exactly like it was in fallout 4.
---
I dont even listen to the radio but I do think they should have a host and more music and maybe some quests and that when Wastelanders comes out, fo sho
---
When you hear the word jukebox most people think think he 50’s and 60’s and rock and roll... not one track of classical at all...
---
Freedom 76.
---
when you are in the zone of an unclaimed workshop, and someone starts the claim.  it turns every player in bounds to a hostile target to the claiming party.  it is a mechanic and not a bug.
---
but that part really needs to be explained better
---
That or if they could maybe do like a drive in movie event maybe?
---
Since when do camps block the event? There were no problems last meet week?
---
Yes - wise advise. I think these things slip through the cracks. I had claimed a workshop when playing the day before and if I had been killed then I wouldn't have minded because that is what is supposed to happen - my fault. But I think some people try to find glitches that put you into PVP without you knowing.
---
I’ve been reading a lot of issues with exploits and glitches on the PC version more so than consoles. 
---
One being a guy with the behemoth melee weapon not even available to use being used to goi g below world and many other issues... 
---
Crazy... I’d send a report to Bethesda either way with info so they can be aware of it.
---
Only for low levels? Because after 50 you stomp everything.
---
This game is the opposite of a survival game, you can find/produce/loot a surplus of everything.
---
You only need a melee weapon to destroy 99% of enemies, if you put some effort into your build you can one hit kill close to everything.
