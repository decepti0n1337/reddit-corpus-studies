Sounds like there is quite a few of us who wish Bethesda would stop acting like a helicopter Mom insisting we play with the other kids. I hate playing online multi-player games for a reason. The one butt wipe ruins the good feeling the other 20 players leave. It's poison in the well. One jerk always ruins it for everyone.

---
I hear ya. I was referring to my first C.A.M.P. I played pretty fast and loose with my perks, too.
---
AGREED! Where do I sign the petition???
---
My online handle is a derivative of Asmodeus, which is a demon. But I got it from changing the spelling of the character in The wheel of Time series. I had to add a number because the plane name was taken and adding the number one or two seemed boring. I'm not a particularly evil person myself lol.
---
slip187o.  hit me up whenever
---
I'd just laugh at people likje that and walk away.. It's the buyer that technically sets the price, not the seller. If no one wants to pay that much, the seller will never make a sale.
---
Add your platform, it'll help!
---
That's my understanding but I also believe the fight can continue indefinitely if the killed player seeks revenge
---
600 caps? I feel sorry for you lmao you on Xbox ? Got anything to sell for some caps ? Lol
---
I like this game, but I didn't play at launch, first impression are your last for a reason, the bag issue, asking cheaters for information how they cheated to get unbanned, the drinks, the bottles. I tried convincing my friends to buy it and give it a shot but nothing happen, the bad taste is there to stay for a while
---
You can use the camera. It shows the description of downed enemies even if the aren‚Äôt visible.
---
So it would take 150 days of gameplay.  Assuming a mere 10 minutes each means 1500 minutes or 25 hours of grinding.   If we assume a minimum wage of 10/hour it is 250 in labor.  And those horrifying numbers are conservative.
---
Bahahaha this post is gold!
---
You will be able to power your machine. Then it shows on the map. üëç
---
Shopping baskets, billiard balls. If you use the scraper perk on laser guns it's about ten plastic per gun.
---
Can't really help out today, but yeah it'll help to find people here. I tried soloing it today hoping randoms come along. They did...except they did absolutely fucking nothing. I had to grab all three pylons and deal the majority of the damage on the sheepsquatch. Wasted about a hundred stimpaks, too. All for a 1* vanguard raider leg and impostor sheepsquatch outfit. 
---

---
[Here's how a worst case scenario looks like](https://imgur.com/1ZGB5Mx)
---
Thanks for the info!
---
My first camp was a sleeping bag, stash box, and all the workbenches loosely arranged in a circle near the flatwoods relay tower so I could start every game session with a supply drop.
---
I have wood and maybe some leftover duplicate plans
---
That entire situation is shitty.  Oxhorn turns out to be homophobic, petty about criticism, and rather neckbeardy, but I also get the feeling that most of the people pointing it out do so because he is a "Bethesda Shill" who has positive opinions about Fallout 4 and 76.
---
Nobody wins here.
---
It looks like it‚Äôs stylized like borderlands but gameplay fallout, which is interesting
---
1star 2shot
---
The vast majority of us hate pvp!
---
Correct me if i'm mistaken, but you still have the chance to retrieve the dropped junk, unless somebody else picked it up. That hasn't changed since the beginning. And again, as it's no ones junk the moment it was dropped it's not stealing. So going after the one who 'legally' picked up some junk is kind of a dick move imho.
---
I felt rich when I noticed I had like 2,000 once.
---
I have a suspicion the suits in Zenimax were warned by the developers that this game shouldn't be released in it's state but those warning simply fell upon deaf ears for profit. Unfortunately the devs took and continue to take most of the heat.
---
99% of people who have it either duped tokens, bought duped tokens/suits, or abused a bug from early on that let you infinitely do them in one session
---
Life preservers. Nuka Cola cups and straw, shopping baskets, pool cue's and balls, racks, golf clubs and balls, cigarette packs and cartons ..
---
Gunsmith is a good skill, the 50% less damage to weapon condition is handy in most builds, especially if you get some of the faster guns like .50cal, LMG and Minigun. So keep that in.
---
Power Smith is also a good skill, but none you need to have equipped all the time, you can slot your perks in and out as often as you want, so if you want to mod something on your Power Armor, remove Gunsmith and put in Power Smith. Afterwards you can simply put Gunsmith in there again.
---
After you've hit max level (50) you keep leveling and get more perk cards. At some point you will have Power Smith (for when you mod your PA) and Power Patcher (when you need to repair your PA). Slot in Ammosmith when you are about to craft some Ammunition. You can even slightly redistribute your Special Statpoints after you hit level 50 (swapping 1 with another 1 each level, you will know what i mean when you hit 51).
---
I mean everyday in the context of how often these weapons come to market lol
---
A set for a explosive laser rifle is one of the only deals you‚Äôll see for a laser besides laser for laser.
---
dude, that is not a rainbow. that is a groundbow.
---
maybe but it's still good and YOU did it! Shine on ya little rock star
---
I looked there. All I have is the beer keg that I can‚Äôt use. I guess I‚Äôm bugged. 
---
Thanks for the help though.
---
It does not show as having any affect, have you tried adding / removing your armor near a rad source to see if it has affect? It might just be a user interface problem.
---
I think all explosive weapons break faster. After 300+ hours I still can't figure out how condition works, other than that it is calculated on hit and not on shot. My tse dragon breaks in like 18 shots from 200% condition
---
LOL, Same exact reaction.
---
People pvp over dropped junk every 5 minutes...it was intended...so no...not a dick move...many people take others junk just to initiate pvp...and when i drop my loot and it says on MY screen "retrieve YOUR dropped loot" yeah I'm gonna say it is still mine
---
It completes for me, doesn't give me a reward though...
---
My cooking station was on a rock but the soot flower was in the middle of a field - it's just never happened before.
---
Very nice!
---
Yeah it's insane. By the way how much is a tse dragon worth these days? Or an IE dragon?
---
I had a guy want to trade. He wanted my 3* gatling gun . I jokingly set the price at 10k.. He paid it. 
---
I should've gone higher.
---
It had faster reload - exploding - and more damage off mutated
---
Forever to be referred to as the pioneers of the groundbow!
---
God damn man you‚Äôre a very up yourself person. Believe it or not I didn‚Äôt just close my eyes and point at this comment to randomly respond to, I understand the context. Forced, unnecessary and overpriced micro transactions frustrate literally any player who has an understanding of the market or doesn‚Äôt view a game through rose-tinted glasses. I‚Äôve dumped a good 500 hours into tf2 and yet I despise their monetisation strategies. 
---
You can‚Äôt say people are ‚Äúfishing for outrage‚Äù or whatever the hell you said when they‚Äôre complaining about one of the most basic and widespread issues that encompass the majority of the games industry. If anything you‚Äôre just fishing for ways to defend FO76 if you really think their monetisation scheme is anything above detestable. Just because they latched onto a vile popular trend doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre any less guilty of introducing said vile trend to their game.
---
We play solo games because people in real life annoy us, why does no one understand this.

This would solve three MAJOR endgame issues all in one go: lack of cap sinks in the game, far too limited stash space, and camp/gear construction related tasks being more of a boring grind than a challenge once you have all the materials and perks you'll ever need
---
Forget what everyone else here is saying watoga high school is the place for plastic go to the cafeteria you will leave with about 200 pieces of plastic
---
Where as I am that guy with scrapper perk, farming uranium fever relaxing collecting all that. Scrapping it for steel and making a few thousand in caps a night. Just from selling steel to players.
---
And also when someone takes it the screen says another player has taken YOUR loot
---
They used to. It changed last patch.

Let‚Äôs see Paul Allen‚Äôs house
---
Its just my comprehension of the fine english language leave me barehanded and barefoot against the complexity of their point, which clearly seems to elude me. Not saying it was stupid. Saying I failed to understand it. Not a native speaker tho.
---
Idk honestly, it's a level 35 I got from a random ghoul. My first and only tse drop. I would estimate somewhere above 10k though. Instigating might potentially even be worth more than tse because you will almost never use a dragon on somebody that isn't at full hp
---
PS4, completely forgot about that haha, thank you!
---
Thanks, I assume grafton monster counts for cryptid?
---
YOU SHOULD HAVE SENT SUPER MUTE AND SHEEPQUATCH NUDES
---
oh my lord the bloom on that
---
Turrets are a situational thing.  Where I have my camp my two missile turrets are invaluable when super mutants, wild mongrels, liberator bots, ghouls, and other random encounters come knocking.  They have given me enough time to get out the right weapon to deal with the threat.
---
Alpine River Cabins has an explanation though.
---
Haven Church, on the other hand...
---
The part of the playerbase that actually use reddit, write in a forum or something like that is in most cases only a minority (maybe \~20% (cant prove that)). There will be enough players who sell even good items they dont need in their Vendors, cuz not everyone wants to go through the hazzle of creating accounts for x-platforms and make screenshots, write long posts, add people to their friendslist, make an inventory of their stock and so on.
---
I want to run a soda shop.
---
Oh I think it counts. If not, we can go wendigo cave. And you're welcome. :)
---
super mutants dont have genitals (that we know of) or breasts because the fev is similar to steroids it also makes their voice super deep tabitha and lily where female but looked and sounded like all other mutants I dont know about tabitha but lily remembers not being a mutant and her grandchildren so she acts like how she was before fev
---
Thanks for the help again +karma.
---
Saying the system might help
---
And to end the story we go to the vendor he accidentally sold it to, or the place he meant to drop the lvl 25 mini gun to reduce weight but dropped his favorite gun instead.
---
I appreciate it but I‚Äôm away from my console right now :)
---
Yea that's what I'm afraid of happening
---
Is this real life?
---
You‚Äôre kidding...thought I was getting a magnifying glass for steel. D‚Äôoh.
---
we've found the guy who's fun at parties
---
Where is the cat lady located? I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve met.
---
I thought the Enclave in Appalachia was wiped out?
---
Xbox my bad.
---
It has no affect at all. I still take the same amount of rad damage. Tested it with a normal set and my Legendary set
---
Okay. If you can, send me a friend request.
---
Amazing, thanks.
---
I didn‚Äôt know this!
---
Start new character and get up to 10. Works with location trophies as well.
---
Oh no cigarettes? You know how many of those I pass up?
---
Two shot explosive weapons after the nerf patch are trash (especially the tse handmade - I'm not actually joking, it is trash - I've tested it myself; even with perks it is still trash) unless you have a good build for it.
---
it could be optional, which would answer most of those objections.
---
I'm on xbox. Sounds like a great name but what if Bruce banner shows up?  I dont want to swing ke like loki XD
---
Jokes aside that name really is nice, I was initially thinking the Drunken Virgin.  Just as little joke since we're in west Virginia but I didnt think this subreddit would be happy with the word virgin in my title
---
I didn‚Äôt know this about the guns!
---
Not counting random legendaries that could drop with different effects, the All Rise Super Sledge is pretty insane
---
Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been to thunder mountain yet.
---
I don't do sentinel because I am way above sentinel. I'm universal, sentinel is specialised, as far as god level team PvP looks in reality, not from the perspective of coop people diving deep into survival, sentinel is a highly specialised build thats 100% depended on position and I prefer roles where you can take over given position instead of being effective at holding it down. I can move. They can't. They need number advantage or terrerain advantage not to be freefrags. There's like &lt;10 people worldwide I seen able to use assassin/sentinel and not be an idiot, rest are freefrags when exposed to seasoned PvPers. I kill those guys by hundreds. My build made four months ago was made for sole purpose of making ass/sent obsolete, and I made two new PvP toons since. Just look for comments of experienced traders who dunno how to git gud - "I have the ass/sent and I still die in one shot WTF".
---
I have all interesting armor sets in this game and I use mashup that most of the community would call random bullshit.
---
I‚Äôve been crafting level appropriate handmade rifles for randoms. People are really appreciative, and it adds another dimension to the game for me.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
I have a boat too!  I keep mine off the coast of Thunder Mountain.  I'm stealing ideas from yours, especially the masts and the rowboat entrance.
---
Do you keep getting infected with parasites everytime you fast travel? That's been my biggest issue.
---
It‚Äôs your favorite game? Really?
---
1 stars are pretty much paper bag feed for me. I get super excited when I get a 3* pool cue or something lightweight. Get stashed for scrip later. 2* are always a weight to value decision. I find non legendary junk to sell to vendors.
---
I like the idea. However can we do something besides ghouls?
---
Let's hope Bethesda reads these things because you are not alone. I really only like playing solo and caps are only good for what I can buy, not something on to themselves (no good having 5K in caps if there's nothing to buy)
---
Ok, you're clearly not bright so I'll attempt to explain again. Cosmetics aren't a necessity. It's only incessantly sawed after by those with no self control or patience. You can casually buy stuff in the Atomic Shop by simply playing the game and earning Atoms for FREE. Those complaining that the items are too expensive and feel like they're being forced into spending real cash aren't playing the game right or simply stink at it. No player benefits in stats from wearing a fuckin Easter Bunny head. If you have such a hard on for this nitpicking argument about cosmetic prices in 76 (which aren't expensive by the way) then why not jump into the ESO, SWTOR, DCUO and every other MMO that sells buffs in their market. This argument is getting lame. You and others clearly practice the religion of Hate 76 and there's no convincing you. I have plenty of criticisms for this game but at least I acknowledge improvement and point out bullshit like this dumb complaint.
---
You‚Äôre not the only one, same issue as well here.. I have tried it a couple of times by picking new flowers, but she keeps ignoring me. So it looks like a bug. Are you playing on PS4 as well?
---
I keep my camp there.  There really isn't a convenient fast travel spot in the Mire in Survival, which makes it a pretty safe spot as well.
---
they've been assholes since NMA was created. Remember, you can't be a fan of fallout unless you hate literally every fallout game that isn't new vegas or the first two games.
---
Cigarette packs and cigarette cartons yes, the plastic on the outside count as plastic, a cigarette on it's own counts as cloth.
---
Personally, my own vision, is that the resident of Vault 76, being‚ÄùAmerica‚Äôs best and brightest‚Äù, would go on to form something like the NCR, like ‚ÄúNew Appalachia‚Äù it something. Their capitol for their small nation would be New Charleston, the rebuilt ruins of Charleston. They would have an army that utilizes ultracite weaponry and power armor as well as vertibirds and those planes (not commercial, the one next to the farm in the old starting screen). They would rebuild Summerville Dam to power New Charleston and explore ultracite as a fuel source. I don‚Äôt know, just my 2 cents.
---
My Nuka Bong and some Radweed.
---
lol this sounds like a victim sign up list üòÇ
---
Wow I feel stupid! Mutations? Serums? Am I playing the same game as you guys?
---
i do something similar, i run excavator with blocker, reactive plates and my .50 cal with vampires and explosive (2 star) i slowly back up to avoid some of her melee hits, and outheal the rest of them
---
I held on to my card until I found just the right server.
---
A bunch of level 200-300s were destroying the SBQ. When it was over I started that event. They all showed up and it was finished in a matter of moments.
---
We couldn‚Äôt find the body but hey, you can‚Äôt win em all!
---
people are savagely capitalistic by nature I suppose.
---
No, those using pacifist mode don't feel like accidentally initiating pvp. Stop going places with junk and dying, put your stuff up regularly.
---
I was just finishing up free range by myself, had just got the cows to the farm, when my game crashed.
---
When I went to look for recent players to quickly hop back in, it was blank.
---
Stopped playing for the night. I was so happy to be able to do that event without any help, keeping all the cows alive, and my game crashed yet again. So frustrating.
---
Nah im looking for ppl to join me.
---
wouldn't help a mere lvl 80 lol
---
Im actually building a second character to be fully auto ü§Ø I would love to have one of those for when it hits the level
---
I'm so sick of this, I can't imagine having the stomach to do something like that essentially for a living. Personally I love I Hate Everything's reviews. He mostly does movies, but the game reviews he really puts work into them to fully explain the good and bad and it's with games he's actually put serious time into. He has like 4-5 videos about Destiny's issues over the years, but he's also put months of real world play time into it since launch. So much better than getting 50+ buzzfeed-quality videos from some dingdong who's played for maybe 7 minutes, if at all
---
Wow.. is Bethesda paying you or something? You attack him for ‚Äúnot being bright‚Äù, but he just has a different opinion than you. Chill out, man.
---
Just do what I do. Down vote the shit posts
---
Instigating is awesome. I have an "Instigating The Dragon" and oh boy. That thing already does 240 damage without the Instigating perk. I actually sold that to someone for 20k
---
I didn't play the beta I don't have the lvl 20 something trophy
---
Oh you are welcome. :)
---
The Fallout Reddit doesn't hate the game, they more so reference 3,New Vegas, and 4. I'm not sure if this post has anything to do with the "Fall of 76" post, but that was posted in both subreddits. Post links to the Fallout circle jerk posts that you've seen instead of using semantics to validate your point.
---
its because on console they can only update so quickly due to allowed updating times. and as for PC they do not want to update it outside of the same times as the other updates. because if they patch something out early, the console players will abuse it relentlessly until it is removed on their end. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
pure speculation
---
 Yes. It is a pain, please fix it.
---
Well yeah I would say that as well üòÇ
---
I have the same problem but didn't play beta except mine is the level 25 trophy
---
I mean you dont have to he open world to be a good game
---
Yeaaaaaah buddy! Fallout 3 was my favorite game, then skyrim, then fallout 4, and now 76. I love bethesda style games. There's stuff to interact with in every room in a really cool world. "Better" games like rdr2 feel empty to me.
---
Oh, as a pure PC player i never knew consoles had that limitation, that atleast could explain why there are no short-planned hotfixes like in other games, thanks :)
---
lol cowards don't enjoy extended combat, this is why they try to headshot you from full scope range distance. lazy pvp is lazy
---
Water is wet.  Sun is hot.
---
That would work better with the bathrobe!
---
True, but I usually enjoy open world games to be much more enjoyable, but that's also my preference and opinion.
---
If anything, that just makes him a *lazy* piece of shit.
---
If they focused on a good solid online pve fallout game and had good micros transactions with decent prices they would be rolling in it.
---
Thank you! üòÑ
---
Weird. Is it possible the first players before the first patch post beta, might have that issue? Thisbis the first time ive heard that problem from someone that didnt play beta first. Hmm.. Tried another character to see if it was a fluke or a glitch?
---
Dont forget the circuits from the telephones in the whitesprings
---
Not rude at all, I will definitely be checking it out! üòä
---
No, I'm not Oxhorn. I just finished spouting a list of complaints. No idea how you came to that conclusion. However it is slightly irritating engaging in the same repetitive, nauseating debate over and over again because of those not reading or intentionally misinterpreting my comments. I'd rather redo my taxes. That said, I apologise for my tone.
---
Never thought about using the ‚Äúrecent player‚Äù as a join option! 
---
Really sucks dude, if you‚Äôre on PS4, send me a dm one day and I‚Äôd love to run some pub events with ya to make up for tired servers.
---
One's a p2w game and one's a game that you've already paid money for (especially for people who paid full price on launch).  
---
Not to mention, it's not like BDO's outfits are assets from their previous titles.
---
Yup all they have to do is add classic vault suit skins and the desert ranger outfit and people would buy it by the dozens
---
There used to be a bug where this would happen very often, check your playstation plus membership? Other than that, I just tried to log in again and again and again until it worked. Usually it would work after I tired off my playstation and then turned it back on (not just restart) and then go into settings and tested my connection. 
---
Other than that, I am out of ideas, sorry this is happening to you
---
Idk what u mean? Im simply starting a group.
---
Actually on further read, OP is right. If someone steals your stuff, you should be able to retrieve it by bounty of the player or being able to kill.
---
Hey, me too. Finally got the balls (and mutations) to do a few non-rad zone SBQ fights without power armor. Sure lost a lot of weight gulping all those stimpacks and radaways!
---
What about a bloodied 3* super sledge 1* for the bloodied part and one for 40% faster swing and another star for -40% while power attacks would that be God tier?
---
You‚Äôre right. If someone gets your loot, they should become flagged for PvP.
---
You're a fucking idiot. First, you can earn better repair kits in game, so as bone headed as it was to put the regular ones in the shop it isn't ptw or anything. Second, neither you nor anyone else here knows what the legendary vendor will do, and spreading false info like this is fucking bullshit.
---
The problem is that the power level between someone who specifically wants to win pvp, and someone who doesn't is so extreme that the latter isn't even worth trying if the former shows up.
---
If the only legendary effects that effected players against each other was assassins, so pvp players had 8% more damage and 40% damage resistance advantage only, then it would be reasonable and possible to casually pvp and not get unilaterally annihilated.
---
Full sentinel explosive rapid unyielding bloodied builds that are nearly invincible without the same god tier weapons they use, and unsurvivable without the same armor they use, make the game so lopsided that it isn't even worth the effort of trying to do pvp.
---
You can stay in pacifist mode. Just do not pick up another players loot or you will be flagged for PvP is what OP is saying. We‚Äôre not talking about the brown drop bags, rather speaking about death drop loot. People notoriously steal flux and masses during SBQ fight and it‚Äôs really annoying that you cannot do anything about it. Think about it.
---
Why would they have to be the richest?or well equipped..I‚Äôm PS4 lvl 169 and play a raider and I don‚Äôt have all god tier equipment and have done just fine as a raider even run a maze base
---
Getting butthurt and calling it a "big deal" because you spent $80 on novelty vodka and it came in a plastic bottle is the epitome of a forest world problem.
---
You deserve gold
---
Deathclaw hordes?
---
This is a radical idea!
---
And if you have scrapper you get like 9 per.
---
I like to think this game is different, and I think a lot of other people do too. I play a good deal of online games, many competitive, and just because the norm is many times to scream at your "garbage team" and look out for number one, it doesn't mean you have to. I try to turn my mic off when I start to tilt, congratulate players that do well, and the like. That's what I love about 76. That's the norm here. Helping others, being considerate. Just because "it's a game" doesn't necessarily mean you forget your table manners and smash everything in sight with no remorse. Doesn't mean you have to play that way, but don't be surprised when other people do.
---
Yup anytime you see me online
---
If you're on PC, you can use a mod to make the meat piles glow... very handy.
---
I can't imagine they'd ban you for you wanting them to fix their mess up. That seems a little ridiculous...
---
Try 20 now days I agree it‚Äôs stupid asf
---
Unfortunately im not lol. PC gets its so much better üò≠
---
Morgantown is better, but they're both good.
---
The challenges are not for us to earn atoms. That is the secondary effect. They are used by Bethesda to test and encourage certain gameplay elements, and for them to earn $$$.
---
As long as you own it, you are eligible for PvP. That‚Äôs been a point of contention in the discussions.
---
Modders can discover the reason something is broken and would be able to fix it in 5 minutes.
---
Meanwhile those same issues take months for Bethesda to fix them.
---
The only difference is that this time, modders cannot fix thousands of bugs for Bethesda, as they did in the past with Unofficial Patches.
---
None of this is exaggeration, by the way. It's par for the course with any Bethesda game.
---
How about the most basic quality of life such as bad naming? And this is just one very small example:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/mfwvySS](https://imgur.com/a/mfwvySS)
---
re: the comment about consoles, yes, that might explain time between patches, but it doesn't explain why it takes so long in general for things to be fixed. They could be fixing far more per patch than they currently are...and if they tested for 5 minutes, 100% of the things that get broken each patch should never be happening in the first place.
---
examples please
---
Bannian is a word, with a meaning, look it up:)
---
its a big deal to investors in an industry where games cost in the hundreds of millions to produce. there was so much controversy surrounding this game. It did not do any favors for Bethesda's reputation.
---
I only ask because I remember when the game first came out and people were demanding refunds that in one of the older threads they stated Bethesda tends to ban people for refunds. Not sure if that‚Äôs apples to apples in this case or apples to oranges...
---
Its one of the top comments here what was left out. Apologies that im too lazy to repeat it.
---
You probably used an emote while holding the camera. That happens every time
---
I think it would be the same for any B/E or AAE weapon, you're looking at way more than 25k, people tend to horde them, and most of them already have close to 25k caps per character on each of their accounts, so they don't even want to sell them for caps. For TSE weapons, and those below, yes you can buy them for caps, but *player trading* is already on various Discords so the new in-game version coming won't change players behaviour it will just allow more players to take part in it.
---
I would like to apologize for feeding the troll and nominate our fellow *Woodcuttering* to be the *Number 1 troll of the day*. He has earned it with *making 3D engine with just C++, a super coder, a super artist* while downvoted to the ground by everyone :)
---
Pretty much. I'm willing to believe that No Man's Sky is now amazing but having paid and played the game at launch, I am never going to touch the game again. 
---
Also hilarious that people are shitting on the video. Regardless of if you had fun, this game was an objective pile of crap at launch.
---
Bloodied alone would not be 20k. Like you could sell it for that sure, if you find someone desperate but a one star is not worth 20k.
---
I understand what theye mean, that's why I prompted them to stash their items frequently. Chances are you're not picking up flux during a SBQ fight, pick it up after. I see the same thing during imposter sheepsquatch, a place known for people dying mind you. And people complain about losing their junk there. Stash EVERYTHING before big events, it should be common sense.
---
I seen it yesterday witch is ridiculous. My friend bought a non Yesterday for 3500 off a vender and sold it for 14.
---
Unreasonable traders are a dime a dozen in this game, weirdly enough. TSE got nerfed so dunno what their deal is.
---
The economy of the game is fd up lol
---
But only the sheepsquatch's spine throw attack, and it must be targeting a grounded scorchbeast that isn't in the picture and is at least 1 meter higher than the sheepsquatch and inside a dust cloud in a rad storm in the forest.
---
Not speculation at all; consoles absolutely require a verification type process before the update is pushed. In the past, there have been a few hotfixes that came to PC before console due to that sole reason but large fixes (like duping, if I remember correctly) where patched at the same time for reasoning you stated.
---
I'm pretty sure this has been mentioned many times over.
---
Yes. I use it regularly.
---
So I bought a random bloodied plasma and ultracite pistol to try it. The plasma apparently doesn‚Äôt have a splitter. Not that I know anyways. The ultracite one if I‚Äôm calculating right. I should be doing 820. Unless it‚Äôs 5 shots. So yea. Ultracite is good

---
1 plastic, 3 steel.
---
It's a dupe but still worth very good money. I'd suggest swapping it for something you really want.
---
God you're a prick. Did someone hurt you at some point.
---
You're an idiot and a philistine, no one can help you.
---
Damn that scares me, I have one left for the platinum and it‚Äôs level 100. I‚Äôm level 94 right now. If that glitches on me I would be heated.
---
I like the Mega Red Rocket, there's lot of empty coolant bottles, along with brooms and enamel buckets, etc.
---
Have a friend or make one that you trust and use them. Either put it in a container or have them hold your stuff.
---
Ouch
---
You transfer items or caps to someone you trust then load in your other character and your friend transfers them back
---
I'm a 152 and I think he was on a secondary character. He was something like 107
---
Between Bolton Greens and Fraternity Row. It's got a Quonset hut and a silo, to help you find it.
---
Or have another system and a second copy of the game
---
What level are you now?
---
That one in the BoS trading post in Watoga that has the plunger always makes laugh cause I'm pretty sure it's a dick joke lol
---
That sounds like an awesome gun
---
Lol no most of my weapons are dupes from the Duping months of winter.  I just got this today in the burrows on a nuke.  I‚Äôm level 174 and have mostly everything I want, and have no need for its PVP attributes.  
---
I got an offer for 10k caps and a sick combat rifle.  I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs it‚Äôs value.  10k caps
---
So I do apologize for my statement. Apparently I didn‚Äôt give it enough of a try or one that compliments my build. I‚Äôll take my statement back on laser and ultracite. I‚Äôm still sketchy about plasmas since they don‚Äôt have a splitter. Now only if you could silence the damn things so you could get stealth bonuses.
---
I play with three other people on a regular basis, we run a shop...each have a minimum of one mule, in my case there are three. We horde everything of interest from Magazines and Dog Food to 3 Star God Roll and Apparel. We sell or trade it, obviously, but have never asked for that amount. Nothing over max caps even makes sense to us. Vendoring is fun, it's socializing and enjoying the realm that is Fallout76, but when it takes all of our mules and multiple transactions to purchase or sell an item...that is asking for trouble. Server instability, player dishonesty...it's ludicrous.
---
If they do, I hope it will somehow be optional! Really like noscope 1tapping critters
---
When does the wood respawn? I got the wood from these spots and its been 2+ days and I cant get the wood from these spots again.
---
Well, 20 atoms is kinda useless for that challenge, but realistically they made that challenge because they were hoping people would play this game for longer than a year.
---
Oh I‚Äôm sure, but repetition can lead to unconscious programming? (Oh, hi Bethesda. You didn‚Äôt see this comment)
---
I've been to Harper's Ferry and New River Gorge, and both places are absolutely worth seeing. I greatly enjoyed the visits.
---
I have fond memories of driving through WV, and camping there.
---
I hopefully in a non irradiated area, so bloodied builds can take part, as most competant Queen raids usually leaves an exposed part!
---
I like it, just think of all the gears and titanium. 
---
Cryptid hordes would be more 76. And would yield end game worthy rewards for end game difficullty
---
Ballistic fiber from moth men and sheepsquatch
---
Acid from snallygasters and grafton monsters
---
crystal from flatwoods
---
screws from wendigos.
---
Cryptid mayhem sounds so awesome, why isn't it in the game already?
---
Thanks!
---
You dont necessarily need another system but yes that is the more practical thing.
---
Not for $15 a pop
---
Would you use it?
---
The character I'm working on is close to 20. My main is close to 90 though. I have plans on my day off to power level my alt.
---
all day
---
Have a friend that lives in the southern portion. He's very evasive about where exactly.
---
STOP LOOKIN' AT ME SWAN
---
Incestuous tentacles, just tentacle-on-tentacle \*barely discernible\* action. It's worse than the tomb with the Ark of the Covenant.
---
Soooo my exploding flamer would go for how much?
---
I ran into a player the other day and told them lets do the camera challenge. We were able to kill 6 birds with one stone. It only took about 30 minutes to finish that challenge.
---
No, but I want the damn camera. Seen the tourist?
---
Lol. What‚Äôs up SupaFly? How‚Äôs the herbivore serum treating you so far?
---
Pretty slick ;) 
---
I didn't know that was you behind that u/ haha.
---
Would totally have bought a copy.
---
i said "pure speculation" because i heard it once, but was partially unsure if it was 100% true
---
Yup, I'm a stealth build as well.  üòé  Works quite well.
---
The problem is the cap limit. I'm personally of the mind that there shouldn't be any such limit. However, as long as the limit is in place then anything more than 25k asking price is just silly. lol
---
At least let us scrap the ammo. Oh, I have no lead to make bullets but I'm carrying 1000+ 10mm ammo. Which I somehow can't remove the lead from. Or .38. So in the end I chuck out bags of that to clear space.
---
Haha! Yep, it‚Äôs the Dog lol
---
Dunno about that. Haven‚Äôt seen it on my recipe list üò≥
---
...and a perfect example of the type of people creating these in-game economy problems.
---
Love it! I'd love to have those on a t shirt, stickers or magnet lol
---
That's a great spot, especially since you can stash it right away.
---
...I never looked into the trash can before, holy moley.
---
Alright.. Join me..GoodieFX
---
He‚Äôs talking about death loot drop.
---
*line of people all named Adam walk out in chains*
---
&gt; Nuka World was designed only with the concept in mind that you'll be a raider.
---
Basically describes my only problem about it. I downloaded a mod to skip the quest to raid Commonwealth settlements the second time around. It was a bad design decision to make it a singular choice.
---
It's best to have a friend hold your stuff, then get on your mule, and they can hand it back. Putting stuff into a container, even with a friend,can be pretty risky.
---
Jusk ask friend and make him build and lock terminal. Hack it, rebuild it, repeat
---
So I have to rat myself out, I checked my perk cards today in game and for some reason I had put back class freak instead of bloody mess. It would help if I actually had that perk activated! So that explains that....:P
---
Yeah it looks like garbage.  Text might as well have been in comic sans for the effort put into it.  When I first saw the datamined assets, I thought that must be placeholder art.  Now that I see it's how it was released, I'll likely be waiting for it to go on sale before buying.
---
It's easy enough to just go find people. I just did it ten minutes ago. I stalked a level 3 in Flatwoods and then went to Whitespring and found someone in power armor. The guy from Whitespring then went back to his camp which happened to be right next to mine so I went back there and got some more. He took some of me, we thumbs up'd and hearted at each other and then I went and killed Swan. It was lovely.
---
Lol. Been my little dirty secret for the last few months. Hahah
---
I don‚Äôt understand why anyone is trading for end game gear. I can appreciate that not everyone has the RL time to grind, but by end game the only thing left to do in is grind.
---
I Typically only get 10-15 now, highest I have gotten was 115
---
Lol yeah reading it back does make it sound a little like a burn
---
I might have to do that... Of course 1400 caps at a time... LOL
---
NOT AT ALL! I am this build and I can still kick ass. Please stop spreading this rumor that they are ‚Äúnerfed‚Äù so badly that no one will want to play. They still are very powerful in game....
---
I hope this is the case, because personally I hate sitting on reddit and discord looking for trades. And the things being a god-roll for me, might not be one for you, so you'll sell it. So i really hope that I'm all wrong. 
---
But in this case, I'm also concerned about the caps tied to what you sell, if it's tied directly to your characters caps.
---
I will try to clarify my self a bit better with an example:
---
You have 10k caps in inventory. The vending machine takes this into account, and you can't sell your items worth more then 15k caps. This will be a problem.
---
Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast just south of Whitespring. It has an image on the map as well.
---
Eh, I despise player trading so that ain't an option for me lmao
---
I'd rather it be in a perk or PA mod form
---
If you're on PS4 hit me up, I'm a solo player and really just wanna get atoms and go back to playing. Murder_ofCrows
---
I play periodically. I have a 2 shot but not explosive. Still available?
---
Xbox, but thanks. I‚Äôm gonna look for the pointing cardboard vault boy, bring some attention to it. If I put up a vending machine I‚Äôll put the water right next to it, too. I‚Äôm tempted to sell water cheap but I don‚Äôt want the little shits making a profit off me.
---
How did whitesprings get nerfed?
---
"Unreasonable" depends on a lot of factors.  Players who play to wheel and deal are unreasonable only to those who play for fun.  To each other, its the way they want to play.  
---
Those who play for fun and give their stuff away are unreasonable to those who think that it's dumb to give stuff away.  To each other, they are helping each other out.
---
As for me, I'd prefer NOT to give anything valuable to some punk who turns around and tries to sell it for a 1000% mark up.  Beyond that, if I have something someone needs and I'm not using it .... its theirs.
---
It's sad to see the game being bashed so hard still despite it being massively improved.
---
The large majority of people will **never, ever** change their views on the game beyond their opinions of the game at launch. As proven by the video everyone's passing around from Internet Historian.
---
North of charlie silo. The next location.
---
135 here (still high, but not that high).  I spent the evening taking over one particular workshop, and hanging around for the defend quest, multiple times.  Sometimes I stuck around longer, sometimes just hopped after that.  I was crouched/hidden near 100% of the time.  No one every attacked, and only one person ever even came into the area (level 203).  He waved and ran through (I waved back, I was hanging out on a cliff nearby).  Maybe I scared him off, but I suspect he was just saying 'I'm just passing through, ignore me'.
---
I generally don't do that though.  But find a quieter server and go way out on the edge (I was at the Red Rocket Mega Stop up in the NE).  You can always just hide and log out if things get hot.
---
And I love it haha
---
The bug here is that there are two legendary effects called "+25 Rad Resist" but one is actually disease resistance. If Bethesda do ever fix it, they'll probably just change the name.
---
I found it cheaper in resources to repair a couple walls and my fusion generator over 6 turrets. Im always getting visitors where im at. I come back to camp and usually its just a couple walls. What happened to the notification when our camp is attacked?
---
It used to have almost guaranteed 3\* legendaries when clearing it (not nuked) now days it only has 2\* maybe a 3\* if your lucky.
---
One spawns right at the entrance to Whitespring, on the hood of the red car right out front.  Just hop there until you find one.
---
I had a guy tell me I was the reason "this game is fucking garbage." He also called me a cheater and duper. All because I contested his public workshop and kicked his ass. I don't let anyone message me except friends. Call me whatever :)
---
So....like a wall?
---
I'd be game to join in, need that flux, hardened mass and high rad fluids for mutation serums. I probably won't get on until 10ish my time (MDT).
---
Same tho
---
Now I wanna build a Nukashire.
---
üòíJesus Christ
---
There's people that want trades for item only, and I get that. There's also people who want like 20k for one gun or one armor piece, that seems crazy to me. 
---
I would also prefer to not give something away then see it with a huge markup the next.
---
And it's gonna be an Epic store exclusive (for a while at least). Total bullshit and I haven't seen significant backlash for it at all. Imagine if Bethesda did that with TES6, people would lose their god damn minds.
---
I thought the same thing on the datamine as well. I had 1500 atoms stacked and thought this was a great deal for what you get. They really need to bring the price down on alot of items. I too, wait for the sales and even then they're still spendy. At least beth is trying... To an extent.
---
The first half is good advice up to invest in charisma and hard begin that is totally not needed until level 50 up until then it's way easy to just survive with what the world gives you.  You never need to buy anything and get enough caps to get what you need.
---
Did you tame them?
---
Well fuck my ass
---
You farm a lot of mothman eggs!  üòé

[Nuke codes 4-29/5-6](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-nuke-codes/)
---
Ghouls is just the default with hordes, personally I would like robots or deathclaws but it needs to make sense.
---
Awesome - that journal was great, good job!
---
Nope static spawns
---
Thank you
---
Glad to help!
---
You know wendigo's would be in any ghoul horde as they are technicly a ghoul in fallouts lore.
---
Oh
---
Yea every update requires a verification review by the console owner. Supposedly there is also a fee associated with it. Because of that game developers will often only release large patches far and few between.
---
Thanks alot for your insight. It's helped me alot. Much thanks!
---
When this happened to me (a handful of times now), I‚Äôve gotten legendary drops 1 out of every 2 or 3 bots. Then server usually craps out/resets/whatever within about 30 mins. Not sure if they‚Äôre correlated for real. When I find a server like this, I try to enjoy the drops and plan to not be on that server super long :)
---
https://nukacrypt.com/home
---
Why pay attention to these challenges at all? The most basic part of the game is to explore and have fun. These challenges are just a distraction. Stay honed to the base experience and never mind.   
---
Unless you want to mine them for points to buy stuff from the store (I don't .. I have 5000+ points)
---
if someone has something rare and in demand though they wont need to drop the price. if your item is the only place someone can get it, then you can charge whatever you want.
---
i honestly dont think a 10% tax will do much to prices of rare weapons. other stuff mabye...but not guns.
---
Moders can also target specific bugs and there is no quality control expected. Bethesda has to work on priorities and there are high qualities expected.
---
I once saw a character that was well over level 200. I have played since this game launched and I am only level 118 and I used to play after I got off work almost everyday. I could only imagine how many hours he must have played to get that level.
---
Out of loop. What happens Tuesday?
---
Could even go as far as needing to unlock different tiers of work bench for each level bracket. Level 1 work bench crafts lvl 1-10 gear and so on. Like where this is going, I hope it gets their attention.
---
I can see that but I like open world but I tend to like the quality of content from linear games more
---
at vault 76 selling some drugs for the news
---
wait, we don't lose caps if we got hunted down in adventure mode? just our junks?
---
You may never need to buy anything early on from vendors, but, it's good to start your equity early for meta and beyond. 
---
These are tips, not mandatory actions, just little things OP might not have heard of. A lot of QoL perks are pushed to the wayside for strict damage output. Which of course is fine but I personally wish I knew about some things before I worked on my final adjustments.
---
Anyone still playing this game is going to be a die-hard defender.
---
They are in defensive mode now, but just sort by the top posts for the past month and its nearly all complaints and requests for fixes/changes. 
---
For example, defenders here are saying the atom shop is no big deal, but the **biggest issue** this past month that this subreddit got *real* angry about was [Bethesda adding non-cosmetic stuff to the atom shop](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9e31i/danger_sign_repair_kits_noncosmetic_item_will_be/) and breaking their promise not to do that.
---
When I sell. I'm going to undercut everyone. Cheap rounds!!! Get your cheap rounds here!!!
---
do you think it will translate to a small 24 player per map economy though? 
---
in wow or eso, there are trading guilds where the price of items can be assessed by the supply and demand of 100s of thousands of people.
---
in fallout its just gonna be the couple people per server competing for prices. and theres no way to effeiciently compare vendors prices.
---
I thought I was just unlucky
---
I‚Äôm curious to know if they‚Äôve ever discussed this as something they are looking into. It feels like necessity at this point between blue screens and server disconnects. Also some kind of schedule on server shutdown periods. Hell, would be nice to just have a big beautiful server list but that would require allowing more players on the map. Who knows what time will bring, until then one can dream.
---
I'm pretty sure it was mentioned in Fallout 3, when the Brotherhood gives you access to the Vault-Tec computer? I'm doing my first playthrough currently so it's fresh in my memory. I'll go check, though!
---
do you think it will translate to a small 24 player per map economy though?
---
Appreciate the FYI, what platform?
---
Cool lvl 100
---
I don‚Äôt know if you could‚Äôve sounded more ignorant if you tried.
---
Dude just wait until Tuesday and put it in your player vending machine, if someone needs it they'll buy it and you get caps, everybody wins
---
It's all probably on the Fallout wiki. [This page](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_76) mentions where 76 was referenced in other games.
---
I'm going to say, on YouTube Oxhorn does a fantastic job. 
---
Wording is different some times buybthats because if how he is trying to present the channel.
---
Thats not really the glitch though. Everyone can do that. Like i said, dont want to get into the details of it so more people dont abuse it. Me and my buddies all reported it to Bethesda, so hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
Every workshop I take, I walk up the outside and leave vault boy cut outs that follow a trail. At the end of the trail is a vault boy pointing at the sacred scriptures I write. By sacred scripture, I mean "pee pee." 
---
Gets them every time
---
It's rarer in other fallout games it's all i can think of
---
Awesome tyvm
---
It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúperfect example‚Äù of anything. 
---
8k is easy to get for me. 
---
That gun is hard to get for me. 
---
That‚Äôs economics 101. 
---
Do you want me to lowball him and offer 2k? Or less? Being real I‚Äôm lowballing the fuck out of him at 8k, that gun is worth far more. 
---
Or should we not trade at all (which we‚Äôre supposed to do) and just ‚Äúplay the game‚Äù? I am playing the game. 
---
That‚Äôs it. Caps are easy to come by. If cap sinks like the Sheepsquatch were more available, sure I‚Äôd think twice about blowing my bank. But  there‚Äôs not other cap sinks, and I‚Äôm not blowing my bank. 
---
And I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong with the most desirable guns in the game going for max caps. They‚Äôre *very* rare. 
---
Legacy weapons go for more than max/trade only because they will only get *more* rare as they can‚Äôt drop and people who own them my stop playing.
---
Why does patching even the smallest thing take so long?
---
b/c Todd's a lunatic environmentalist and thought it was great idea to have only 1 cummunity toilet for 250+ devs to save on water. The line is really really long...
---
Or I can give it to someone for free

You should use it to shoot at bad guys.

I apologized for the inconveniance of wrecking him and taking his shop for no reason. you seem to be having an extremely emotional reaction maybe you should calm down.
---
For me it was endless hours of coop Halo, but yeah playing with your partner is awesome.
---
That's...your problem. Grind up some more levels.
---
No problem. The upside to them is that they shoot like a rifle. So you can achieve the freeze effect at great distances. Although, I recommend not shooting the SBQ while in the air. Unless you don‚Äôt want her to land. It seems to bug her out a bit.  Sorry if I hijacked you post earlier. Happy hunting!
---
It's amazing the lack of self awareness. He just had his account  temporarily suspended the other day for the amount of shit he was flinging and now he comes back and acts like he's the moral high ground here
---
Yeah, I see what you mean, devs can focus a lot more detail in linear games, while open world games tend to have more repetitiveness, an example being radiant quests. For me I just like the freedom of open world games, where I can mostly ignore a main story, run in a random direction, and decide who I am.
---
I love this post
---
I can mod your armor. Do you have the materials?
---
Charleston Herald, 3rd floor in the office. It'll spawn a buncha different plans. Server hop till it appears.

not sure what are they again?

Every perk card you've spent a point on, has raised the associated SPECIAL stat.
---
Xbox as soon as I can make the sound system cooperate
---
 I'm on XB1 but thank you for the offer! Kinda made my day sour bc I have to go to work now lol
---
You can already change your Bethesda username, we are talking about character names here.
---
I‚Äôve heard of this before, but I‚Äôve never seen Plans there period. Is it supposed to be in the editors office, or am I missing something?
---
Thanks! Now I know I havent fucked up
---
A weekend  wasted is never wasted weekend. Enjoy your wasted wastelanding!
---
How do you find 2*? 90% of the ghouls I find nowadays don't have even a single star. It's nice that they don't regen health, but the loot is pretty much guaranteed to not even be worth batting an eye at
---
17 adhesive, 17 aluminum, 17 fiberglass, and 5 pure violet flux are required for each leg.
---
Looks cool. Better than mine. My wife makes fun of mine all the time. Lol
---
You increase one of your special attributes every time you level up, until level 50, perk cards use those points in their respective attributes. If you rank a card up to let's say from a 2 to a 3, it will use 3 points of the total that you have put in that attribute. I'm sure by now you know that you create higher level cards by getting dupes and combining them. After level 50 you can choose to make a point go into a different attribute from another attribute or gather one card to use/combine. 
---
Does this answer your question
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
pure violet flux are required to make calibrated shocks?
---
let me see if i have any i know i have the rest.
---
I don‚Äôt trade... to easy to get scammed. I take screenshots of my items, upload to imgur and then sell it to highest offers. It‚Äôs so easy. Doing it every couple of weeks takes very little time.
---
Or outfits that were already in the game or files from Fo4 which don‚Äôt even look good like the postman outfit or the tuxedo set are boring
---
How do you get 10000?
---
thats why i think we should be able to take selfies with the camera and have it count for those challenges
---
My one and only God roll. I wasn't geared for the heavy guns build then but letting go of the handmade was easy when I saw the heals.
---
The part that is ‚Äúconnected to the foundation‚Äù is floating in the air
---
It's just circle jerking at the other side of the spectrum, lol
---
Except for them explosive energy weapons :( 
---
I didn‚Äôt know they even existed till last week lol
---
What about Ground Pounder, that doesn't work with auto heavy guns?
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
Nah it's cool ty man
---
Awesome! But I might have misunderstood. Are you on XB1?
---
Wait, Todd said he put his best men on this
---
Does Wallace give more money?
---
I have been recently told its not possible but I wan't them to be wrong.
---
The ad is totally us. Me, a third shift manager, a pastor's cousin and devout Christian, a heavy metal goth, a married couple in their 30s, a grandmother, two brothers who are little kids but chill af, an entire band (three dudes who randomly play instruments in our party), the drag queen who's also chill af, one person who's going for her Masters and works for the government writing death certificates, some people from the deep South and some from the inner cities, at least one Englishman and one Scotsman, and of course there's the sprinkling of nerdy gamer types you'd typically find playing.
---
Also I wouldn't mind having that Sound of Music dress complete with bandoliers in game...
---
This community seems very different since release. I played for around 3 or 4 months upon release.. at that time 2SE were the best and they'd go for quite a few caps. But it was like 6-10k for the 2SE handmades.  Max caps on your person was only 25k I believe
---
Yeah, I've tried to play it but it took me 7+ hours to find a match then the first time I fast traveled once it had started I ended up on an infinite loading screen.
---
There's no point putting that much time into something if the games just gonna shit itself.
---
Yep. This is exactly where I got the Laser plan.
---
Congrats. Just found my bloodied Grognak Axe the other day too, level 135. üëç
---
Yes, but they don't spawn in ghoul areas by default, they need their own spawnpoints/rules.
---
If the burrows had random wendigos it might actually be interesting, but they aren't there.
---
It's a shame because without ghouls wendigos are so much weaker, and without wendigos ghouls are complete trash.
---
don't have any violet flux :(
---
i don't even know how to get any.
---
I‚Äôve had kinda crappy luck everywhere recently lol. That said I‚Äôm level 125 and I can‚Äôt move for gear I want to keep but don‚Äôt have room for. Honestly there are only a couple of things I don‚Äôt have yet so I can‚Äôt complain really.
---
My problem exactly right now it seems to be 90% of the legendaries that spawn are 1 or no star and the ones that do spawn give me 1 star items.
---
I have it. It's an item that you craft from several different things that you find in nuked areas.
---
You and everyone else keep saying the same thing that was said within the first week of the game's release, that it was unbuggy and unfinished, we know, you dont have to keep repeating what others have said half a year ago
---
Along with what FrazzleBong mentioned, I always pick up every weapon from the enemies I kill and sell those. 
---
I also have the maxed out PharmaFarma perk and sell all the chems I find except stims and Radaway
---
I‚Äôm stealing this.

Wow. It's almost like survival is meant for PVP. Poor things. üôÑ
---
Idea: make two separate sets of challenges between adventure and survival. Decrease total amount of challenges for atom shop balance

i can pay you/trade items to compensate you for the help.
---
True that!
---
Shame I'm on PC and need help as well.
---
Best of luck on finding someone soon !
---
 "*Colonel Gutsy voice*  ... IS THERE SOMEONE WHO NEEDS ME TO SQUEEZE THEIR ASS?!"
---
Sheepsquatch assualtron is there for specifically this.
---
It bothers me so much when I pick up all the golf balls and can't pick up the damn baskets they come in. If a golf ball is 1 plastic, those fuckers should be like 50.
---
\+Reckless == Martyr's
---
Sounds good. Do you already have the armor?
---
all flowers within nuke zone become raw flux of the related flower, Purple flowers Raw Violet Flux for example (u need 10x raw flux to make 1 pure flux)
---
any enemy killed within the nuke zone has a chance to drop: Glowing Mass, Harden Mass or High Radiation Fluid (1 of each to make 1 pure flux)
---
all flowers within nuke zone become raw flux of the related flower, Purple flowers become Raw Violet Flux for example (u need 10x of the same raw flux to make 1 pure flux)
---
You too!
---
I just found out after coming back to the game that two shot and explosive got nerfed hard. What is the best build now? I've built my character around my two shot Gatling gun. I just got an explosive 50. Cal. Does melee do more dmg? Like an instigating hammer?
---
yup just need the shocks mod so i can get the extra 50 carry weight, ive allready got one on the right leg.
---
Think that‚Äôs probably better than what I got. level 125 and I got a bloodied crossbow earlier lol.
---
Oh, absolutely. I was more thinking about the damned super mutant standing more than 10ft away.
---
Found it. You both are life savers, take my upvotes
---
Yeah it‚Äôs kinda annoying. Like why can‚Äôt I raider cosplay and take a selfie with Rose?? I get they want people to play together but some days I just want to go solo and get away from others lol.
---
No, I do it too.
---
Its the only way I have to get rid of them, as I don't use a mic, and switching to some marketplace outside the game to find people to sell to... irritates me.
---
We can do that. Are you on now?
---
No sadly, pc
---
 No, he's just a friend. When I used to farm for plans and stuff he became my favorite bot vendor.
---
 As I get my own stuff, a few grand is plenty for walking around money and unless I get spendy, that kinda maintains itself. ;)
---
Keep plugging away. Me and my wife spawned into nuked Whitesprings and she also got a 2 shot lever action. It does get frustrating lol.
---
Yeah, I don't remember getting the rewards for the quest. Maybe I just didnt notice.
---
Wait...  I thought this was the main fallout sub for all things 76 üòâ
---
yup at my camp near white springs, just join on me and were good to go.
---
I have 2 consoles, and a digital version...
---
Thanks. I am liking the Axe lol. Congrats to you too.
---
Haha you are aware of mutations right? Well the Enclave sells random mutations for VERY high prices. But plans for the serums used to drop off the SBQ, so quite a few players can craft serums now too. And usually you can get them for anywhere from supplying the mats (nice people) up to ~500caps for a premade serum
---
Uhg, all the other PC players are party pooping squares. I feel so lonely on PC.
---
Yeah for the horde mode to work windigo's would have to be in some waves with the ghouls. The simpler ghouls just being fodder so the windigo's can get up close and feast.
---
Nice! I got my first set of marine armor from him :) 
---
He seems to always have some solid stuff
---
I bought it twice aswell. 1 is a main 2nd is a mule for legendaries. It's ok. Praise Atom.
---
50s era alcoholism has always been rampant in the fallout universe. It fits.
---
I am
---
I feel your pain. I‚Äôm level 147, and I‚Äôve got so many legendaries I‚Äôve cleared my stash of everything else while waiting for the new vendor. I have never once had a TSE drop.
---
Have you been to literally any vendor ever? There are always other legendaries available.
---
RNG is RNG. Remember, you can miss that 95% chance to hit in X-com 10 times in a row if the game hates you, or you can hit that 5% chance everytime if the game loves you.
---
Heavy Guns version is Lock and Load - different perk.  Although I wouldn't run with either - using up so many perk points for just reload is pretty bad gains.
---
I hate these photo dailies.
---
Look all I was saying is that it‚Äôs a little odd that you felt the need to type an apology for something so minor I don‚Äôt really care and I‚Äôm not having some sort of emotional reaction I made a simple statement that 76 players are over sensitive you and the other guy just spiraled it into something bigger and trust me I am perfectly calm
---
I got a level 35 tse .44 from uranium fever at about 120. Only tse I've seen in game.
---
I read an article on here earlier that an atom purchase was made through the Microsoft store and the website was acting a bit cagey. He did state that the purchase went through.
---
do i need to invite you or...
---
Gotcha - this is helpful üëçüèΩ
---
I‚Äôd like to get some nice skins for it too, say reddish camo for my explosive gat and silver for vampire‚Äôs. It‚Äôs probably gonna take years for them to develop those so I‚Äôm not holding my breath.
---
I remember when two turrets took the entire budget on their own... Those were the days
---
If your a huge fallout fan then why didn't you pre order and play from day one like a true huge fallout fans have done?
---
You're missing quite a few quests :)
---
Just sent a team invite.
---
PC was broken at the time and only recently acquired a console, so had nothing to play it on.
---
Also, I tend not to preorder games because of cases like this, where the game is broken on release.
---
*cough* *cough* repair kits *cough* *cough*
---
As someone who just sold a weapon for 40k caps and a bunch of ammo earlier today, I'm not really complaining LOL. I wasn't expecting that amount, but I took it up when they offered so I could buy those serum plans I've been wanting... At the same time, I would never personally pay that much for a weapon myself, so I'm not normally in favor of inflated prices like that.
---
I feel you (our) pain.  Some TS and 1 Explosive, never together.
---
It‚Äôs fantastic. I love it. I‚Äôm into it even more than f4 and I didn‚Äôt expect that
---
the r/fallout sub has always been unstable. Like seriously before this it was downvoting anyone who mentioned a flaw in any game, now it is trashing on the current one. It is just a fact of that sub.
---
Just saying that a true huge fan as you put it would pre order and play regardless of any issues. It shouldn't matter how everyone else views the game, if your a huge fan you would play regardless of what other people think
---
I buy your light and cheap 1-3 stars from vendors.
---
Pssst what system are you on?
---
level 182 over 700 hours play time never seen one.... got a ghoul slaying gama gun once. how does that work, right on the floor thats how.
---
Just a heads up. I payed just 200 to get this done on one leg.
---
I'm Lv. 190.  I've never seen one drop.
---
*A concern troll is a false flag pseudonym created by a user whose actual point of view is opposed to the one that the troll claims to hold. The concern troll posts in web forums devoted to its declared point of view and attempts to sway the group's actions or opinions while claiming to share their goals, but with professed "concerns". The goal is to sow fear, uncertainty, and doubt within the group often by appealing to outrage culture. This is a particular case of sockpuppeting and safe-baiting.(wikipedia)*
---
In other words, you want to know if the game *worth* your money, but instead, you post contradictory replies with deception when someone gives you their opinion. It is clear that you are a troll.
---
Just go to other games if you got banned for cheating or rage quit because you suck at games. It will do good to your mental health.
---
I am truly sorry for feeding the troll again :)
---
Biv that you?
---
&gt;They stealth nerfed fusion core drain rate, weapon damage and legendary enemies spawning to encourage people to use the atomic store
---
As yes, the cosmetic store front which has absolutely no impact on any of what you just mentioned, I can sure see this lads done his research thoroughly.
---
I‚Äôve done the overseer quests to find her holotapes, including the final personal quest with her fianc√©. Top of the world was what came after I finished the Physical exam for the Burny fire people
---
You can also raise a stat and pick a perk from a different special. After you choose your stat you can switch card categories and pick whatever card you want(lvl gated still)
---
I spawned under your camp and the game world. I fell underneath the map and tried to exit the server before I died and lost all my junk. Rejoining your server now.
---
Pops?
---
Yeah the charge went through but not the atoms unfortunately :/
---
What a massive 1 poison damage? Does it have a mechanic I'm in aware of?
---
I payed full price as soon as it went on sale and with well over 700 hour in to the game I would do it again in a heartbeat.
---
Don‚Äôt be a cunt
---
At first I didn‚Äôt like it, now I‚Äôve literally put hours of my life into it, it‚Äôs pretty freaking good now
---
It's not in the house but down on the dirt road in front of it - overseers case is on a wood table
---
fair enough mate.
---
he was level 60 with patchwork power armor and had the place defended with a bunch of level 1 turrets. so he gave me the impression of being pretty new still. It was pretty much seal clubbing I am level 200 plus with a really good gun and my friend rolled up after the first death or 2 and he is level 200 plus as well. (and he is a for real and legit beast at pvp) I love pvp in other games but I take no joy or pride in a one sided fight win or lose, I feel that pvp in 76 is broken and do not like it overall. but I need my workshops for fusion cores so I have to deal with getting my pve butt kicked from time to time but its all good. yeah I felt like I owed jacklumber an apology dude was just trying to farm some cores and not bothering nobody.
---
Misc.   Only in camp. Not workshops
---
yah i saw that idk wtf happened there, i changed the floor into concreat so hopefully it doesn't happen again.
---
I've found 2 TS and that's it. No E though.  Neither were very good weapons so I got rid of them
---
btw whats your gamertag?
---
It was. It would take down scorched beasts hella fast. Terrible accuracy. The "gun sight" was useless.  Im sad to have sold it. But it was heavy
---
Untrue - lvl 225
---
Selling more copies doesnt make something better. Being more friendly to casual players isnt a bad thing, but it also cheapens the experience for people who like it the way it was. Fo4 added a lot, but it removed a lot, and if you were there for rpg storytelling and character building, your experience was worse, but if you were there for a shoot and loot action game, it did much better for you.
---
It should be on a 24 hour or less timer.
---
Another issue could be your playtime? There's a theory that if you haven't played for x number of hours, certain things don't reset.
---
are you ClearestHarpy2
---
Some people want to know, i have been hoping bethesda will change or add enough features that fo76 will become a game i want to play. I want that information, those videos help me
---
I've gotten one legit tse drop and it was a western revolver. had like four explosive variations but they were either low lvl or trash
---
To be fair some people are more likely to be targeted by bot accounts as well, and in cases such as those I can see why they would have messaging disabled. as easy as it is to ignore or delete spam messages I‚Äôve personally seen and heard of people getting 6+ spam messages per day and at that point it‚Äôs ridiculous and just plain annoying.
---
Are you fallout famous though?
---
There are quests that you 'stumble' upon and there are locations that you have heard of that you need to search out to continue the story. I don't want to spoil it for you.
---
800 hours I like it - yes it has "character" and sometimes I have urges to fling pc out window. overall I still play the heck out of it. if you roam around in fallout 4 after you've defeated the main arc and just exist in that world making your own missions, you will like 76. I can say i prefer it to fallout 4 as another poster said as well. seeing people is neat. sometimes annoying sometimes funny etc but neat over all.
---
Stop using legendaries?
---
I might have spare artillery plans, ill check tomorrow
---
Yes, the game is a lot of fun.
---
I‚Äôm gonna pour one out for you!
---
PC you ??
---
Unsubbed from it months ago friend.  Life's too short to deal with unnecessary bullshit.
---
What sort of things have the updates done?
---
Xbox- you should include that in your post to get you more help faster :)
---
Shout out to heraindrop something for letting me perch up in your house after I shot my own feet off and then went and peed in the backyard.
---
You are lying but okey hahaha
---
Roaming around is probably my favourite thing to do in fallout so that‚Äôs good to hear.
---
That was me. I set the price to cover the cost of the flux. Nice doing business with you.
---
It‚Äôs almost certainly rising demand and falling supply. The duping stopped and there‚Äôs inevitably players who still have tons of godly weapons but moved on to other games so they‚Äôre not on the market.
---
Heck I‚Äôve been trying to get a legacy salvaged Assaultron Head. You know, one of the shittiest weapons there is, but it‚Äôs basically priceless. So imagine what a decent explosive laser weapon is going for.
---
It‚Äôs basically trade legacy for legacy these days, which most people dont have an expendable supply of. Or anything half decent is trade only. It‚Äôs real bad right now
---
Launched 6 nukes on the queen the past two days with my brother, 6 slays and Zero problems
---
Only use a flare gun, paddle ball, and the commie wacker
---
It'd be better for something like berry mentants
---
Use a friend you trust. I try to compensate my friends because I have two mains and three mules. It can get agonizing to get stuff to the right guys.
---
Do what one guy did and play without a pipe boy
---
I made a post asking bethesda for a ghoulnado, if you could throw some support that way we could have a giant randomly generated radioactive tornado flinging radiated ghould at us around the map.
---
PS4?
---
4 star legendary effects exist, but are un implemented. Most of the legendary effects from 4 that you don't see in 76 exist as 4 star drops so that they don't spawn while still being there to put on special reward guns like perfect storm, bunker buster, and all rise.
---
The 5th star is for legendary mods, like the sacrificial blade for machetes.
---
It's even better when Can-Do! is active!!! Dog food for Life!!! ;)
---
Head to the room on the left at the end of the hall, on the terminal in the room, select the entry "Touchdown Recovery".
---
I don't think anyone mentioned Cooking Oil yet. Most kitchens have a bottle.
---
PSN: DrugsKeepMeGoing, If you ever need a helping hand in any daily‚Äôs hit me up, I‚Äôm online daily and if I‚Äôm playing a different game don‚Äôt be afraid to message me as I don‚Äôt mind hoping on Fallout to help people out 
---
Goes for whoever sees this, not just Baker
---
I would take them but i am at work&gt; I use a gatling laser and one queen fight uses about 20 of them. if no one takes them by moreing id be glad to get them.
---
If your talking about your queen fight weapon, prime it up. If your talking about your every day gun, its not worth it.
---
oh i am on pc are you pc ?
---
Well yeah, the gunners sight is a mod, it just is in the wrong spot on your screen when its used
---
Lol for a second it looked like you dropped your balls, then I realized it was a rock.
---
Note, cavalier, sentinel and others only appear as the name of armor when specific other legendary effects get overridden.
---
In 2joy's cas that piece would normally be assassin's as that is the first star, but the second star of cavalier overrides assassin and so gives it a different name.
---
I‚Äôm level 56 and I‚Äôve never had more than about 1000 caps at one time
---
I don‚Äôt actively PvP, only when someone contests one of my workshops. I‚Äôm completely built for PvE but have one trick up my sleeve... target computer two shot quad barrel missile launcher.
---
Except for one guy who was clearly a survival reject (geared for PvP but prob couldn‚Äôt hack it against the big dogs) it works amazingly well. It‚Äôs unavoidable once you lock on and can be spammed quite quickly. 
---
Sure if someone has dense + fireproof I‚Äôm out of luck, but so far only that one guy posed a problem.
---
I‚Äôm rambling but overall I agree with you. Not all of us want to PvP so the challenges are annoying
---
&gt;Over 30
---
Wow... I have over 140 on me, hahah
---
Out of curiosity, why do people keep calling them legacy? You know that explosive energy weapons are coming back once they are reworked, right? And the ones we have now will most likely be changed to whatever the reworked versions are. The patch notes from whatever it was, patch 5 or patch 6, made it very clear that the removal is temporary
---
Xbox sadly
---
One single TSE drop in 129 levels for me.  A 10mm **.  It‚Äôs my fun-in-the-forest gun.
---
Level 80 something here, last weekend I got a Bloodied Explosive VATS AP cost railway rifle and sold it for a TSE gatling plasma, an AA 50 cal, and an AA i think fire rate handmade. I got insanely lucky, so I'm hopeful for you to do the same.
---
Not op but my Psn is DrugsKeepMeGoing, If you ever need a helping hand in any daily‚Äôs add me, I‚Äôm online daily and if I‚Äôm playing a different game don‚Äôt be afraid to message me as I don‚Äôt mind hoping on Fallout to help people out
---
Those have been in the game since release. I wouldn‚Äôt hold your breath though I hope we can eventually
---
They could impose a limit on trade based on the level and the stats, especially if its legendary.
---
In my 600+ hours in-game, I've never gotten a TSE, but I did get a AAE 50.cal, although I've never even used it.
---
I'm not asking if the game is worth my money, I asked if the game had an end of life plan. 
---
Which of my posts have been contradictory? You're the one trolling here. Why don't you crawl back undrt whatever bridge you came from.
---
&gt; Selling more copies doesnt make something better
---
But it DOES mean that there are a ton of people that might‚Äôve greatly enjoyed it.
---
If nobody has taken it I got a level 50 (or a level 60) that could use it. But I would also like to remind you that I think the legendary vending machines will be out Tuesday so you can break it down. If you want I'll trade you a weightless so it won't take up much space.
---
Hey I've pretty much stopped playing since I'm waiting for private servers to come out so I have a tse railgun you can have. Pm me and we can work it out but I'm currently on vacation so it might take some scheduling
---
That‚Äôs just luck. Even if it‚Äôs only 1 in 7 nuke fights that cause connection issues, that‚Äôs too much.
---
&gt; For the love of fucking ODIN
---
Haha love that
---
Would be nice, I keep music playing and have to turn it down every time I go to talk
---
I know that spot! That was the exact same spot I had my camp for the fasnacht festival and the first few weeks of the Nukashine quest.
---
Do you get random(rare) attacks by scorched and super mutants?
---
Would love to see more images of your camp, looks inviting
---
hes a friend so just say "hey ya arent using it give it back to me so i can" unless he is and just doesnt do that stuff then well yeah prolly have to get a 3rd lol
---
It was a Triple A release, which means it got more publicity than the previous games, New Vegas is probably one of my favorite games, I think Fallout 4 and 3 are alright, they aren't terrible games but New Vegas just has a special place in my heart.
---
ok thanks
---
both yall need to stop givin these people ideas.. seriously.
---
I appreciate the advice, but I'm good on  legendaries to break down atm. It's just a decent and relatively unique gun that could really help out a lower level player that I want someone to enjoy.
---
I haven‚Äôt even bought the game yet, but I keep it on my radar. That‚Äôs why I stay subscribed here: To keep a thumb on the pulse of the game, get a sense of how (and if) it‚Äôs improving, and lookin‚Äô for when I‚Äôll feel it‚Äôs a good time to buy.
---
On the normal Fallout subs, forget it. No way can I expect some simple clear-cut info about how the game‚Äôs coming along from those. I‚Äôd have to sift through so much vitriol and hyperbole it couldn‚Äôt possibly be worth it.
---
I pre ordered, played the betas, had some fun when it released and spent around 250 on my edition, since then I have played about 100-150 hrs and feel meh about it.  It didn't really engage as well for me as the past games. To each their own.
---
same here üòÅ
---
I'm lvl 123. Got a legit TSE at Pleasant Valley last week, super mutant dropped Assault Rifle TSE faster reload. First ever 3* in 300+ hours of play.
---
Laughing, maybe like the puking one but it's laughing instead. There's been plenty of times something happens or a player does something and you can't express laughing, it's a bit hard using the thumbs up or heart to show others something was laughable..
---
Elaborate please
---
I just  decided to ignore these challenges, they are so over the top and require specific shit that as a solo player i wont get. Deciding to throw away a feature when im only level 70 is bad design (of the challenges).
---
I usually just chuck em but I figured it was wasteful
---
Well I had a Tse flamer. Someone offered me something that was to good to be true and I accepted it. It's pretty much my fault for being dumb
---
I'm soooooo glad I'm not the only one to think this. At least 5-10 plastic.
---
r/fo76filthycasuals is a great place if you ever need help. Especially the discord. I know you said you are solo player but there's no obligation they just love to help!
---
PC unfortunately
---
Damn thanks anyway. Have a good night.
---
Yep Angel_Reaver is my tag
---
Oh, I thought you were talking about joshua graham. I would love a .45 and a sweet outfit in this game, but I guess a festival would work too
---
I'm at 189...the only TSE I ever found was a level 35 TSE dragon at level 153. Just 13 more to go and you should find one by this logic
---
You‚Äôre right, but they‚Äôre legacy by definition since they‚Äôre limited to whatever is currently in circulation. 
---
 
---
Bethesda hasn‚Äôt mentioned that change again since they first took them out of the loot pool, so I‚Äôm not holding my breath for a re-work anytime soon.
---
That said, I hope I‚Äôm wrong and it‚Äôs sooner that I think.. but even if they re-work them, there‚Äôs a chance explosive energy weapons as we know them today will remain legacy. Unless they retroactively change them. Which is certainly possible. Guess we‚Äôll see in time
---
I am Norse God-level pissed. It's just so stupid, un-intuitive, and easy to solve. Yet, it hasn't been touched since BETA.
---
COPE
---
Suspect most are duped. I have one, have seen two total. One was from a trade, and I traded it right back away.
---
I have several other explosives ... have a troubleshooter / explosive, (.44),  AAE (x2) and VampE (10mm), Vamp E (flamer) and Stalkers/E (harpoon). That might be all the explosives I have. 
---
Oh wait I have a few others - rifles - but I‚Äô don‚Äôt have a rifle character I‚Äôm using. I think I have a something explosive handmade and a something explosives either combat or assault rifle. Forget what.
---
I mean you can buy one
---
Thanks! I enjoyed it greatly.
---
Looks nice, post a walk through on the settlement page, I‚Äôd do mine but I‚Äôm banned from posting.
---
West Tek is still good. I sometimes hit the Burrows. 
---
Events are still the best spot, w/ the new cow event, AWOL armaments being the best I think still.
---
Haha. I liked this. &amp; Yeah we can be a bit intimidating but see it all ended up well. Sry if we ruffled ya a bit after that first incident.
---
Making friends is easy, just... Send.... NuDEs!!!
---
There was apparently some issue awhile back where people could send you a PSN message that would lock your console, because it created an error or whatever. So a lot of people blocked all messages, and many have probably just left it like that. I don‚Äôt hold it against them. It‚Äôs their loss that they don‚Äôt get to see the rare vendor I spawned anyway.
---
Waaaaa YouTuber making fun of the video game I like waaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Ignoring the fact that the production is comedic in nature.
---
The game, and by extension Bethesda deserves every bit of it.
---
Everyone should know, and be reminded of how poorly this game was launched, the lack of respect Bethesda showed their playerbase and the gaming community as a whole with the quality they delivered.
---
Battlefield 4, Destiny and Division all had to work fucking *hard* to crawl out of the mess their launches provided their fans. And came out on top for it.
---
Fallout 76 is only just leveling out. It is still below par in many respects.
---
It certainly is annoying, as it's a random occerance aswell (well for me anyway). I do notice though that you get about 10-15 seconds of radiation free time. So if it spawns you at fissure prime for example you can sprint out of zone. Not much help though if over weight or no spawn locations available at all.
---
I'll provide an offering to Odin for you in the hope it gets fixed :p
---
The Whitespring is a fantastic place to look.
---
Golf clubs, balls, pool cues, pool balls, shopping baskets, plastic cutlery, stacks of cups, cups with straws, plastic plates ... so much plastic.
---
How did you do the trade?  Good way it to sell the item to them for a cap value of it's worth. Then buy the item you want in trade for the same value. That way if some one scams you at least have the caps to buy it from someone else
---
So, with a Vampire's 50 cal, you can actually pull off a Nerd Rage/Adrenal Reaction build quite beautifully by irradiating yourself down to 20% hp and just completely annihilate anything and everything in the game. Give it a shot, it's crazy. 
---
Have fun with that saucy minx of a gun!
---
Explosive breaks fast.
---
Yes please! Ibwant to buy more stuff...but it is pointless when I am maxed.
---
And so it begins‚Ä¶ really goes to show you nothing is enough for this community. Budget is expanded but NO!!! WE NEED MOOOOOORE
---
I did do that.
---
My main is 360 ish and my alt is 176. I‚Äôve had 3 TSE‚Äôs drop and exactly none of them went with either build.
---
Until they do add it use the Chat and SFE mod. People call out events, Free range, SBQ, and friendly chat.

Level 293, got my first from uranium fever at about lvl 110 (TSE ** Combag shotgun lvl 40) and my second yesterday (TSE Reduced weight 10mmSMG from the queen), but i do a LOT of legendary farming so its a bit more likely, still no BE, AAE or FE though, the ones i actually want :p
---
Hhmmm....well I'd say you're safe. And if they were to ban you, and you never got the atoms you paid for, that seems lawsuit worthy to me. Lol
---
I feel the background behind the mothman and mirelurk is way too black, given they are also mostly black, and giving it a slight blue color like a night sky would make them pop out more without taking away from their highlights.
---
I definitely get what you mean. Bethesda-style games are some of my favorites too. And I love fo76 as well despite all its flaws, moreso than other AAA title games like rdr2. Rdr2 is amazing in its own right of course, but Bethesda-type games feel a lot fuller and intricate due to the sheer amount of stuff to do, find, collect, interact with... Even when you've achieved endgame goals, it feels like there's still more stuff to do and goals to achieve. And Bethesda throwing in an occasional new quest/event and new items every week or so keeps me invested too, because I *gotta have it all*.
---
NV also had the habit of corrupting saves on console until first or second DLC patched it out.  Folks tend to forget that the earlier FPS fallouts had pretty significant release issues.
---
The fact that a game so broken had a cash shop is one thing.
---
The fact that it now, after explicit promises to the contrary, features gameplay affecting items only proves their point.
---
Has anyone caught a ban for using the text chat mod alone as far as anyone knows?
---
I kinda assume it would be a big enough deal if people where getting banned for it that it would be all over here but you never know.
---
They fixed a boat load of things, added more quests/ items to the game, evened things out, and this Tuesday are adding player camp vending(running shops) and a new legendary vender, have 3 road update maps out that go all the way into next year, and have added new locations to the map with many more update to come out
---
i will add, it's not just the legend themself, Sinseer, it's the crew. if you transgress Sinseer, you are opening up a world full of powerful adversaries. but, if you have true remorse, and you try to make amends, you're good with us. we're good.
---
we welcome any who would come, Take What You Need, Leave What You Don't. the total caps value of what i have dropped on "the roof" is beyond your comprehension. but, it didn't fit with my build. i know it will fit with \_someone's\_ build. so we drop what we don't need. and take what we do. and sometimes take something, try it out, repair it when we're done, and re-drop. enjoy. 
---
Take What You Need, Leave What You Don't. it's simple.
---
What do you mean? I'm honestly unsure how the mechanics work, but I've heard poison on something like a syringer can be useful in early game (only until enemies get to like level 20). Buff the poison damage on things like sheepsquatch shard, syringer, etc., and however it works now, poison to me means DOT. Give poison weapons similar total damage to other weapons with similar ROF, but maybe like 2/3 ballistic and 1/3 poison, or 50/50 idk. And maybe let it stack but with a cap like the furious effect (introduce a furious poison build?). Enemies like SBQ seem to have no poison resistance and neither do a lot of players. That makes poisoner's armor relevant or forces people to use stimpaks to counter the DOT, and it introduces new strategies into the endgame meta instead of just explosive and bloodied builds against SBQ.
---
The mielurk one is so good I thought it was a picture at first(I‚Äôm on mobile to maybe that‚Äôs why). Anywhoo love the drawings
---
Hmm ok thanks
---
I feel like no matter what game I have, the background updates only start for my PS4 after a day or so being out. Other than that, I have to go in there and check for update to start it. But if it‚Äôs been 1 to how many more days, it does it for me (that‚Äôs just how I feel)
---
I play mainly Overwatch and fallout and I always have to check for an update to start it
---
Personally I think the game has made serious improvements since that time. Granted there are still some seemingly basic things needing fixed but I have hope! And yes pretty much, Whitesprings nuked is your best bet but also the new dungeon called the Burrows while nuked is supposed to be pretty good. Although I haven't got to experience that yet
---
Why would u even want to carry that many. Once I hit over 14 I start just using a power armor all the time. If I need more I farm white springs sentry bots
---
People are brave, I don't like trading items for items because Fallout 76 doesn't have a secondary trade authentication feature.
---
Or you know people that have cancer and can‚Äôt work or do to much while they get treatment...
---
I have less time than you...I focus on making the game as much fun as possilble and nothing else.
---
Don't use fast travel or the map?
---
BuT wHy DoEsN't He TaLk AbOuT tHe PoSiTiVeS?
---
Well, it was considered "better" by a much bigger number.  Let's not pretend the earlier fallouts were that hot on the writing side.  FO3 and NV typically slammed for the mosaic style endings.  Granted you had more skill/Stat based dialog options the farther back.you go.  That was mostly little stuff though.
---
I think he means the Funko Pops figures
---
I'm also kind of bugged that he didn't mention the nuka dark situation was completely on the other company.
---
Ok Richard Dawson Kiel. (Jaws, James Bond villain)
---
Whats a "PVSSY"?
---
It really is, what were they thinking?
---
Its that theyre being nerfed again, explosive shotguns seem to be getting an 80% damage decrease on the explosive effect
---
I think everyone can agree that the game could have used more development time before release.
---
Yeah lemme eat their nuts
---
Just like XP boosters or buff consumables just about every MMO has had in their shops for years? Look, I get the gripe with those weapon repair kits but they are not only available in game as drops but if you play 76 they're about as useless as a rail gun. Especially without a dungeon. If you don't have the correct perks or can't locate a workbench by 50 I don't know what to tell you.
---
Latin for vagina.
---
Fallout 76 was being developed alongside fallout 4, which began in 2010. I wouldn't call 9 years 'rushing'. The launch was really really rough forsure, but i feel like the only guy who remembers bethesda saying the point of the b.e.t.a was to literally break the game so they could see where the improvements needed to be. Then when the game broke everyone rage quit...
---
I remember when New Vegas was still pretty new they used to shit on that one too. Even after it was patched. Now they talk about it like it's the bible. Personally I have fun with every Fallout game released, but there seems to always be elitists for some of the older titles.
---
They were really well written IMO
---
Not certain but I'd wager you could possibly get away with level 1 on that build
---
GG man, sounds fun but very stressful and difficult. Props
---
Same with the new vagas subreddit and it's meme subsidary.
---
It's a shame because I actually enjoyed a lot of the content that came out of it, but I should've expected it as they already had a supiority complex with the other Fallouts.
---
Oh wow, even more special then! It's an amazing weapon, people would pay a lot to own one. The main thing is if you got the trade you want :)
---
Call it unpopular if you want, but considering how easy it is to farm atoms on the daily, and how costless the repair kits truely are, its a poor argument to call it greedy or over the top. If you look at level 50 armor and weapons since thats where repair kits are most likely to see the most use, most of them if not all do not break in quick amounts of time. More than that, by participating in the queen fight and kill, you can get improved ones which are vastly superior. Secondly, it takes at minimum 6-12 seconds to get the kit to serve its function and in 99% of pvp situations, you wont be alive long enough to make use of them. Third, Not everyone wants cosmetics, not everyone wants to spend the atoms they earn in game on extra skins. This a harmless way to give people another choice.
---
yes
---
Ahh either way, be can now construct two whole conduits!
---
It's a beautiful state. Just stay out of Huntington :X
---
I feel like you've missed the point of your own comment.
---
The games not gods gift, definitely not horrendous either. People have valid complaints and is also a game worth defending. Its a game which needs improvement but is undeniably fun and has held a pretty stable player base.
---
If nothing, its a super solid 5/10
---
Were you on console or PC?
---
Especially new vegas, I've heard nightmares about it on launch.
---
Feels kinda ironic actually.
---
Your not alone my friend. That guy must have been sniffing glue.

---
Who‚Äôs ansel?
---
Bless!
---
He's the start of the new player camera quest. You have to find his body, and the holotape, note, and camera he's carrying are part of the quest. He's quite difficult to find.
---
The sheepsquatch outfit(s) are random rewards from the event so yes, every time you do it you have a chance of getting them to drop.
---
It was worth buying before, but not perfect. It is a solid game. Even if you just do a solo play through w/ the main quest lines that‚Äôs still a decent value.
---
Thanks for the response, I was a bit worried when I crashed during the event.
---
Jees, you really take this nonsense this serious you actually threaten someone rather than discussing? You sir are looney and need to seek the help you need before you hurt yourself and others.
---
Level 178. Never got one either.  But I did get a one star Instigating shotgun that is fun.  Oh and I got my first drill tonight from a leg. üòÇ
---
Yeah thank you
---
From my perspective the best part of fallout would be the side story's. The actual in plot lines have always seemed "ok" to me.
---
Me and my brother sell junk for the best armor and weapons. So we farm most of that time and help out others when in need
---
blah blah bethesda sucks blah pay to win !! blah blah GREEDY blah blah. repair kits are fine. little to no impact on the game and it was nice repairing my broken weapon at the end of an extra long queen fight the other day. 800 hours of playtime under my belt
---
Not all of us, I woke up with a keyboard imprint on my face last night...
---
Actually that isn't true.
---
X-com uses an rng normallizer where every shot you miss gives you a hidden bonus to hit the next shot, and every time you hit you have an increasing chance to miss the next one. This smooths out the random chance so you never get extended periods of constant missing, and enemies never get extended chains of always hitting.
---
It isn't as random as it tells you.
---
This game hates you and doesn't give enough of a damn to fake good fortune from time to time when you've had it bad.
---
small /s
---
I‚Äôve never even held just an explosive weapon in this game. Our time will come. One day...
---
Yep, to this day I still have a habit of rolling saves.
---
Oh. Was duping only PC because I have not seen one person banned for duping or picking up duped items on Xbox?
---
Any one else on the xbox experience frequent crashes after this update? My system has crashed 4 times today durring combat... shit is fucking driving me nuts.
---
wonder if its reloading and youre just not seeing the animation because you swap.
---
It‚Äôs not uncompletable, it‚Äôs simply a repeatable quest.
---
Todd Howard could have eaten that canvas. Remember, when you get your bag, you are literally stealing food from Todd Howard's mouth.
---
Would they call that CAN‚Äô abilism?
---
All Horsemen of the Apocalypse skins are supposed to be applicable to all PA types and it changes them to that Plague/War Raider model.
---
A typical reaction. You can't admit fault, so you belittle the point entirely.
---
That's fucking insane
---
Undead incestuous tentacles you mean?
---
Or make it a challenge and walk past the scorchbeast spawns to Watoga lol it's not that much farther either
---
 Yeah. I get at least half my keepers from bot vendors. The Whitespring Station one had pages of Legendaries the other day. ;)
---
Could just do the mine. Its a shorter walk. Less chance of legendaries though.
---
Much more valuable and useful in any event.
---
I got a TSE Submachine Gun that‚Äôs level 45 (I think) and I never use it because my wife and I are both into semi auto rifles. I am just keeping it because when we start playing again I can start fluffing up perk cards for it. I got it when I was level 62 at Whitesprings.
---
Will cause even worse cap deflation, see my post history
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure duplication was possible on console since people received the code on there too and eBay was filled with posts selling TSE guns on consoles.
---
What a legend
---
I've never had more than 4k, usually 2k, and there are still tons of plans I don't have. I'm continually amazed by those if you at max caps or even 10k+. Unless you don't build as much I just don't know how you do it. Hopefully when player vending starts people will be reasonable and perhaps I'll make some caps with plans and such.
---
Sir, I request that you back back off. For my own safety I have enough Atoms and I will be forced to purchase a restraining order (currently on flash sale). I'm feeling a bit threatened.
---
10 atoms
---
Dang i should have thought of that....
---
Then how was it a scam?
---
Your caps will become even more useless as legendary trading will rise into the 6 or 7 digits
---
It was much less than the weapon I was being traded
---
Winky face.
---
rad resist doesn't even do anything of note in rad zones.
---
You need something like 16000 radiation resistance to reduce it by the max amount, which gets you to like 6 rads/second
---
Power armor has a hidden effect that cuts radiation in half before applying resistance, and hazmat suits cut it by 75%. These hidden magic resistances are what let you handle nuke zones easily.
---
You can almost get by with rank three rad sponge shared on a team of four huddled together, but that doesn't rely on your radiation resistance at all, which even with leaded legendary radiation resistant marine armor isn't going to scratch the radiation involved. 
---
Also disease resist is called radiation resist, as said.
---
I'd be interested in doing that. I want more friends that play 76 and like doing events an stuff
---
I am all for server-wide comms channels (text/voice) however me thinks that it would require heavy moderation, at least on console.
---
Same for PS
---
That‚Äôs becoming a common problem with Bethesda games, they‚Äôre lucky I‚Äôm willing to endure it as long as I eventually get a polished game to play; but I also understand that a lot of gamers aren‚Äôt willing, don‚Äôt have the time, and move on too quickly to stick with a game through another year‚Äôs worth of updates. 
---
I‚Äôve been trying to play Blades and it‚Äôs... disorienting to say the least. I think the developers probably try to push for more development time (naturally), but publishers and fans are constantly putting the pressure on them when they get towards the end of the production cycle. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but I believe that there was a big debacle when Skyrim came out and Kotaku and other journalists started leaking details much earlier than Bethesda had intended. Then when FO4 came out Bethesda blacklisted Kotaku from receiving any sort of advance copy of the game. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt handle release dates very well üòÇ.
---
Please tell me thats a female character
---
Just came across this post, excellent advise! thank you!
---
At this point "who is ansel?" has to be a troll question. I've put out notices 3 times I've had the body, the third time I just put camera in thr title because some always asks "who's that?"
---
Also try mossy town in the mire. good luck. Glad i could help
---
Whenever I get like a 1-star legendary I just run over to a lower level on the map and give them it same thing with a 2-star I'll give it to someone is around level 50
---
Yeahhhh.... I mean I know I'm late to getting this, too, but I wanna make sure people can at least try to get it too, if they're as late as me.
---
The water collection simulation is so immersive too.
---
1. servers are much more stable 
---
2. TSE got nerfed but its still viable
---
3. player vending coming in next patch plus backpacks.
---
4. vendors were pooled so you dont have to travel everywhere to get your caps now.
---
5. known plans are now show as known.
---
6. storage was increased twice!
---
thats all the big ones that affected me that i can think of.
---
There is no mention of an orange asylum uniform in the game's files, it doesn't exist.
---
Nuke zones aren‚Äôt my problem here. I‚Äôm not planning on marching into a nuke zone with my rad resist armor. I am however planning on fighting ghouls and other creatures that severely reduce your rate fertility because they put half of Chernobyl into their punches. At least I can get that down.
---
I like number 4!
---
No joke. The attitude of the guy I first heard talking about it convinced me to never visit that page.
---
pc?
---
Wouldn't you have to sell them for a minimum of 1cap each?
---
That's what the [invisible power armor glitch](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/jantsen/screenshot/12072270) looks like. Never seen it with clothes before.
---
Nope, no camera ...just ...?... normal walking around
---
I preordered the game and played the beta still useing that character and I'm pretty sure legendarys at white springs don't spawn as they used to, same with west tek they will spawn but not as frequently and I'm talking about server hopping btw I have plenty of 3 star or 3 diamond wepons and armour to prove it. it's just not the same now.
---
And bolts!
---
Right now I have 135 Rad Resist. 22 per Limb, 42 for chest, 5 for under armor. I have three rad resist pieces. I should have 210 rad resistance. Upon finding the other two rad resist pieces I may plan on investing in the perk (as useless as it is) and claiming my 260-300 solid rad resistance.
---
I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre gone?
---
I got my first 3 star yesterday -- vampires machine gun
---
Increasing the cap limit will only cause more problems with the in game economy. It‚Äôs a bad idea. What we need is either more cap sinks or harder to find caps. The economy is over inflated already and the majority of players don‚Äôt actually have a problem with the current level cap as they barely reach it. Reddit is a minority in the game
---
Xbox One
---
You're going to be drinking my lemonade through a STRAW when I'm done with you
---
Honestly I dont think I can play wothoit excavator armor for the next few days, I'm waiting to sell my legendaries to the legendary vendor.
---
I just take solace in knowing Outer Worlds is going to sell worse than 76
---
My main is 78 (been playing since beta...I just refused to power level) and I got about 4k in caps... :/
---
Had a shotgun tse drop. Gave it to my wife since she's a shotgun build. Won't give it back now lol
---
Nope! Still here!
---
The patched suit.
---
It's a unique quest reward for mayor for a day that most people sell or scrap without thinking about, but is not obtainable by any other means.

They are getting way too obvious about them wanting us to **buy** atoms instead of **earning** them...

&gt;While Repair Kits do offer a way to fix an item in the field, we feel you will find that they are a convenient option you can utilize during your adventures. If we find that Repair Kits do offer any sort of competitive advantage once they are available, we will make any changes necessary to ensure that advantage is removed.
---
The convenience is direct evidence of competitive advantage.
---
If my gear breaks, I can spend money to keep using it, when I would otherwise have to seek a bench to repair it, thus saving me time, and allowing me to stay in the field longer.
---
People are genuinely aghast/baffled by this clear violation of pre-release promises when it's such a simple concept to explain.
---
Tmw I have five thousand plus hours on terraria
---
Yikes
---
Last time I tried playing that way I ended up with a bounty.
---
That's my plan
---
That's what I meant, it just never leaves the list.
---
I got one at 714 hours playing, around lvl 250 ish. And it's the wrong gun for my build. It's a 3\* .44 TSE 15% faster reload. It's sitting in my stash for a memento &gt;\_&lt;
---
Oh. Ok. I knew TSE weapons were on console as I have one of them from an enemy drop (I guess I was one of the only people to get one legitimately).
---
I‚Äôve been server hopping all day you‚Äôre a godsend
---
White springs.
---
I never received a healing salve recipe, as it is only obtainable from events, and is very rare. Only level 170.
---
So once again rng says this challenge is not doable unless I can find someone willing to offer a fair price for a very rare recipe that is in high demand for a limited time. Such fun challenges.
---
I'm just going to sell the ammo I don't use. Misses, .45, nukes, crossbow arrows, etc.
---
One that preferably isn‚Äôt going to be removed as a place for your camp.
---
No idea if the server is still full, but I got your request. Come on in when you can.
---
Somewhere that doesn't have enemy spawns. I placed my camp near the Nuka-Cola factory, and the only thing that has attacked it so far has been molerats and that only happened once.
---
I would recommend around Watoga, I have one next to the river to the west of the town. If you're close enough and finished the mayor for a day quest, you will have personal bodyguards. The assaultrons that patrol the west and south edges of the city will kill anything that invades your camp.
---
We really do need some sun bros up in here. Maybe it‚Äôs a fluke but the last few times my base was destroyed I just moved my camp and all my stuff was repaired upon placing again. Didn‚Äôt cost me a screw. Also it surprisingly let me place my entire base whole, which has only happened these last two times.
---
There is no winning with griefers, just block and hop. Even if you can consistently beat them they‚Äôll just keep coming back or start griefing someone else.
---
That said, wouldn‚Äôt it be great if you could offer a bounty for griefers? Just throw up 1k caps and everyone just descends on them across all worlds they try and escape to.
---
Writing all this is making me want to start a ‚ÄúSun-Bro‚Äôs of FO76‚Äù sub to get people to fight griefers with/for you.
---
I feel like you think I'm talking about complete legendary annihilation, I think we can all agree that watoga is the only place, well for the most part but I'm talking about legendary changes not annihilation  lol I  say annihilation as a joke but you know what I mean.
---
LOL yep, same here. 1\*/2\* legendaries for 20-100 caps that weigh 1-2 lbs are a steal and a great little "bonus game" every time I go to Whitesprings to craft and sell stuff. Sure, the scrip from them may be minimal, but it's fun to see what kind of junky legendaries (and surprisingly good ones sometimes!) people sell. Especially as someone who's still fairly new and recently hit level 50, it's a terrific way to get some usable gear and store some just in case :D
---
Dear gimmethegatling,
---
We are aware of this issue and have absolutely no plans to fix it unless it can be turned into some exploit that benefits rather than fuck over the player. 
---
Sincerely, bethesda.
---
Is there a vendor nearby?
---
Everything Internet Historian does is "Dead and Buried"
---
It doesn't change the fact that it all happened, and content about it is popular and entertaining.
---
Not enough money is being spent in the Atomic shop. So now we get these ridiculous challenges to make it harder to earn atoms in game. Really all Bethesda would have to do is put a perk/skill reset token in the atom shop for 1,000 atoms and the cash would flow like a river into their bank account. Apparently a marketing department wasn‚Äôt on their to do list at the Austin studios.
---
Start a war on whitespring
---
Simply placing your camp again will repair it. Whether this is intentional or not is anyone's guess but I hope Bethesda never patches it out
---
It's on YouTube if you wish to watch it.
---
My character is primarily a trader, honestly, and even I sell stuff to vendors for way less than it's worth in trade more often than I'd like to admit. Yeah it's fun to collect junk and amass caps by trading with other people, but what's NOT fun is hitting stash max and wanting to just PLAY the game rather than hop around a bunch to sell people a few thousand caps worth of stuff... Especially as I get closer and closer to that 25k cap limit
---
Also, please keep selling them to bots, it's actually really fun to see what people sell to the bots and scoop stuff up :D
---
lmao your not wrong the other week some kid wanted 80k minimum for a aae 90% less weight handmade or real money
---
It still has some major issues. Loot issues being one. Yeah, it‚Äôs better than the day it was released but I feel like since it‚Äôs had 6 months of us beta testing it for them it should be in a better spot. If they want it to succeed they need to figure out a way to provide actual end game content. As it sits, no end game content unless you consider terrible odds to actually get good 3 star items as end game..
---
"If i can stash it, I can trash it!"
---
Care about the way you look more than stats

It took a tad more than a few weeks for Fallout 76.

And it still has bugs out the asshole.

I‚Äôll throw you 10 tomorrow.
---
If someone contests it they can freely kill you at any point until you die.
---
You can't kill them until they get the first strike, so fighting is recklessly suicidal.
---
They can see you on the map, and likely will plan their rout to you before contesting, so running away is difficult.
---
You can sneak, and depending on how close you are to a fast travel point you might be able to evade them long enough to find somewhere to commit peaceful suicide and not get your loot stolen. Remember, they need to take the first shot, so sneaking up on them is completely pointless.
---
Or you can jump off the server. Which is the best option as it unshackles you from the workshop, because the other options they can still just go back and pay again to try and kill you a second time. There is next to no risk for them, and caps don't mean much, so they WILL try again if do successfully dead yourself the first time.
---
It must be similar to scrapping crops to repair for free. I‚Äôm glad to hear it wasn‚Äôt a fluke
---
theres a dude on xbox that buys things from people that are super rare then dupes them and resells them for insane prices. people thought duping was fixed but the real dupers are people like this.
---
You'd think after the 3rd game Obsidian makes that's bad, buggy, and broken people would start to think it was Obsidian's fault for putting out bad games and not mean ol' publishers who just didn't give them enough time.
---
I like the player issued bounty idea. It could show the accusation on their icon too. Maybe only players in a certain radius to you. That would help a little with the spamming of bounties. Or a timer? You could play raider boss and pay others to hunt down wanderers. Perhaps a boost on caps won by the hunted. Sorry for rambling. Lots of ideas. üòÜ
---
THIS!!!!!! As a newer player, I've had multiple people make my day this way. I've had many people give me random legendaries, at least two of which I never spoke a word to (the others saw I wasn't well equipped while trading via the market), and I was always SO excited when that happened!
---
Other times, heading to sell stuff at Whitesprings and finding a slew of legendaries to choose from for a few hundred caps or less is like Christmas! And when people just randomly drop some in a bag or throw em in the trash can across from the crafting tables... Damn that's such an amazing feeling.
---
You do if you want New Vegas 2 which is what people are treating the game as.
---
People are gonna be cheap.  Dont let it dissuade you.
---
I sell every zealot legendary I get, because they are worthless
---
Most of these people look to see where you are, and see if they can fast travel/sprint over fast enough to kill you before you jump servers. If you crouch through them searching for you the probably will choose someone else.
---
I have never exploited the trick to kill someone myself, but i have been learning what type of things i look for if I wanted to, so I can try to learn how to avoid being the target myself.
---
&gt; massively misleading
---
Everything he said in the video happened...
---
Did you check G2A.COM?
---
Did you instill the creation kit for Fallout 4? It should come with the Tools folder. Also, Archive2.exe is located in the folder named Archive2 which is located in the Tools folder.
---
Thanks! Any idea what time you‚Äôll be on?
---
I've not heard about wanting to pay for one, and I wouldn't. I'd just make a new character at that rate, transfer shit over
---
Yeah it would be an interesting addition but like you said there is potential for spamming. Could you imagine giving out quests and rewards though? It would have to be after being killed or someone destroying your stuff or taking your drops. Then you‚Äôd have a ‚Äúhired gun‚Äù option instead of revenge and you could put up caps or items as a reward.
---
The upcoming challenges have been leaked, it gets better :

---
Heres a tip: dont be a dick
---
Farming 3* is imo better at West Tek. But nukes are great too.
---
Dont be like that. You know we know that you know deep down... You want that budget.
---
A. Effin. MEN. to that.
---
I would he okay with this, I know I can just grind out more exp for more perks and special stats, but for a small fee of atoms I'd reroll my build a few times
---
...because any non-cosmetic item seems to go over REAL well with players.  :D
---
Oh new idea, maybe go over to the market76 sub and offer caps for a mercenary or two. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd find a few people for a couple thousand caps.
---
Ugh... LOL my first messenger event seemed so easy til I got to anglers above my level, the second messenger event... Ended at a fissure site. I was level 20-something and there was someone below level 10 with me. It... didn't go well.

It was also when I learned that you could fall right INTO the fissure! So that was awesome...
---
I have never heard of anyone getting banned for any type of mod posted on Nexus. I cannot see a Chat mod as cheating, people using it have been nice enough so far, I have not seen any abuse.

The Chat mod is how I found the camera. People can be very helpful if you give them a chance.

I use to be a programmer 25+ years ago. We build factory machines/robotic. The programmers have no way to give the eta for the finish product. The only way to ensure you have a product in hand was "daily build" which you sees in applications these days , eg "build 102832"
---
However, HOWEVER, management who have no idea about programming, CAN in their wise ways set a date and time of release of product. In factory machines build they just give a dateline to the client, and if product is not delivered by that date, the company have to pay the client a few thousand bucks per day till delivery of product.
---
So what do we programmers do? Built the basic requirements, and bug fix and addons of ui last. If product have to leave the factory ...we fly in and wait at the clients side for the product and said we are doing " final on site setup". And later bug fixes.
---
I hate managements and datelines.
---
... maybe thats why i am not complaining about FO76 bugs and such. I love the game. Enjoy it so much. To Bethsheda programmers, thanks guys.
---
I would recommend you do both. With the new bug fixes and updates, there is less likely to be bugs hindering your experience through the first 50 levels like there was when the game was newer, with your high level, new content is coming every month in the bucket loads so there is value in finishing that character, such as making that character melee build, or shotgun build, etc, and making your new character all pistols or heavy guns, etc. And between both of the characters, you can earn the daily and weekly atoms from the game on both characters, allowing you more atoms with which to buy some cool stuff, oh which there is way more now then there ever was before. I believe its a great time to get reinvested if you're willing to give it a try.
---
Next to the train station near Poseidon power plant. It is a farm plot
---
Maybe just one a day? Even if it was just for fun.
---
Well..... LvL 226 here, started playing since beta. Didn't want to participate in any of the duping/RL coin sales. Never seen it as a drop. /sigh.
---
Been playing fallout since FO1 and I'd say the game is well worth 60 bucks.
---
I have run this event 6 times/all different days.  3 times the server crashed, event gone. 1 time I actually found the invisible body to loot, the other 2 times I could never find it.
---
Invisible body to loot is THE stupidest thing imaginable. 
---
And why....oh why can't we have a "rejoin the last server" option?
---
Lol, I don‚Äôt see what the ‚Äúlogical‚Äù issue would be. It wouldn‚Äôt be giving players anything they didn‚Äôt already earn via leveling up. Just the ability to re-spec their characters if they want to buy the token.
---
Is it better? Yes. Did i crash twice and have to relog a third time after getting stuck today? Also yes. Many bugs are still not fixed, like dying over encumbered doesn't let you respawn. 
---
Excluding the bait and switch of various merchandise outside the game, the game is still unstable. The only major difference is now i'm not crashing every hour. I don't think it's good enough yet to get a pass if it just released. Especially since it wouldn't release with fasnacht, sheepsquatch, or any other content they're drip feeding.
---
I mean if you want an rpg like new Vegas that doesnt have to be open world
---
Sure, I'm trolling here when all people calling you troll and downvoting your post. *The pot calling the kettle black* ;)
---
I had peace and quiet a little north of flatwoods, and only lvl 1-10 ever spawned.
---
have 2x starched genes perks. go to west tek. go in the doorway straight ahead. see the hallway with the rad scrubbers and the glowing green pool for a floor?
---
crouch down and collect several hundred toxic goos from the floor. 
---
drink them til you're almost dead. you should see a notification that you have mutated. enable 2x starched genes perk. activate rad scrubbers til you're not irradiated. 
---
server hop. repeat. jump higher. run faster. hit harder. fall with less damage.
---
Yeah, these challenges start getting to me too, but there are no such problems on pc with an in-game chat (mod,ofc). There are always someone who wants to help with these challenges, just ask about it. It's free atoms for both of you so why not? I'm also never refuse to help people who ask about challenges when I have the prerequisites for it.
---
I would speculate that other markets have cheaper keys because there is less demand for the game and Beth is trying to grow user base there.
---
Some people have said you can redeem the foriegn key while using a VPN and then it works fine after that, but that's pretty iffy for me.
---
Personally I bought 2 "used" copies off Amazon for 25ish each. Well, I bought three actually. I had to get a refund on one cause it didnt work.
---
I could be mistaken but I thought that specific combination was taken out of the loot table rng as a result of the whole duping fiasco. Obviously the ones already around weren‚Äôt purged, but I was under the impression it‚Äôs impossible for them to drop anymore
---
Don't inject your filthy bigotry into this thread.
---
...and that would be an advantage to players who want to PAY to reorganize their perks to their advantage for any reason.  
---
Don't know why you don't understand the concept.
---
And people could still do that. I‚Äôd just rather be able to do a respec than have to start from scratch, especially with my original character I started in beta when I didn‚Äôt know what the heck I was doing and I‚Äôd happily drop some atoms for it. It wouldn‚Äôt give me any kind of advantage, I already earned the XP in game, just the ability to respec my perks and skills.
---
That's a bad word
---
Nearest one would probably be in the park to the South depending on which side if the factory you go with.
---
I mean fair, it wouldn't be for everybody
---
Leather and pipes

With so many issues surviving with each and every new Fallout game (Heck, even some bugs migrated from FO4 to FO76), I feel like even the developers are somehow lost in their own game engine and the game should've been rebuilt from the ground up ages ago. I just don't understand why the game-breaking bugs that most Fallout players will eventually come across if they have played each instalment are somehow 'okay' and it's not enough to warrant such a change. Despite all this, Bethesda isn't the only developer that releases a buggy game and then fixes it eventually... I feel like the rise of 'DLC' and how everyone is connected to the internet has somehow made it okay to ship an absolutely *shitty* product because, well they can fix it OTA.
---
Dude I will TOTALLY try that!
---
How? I‚Äôm the same level with the same number of perks.
---
You saw the fit everyone threw over repair kits, this is way worse. You'd have an advantage over those that don't pay 1000 atoms to respec.
---
I'm sure everyone made mistakes when first setting up their builds. Probably reason you want to respec. Now imagine me with a crappy setup, meanwhile you just bought 1000 atoms and respec your character to optimal build. You will clearly have the advantage with a better build. Meanwhile if i don't have the money, I'm forced to level up 10-20 times before i can move enough points and unlock required cards to match your build.
---
I got you confused with the pc player who is having a birthday. I meant that for him, sorry
---
Cant bring myself to dump 140~ 100% cores &lt;.&lt;

Sure. I can help you with that. I'm just getting on now and will look for your friend invite, or send you an invite if you haven't sent me one yet. IGN: jchamlin
---
#2; Biv gives a recipe, but it's kinda rare.
---
Yeah, there's a computer that allows you to redeem them for prizes. I don't remember exactly where but it's at the entrance of a mine, that is full of scorched.
---
Because atom shop dude!
---
If you seriously do not understand how that would be an advantage to playing, why would you want to be able to buy it?  Come ON.  rub those two braincells together and THINK man!
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been hearing a lot of good things about the updates lately, other than a couple bad things. I think will reinstall later tonight and try out a new character and continue my old, thanks for the advice!
---
&gt; cavalier/sentinel 
---
what are those? I've seen all the others, but not these two.
---
Unlucky.  I‚Äôm level150 + and just now got two science scribe outfits and three paint jobs in last months nothing before that.  Usually just 40 mm rounds I just dropped so they don‚Äôt weigh me down
---
Pleasure.
---
When you say "you know how much money they would make from this" and "I don't understand how this would be an advantage to players" in the same thread, I have no hope for you being able to grasp this very simple concept.
---
Blegh. I hate that. Wish the technical data would just stack if it's gonna be a rare shot.
---
Keep at it they'll eventually start dropping. I've turned in prob close to 100 and I've gotten maybe 6 outfits
---
Almost like he took your plans and then set a price he knew you wouldn't pay to scam you.
---
Didn't realize there was even a chance not to get stuff. I just kept seeing people bragging about getting like 5 of the same outfit.
---
Nah that‚Äôs not true, I got a TSE Western revolver lately
---
Where do I find Biv at? I just started. Is there a quest line I need to craft the stations?

I have an alt character who is a construction worker and loves to do this sort of thing.

I'm out of town till Thursday though, so we'll have to meet up then. What times(and timezone) do you usually play?
---
i get plenty of outfits.. but no PA paint.. i do it for the paint :(
---
He was negotiating bro :P
---
How very PG of you.
---
Happens to everyone.  Happened 4 times in a row to me.
---
Almost every mmo or online game has this feature and it‚Äôs never ruined a game or caused an unfair advantage on any sort of panic scale. A lot more goes into advantage than just the build stats everyone has access to. Rare weapons and armor, raw skill etc. I don‚Äôt even play PvP or survival at all, just PVE. I don‚Äôt have the time needed to dedicate myself to rebuilding a character from scratch etc. and a lot of other people don‚Äôt either. It doesn‚Äôt give me access to anything special or unique. I could make the counter argument using your logic that because you can play the game more than I can, you can respec your character faster than me giving you an unfair advantage. But I mean really how does one exploit that advantage and how much of a real advantage is it?
---
I didn't know there was a caps cap. I find it fascinating that people play so long on one character. I'm on my 6th. The highest level I got to was 47. I'm on 38 now, I think.
---
I run a heavy/rifle build so they get my instigating hunting rifle. :D
---
We should have a group for this - r/drunkgamers should cover it! I do this all the time on XBOX1
---
Yes, there's a poster at most train stations for a frat party. That's thw quest line, it's near Morgantown, almost directly right from Vault 76 on the map.
---
The spawn chance is 5% for level 40 and up and goes down 1 percent every 10 levels. This chance doubles in nuke zones
---
I‚Äôve been looking at the sub and I haven‚Äôt found any toxicity yet, I even found something positive about fo76, I‚Äôll update this as I go on
---
Fallout 69
---
My greatest accomplishment in FO76 was having 2700 caps on me; they were gone in like 30s because I desperately wanted Brick building plans.
---
I nuke the place today and none of the ghouls turn into glowing one :(
---
Found a TsE handmade on the watago vendor 2 months ago, just this week got one from a ghoul at Whitesprings.
---
Watoga
---
I farm like crazy... I mean that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs left to do. I am sitting close to level 300 and I finally had a TSE Handmade drop from the Queen a few days ago.
---
I‚Äôd rather camp budget increases than most things right now, I love building in this game.
---
I just did like 3 laps and couldn‚Äôt find one. Arggghhh
---
I loved New Vegas but Old World Blues was nearly unplayable for me.
---
The vast majority of the time on PS3, the framerate would grind to such a halt that I was getting less than 1fps.
---
I'd have to hope the game wasn't auto saving and just close the application.
---
Of course, that hardly did anything because it'd be the same when I started it up again.
---
I think out of the thirteen or so times I played through NV, I got to do OWB two or three times because of that issue.
---
It‚Äôs nice üëç
---
Enclave bunker
---
If it's heavy and a crap roll, it gets vender'd
---
If it's light and a crap roll, it gets saved for script
---
If it's not a crap roll, it goes to the marketplace... Where it gets ignored generally unless it's God tier
---
If it's God tier, I hoard it as caps have little value and it might be needed for a trade.
---
I got a bloodied explosive gatling gun that someone sold to a vendor, I wasn't even into heavy weapons but it has been pretty cool without even needing heavy weapons perks equipped it's awesome.
---
I got a tse m79. It's my baby, have to say it's not tons of damage and most of the time 1/2 of the shots hit the target. Only I've seen lvl 156..
---
Maybe server hop :/
---
Or you use the tasty version that cures all addictions
---
Oxhorn isn't a homophobe, he *was* a homophobe. People can change, you just have to let them.
---
Lol. 200k is impossible. The max is 125k
---
They still drop.
---
I have a lv 155 and lv 110. Only TSE I earned was a cryolater
---
I work two jobs, I support a family, I don‚Äôt have the time to level up a new character. I only do PVE, I don‚Äôt play survival. I want to be able to respec because I do not have the time I wish I did to do it in game and a lot of players are in the same boat as me. As I said on a previous post by that logic someone who has more time to play the game than I do and who can respect faster has an unfair advantage, should I get a boost for less time played? Every other MMO does this in some way shape or form, it doesn‚Äôt cause imbalance.
---
I love this. It's like investing to upgrade stores in fo4.
---
Need more ways to make caps worth something again
---
This is what you see when you fall off of rainbow road in mario kart
---
Hell, I lost interest around lvl 50 because I had sneak perks that allowed me to take down Scorch Beasts with sneak attacks, and every time they started to aggro me I'd just sprint away and then crouch.
---
"OH, this mother fucker wants to shoot at me? Let me at 'em!! I see him! Going in for the ki...wait Where did he go?"       
---
I wish I had an easy way to upload videos from PS4 to my Google Drive because I'd love to post a 2 minute video of myself in the BoS cave with the Scorchbeast who walked right up next to me, *should have seen me* and then kept walking; I was continually shooting him, essentially with impunity.
---
Your argument doesn't work though. Even if that's the case, that i can play more and have an advantage.  Reason is i wouldn't be paying for that advantage, you would. 
---
I'm not saying it's fair to those who can't devote enough time to the game. Just saying your solution would be "pay to win". Which is what Bethesda promised would never do. They already walked a fine line with the repair kits and received tons of grief over it. I just don't see it ever going your way.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Huh, I guess they‚Äôre just really rare
---
me too... lvl 189 without any explosive or two shot drops, the only good items I've found have been from other people vendoring things. RNG is often unkind.
---
Usually theres an eyebot up at te relay tower nearest to flatwoods.
---
Wait wait wait....you seriously just said someone who plays more than you do has an "unfair" advantage??  
---
No man, that's called a GAME.  :D
---
When did he say anything to contradict his old statements other then saying " don't listen to the trolls" and copy strikes.
---
Got one! Thanks
---
Just got one. Thanks!!!
---
But seriously, I don't want to try and explain simple ideas and rational anymore.  Done being captain obvious for the night.
---
Just use it up. Once in a while, I've had really high numbers in guns before. Idk how exactly to trigger it, but it's not very common. It won't let you reload until you fall below the natural amount
---
Lol this sub is a hub for the opposite, if you say a bad thing here you're almost guaranteed to be swarmed by downvotes. This sub is probably slightly more balanced but still has a massive bias.
---
I am east coast - I work nights 12 hour shifts - 2 days on 3 off 3 days on 2 off - my sleep schedule is random AF - that being said I don't generally sleep more than four hours at a time and I play ALOT.   look forward to meeting you o7
---
Super rare. My guess is that they might have done something with the drop % when they were getting duped so much.
---
The question is, does Gauss Rifle count as an energy weapon as far as modifiers go?
---
If you use the camera, her name will show up at the top right if you are looking at her. Makes it a bit easier to find her.
---
It does need to be fixed though.
---
I believe you get them at the end of the brotherhood questline
---
It's not a bad subreddit at all, all they do on there's share camp builds and funny pics they took

I sell all kinds of stuff to them just to make room for better stuff. When the vending machines finally get here I'll be selling all kinds of legendary stuff
---
I remember hearing somewhere that all super mutant's are female and the males became centaur's when exposed to FEV.
---
Yes, 100%. Back when I played Fortnite: STW, the global chat was full of bots spamming links to third party websites that sold weapons and mats etc. for real money, to the point Epic disabled the global chat. Dunno if they fixed it nowadays, but that was really annoying.
---
Only 2 accounts though.
---
It can sometimes lag a bit for me, but hardly ever crashes. Just the last 48hrs alone I've done the SBQ event about 8x without any major issues. 
---
You might just be incredibly unlucky... but some things I'd try would be to validate my internet connection. Test speed as well as packet loss. If you have slow or poor/choppy connection, could add to your lag and eventual crash. Are you on wireless? Try switching to wired and see if any difference.
---
Maybe somehow your install is corrupt? Could try deleting and downloading all again see if any difference.
---
I was an xbox bounty hunter prior to my ban.  Anybody who had a bounty on them over 50 caps was on my radar. I would hunt them down, kill them,  and check their bag for large amounts of items.  If they had over 1000 of any given item i knew that was legit. I grabbed all the items that were too many and left the server. I then would trudge to a remote area on the map, my favorite spot was in the swamps in the mid right side and drop all of the items.  Then id leave that server and hunt for more bounties. Its how i made caps, passed the time, and enjoyed the game. Then they banned me.
---
1.  Around three minutes.
---
2. Possible reward from doing one of Biv's daily quests. Reward is RNG so good luck.
---
3. Yes. They also stack with each other so a single Dark can give you +6 STR and END with both perks maxed.
---
Please Bethesda
---
You only get that notification when it's another player, not random creatures.
---
Forgive me for not using google but what do you mean by 'an active power grid'? Is there a communal benefit for getting a power plant back online? If so what ??
---
Ever since they mentioned the legendary vendor i started hoarding them
---
WVA Power Co now has 2! 5 if you count my friends I haven't even talked to about this.
---
No problem!
---
Got one from AWOL Armaments. It‚Äôs a single action revolver üòÇüòÇ
---
that's a shame op! i literally duped every 2 shot in the game in the first weeks this game was out and sold them for 30k or more a piece. then sold them on ebay and other real money sites...  this game for being a complete turd was awesome in paying for my new harley
---
yes if you hook a power box up at nearby workshops it will give 100 power.
---
i think 100 power but free power for sure.
---
Pistols are amazing, https://youtu.be/t9ToHNZj6xM
---
No, because they do ballistic damage.
---
The gun itself, however, is classified as an energy weapon and as such no longer drops with the exploding legendary modifier.
---
I legit got a 3 day mute for disagreeing with someone then when I talked to the mod about my mute I got banned. Then I talked to another mod about why they thought it was necessary for a ban and they just insulted my case about it. r/76casuals is definitely the most toxic sub I‚Äôve been on.
---
Lol he thinks he was attacked
---
whats you ign ? and are you on pc?
---
Wait for a big event like sheepsquatch then distribute amongst the power armor types. Banjo just dumps them in a nearby trash can or something and makes a general announcement via mic. No mic? No clue drop a bag and start shooting at it? Oh right there‚Äôs also the new gift emote
---
Definitely not. I disagreed with a policy they brought up about  not complaining about repair kits and got muted. Then when I brought up how I was upset about it they banned me.
---
-wow- I was saying that to point out how ludicrous that logic is, of course it‚Äôs not unfair, nor would doing a respec which every other MMO offers be unfair. Furthermore if you used your brain cells and thought it out before just wanting to trash someone for whatever reason you do that, you‚Äôd know a couple things as to why this works so successfully on every other MMO and why it doesn‚Äôt create an unfair advantage. 1) Survival mode and PVP already have a damage scale in place, which makes advantage come down to legendary weapon types and armors more so than perks. 2) Nobody who has a rifle build based around the bloodied explosive rifle they carry is going to get killed by you and respec their whole entire character to a shotgun, pick up a no star shotgun and come after you with better results. Builds are based around gear, not perks, everyone has access to the same perks, gear and skill is what separates players.
---
It's pretty easy to collect trash and sell it to make the 1400 vendor cap limit. The easiest way by far is getting the chemist perk and with collecting a few supplies, you can easily crank out enough to max out the vendor selling limit. You can make tons of rad away for example, the easiest by far. Or just using the pharma farm perk alone can get you overflowing with chems and healing aids beyond what you can sell to the NPC vendors.
---
If anything, I have to stop playing at some point because my stash is full and I can't sell anymore, I already end up throwing away low value legendaries, but I can only do so much of that before I fell like I'm wasting my time.
---
I'm really looking forward to player vending to be able to sell more as it's not easy to consisitly sell stuff to other players, and they always try to buy stuff you don't want to sell. However, it's really going to shake things up though, I predict it will really drive down prices, I can easily sell stimpacks at 15 caps for example, be making more than the vendor pays but be easily affordable to someone who doesn't want to invest the perks/time etc.
---
Some people gotta photoshop that kind of effect in you got real life weathering!!
---
Hit me up, GT: FrienofthedeviL 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox one and nuking the queen and pvp are pretty much my end game and I can do em both decently lol I‚Äôm always down to play with griefers, love when I claim a shop and they try me. They usually don‚Äôt suspect someone on adventure who is 90% specced towards pvp. A nice surprise.
---
You can make 1400 caps a day just selling looted items.
---
Like 10k a week not hard to max caps
---
Ign: shibus
---
I love Adderall
---
My journal arrived on Thursday! I love it!
---
You forgot money also separates players
---
 I am most are useless and take too much space i have been saving a lot for this to get a three star or maybe higher
---
That's kinda how it goes. Subreddits just become echo chambers.
---
I dont see how you can make that much money, Im always running between 1500 and 5000 at max,
---
The trick is that as long as eachothers xboxs are set as the other persons ‚Äúhome xbox‚Äù you and a friend/sibling can share all your games with eachother while being able to stay on your account (ive been doing this with my little brother ever since i moved out from my parents a few years ago)
---
Aight I saw it in my feed this morning, I haven‚Äôt seen it, it isn‚Äôt going to make me hate him right? Cuz I like this guy and a like this game, but I don‚Äôt like watching people take shits on my interests.
---
It‚Äôs not pay to win though is my point. As I just said in another post the reason every other MMO does this successfully is because it doesn‚Äôt create an advantage. There is already a Damage modifier in PVP/Survival that forces advantage to come down to weapons/gear and player skill. Builds are based around weapons and gear, not the perks everyone has access too. The guy you killed who‚Äôs entire build is made around his bloodied, explosive rifle isn‚Äôt going to respec his whole character to a shotgun build, take the time to find a new rare BE shotgun, find all new armor to work with his new build and then weeks later when he‚Äôs done all that come after you with an advantage. Every MMO does this, name one where it‚Äôs caused a problem or an unfair advantage?
---
Yeah, those can sell for a good bit. They are used in nuka quantum grenades (some of the strongest explosives in the game) and nukashine (teleports you around the map randomly, good for messing around + fast travel while overencumbered)
---
Fuck me running.. That's straight bat shit
---
What mods are on it when examining it?
---
I unfollowed them in December 2018. It was a good decision
---
Ok cool thx for the info. One more question do you know what a good price in caps for one would be. At this low of level I think I‚Äôll just sell mine
---
Why the fuck are you even still here?
---
You can leave
---
Nah it refills the guns it works with black powder rifles and the dragon also
---
I'm not I use a handmade and a black powder rifle with no legendary effects
---
Okay I was talking about this the other day. I remember early on when I was playing I would check every terminal, note, etc. and while at the entrance to a mine (clues to which one) I remember being prompted with a choice to redeem something with tokens. I want to say it had something to do with a yield of ore maybe? But now that I type this out it was probably the opposite maybe. It might of been saying you get tokens if you turn in a good yield of ore. Does anyone know what I‚Äôm talking about?
---
 legendaries often drop nothing. Even 3*s.  :(
---
A flaming barrel and rifle stock
---
I've found about 8 explosive weapons but nothing with a good first star and no shotguns. My friend did find a TSE Dragon on the SBQ though. Didn't work with his build but it was fun for a bit.
---
The vast majority of TSEs are duped. If you find one genuinely good two-star weapon per 100 levels you're doing well, and most likely it won't be something you'd want to use yourself.
---
Was that the miners miracles one?  BC I vaguely remember that..
---
Yeah if people are buying rare, powerful weapons and armor from third party sellers absolutely, but that has nothing to do with this.
---
How many ammo per reload?
---
"Auction"
---
That doesn't sound fucking stupid and pretentious to you?
---
Anti armor is very good. If that gun is max level, you have something pretty valuable.
---
Ohhhh a thrower.  Yea, go with rifleman and tank for that.  Its not automatic.
---
So was I. I was notifying people yesterday. I got my final camera for my last character today.
---
306 per mag it has a gamma reciever and flaming barrel with a rifle stock.
---
level 168 checking in!
---
I‚Äôm not sure at all! But it is definitely been a topic of discussion between me and a team mate several times before so I feel like I should know! I‚Äôll have to hop on tomorrow and do some investigating.
---
The only way I figured that stuff out was to look at its stats, pick the perk, then re-look.
---
In real life the gun shoots a steel slug using the power of electro magnets.
---
In fallout the battery for the electromagnet as well as the metal slug are both contained within the 2MM Electromagnetic cartridge.
---
So I know that doesn‚Äôt explain why grounded reduces the damage, I think it‚Äôs just an error on Bethesda‚Äôs part.
---
But if you build there, you ruin a spawn point for the wandering vendor bot.
---
Yes I have it, I crash once an hour on PS4. A lot of others do as well. No fix that I know of. No other PS4 game that I own does this.
---
And then you have the whole ‚ÄúNew Vegas Good‚Äù posts that come around every week and manage to reach 1.5k or more upvotes each time, and any time you speak out against new Vegas it‚Äôs always a backlash of people saying ‚Äúwell sure your opinion is okay but this fallout game sucks compared to new Vegas.‚Äù
---
Nah he‚Äôs hard crashing, no an internet connection issue. Happens to a lot of PS4 users.
---
Well you're trying to add something into the atomic shop which involves real world money for some so how would this have nothing to do with it?
---
Its rifleman thank you :)
---
OK. Well I have to register the excavator pa and wanted to do that tonight at the same place so might get an answer sooner than you if it is the same place :)
---
*Cough* its not really a solo game.
---
personally i love having my camp in the divide. not terribly far from the places i go most ^ ^
---
you can buy one each day in whitesprings pink room. So that's at least 7 a week you can start bulking.
---
Whatever people will pay
---
he‚Äôs doing great
---
Lol. I always sell my 3* weapons that I don't want to use to the enclave.
---
If I recall, you can find a list of local vaults on a terminal, and 76 is among them, slatted to open 20 years after the War. (The actual one opened 25 years after for some mysterious reason, but eh, plans change).
---
Got this taken care off :))
---
You get a drill don't complain
---
I honestly don't know, I haven't traded in ages
---
Usually having a team of 4 people, 3 out of 4 of us disconnect multiple times per event. It really sucks, dampens the experience a bit.
---
Lol
---
Because it doesn‚Äôt create any tangible advantage, nor has it on every other MMO that has this feature. Selling legendary weapons or armor in the atomic shop would create an unfair advantage. Selling -additional- perks or skills in the atomic shop wold create an unfair advantage. A re-spec does not.
---
Hey man. Trading posts are not allowed is this subreddit
---
Those go for like 50k caps btw if explosive, just bloodied probably 20k caps
---
Oh no!!!! The chance to make free money is hard?!! The game is at least giving u the opportunity but it is a game that wants and needs to run off microtransactions since dlc is gonna be free and they Definitely want players spending money .if players can easily earn it in game. Then bethesda is losing out on revenue which in turn makes us lose out.
---
Yeah, that's where I thought I got it, I have the plan learned.
---
I dont have the bos power armor paint PLANS, but I'd sell one of my painted bos t60s if you're interested.
---
Lmao I was waiting to see this when I started reading the comments!
---
Next to fissure site prime!
---
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK! Just needed the chest piece. Logged off last night, get back on just now and I'm left with a chassis that has a t51b right leg and t51b right arm. Fuck you Bethesda!
---
So do I!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Haha...yeah. Like when I spawned the Imposter Sheepsquach and LITERALLY NO ONE SHOWED UP! I could have easily defeated it, running all 3 pylons, without power armor, but I would have needed twice as many stimpaks.
---
since when? its not listed in the rules.
---
Why would it? I put a item people come and place bids on it, what's that called? AUCTION!!!
---
Pretentious not at all I call stuff but what they are, don't really understand what's stupid about it? Maybe it is for someone that only has shit to give to other putting its point of view or probably you didn't even understand it....
---
and screws
---
Having lvl 50+ players with God tier weapons and armour everywhere without having a perfect perk set is already causing problems left right and centre and now you want to let people re-spec on demand? 
---
Yea no thanks
---
I think I got cancer from trying to read your response.
---
I think this sub is more about encouraging Bethesda to do what‚Äôs good for the game to see the game succeed than it is blind positivity. This thread alone had people saying how ‚Äúthey understand the hate 76 received at launch.‚Äù 
---
I believe it was the post over on the fallout sub about the ‚Äúthe fall of 76‚Äù video from the internet historian where a majority of the comments leaned more in favor of bashing 76 and how it was/is a ‚Äúbad game‚Äù while on this sub there were comments about the same video saying things such as ‚Äúthey have a fair point about launch but they never mentioned how well the updates/content added in has been‚Äù 
---
For me I just enjoy the discussion this sub has about a game I enjoy, while the fallout sub has adopted more of a mindset of ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt think new Vegas was the best fallout and 76 the worst then you‚Äôre wrong‚Äù and leaves no room for you to really voice an opinion otherwise without being downvoted/replied to with comments such as ‚Äúpeople still play that trash game?‚Äù So to me it isn‚Äôt really a sub to celebrate fallout as a title (which I thought it would be when I first subbed) but rather an echo chamber about new Vegas being the best while anything less than new Vegas is ‚Äúgarbage.‚Äù
---
This comment would get me crucified over there but i liked 3 more then new vegas and didn't really like 2......
---
AAE LMG goes for 12k+ so if you wont go ova 10k then you might aswell say your not paying for it
---
I'm just being disconnected every hour, game doesn't crash but still. I guess there is nothing we can do about it instead of just waiting for Bethesda to fix servers stability or whatever. 
---
That's quite a problem when you are in the middle of something, and have to start the quest stage again.
---
More to this, every time I exit to main menu I get an error, some 2\*\*\* code, I don't remember.
---
The sad thing is they might not even know about these problems, because a lot of players say the game works just fine for them.
---
Now just to get that camera...... lol crappy rng when it comes to players posts and server hopping. I‚Äôve mostly given up trying to get it now
---
comparing fallout 3s ending to fallout new vegas'... fucking lol
---
It's like a pussy, but the girl who owns it listens to deep underground black metal. True cvlt stuff.
---
since earlier this week. search 'trading' in this subreddit. one of the mods made a post about it
---
The easiest one that is a guaranteed spawn is the Grafton Monster, usually in the dry River bed south of Charleston Station and Poseidon Power Plant.
---
i'm not going to say i'll pay more than that because i will never realistically have that much at once in this game, as is ill have to farm for a week to get up to 10k
---
Let's be honest: it's an adult game, but most of the themes are quite immature.
---
Is this your first fallout?
---
There are totally female super mutants, they just all look the same. Like dwarves in LotR! Anyway, theres a town that was getting experimented on in 76 that has them in vats and you can see who they were before and plenty of them were female but look just like all the rest.
---
Just have to wait 22 more levels.  I got my very 1st \*\*\* TSE (natural drop) a couple of weeks ago at something like lvl 162 (Thanks to West Tek) wich was my dream weapon (TSE Handmade).  I then got a \*\*\* TSE Automatic Pipe Rifle a week or so ago.  So not as exciting as getting my 1st TSE which is AWESOME.... but having 2 \*\*\* TSE weapons drop so close together... Makes me wonder if this is something that is more common after something like 150? or 160?
---
BTW... TSE weapons are overrated.  They break crazy fast compared to other weapons (explosive damage) and don't seem OP at all after having executioner's, bloodied, and vampire weapons. After the gimp they aren't all that awesome anymore... but they are freaking FUN.  I take mine out on mat/ore runs just because they are fun to shoot. Then go back to my heavy guns for legendary runs.
---
Where did you get it for $20? Gotta a buddy i'd like to get into it.
---
man, that be awesome! :D
---
Great sent you an invite just now
---
Is it that rare? I had a level 111 trying to buy mine from me today, I was pretty confused why he would want to buy it when it‚Äôs easy to get
---
lol every time bro!
---
I'm getting fed up of them. If they don't improve soon I'm going to stop bothering to look.
---
I still haven't found a camera.
---
Come on, don't be so extra I understand that all you want to do is talk shit and be salty nothing wrong with that...
---
Realistically i payed 17k for AAE LMG if you can do 8k maby you should be looking for TSE
---
yep would be cool to see if R was held down a radial menu appeared with ammo types of different types on it would also be cool for prime weapons since then you would be able to use normal  .45 when not fighting scorched but be able to swap to ultracite/AP/HP ETC when on your siuation calls for it
---
Nope. I‚Äôve played fallout 3, new Vegas, and fallout 4. I enjoyed all of them, except for fallout 4 but I still found it okay because of the gun play.
---
Did you find this person on the fo76 subreddit?
---
tip: go on r/Market76 to get legendaries
---
 hope that with all the comments you have taken some things away from this.  
---
The first is that people don't want caaps for high end items, they want other high end items and that "caps" amount is just a relative value  
---
The second is that the economy is shot and largely due to hyperinflation- and personally i don't' think that "caps sinks" can fix it, there needs to be a massive restriction on cap generation, i.e. printing currency-- as it is now each player has the ability to add 1400+ caps per day to the economy  
---
The last thing is that we have a very poor means of trading which causes there to be very little market information, stable markets need to have value/price information (this is literally why they have stock exchanges with strict rules on things like "insider trading")  
---
\---  
---
and just to be clear, it isn't the items being overvalued, it is the caps having no value- as example, lets day gun X is worth 5k caps today, but tomorrow there will be twice as many caps in the economy, gun X would then be worth 10k caps  
---
that is what is going on and it sucks
---
Alright i have to go now but if don't forget i could give you some useful tipps tomorrow
---
Explain to me which of those lvl 250 players don‚Äôt already have a perfect deck for their build? Tell me how mathematically and mechanically given the game system and modifiers in place this would create any sort of actual advantage? Every other MMO does this, name one where it‚Äôs caused an imbalance problem? 
---
The only arguments I see being made against this are based upon paranoia and unsubstantiated fear rather than facts, mechanics, math, or examples. Repair kits create more of an advantage than a respec does. If anything have a re-spec bot in the game where you can pay 5k caps to re-spec too if the argument is fairness of access. But that‚Äôs a different argument than fairness of advantage.
---
That would be beautiful
---
Ill answer your question anyways in case you dont want to just get the codes from the web. Each code you get front he officers is for one of 3 silos A, B, or C. each corresponds to a space on a board that slowly reveals the meaning of each at the enclave bunker. Dont worry about finding them as there is a way to track where they are at the bunker.
---
"How dare you complete our ridiculous objectives! Just give us money already!"
---
well then they need to list that in the rules then because people don't check the subreddit every day.
---
also then where am i supposed to go to trade then?
---
i've tried making trade request on 3 separate fo76 subreddits now and in every single one im getting auto removed.
---
I sell them the vendor bots too. If i can scrap them i would. Too much hassle trying to find a buyer. Wish there is an auction house option but there is none.
---
Thank you this helped
---
Damn, that's nice. 15 shots aren't just enough even for a semi-auto
---
It might as well be if you don't have a microphone. I have no way to communicate with other players unless I learn to use emotes to transmit in morse code.
---
I want those 3 *** legendary anti gravity boots
---
I grab every quantum I see. Use some for nukashine or grenades stockuung the rest to sell next week
---
Looks complicated
---
Shh! Now they're going to make all of the challenges involve 3 players or more.
---
Well there are many subreddits dedicated to trading stuff. But you'll need to stick to the format before posting since bots will auto remove those posts
---
Is it a Quad? My quad weapons always glitch and give me a crazy amount of ammo in the magazine.
---
Almost like some people don't wanna hear constant complaints about something. Your freedom to complain only extends so far as someone else's freedom to not want to hear it, friend.
---
Why do they go for that much now?  I've been out of the game since they nerfed the exploding damage to make TSE's mostly useless and back to melee 4 lyfe.  Did they buff exploding damage again or something to make them go for &gt; 10K?
---
I agree with this. My Scattered Laser Rifle shot 4 additional shots and even with it at 200% durability, it loses durability extremely fast.
---
I‚Äôm going to splatter my entire camp with Mr. Fuzzies!! =(^o.o^)=
---
Imagine getting upset enough about people dogpiling a shit game go outside and I dont mean outside of your home in fo76
---
Oh god, now I want to see what the ones that are sticking through the dirt look like from the "other" side.
---
Well a bloodied explosive gun is the top tier right now, and just since its so easy to earn caps in the game, people will only sell them that high, if at all, most of the time people want only trades in either top tier armor or weapons
---
The community is pretty nice , so if you ever need stuff If your under rank 20 , someone will give it to you.
---
Don‚Äôt rush the campaign 
---
Don‚Äôt play survival until you have really good stuff , for then just play on adventure 
---
Scrap your weapons 
---
Build your camp in a place with a junk pile 
---
Know that the first couple of quests can be slightly tedious , but after the responders quests the games very fun.
---
Level 206 here, got 5 or 6 two-shot weapons but never got an explosive weapon.
---
ive been sticking to the format but for some reason my posts are still getting auto removed, not to mention every time it happens i have to wait a longer and longer time before trying again.
---
i've tried to contact the mods on these subs but i either get angry response essentially telling me to f off or i don't get a response at all.
---
i had my best luck at trading on the few rare occasions i try, here on this sub.
---
Because we have no idea what's going to happen when we tune in. I mean, if I tune in to Hunter/Hunted, does that automatically enroll me in the hunt? what happens?
---
Am I now marked like on survival ? How do I know when somenone is coming for me? Who is the hunter and who is the hunted, are we just hunting each other? I have no freaking idea
---
looks kinda trashy too
---
I don't think there is a "best" place. It's wherever you like being.
---
It‚Äôs because it activate its stealth boy mode when it dies for some reason when it dies now
---
There's (so far) useless regular tokens spread around the map. For example at the monorail elevator. These are not to be confused with the mr fuzzy tokens, miner claim tokens, or future scrip tokens.
---
Well what you saw was backlash at repair kits
---
You can always fast travel to vault 76, your camp, and owned workshops for free. 
---
This is especially useful if your camp is on a different side of the map as the vault, as you can make fast traveling signifantly cheaper if somewhere is closer to one of those locations than where you are.
---
West Tek used to be shit farming for maybe 1 3\* a run thru compared to WS.  I haven't been in the game since the TSE nerf hit as it got boring going back to melee all the time, but dang... did they totally cut down white springs?  Would always get at least 5+ 3\* easily with about an 45m-hour run in WS...
---
he was though by people who have  taken a dislike to him for no reason that i can discern
---
Type in tips in the search bar.
---
What the absolute fuck
---
Just south of West Tek Research Center where I placed my marker.
---
I have my C.A.M.P. near so I sometimes see Mothmen and Flatwoods Monsters standing there on the edge of a little cliff.
---
[https://imgur.com/uNjkglx](https://imgur.com/uNjkglx)
---
Was thinking about it but I just use them for when I'm farming different types of ammo.
---
the first is just a case of people not being able to change according to the internet while the rest seem to be false  as i havent seen any proof about it and when asked no one has delivered anything other than a video that is got many errors/falsehoods
---
Robot hookers like in New Vegas. No wait. That should be on the ‚Äúshould‚Äù list.
---
Hype is as hype does. They're not worth that much except people have hyped them beyond belief because it's *meta*.
---
I would say don't do workshops. If you do be prepared to be griefed anywhere anytime.
---
Best til right here is BE CARRFUL CHOOSING SPECIALS AND PERKS you're gonna want to build your guy a certain way. and it's reversible but a pain in the ass to start like I did kinda putting points wherever I felt like it and later on wanting a bunch of perks I didn't take earlier cuz I didn't know how to build my character. It's not that easy to play multiple weapon types and stuff until a high level, which is what I'm used to doing in fallout games from the start.
---
I have only gotten 1 TSE my entire 300+ hours of gameplay and it just so happens to be a Furious Two Shot esplosive that does more damage every hit. Got lucky on the drop and the effect but would KILL for TSE Shotgun since they seem the most viable for tough boss enemies
---
Please forgive the upcoming book below, but this has been something that has bothered me for quite awhile....
---
I constantly watch the 76 trading Reddits. And I mean constantly, like to the point of addiction. I really enjoy seeing what people have, what they go for, etc. I also like seeing if I can find a cool gun or piece of armor or plan that I‚Äôd like to use.
---
I do not have a ‚Äúmule‚Äù, and I won‚Äôt. If I can‚Äôt buy something with caps, or caps and something that I have on my character, then I figure I don‚Äôt need it.
---
The thing that has gotten to me is that I could give you, right now, the names of probably 3-5 people who will tell you (because I‚Äôve seen it) that caps mean nothing to them. They only want trades. Some have begun to trade consumable items (ammo, recipes, etc.) that they have for high tier items. They have ‚Äú100s of items across 42 mules‚Äù (exaggeration, I know). These people will basically tell you to go eff yourself when you try to do business with them if you don‚Äôt have the extraordinarily rare item or high tier items. Or, they will charge you massive prices. I then see these same people lowball bidding with others for items (for caps, nonetheless), when ‚Äúcaps mean nothing to me‚Äù. See the double standard there?
---
This person who is hoarding those 100s of times across numerous mules, for what? They‚Äôre never going to use those items, and the items are lost to those that could use them. The circle of people that have things that are tradable usually seems pretty small. Eventually when you have each and every rare weapon, and 10 sets of sentinel/unyielding/cavalier armor, what are you going to do with it?
---
So, in the end, the little guy is locked out of any hope of getting one of these high tier items unless they somehow parlay smaller items into something else that is tradable, or they get a lucky drop from the RNG.
---
I posted the comments below to one of these people when they put out a post explaining how things were, and why his way was just the way it was and we had to deal with it. After my comments got a boatload of upvotes, he decided to delete his post. There is just a double standard with things at times.
---
-‚Äî My prior response to a ‚Äúbig dog‚Äù trader
---
I understand that caps mean nothing to you, and to lots of others here. I get it. I also understand that, just like me, you have certain items you would like to have. I get it. I also understand that you have grinded to find what you have, or have bought or traded for what you have. I get it. I also understand that it‚Äôs your stuff and you can do what you want with it. I get it. I have no hard feelings towards anyone.
---
What bothers me, or what is sometimes annoying, is that I see the same few people on here over and over with boatloads of items, wanting to trade for that ‚Äúone thing‚Äù or one set of armor, or whatever. I know these people are sitting on 5 mules worth of armor and weapons that someone else could use, that are just being wasted. It also bothers me that some of these same people, when you try to talk to them, come off as arrogant, or better than you, or whatever. Just because you (general you, not you personally) have 5 mules worth of awesome stuff that everyone wants, doesn‚Äôt make you better or more cool, or able to talk to me like I am beneath you.
---
I‚Äôm not looking for much. One or two melee weapons, and a set of Vanguard heavy robot armor. I just want to be able to play and survive some of the bigger enemies. I don‚Äôt care about sentinels, or assassins, or cavalier, or unyielding, or any of the other things like that. So when I see one melee weapon I could really use on this guy‚Äôs list of 200 things he is hoarding for that one piece of armor, and when he blows me off like I‚Äôm pond scum, it gets annoying. That ONE melee weapon that he has been re-advertising for months that he won‚Äôt let go of, in hopes that it‚Äôs going to make a difference to get that armor piece or super-fab Tesla rifle or whatever. I doubt it.
---
So, I get what the ‚Äúbig dogs‚Äù are doing, and I understand that having this stuff gives you bargaining power. That‚Äôs the way it is. I honestly really hope that when the legendary vendor is introduced it takes some of the air out of what this economy has turned into.
---
Better off just selling to a vendor, people on here probably wouldn't pay anything decent for it. Not a reflection on you or the loot, more a reflection on the players.
---
How is this not safe for work?
---
Is there a rarity pool amongst weapons and effects. I have countless chameleon wood legs but I have never heard of Calvary armor until last week when I looked on r/Market76.
---
Nice. Love how open it is.
---
Hey, Thanks for the genuine response, I can understand your PoV, still personally loved it though
---
&gt;The large majority of people will never, ever change their views on the game beyond their opinions of the game at launch.
---
I can't say as I blame them. It's been one hell of a freaking ride. I am NOT good with math but I did try to figure out how much time I actually spend playing and how much time I spent trying to play. Not that long ago it was like, for every hour I was in the game I was spending approximately 12-15 minutes not playing because I was stuck in a loading screen/stuck in my PA and trying to get out, etc. It's gotten better but the loading screens and crashes and disconnects are brutal. They happen at the most inopportune times. IF I DIDN'T have plenty of time to play I'd be pretty pissed most of the time... disconnecting right at crucial moments , lag in the silos, glitched quests, you name it. It's a buggy mess. 
---
If I didn't love the people I play with so much, (I do, despite my curmudgeonly ways) I would have quit this thing right after BETA when I threw my damn mouse across the room and broke it after disconnecting right after putting in the code at the silo. UGH !
---
I'm high level now and that stuff doesn't phase me but I remember what it's like to be low level and having to restart the silo after scavening for days to get the bullets and stims needed for a silo run... it's really difficult for some people. And to get disconnected after all that, it was such a harsh thing. I don't blame anyone for quitting and not coming or looking back. 
---
I still play all the time and love it to pieces but it's been HARD and there's still so much crap that needs to be fixed! Jesus christ
---
while it isn't nice to see this stuff some of it rings true with repair kits and such. and this could have been averted if Bethesda didn't decide sticking their dick in a blender of bad ideas was the correct course of action.
---
Same here, level 172 and have never had an explosive gun drop.
---
Unfortunately it's purely RNG. I got BOS T60 Knight Paint after like 5, took about 30 for my partner to get it.
---
Or people that enjoy playing the economy game.
---
This is now legacy weapon with huge price.
---
Stay out of the skooma.
---
Griefers so gonna abuse this to hell... killing self while holding 1 wood scraps and wait for someone to bite the bait. Second you pick up that wood scrap, 3 griefers jump on you out of nowhere and it's gangbang time
---
No that's a horrible idea for something that should be more of a prestige feature already in the game. No no no
---
from my testing it involves lag spike when reloading then swapping weapons had this issue with my dragon and Gatling gun
---
Yesterday i got one explosive single action revolver there too. Yay! Bad thing is, that first modifier is Quad. You have to reload 24bullets. Lol
---
&gt;Craft *different types of* alcohol (25)
---
FTFY
---
Those 250+ players have the perfect build already because they have spent TIME and EFFORT learning, grinding and playing the game. They probably have their second or third accounts already perfected or on the way to being perfect. Why would anyone who is putting in enough time into the game feel the need to pay for a re-spec? 
---
I don't know how you want me to break it down for you besides if you need to pay to catchup with the atomic shop, its P2W. If you can just pay to re-spec instantly while another player is slowlying moving a point over at a time or maxing out perk cards, that is an advantage 
---
If your build is already perfect or amazing, why would you want to re-spec? If you want to another build, why not just start up a new character? Theres a reason we have 5 character slots, so we can do different builds without having this issue. People only use miules for storing items and caps, if they have been using them properly and playing with different themes or builds, this wouldn't be an issue 
---
You say that no one is bringing up any real arguments, neither are you. Saying it is common in other games isnt really a defence, nor have you mentioned some games with that kind of ability in their shops. How do you know those havent affected the game balance? Are you a game developer with insider info?
---
Trade completed. Enjoy your new mutations!
---
No one-star weapons go for anywhere near that. They're simply too easy to find when farming legendaries. Even after the cap trading patch it's more like 3-4k max for the most popular one-stars.
---
BE, sure. You're lucky if you can find someone who will trade caps for those.
---
can reccomend one of the junk piles along the river in the forest  on the west side of the map flatwoods vendor isnt too far a jog from their
---
Anything paid for that gives an ingame advantage.
---
Yea gotta be practical. I originally experimented with the idea of walls, but it just felt so claustrophobic I decided it was easier to go without. I raised the roof in the upstairs to make more space, and also lights from a height give off a really neat effect.
---
Assume.
---
The.

Position.
---
Thank you very much for the help, after redosnloading the game twice i finally fixed it because of you, have a great day!
---
Hey hokatu do you still do crafting service? I'm on xbox and I'm needing ultracite calibrated shocks.  If I get mats would you be willing to help me out?
---
I actually really like this idea and would be all for it.
---
I have picked up a couple of TSEs along the way since BETA but they are long gone now. They were legacy weapons and I gave them away. I still have a TSE Cryolater and a TSE Tesla though. Keeping those.
---
The TSE handmade I had was definitely duped. It was before we knew about duping and this guy was roaming around and giving people TSE handmades and X01 jet packs before we even knew they existed in game. I took one of each. I got rid of both not too long ago, afraid I'd get in trouble haha.
---
Am I late :'(
---
From what I have read there was a Hiring Spree so that might have been required too. Over that I kinda suspect that the 'Canvas' Bag is still delayed because they are still processing the skin of entire the Marketing team.
---
SSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
---
Paying real money to swap from a full melee build to a rifleman build everytime you go to fight the queen, or encounter a scorchbeast in general, absolutely gives you an advantage over people who dont spend real money.
---
Once you have all the perk cards you want xp is largely meaningless so you could swap all your SPECIAL points in and out of intelligence when you go to craft something, similarly charisma is only really useful when on a team or buying expensive plans/recipes. In both of these examples being able to swap those SPECIAL points in and out instantly gives you an advantage over people who need to make a build and stick with it.
---
Yeah. That sub is the most toxic. This sub gets pretty toxic. Become a Filthy Casual today!

Send them a message, use emotes to say hello, follow, trade, fight, help. This is what I did for about 3 months until I got a mic.
---
What makes you say that?

How's explosive effect work on a weapon that's already explosive?
---
Maybe don't take dead people's bags and you won't get trapped.

Silly little fish.

I unsubbed from there when I made a bit of a joke and it got -74 points, so I called them snowflakes and it got to -300 points, anybody who recognised it was a joke also got downvoted to crazy numbers
---
New Vegas was literally unplayable on PC for 6 fucking months after launch, crashing to desktop before you could even play it.  
---
But oh no, it's the best Fallout ever made!
---
I usually sell all my bulk mats to the vendor bots and forget to sell my legendaries so I give them to friends to sell, OR I leave them all in the cash register at WS
---
Np dude, i'm glad it worked. 
---
That being said i'm not sure if it was worth giving me gold for that. Thank you very much :)
---
The player base has asked for pre-set perk card loadouts so that we can quickly bounce from bring a crafter to a fighter or explorer.
---
I have never seen the base ask for re-specing especially in terms of re-specing from the atomic shop. That isnt cosmetic and will eventually led to minor advantages no matter how you see it just like the repair kits
---
Done that!! It sucks!
---
turn on pacifist mode
---
&gt;  Only go past that value for some legacy energy TSE.
---
Lol if you can find someone to sell you a legacy energy TSE for caps... any amount of caps, it's worth it. Caps are primarily useless in the game, trade is mostly a barter system. Caps are used for the little things like ammo, serums, mods, chems and scrap.
---
&gt; I don't have and i'll never own any mules. It's a freaking game not a job, i'm not trying to be the richest bestest or whatever in Fallout76. I just want to have fun.
---
Same, I'm a self found player, I farm up my own gear. I give stuff away on here occasionally when I see someone down on their luck or who got ripped off. I've bought serums to help get alts started but that's about it. I've also been given some items when I was down on my luck. I had a bloodied gatling gun disappear from a bug and someone gave me an AA gatling gun to replace it.
---
It took me about 7 hops at Wavy Willard‚Äôs to find him. That seems to be the best spot since he appears right in front of where you spawn in.
---
I feel as if there still really isn‚Äôt a lot to in game, like the limited number of quests is really noticeable and it‚Äôs a real grind trying to level up last 50
---
Very well thought out. Would love to see content like this. Cap sink, several QOL improvements, pretty expensive to max out and doesn't require server hopping
---
I like the punch bowl you've place on the alter looking like shelf. 
---
I imagine it's a bowl for holy water or donation, just thinking it is filled with booze gave me a good laugh:)
---
If you are going on survival mode travel with light when it comes to aid. Otherwise you will lose loads x

making a camp close enought to the substations will allow you to wire up to the power boxes there most works shops in each area also have power box for that regions power plant
---
Cryolator makes the body glow blue.
---
Are you saying none of the stuff documented in the video happened?
---
Got one with a level 20 character and found a few garbage ones on my 157.
---
That pretty well is a god tier gun. My bloodied lever action (that I found) is a lvl 35 and it shoots exactly as hard as my bloodied hunting rifle... it just also shoots much faster.
---
For one shotting the nastiest of baddies, I'll stick to my instigating dragon.
---
Thormund is so sad about this
---
Yep. There‚Äôs still at least 140k caps that will be removed from the economy on my end, that‚Äôs mostly coming from players since I make my caps from selling ammo.
---
WHAT! If this works.... I'm hurting on screws.... I need wendigo's to kill for screws.... you post... I realize I have a clown outfit in my stashbox from January stored intended to complete this quest.... THANK YOU KIND STRANGER....
---
Those dudes need some people to compete against, I mean thats why bethesda  added the vending machine to regulate prices . If you find same rubbish but cheaper  in other place .
---
I honestly dont see all that much difference in endings, FO3 you are either starting the purifier with or without the added virus, and its either you or someone else starting it, New Vegas you are taking the dam from either the east or west side, then the only difference if who speaks to you at the end
---
Damn that must be amazing for you irl to see your characters progression!
---
can you tell if it's a dead people's bag? don't they all show up as paper bags?
---
I agree, the fallout sub is fairly adamant about 76 being ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù so you won‚Äôt get any real opinions there. I‚Äôd compare this sub to a sports team fan, this sub will cheer on those behind 76 when it does a great job but will criticize their decisions if they aren‚Äôt the best. You can see this by looking at the sub after content updates (cheering them on so long as the content update doesn‚Äôt have any glaring issues) and recently with the decision to add repair kits to the atomic shop (criticizing their decisions).
---
If it helps you make your decision any easier I‚Äôd say wait until the game goes on sale again, for $40 this game is definitely worth it considering you‚Äôre getting updates to it for (at least) until the end of this year, while $60 feels like it may be just a bit too much if you‚Äôre on the edge since there are still some bugs/stability issues that can be obnoxious and affect gameplay negatively. If you‚Äôre used to the normal amount of bugs in a Bethesda game then right now I‚Äôd have to say you‚Äôd be playing a normal Bethesda game (as far as my experiences in game have been), but I‚Äôd check out a few other threads/videos to get a wider range of opinions on the game.
---
*laughs then cries in 2h melee*
---
They probably can't afford the game or internet to play it so now they are probably one of the people at MCDONALDS on reddit being toxic.
---
I agree. Even considering all the bugs, the fact they got the engine working with multiplayer and fairly stable is impressive. Another 6 months to polish up bugs and add additional story could‚Äôve made this game a massive success (not that it‚Äôs a failure, but launch would‚Äôve been a lot smoother)
---
8k for a 3 star weapon is cheap. I've seen 1 star weapons sell for more.
---
&gt; they are 
---
And you know this how?
---
This is great. Helpful lovable characters go a long way in Appalachia :)
---
Well camps are about to be indestructible. Hopefully when they do that they change the zoning for it.
---
I think it depends if someone wants to buy a gun I like I raise the price to a high amount so they can‚Äôt afford it
---
Eh, I hope I don't cross paths with Alex üò∞
---
Why would they make camps invincible? That defeats the purpose of defenses
---

How do I send someone a message? I use the hello emote.

1700 hours, 1 Tse Drop. Although I‚Äôve had a few god roll drops and a fair number of drops that are damn close to god roll and are worth tons.

Also bought tons of the god roll dupes so I guess that‚Äôs nice.
---
Snallygasters count for the photo challenge and are in Charleston near the dmv.

Well good luck because I'm pretty sure camps are about to be indestructible so you want be able to do anything about it.

In-game menu where you join teams &gt; Player name &gt; Send message
---
They're very good to have. Besides being used in crafting, it heals for a ton (especially with Cola Nut, which triples the base effect) and heals pretty fast too. The AP boost is also relevant depending on your build. One of the best aid items in the game.
---
I have lvl 90, 80, 78 and 46 toons, I've only had like 5 explosive weapons drop, none of them TSE. One of them was legacy though, but I got rid of it before they were rare. For some reason almost all of them have been berserkers explosive. I fucking hate berserkers. I have a berserkers explosive western revolver and combat rifle... cant decide if they're worth keeping or not.
---
Just as the other person said. It is a hard crash. Most of the time it crashes to the PS4 home menu. Other times it has crashed so hard it freeze the ps4. So I doubt it is the internet.
---
Sure it can.  
---
New Vegas was literally unplayable, crashing on startup for 6 months on PC for most people.  
---
Until the first/second DLC on consoles save files would regularly corrupt and lose all progress.  
---
Not to mention that the save files on console would cause the game to slow down and get sluggish the more you saved.  
---
Since FO76 was actually playable on launch, I'd say Outerworlds has a pretty high bar to reach for.
---
that's very reductive
---
Bloodied paired with explosive or vats crit.
---
Wow
---
üëçüëçüëç totally agree it's basically getting a bot to play for you. Put some effort in for your XP.
---
Oh, one day it'll happen. You'll get your medics/explosive weapon just like the rest of us plebs...
---
You can buy them from vendors npcs for about 60 or so caps, so I wouldn't charge more than that.
---
this is terrible logic right here
---
Lighthouse near vault 76.
---
Feels bad, had a bloodied lever action drop and I shit my pants in happiness... until I saw it was lvl 35. Then it was too late, my pants were already soiled.
---
Wait can I use a dark with some whiskey and get 12 str? If I have both cards maxed?
---
Yes I know they are ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Oh well maybe if enough of us moan they will make the bracket bigger around the golf club so people can‚Äôt place there camp.
---
Thankfully servers aren‚Äôt that big of an issue. It is just that the games crashes to PS4 home menu or freezes the system, and it is insanely frustrating when the game crashes when I am about to search the body of a legendary enemy and the game crashes.
---
PVSSY ? ü§î what could this word be ?lol
---
Yup! If you can‚Äôt roam around, exploring and enjoy earning your XP you probably shouldn‚Äôt be playing fallout üòÇüòÇ
---
That is your opinion and I respect that sir.
---
You were supposed to get the duped stuff.  They will allow duping again soon as the player base dwindles.
---
Trying carrying around a few of your TS and E weapons, and use relevant perks like Demo Expert.
---
We don't have hard numbers, but people have done testing that seems to indicate a "smartloot" system that cares about the items and perks you already have.
---
I only mentioned it because you mentioned wanting to destroy the turrents. üíÅ
---
Ackshually, it'sh called HENTAI and it ish ART
---
Its all about the SCREWS REEEEEEEE
---
Oh sorry dude! I didn‚Äôt mean anything bad. You literally just reminded me. It‚Äôs a bit early need a coffee üòÇü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I mean that's still gonna hit like a truck, but not nearly as good as it could be.
---
You died, you lost something.
---
Here‚Äôs 3 main reasons for it:
---
1) You get to level 50 and have made a (insert weapon A) build. You find an amazing super rare three star (insert weapon B). You want to change to a (insert weapon B) build. 
---
2) You‚Äôve spent hundreds of hours perfecting your character. The weapon your build is based around gets nerfed and now your build sucks. Should you have to spend another hundred hours changing it? The game has already lost a ton of players because of this. 
---
3) You‚Äôre a casual player you work a lot. You have a family, you can‚Äôt dedicate the amount of time other players can to the game. Maybe you can only play a few hours a week. It would seriously  take you months to respec/make a new character. 
---
To your other question every MMO game has forums/subreddits/sites etc dedicated to it with player based just as dedicated as this one and sometimes much larger. If this had ever created imbalance there would have been an uprising on those games from the player base. Elder Scrolls Online is a perfect example of this. They have offered character re-spec through their crown store for years and it‚Äôs never created a problem. 
---
Really it comes down to this; the people who have time to dedicate to the game won‚Äôt need this option. They have time to level up repeatedly to get to where they want to be or to have 3-5 different characters. They won‚Äôt need or use this option. Or if they do let‚Äôs be honest it‚Äôs not that hard to earn 1,000 atoms or less in game without buying them. I‚Äôve probably earned at least 5,000 if not more without buying them at all.
---
Additionally I am bringing up real arguments.  I‚Äôve cited in previous posts the game mechanics, how  builds work, what builds are actually based around, and the mitigation system backing up my statement that a respec won‚Äôt create an advantage for anyone. Everyone arguing against me are just ignoring those things, hurling insults, or are just making statements based upon fear. 
---
Me: idea, here‚Äôs how it won‚Äôt create an advantage based on game mechanics. Mitigation, how builds work etc. also here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs needed.
---
Response from most ranges from: You‚Äôre idea is crap because muh cosmetics only, it‚Äôs pay to win because I say it is, you‚Äôre an idiot, or I don‚Äôt care I just don‚Äôt like it.
---
It's cool. i agree with you in any case and used to nuke turret platforms like those with artillery when my base used to be closer.
---
That would happen if instead of reloading my Tesla I swapped to a Gatling laser gun with 500 rounds per core.  Swapping back sometimes would give me the 500 rounds into my Tesla.  But it‚Äôs a bug so it‚Äôs random.  Happens less often than before
---
It's also somewhere in the Citadel. I don't know where, haven't played 3 in ages.
---
I'm so glad! ....I was a little worried with the price of it but the quality I felt was worth it.
---
Those are fairly common tbh
---
At least the rest of the game was in a solid state, and people still replay it constantly. I can't see myself ever playing through Fo76's main storyline again.
---
Players won't be able to destroy them, NPCs I believe will still be able to.
---
Love that. Wish more people used artillery, in survival it would be fun to set up camps and fire them at each other! üòÇ
---
More ways to dupe
---
If having an open world is what makes a game good to this sub I see why you all find FO76 so enjoyable. What low standards to have.
---
Pay to- oops too late.
---
More seriously, i personally hope they do not add a BR mode. I don't have anything against BR games, but it's pretty clear that the overwhelming majority of 76 players aren't here for PvP. A BR mode would be a waste, *because* it'd be devoting resources to something most players have no interest in.
---
My main is at 81 and my alt is sitting near 20.
---
I dont think having in open world makes a game good
---
Just adding to the thread more so than replying to you. I realized it came off as that
---
ah ok gotcha no harm no foul
---
is hunter hunted a thing? while i played this game i never once was able to get a single person to fight me on that damn channel...
---
Well, Obsidian is making it, so it's about a 50/50 chance it'll be a flaming dumpster fire on launch that makes 76 look good in comparison.
---
This is the first really good and constructive argument against this idea I‚Äôve seen on here backed up by actual example. Thank you for that. My question would be though; who is really going to sit there and re-spec an entire character burning through atoms like that just to fight a scorch beast or a queen who really doesn‚Äôt give you much as it stands now? I definitely get your argument here, I‚Äôm just not seeing what the real point would be of doing something that time consuming over a minor event in the game. I have to think the amount of people willing to blow 1k atoms and spend 15 minutes on a rebuild to make killing a scorchbeast easier would be very, very few.
---
The main sub is toxic. This place strikes a good balance of criticism, player support, and community. 
---
As far as the ‚Äúfilthy casuals‚Äù sub goes though, they can go straight up fuck themselves. More often than not they‚Äôre just smug assholes that do everything they can to plug their sub, and insta-ban anyone that doesn‚Äôt goose step with the creepy smiley faces circle jerk of praise.
---
I want real discussion, not extreme idiocy ends of the spectrum.
---
two fold: one to make fun of the losers who still play the worst game of 2018/9 and then complain about it.  two to see if there is a market to continue selling duped items for real world money... i mean it only made me enough to buy a harley before the market kinda tanked and the chinese took it over... but oh well.
---
It‚Äôs not a superiority complex, they‚Äôre two different games.
---
This sub is nothing but a naive love circle jerk about the game.
---
Really, the only thing Obsidian has is good writers: Their writers are great.
---
They're *not* a good development studio(for larger projects anyway), and their track record shows this.
---
Did you really just try to knock a video for having 3 second clips of people you don‚Äôt like?
---
In your head rent free huh?
---
If they released it as "early access" everything would have been different too.
---
Brilliant cheers, I‚Äôll give that a go
---
If I happen to have legendaries I don't care about, ie junk 1 stars. I usually drop junk 1 stars on the spot though, and that's only when I accidentally pick them up.
---
Everything else I make as light as possible then mule off pretty regularly.
---
Put your camp on an ore spot near vault 96
---
I‚Äôve talked to a lot of people who have wanted this for a very long time since the end of beta. They may not be the vocal minority but many, many people want a re-spec option. As I‚Äôve said and explained in other posts on here it really doesn‚Äôt lead to any tangible advantage when you factor in mechanics. The PvP mitigation system, and what builds are based around.
---
The BETA (actually just a demo) was two weeks before launch.
---
&gt;you are going to have players who buy things at exorbitant prices
---
This is exactly what happens on the Fo76 trading Discords, as most players don't know *how much* weapons/armor are worth. The seller asks you to *PM them an Offer* and refuses to set a price, hoping there's somebody who will offer them way more than its worth. There are other sellers who just set their prices way too high for the same reason, *buyer ignorance*. This is why there are always loads of players posting on the *price check* channel as they really have no idea what their weapons/armor are worth. Usually sellers underestimate its value, and dealers will snap it up cheap, then resell much higher. However, if you could see the amount that for example a 100 other people were actually selling that weapon for (the knowledge that the savvy dealers have) then they know what the ballpark price should be for it. This is the price that the market, as a whole, determines it to be. Adding a 10% tax to player trades is really not going to make any significant difference to prices. The variability of prices (due to the above factors) will most likely be a lot more than 10% anyway.
---
God help TES.
---
It‚Äôs not always clear if it‚Äôs a death bag or a ‚Äòdropped some crap to get under weight‚Äô bag
---
All my TSEs are purchased from the market
---
But I do have a few great weapons drop on me:
---
* Mutant's Explosive Handmade
---
* Troubleshooter's Explosive Double Barrel
---
* Anti-armour Limb Crippling Gamma Gun
---
It‚Äôs a grind past level 10. I don‚Äôt remember a single quest (if you want to call them that) other than leaving the vault that I completed since I quit playing.
---
I agree hope they make whitesprings off limits entirely sry but it's a good players hub.... Exp, trade, outerwall PvP maybe it's future never can tell...
---
I'm fairly certain most were duped from the dev room. So many out there and such a rare rng roll.
---
It was definitely a failure of a launch. To tell yourself otherwise is lying to yourself. Sure they made $$$ but in doing so they pissed away all community goodwill and damaged one of their biggest cash-cows of a franchise.
---
What's the difference between a brown paper bag full of purposefully dropped junk and junk dropped by death?  How is a random to know one versus the other?
---
About 900 hours in, 3000 loot drops, did not get a TSE anything. I get Two Shots semi regularly (1:80) and Explosives rarely (1:185).
---
The uniform chance is 25% (chance of ranged) \* 4.3% (chance of Two shot) \* 14.7% (chance of explosive) =&gt; 0.158% or 1:633. Having a 2-3\* enemy drop 2-3\* is about 15% so 1:4220. So in about every 4220 legendaries killed, you may see a TSE weapon.
---
Honestly, I'd be fine with just 1\* legendary Handmades, which I get 1:115; it is two days of intensive Whitesprings farming and half the chance for a less than max level unless I go nuclear.
---
I'm not that unlucky (in terms of effect combination) as I got a Bloodied Explosive 90% reduced weight Gatling Gun from a 3\* Watoga Protectron pre patch 8 and bought a Bloodied Explosive LMG from a Whitesprings Vendor (overrepaired so it could have been an accidental sale).
---
Keep the punches flying if it means we don‚Äôt get Fallout 76-2.
---
Hm eventually whitesprings will have a dlc not allowing people to camp there.
---
If you want to see someone actually trying to use one on ghouls, it‚Äôs about as bad as you‚Äôd think it would be.
---
https://youtu.be/U4M5ORi53PY
---
I‚Äôm fair usually with my guns, I solve a furious mini gun that had better reload and another effect I forgot for 500 caps, I was happy with that. I had another dude selling me serums for either 150 shotgun shells for caps. Reasonable fellow. A TSE is reasonable for around 3-5k depending on the weapon and I reckon 5k should be the most for better weapons. Kinda same with bloodied tho I‚Äôd do less. Maybe around 2-3k caps depending on it. It‚Äôs real crazy to see people willing to charge that much so that they can farm more legendaries
---
76 had a way worse launch than Anthem but go on.
---
I'm a 127 and have only seen one 10mm explosive at level 10......  I feel ya.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to get a nuka grape when you‚Äôre there. 400 rads gone, health regen and no rush of losing mutations- it‚Äôs perfect for a quick dose in a rad zone
---
Never trust a drink or warm towel from the internet.
---
They‚Äôre are trying to promote survival mode or just PvE in general me as a chaotic good sort of play through I don‚Äôt mind it but each to there own .
---
This old news.. people are still bitching about this lol?
---
They‚Äôre is an unofficial mod for it but most don‚Äôt use that so I strongly agree and approve this message
---
So it‚Äôs shipped?...
---
Level 136 here, have a AAE LMG and EE .44 drop but that‚Äôs it :(
---
SCP-096.
---
&gt;your real life identity is tied to the Fallout brand.
---
I‚Äôve never seen words more accurate to describe about 70% of this sub. It‚Äôs like if you criticize the game in any way you‚Äôre attacking them personally. Has to be a mental illness.
---
Gt?
---
Well, since you're the only that followed up it's yours if you want it.
---
Oh man, I had some help from a guy, thanks for the help otherwise thoug
---
Np
---
Like?
---
Yeah I'd love to see this implemented. It'd be nice to have another way to communicate since some don't use mics, have voice chat off, etc. Sometimes I feel alone in the game and I don't always want to be. It'd be cool to try to group up with people
---
I‚Äôm sure he will miss you dearly
---
If it is they ain't told me
---
lol so many butthurts itt
---
He did, her joked about it being a 50gb day one patch but didnt clarify.
---
Seems that ammo and aid drops are your most common, outfits less do and PA paint even less than both. But it does seem to be at random. I rapidly got Knight and then Knight Capt. but then it was ages before I got another paint plan. I have outfits up to my eyes from all the times I've done this quest, which is nice but also a bit annoying as I have no use for multiples except sell them. Stimpaks are always welcome though.
---
I agree, as a high level with a unyielding/ low health build you can easily 1 or 2 shot a death claw, they are rarely ever an inconvenience but even then that‚Äôs only if I‚Äôve gone and screwed up my perk cards..
---
It‚Äôs alright to like a shitty game
---
Use one handed and unarmed punch attacks in the strength category
---
Its pretty close though.
---
vendors have 1400 caps every day, people who hoard stuff (usually aid, junk, bad legendaries, and enemy weapons) can easily get that daily 1.4k which doesnt even include other sources of caps (e.g events, selling items to players).
---
also a good long-term investment is buying a serum recipe. one serum recipe costs around 19k, each serum sells for 500 at vendors, all you need to do is nuke an area and farm it about once a week and you have both enough materials to craft serums and other valuable items you can vendor...
---
Fallout 76 fanboys are just salty
---
Ha, that's pretty brilliant conceptually.
---
at release it was a cluster fuck right right now thought its on the meh to slightly above OK status.
---
the new updates though are great when its not adding new crashes/exploits .
---
overall my biggest issue is once your done with the main quest all you have is to wander around and kill legendary enemies
---
New challenge: do an emote while camera is equipped and take a picture of a player doing the same but going in the opposite direction.
---
1) getting one super rare item should not completely change your build and if it does well maybe re-specing instantly for atoms isnt the best option as you dont know for sure if you will like it or not in terms of the gun/armour/build and if you wanted to build off of that one suoee raee item, wouldn't you want more time to understand it and see how it benefits instead of rushing to spend 1000 atoms for that re-spec to see the benefits
---
2) every game meta has to be consistently changed for balance, if nothing is fixed, the broken or OP builds will continue to ruin the game I.e. TS and E before the nerf. If you are go after meta builds, that is their fault for wanting to be the best while not understanding it will be nerfed once it gets out of hand.
---
You must have been heavily into the explosive build or now rocking bloodied and worried about a bloodied nerf. If players can instantly re-spec to accommodate for the meta change, what's the point in the meta change or adjustment? If everyone can just pay to have the best perks, the game will never be balanced and never be enjoyable for anyone
---
It's a game, does it really matter you are no longer one shotting everything? Does it matter if you spend hours getting to the meta just to have it taken from you? Tough luck, meta changes and balances happen all the time, doesnt mean people will cry about it like this
---
3) I dont even need to argue this because you are literally trying to pay to win to feel like you can keep up with the rest of the base. You are making it seem like you are the only person with a job, family and other commitments and cant put a few hours into game without having to whale your way into being the very best 
---
If ESO was such a success, why didnt they put it in fo76? Earning Atoms used to be easy, not anymore once the boose challenges started.
---
Hahaha again your point of people who have time wont need it while people who dont will is exactly why its p2w. People can pay to be at the same lvl as another, how is that not an advantage when they are grinding out 50+ lvls on several accounts when you can just snap you fingers and be thanos esssentaiilly  
---
You might have arguments but all I'm hearing is 1)I dont want to play catchup so I'll pay with atoms or money
---
2) the game will balance itself since they keep adjusting game mechanics 
---
3) an instant re-spec isnt an advantage 
---
After seeing your 3rd argument and the 2nd last paragraph on whose going to buy in or not just proves that you dont understand how this type of situation is p2w. If you dont see how trying to catch up to others with money/atoms isnt an advantage, then this isn't going anywhere and I'm done trying to reason with you
---
Really? OK, thanks.
---
nah crazy dude
---
But...that‚Äôs actually not cheap...
---
Or any open world game in general.
---
Level 125 here. I once got an explosive lgm in whitesprings but it was only level 35 and the 308 ammo is so expensive to make... And I'm totally a rifleman.
---
Another good example would be liking a movie like Star Wars The Last Jedi
---
It‚Äôs objectively bad movie but there are still people who like it.
---
People are free to like an objectively bad product
---
Turret camps outside the golf club annoy the heck out of me too but the owners of them are not getting XP for the turret kills. You can loot the body of something you kill with a turret but you don‚Äôt earn XP. I‚Äôm hoping Bethesda put a no built zone there soon, fingers crossed anyway
---
You're going in circles so this is pointless
---
Even though I too hate the turrets at the golf club I just want to pop in to say that turret-kills that the player doesn't contribute to doesn't award xp. It did in Fallout4 but thankfully not in F76, that would be crazily easy to exploit (making it even more pointless to have turrets there), you can loot what the turrets kill though.
---
Not much different here, people are stupid as shit in this sub too. I made a post about suspensions being unanswered by Bethesda and to the surprise of no one I'm downvoted. I want to get back into this game but I can't give awareness to the problem because people automatically assume that I was suspended for being a bad player.
---
One suggestion and one problem:
---
Suggestion - Free States should wear the flannel shirt and jeans. 
---
Problem  - Power armor nullifies the clothing and armor under it.
---
Not quad.

Eat shit, dickhead. I have a second account because I like to keep a lot of stuff, particularly in anticipation of trading in legendaries.
---
In my measurements, Whitesprings is a bad place to farm 2-3\* loot drops. Out of almost 500 drops there, [I got 12 2\* and 19 3\* items](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=197047020). The place is misleading as I get [about 11% 2-3\* enemies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=1570432351), but they don't drop max stars half the time.
---
Ah that was probably it for me. Putting the ammo in my stash and grabbing it again fixed the bug.
---
Someone's poor and sad.   
---
Mine isn't for hoarding caps, but who gives a shit? It's not like you can't get a key for 5 bucks online.
---
I just picked one up from a looted corpse in Whitesprings
---
Oh and I'm just a level 40!
---
True, but its using the same logic as people that argue fo3 and fo4 have shit endings, where fo4 you are blowing up eirher the institute, the airship or both
---
How the hell did you get the I-beams to snap to the sides of the walls?
---
I'm getting sick of it. I'm also a non PVP, solo for the majority part of my playing. I team up with my friend from time to time but he doesn't play that often so I solo a lot.
---
It is just kinda luck. I've got a combined level of about 350 over 4 characters, and I've picked up 4 or 5 TSE and a several other explosive guns in general, so it does happen...
---
Who else am I going to sell them to? Actual people who might want them? Pfft. Give me those 5 caps snazzy little protectron dude.
---
This is seriously the single stupidest thing Bethesda has done to this game. What kind of MMO releases WITHOUT A GOD DAMN TEXT CHAT?! Seriously...name one. I'll wait.
---
Sounds like commie bullshit but okay
---
I like this idea.  Although it seems everyone I've met, with one exception, has been pretty decent.  At least on the PC, I can't speak to other platforms.
---
I would also like to see an emergency button in the chat. Like if you're getting attacked and can't defend your camp or something, you open the chat then select an option which sends a message to every player and an event starts that's like "Assist [player name]" - whoever accepts it will then be able to fast travel to your camp and help defend it (and you won't be able to grief that person's camp if you accept)

It would make gifting things in paper bags obsolete, I drop bags of stims, Radaway, water and dog food for new players I see, I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want them to then be flagged for PVP for some griefer to be able to 1 shot them because they‚Äôre flagged and fresh out the vault. At the end of the day it‚Äôs just junk and there‚Äôs plenty more out there and it wouldn‚Äôt be worth losing the ability to gift new players and low levels with useful stuff showing them for the most part there is a great community around the game.
---
Oh right, I forgot about that. Maybe make it so that you can just slap some Faction Approved Paint on the Power Armor to make it Faction Power Armor.  
---
That way we dont leave out the power armor players entirely.  
---
Also, good idea for the Free Staters, I really didnt know what to suggest for them.
---
What I'm curious about is how would text chat work on the console though?  Seems to me it would be laborious using the controller.
---
HA HA
---
F I E R C E
---
Nope, and ur not the only one. I just found a vanguard sentinel arm at a vendor today
---
Or people that enjoy playing video games.
---
I think explosive just adds +20% damage these days
---
Yep, I have a lvl 50 bloodied hunting rifle that does the exact same damage per shot... So all in all I'm bummed it wasn't max level, still happy I got a nice rifle.
---
Hahahahaha. Defensive much?
---
HEY GUYS I FOUND THE GUY WITH TWO ACCOUNTS!
---
I believe just north of whitesprings there‚Äôs a lead deposit you can set up camp around that is just out of the typical whitesprings nuke range, that would keep you from being nuked and let you farm lead!
---
Legs all the way up griffin
---
The vast, vast, VAST majority of them are duped. The "big name" traders you see in the market subreddit were all players that were heavily involved with dupers. Any time something organic showed up on the sub, it was immediately snatched up and duped into the fucking dirt. These players spent months trading duped items that were essentially worthless for whatever was currently the flavor of the month.   
---
Market subreddit mods knew, let their friends fly under the radar, groups of dupers/traders continue to reap the benefits of absolutely destroying the economy on whatever platform they were on.
---
I thought you had to still hit the hit the enemies yourself before the turrets kill them to get the eco because where my camp sits at I had to place turrets to defend it from a spawn next to it and every time I see it kill one I don‚Äôt get exp.
---
The only legendaries at vendors are ones people have sold to them, if there aren't any legendaries on a vendor then no one must have sold any in that lobby.
---
I was given one, no idea if it was duped or not. Didnt lose it when they erased a bunch of stuff with updates, got weakened though. Still a good shotgun.
---
Where was this mentioned at?
---
New vegas is guilty of at least a good portion of what they hate 76 for.
---
That's not a bug dude. Vendors don't sell legendaries, they only sell the legendaries other people sell to the vendors. So if no players sell their legendaries to the vendors, there won't be any legendary items to buy.
---
Well here's where this all varies from player to player because my loading screens are never more then two minutes, baring one exception which was five minutes a couple of months ago. The biggest issue I have is with loot, it rarely feels like it's worth my time running events or hunting legendary creatures.
---
You literally called me pathetic for having two accounts. Yes, I am defensive.   
---
What about having two accounts makes me pathetic? I legitimately can not think of a logical argument to support that opinion, other than the fact that your lack of disposable income causes you to lash out at other individuals who can afford luxury items that you deem unnecessary.
---
Good luck :)
---
Boy is that a trick and a half. Yes it is hard, yes it is time consuming but I'll try to explain.  
---
There are two I beams, the half beam and the full beam. The full beam loves to misbehave and hates to be placed, it prefers to be snapped on. The half beam however is very open to the idea of being placed. Half beams (and full beams I guess) can be snapped to the center-edge locations of floors and foundation BUT NOT CORNERS.  
---
What you need to do is Translate ALL floor tiles where you want I-beam on the corners, by one half. Snap half beams to the center-edge points of all those floor tiles. Here's the trick, they stack, and they float. Stack them 3 high, delete the bottom two to leave only the floating I-beams at the top. Translate your floor back to it's original position and snap full beams underneath your floating beams.  
---
Congratulations, your beams are now on the corners of your floor or foundations!

Ive got nearly 1500 hours played. I have had 1 TSE drop for me. A harpoon gun after about 200ish hours. Ive not had one drop since early december. I bought a couple.
---
Not saying to witch hunt yet dropping their name without showing any proof?
---
Well they kinda did with F76 and will probably do the same TES6 and Starfield, they will be Bethesda Launcher exclusives.
---
THIS thread is no less of a fucking cess pool. Check out this [thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bklqvx/people_are_seriously_selling_items_for_3040k_caps/) Dozens of comments with multiple hundreds of upvotes shitting on people that have accumulated too many caps? There is a SERIOUS disdain in this subreddit's core community (which literally consists of people that started playing last week, and will stop playing next week) for anyone who is even moderately competent at achieving absolutely anything in this game.   
---
If this subreddit was a physical place, I would drive a fucking car bomb into it.
---
I don‚Äôt use bloodied weapons at all and I never had a TSE before the nerf. In fact I don‚Äôt even play PVP and I never play on Survival mode. So by falling back on insinuations again just proves my point in my last post. Thank you. 
---
Your argument would be valid if I was saying we should be able to buy additional perks or skills but I‚Äôm not saying that at all. How is giving anyone the ability to do a respec going to make them thanos. If someone is level 40 when they respec they are still gonna be lvl 40 afterwards. Oh crap they got rid of lead belly and took rejuvenated instead, wow game breaking OP p2w right there....I‚Äôm not trying to pay to be able to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù I‚Äôm saying there are several reasons why players would want to respect that are legitimate and not trying to gain any advantage. 
---
I think the real issue here is you refusing to even entertain the idea that it‚Äôs not p2w. At the same time you‚Äôve yet to explain through example or logic how it is p2w. Your stance is simply; it‚Äôs p2w, I don‚Äôt have to explain it, it just is because I say so. If you disagree there is something wrong with you or your trying to cheat haha.....So really you‚Äôve got no counter argument to what I‚Äôm saying. (Have you even really played another popular MMO before?) You‚Äôve got no mechanics or examples to back up your opinion. You just know you‚Äôre right because you think you have the popular opinion and you‚Äôre just insinuating things about me as a player. You keep repeating the same loops I keep disproving. That‚Äôs gonna take you far. 
---
Give me specific examples or mechanics that would make this p2w.
---
Let's be real, they aren't innocent.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I'm a level 50 and didn't even know what a TSE was until this morning lol
---
I also never found a TSE, I have 1, but that I bought from another player.......................... TSE minigun
---
Nice post! I run stealth commando but non Bloodied so it's always interesting to read another perspective.
---
Yeah, true. Bethesda has done quite a job of running the theme and aesthetic into the fucking ground.   
---
I guess the Rick and Morty stream should've been a clue.
---
Someone may have said this already, but I would think it‚Äôs no wonder that r/Fallout is mostly FO76 since it‚Äôs the latest in the franchise. Come Fallout 5 and it will be flooding it just the same.
---
I know this is a joke, but I think many people are taking it seriously and this post will most likely get downvoted to hell
---
What happens when you hit the cap limit and still have stuff for sale in your vendor and people buy stuff? Where do those caps go? When you do hit the limit do people get locked out of your vendor, does the vendor hold the extra caps?
---
Yeah, too bad we can't all have Stockholm syndrome like you guys have :D
---
It's not like he has a go at people who enjoy the game. Just how Bethesda made a total mess of the launch really.
---
And they already contact bethesda
---
I‚Äôm waiting for you to make an argument based upon actual example or mechanics. Other than just saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs p2w because I say it is and if you don‚Äôt think it is there is something wrong with you.‚Äù I‚Äôve given you examples and mechanics of how it‚Äôs not p2w, give me some on how it is. I‚Äôm 100% willing to be proven wrong. But give me specific examples. Like an actual scenario of how someone would exploit this in game. Not just general statements.
---
Love my gilded, use it frequently for random screenshots. Should look pretty good with the Black/Gold Nuka power armor.
---
Haha I built my camp overlooking that crater
---
I had just thought about this the other day and was wondering if anyone had heard or received any info. Please keep us updated, I am curious as to the outcome.
---
Because at the top end of the game caps are easy to make, legitimately too I might add. By this I don't just mean high levels I mean efficient gathering of all resources including caps. I make 20K caps per day and have no real sink other than buying legendaries and resources with a good price to weight ratio.
---
I don't however do PvP so have no real need of the kind of items that go for these amounts. When I see a PvE item I fancy then price will be no object.
---
The economy is in serious inflation territory. The unit of currency for top tier items is not the bottle cap but the char limit cap, ie. 25K.
---
It will be interesting to see where this leads with the legendary vendor and as Fallout 76's population ages. My junk legendaries have a secondary value as scrip too which isn't tradeable but we see a trade now in these items.
---
As you might be able to tell I have a bit of an obsession with in-game economies. In World of Warcraft I spent a large amount of time in the auction house spotting trends and flipping items; it was a game within  a game for me.
---
I ramble though but want to say this: no-one has the right to the best items in the game. Many casual or new players might think all god-tier gear is duped but as someone with almost 1,000 hours of playtime I see little evidence of this.
---
This is a rich and complex game that a lot of people put a lot of effort into. Things are and should be difficult to obtain. That said things may be evolving in ways Bethesda didn't consider and are responsive so who knows, we may see some sort of evolution but not so much as to cause a revolution amongst the hardcore.
---
Ah, so this is how you Alt+F4 on console
---
I‚Äôve gotten one two shot gun and it wasn‚Äôt even explosive...idk how I see all these posts of people finding these god tier legendary weapons
---
Report and block him it will go straight to Sony they will block the player from joining your session. Just had to do this with some douche
---
This is interesint, I was under the impression that XCOM has all rolls predefined. If you save, miss with 95% hit and load game, you will miss again, and again and again, no matter how much you gonna try. But if you will do other chance based action instead (like shot with other soldier, be shot by alien) and then try the 95% one, you'll get a new roll and most likely hit.
---
I forgot you have to go to his profile to do this then do it on fo76
---
She stands still for at least half her health bar, it's nuts. I mean I like the free loot but the fight is way too easy
---
We did, we reported him to Bethesda and Sony a week ago, but he is still here and harassing her
---
Haha, Alec isn't so bad. He's not the type of raider who frequently picks on the weak. There's no challenge in that, no way to prove your strength. Besides, at the moment he's pretty focused on hunting down the rest of the Brotherhood of Steel...he's heard that they have the best armor, so it's something he's gotta add to his arsenal.
---
Can't feel sorry for people willing to spend more money for "collector's edition" games. That only encourages publishers to drive the prices up for the rest of us. You're really that bothered about some bag with fallout logo on it? Have one made yourself already and move on.
---
I fell victim to one of the classic blunders
---
We contacted bethesda, and Sony yet he is still harassing her.
---
Is that a MBMBAM reference?
---
Haha
---
Bit of a mystery indeed. I've no idea either....
---
Ammo as currency?
---
Where have i seen this one before?????
---

I'm not even sure I want a weapon that's a two shot + &lt;insert effect here&gt;.  I'm a stealth sniper build and don't like the reduction in accuract.
---
Now an instigating or anti-armor explosive hunting or lever action rifle, I would love to have.
---
No, mules are more used to carry stuff, not caps.
---
I agree but not yet. Let‚Äôs get them to fix the potential bugs that may arise.   
---
I don‚Äôt want to get robbed of more than 25k of caps.

Just seems like despite all the fanboyism, the games aren't as popular as the Bethesda ones.  Some people seem to be boycotting it because of the Epic Store or whatever,

Cool picture!

How he can join you in another server if is not on friendlist ?
---
im not sure how it works, because i put in the jargon on the black light up boards in the command room into the website and it caused it to not come up with any solutions
---
Honestly i just did not enjoy the characters or story of it, three dog had more charisma than the entire vegas strip, and the overly politcal story was just not nearly as engaging to me as finding/avenging Liam Neeson. Not saying there weren't good characters or stories, the survivalist story is one of my all time favorites in gaming period, but as a whole i thought threes atmosphere was far more enjoyable. Again, all of this is just opinion, i do like new vegas, not saying it's bad, just that i have better memories of 3.
---
I know this is extremely old but are some of the "deposits" actually "veins." I've been looking for one of the lead deposits for a half hour and can only find lead veins.
---
I have a Name suggestion and a Name question.
---
Name Suggestion: You keep the account name as is, but the character name sits just underneath it, smaller and in parenthesis.
---
Name Question: If somehow you survived being born and growing to adulthood without any other humans around you, would you have given yourself a name? Super hypothetical, maybe philosophical, but 100% dumb.
---
On a Facebook fallout group he pays people 500 caps to find a world that my friend is in so he can join on them and harass
---
Just use the unjumbled codes on Nukacrypt

Nukacrypt shows you the unscrambled code you don't need anything else unless the code hasn't been solvec

What do the reactors do when they‚Äôre powered? I‚Äôve seen switch boards at power stations but activating them did nothing when the plants were fixed.

Wow that sick

Dude it‚Äôs literally describing the oil oligarchs selling art. No painting is worth millions, except that rich fuckers know there‚Äôs another rich fucker will pay that for it.
---
Those guns you bought for cheap (like 2k = TSE gatling), were dupes, that is why they sold it to you for like 1-2 hours worth of farming caps. Are you that naive?
---
If you had really good roll on good weapon, or god roll on meh weapon (still something you would use) then would you really sell that for 2-5k caps? Don't be ridiculous. Caps are worthless at end game.
---
I agree that it should be a feature already in the game 100%. The reality of the situation though is that it‚Äôs not in the game and Bethesda is going to try and make money. This is a way for them to do so without selling boosters or something of that sort which would definitely create a p2w situation.
---
Bethesda deliberately makes small adjustments because there is a minority of player base who persistently complain about being forced to socialise.
---
Since the shared vendor cap pool it has become much easier. I'm not saying you should but if you try you can make 7K caps per account per day.
---
1. You're a fucking genius.
---
2. I had a brainwave while I was trying to figure out how to transpose my foundations without breaking everything - as long as you have a second storey to snap the floor piece onto, you don't need to! I snapped a 2-wide piece on [like this](https://i.imgur.com/jQh8iDe.jpg) and it worked perfectly. \*manic cackling\*
---
What's your carry weight?
---
My thoughts exactly. Player vending without a cap limit is worthless.
---
I've picked up two in my 800+hours. Both flamers ü§∑

That's nice and a fitting reward :)

Same on PS4 loooool

Name suggestions for the Perk/Mutation - Metal Mouth, Magnet Mouth, Tinsel Teeth, Tin Grin

It‚Äôll junk the caps, same as what happens if you‚Äôre capped and sell to vendor
---
Patch notes and roadmaps and oh, everywhere really.
---
I can't agree with the last sentence.
---
Put in the nuclear keycard, punch the code from Nukacrypt into keypad for your silo, and then use the "periscope" to select where you want to drop. Be warned, if you are going to be taking on the SBQ, you are going to need alot of firepower and many others on the server to help.
---
The nukacrypt code gets used at the launch site after you put in a nuke keycard.
---
Small Indie company hard at work
---
Well, I don't believe we actually have any info confirming that. The closest we have is "we're looking into it" or "it's something to consider". At the very least I'd like it if just the immediate area around the golf club was made off limits. Everywhere else if perfectly fine. The whole of whitesprings is way too big of a waste to just cut off from the player base. At the very least wait 2 days for the update to drop that will be making several changes to camps. For a vendor plus flat as possible terrain, you really don't get much better, plus, if you build near robot patrols, they'll kill mobs for you.
---
If you're interested in containing your crops indoors, you can place all your crops down first, and then you can clip foundations through them without issue. You can literally just place them through crops. Doesn't require any trick or method.

You don't get XP for kills you didn't contribute to. Only loot if your turrets did it alone.

99% of them are duped.

Got my first (and only) one around lvl 100, was a pipe pistol tho
---
I'm on the PC, I'd be interested.  Would be a fun diversion.
---
I‚Äôm.. really struggling to comprehend the point this post is trying to make.
---
They got it right in elder scrolls online
---
Controller would be primary. The XB1 keyboard UI was recently updated and pretty streamlined, user-friendly. Some of us have keyboards to type with too. You do however, raise a very good question.
---
For console, it'd be nice to have a custom UI always rolling that used 'Topic' tags + together with a typed message so:
---
\[Gamertag\] \[LFG \]\[Nuke\] SBQ, 15mins need help! \[Reply\]
---
\[Gamertag\] \[Help\] \[Quest\] Where do I find the sheepsquatch? \[Reply\]
---
\[Gamertag\] \[FS/FT\] TSE Lever Rifle 2000 caps! \[Reply\]
---
Sound idea?
---
Easier? Harder Shirley?
---
That selling boosters would create a p2w situation?
---
You're literally saying that it's acceptable that they committed false advertising.
---
He doesn't talk about positive stuff, because that is like talking about  salmon next to blue whale. The combat? the shallow and boring combat. The endgame? one monster, that was imported straight from skyrim, requires zero brains, gear, and skill and has loot pool of 100 000+ The PVP? Where meta is that you have to not move. The UI/UX? No chat, trading dialog is mess, social menu time to time f#cks up. The community? Delusional players who still think that F76 is great or has become great after bug fixes. Growing playerbase? Ohh you mean all the grayed out people in social menu and totally not players leaving. New content? The content that you run through in hour and then you forgot them, because they add nothing to game. Mask, No one. Alcohol, No one. Camera, no one. Even the dungeons are nothing more than existing boring and shallow content that has slightly better loot drop. What exactly has F76 positive? Maybe dumb persons can tell, he can play it, because it requires zero brains and challenge to overcome, but for online gaming audience this game has nothing to offer.
---
I am so down for this. Do you have discord?
---
My id is saskapone lemmie know when you add and what your id is.
---
So unarmed does benefit here? Good to know. I have gladiator and I'm going to see what my atk is with max cards and maybe incisor as well. I got my health down to 4 and that's the best I could do without dying.
---
20 caps aren't worth a loading screen.
---
Just take the stagger off yaoi bears and give it to deathclaws. Bears are honestly more scary than anything short of the sheepatron

Yea I am blooded build as well but I use a super sledge with 40% faster swing
---
Game is in way better shape than it was on lauch but still far from the condition i would have liked to see it released. And they are bringing new bugs with every single patch.
---
I was heavy Tse till the nerf. Man I miss seeing legit 3k+ damage.
---
TES is gonna be another shitstorm im afraid :(
---
I can get over 2k damage on mine it‚Äôs a beast
---
Well, now we know why he‚Äôs on food stamps.
---
Home is where it's at.  It may not look pretty like other people's, but it's your home and you can tell the world to shove it if they dont like it.
---
Well they are meant to be the apex but are the easiest way to get black metal for the excavator power armour
---
I know that most of the time it‚Äôs a no. I lost 1400 stimpaks because their servers crashed and I got nothing even though they should have replaced them. Though at least you have video evidence, so you could give it a shot.
---
First of all though, try contacting the buyer. If I were the buyer I‚Äôd let you sell me a very expensive bobby pin or something. Usually people will do this, especially if they have high karma. Hopefully they aren‚Äôt going to be a dick about it, but there‚Äôs only one way to find out. Good luck.
---
I sell every one I get unless it‚Äôs three star. Every. Single. One.
---
That was until details of the new patch was announced at least.
---
Yeah, that's a good idea that'd probably work well.
---
Since I'm on PC, typing wouldn't be an issue for me (touch typist).  I was mainly curious how that could be implemented.  And that some consoles can accept keyboards for typing is a good thing.
---
Basically any argument why Bethesda Fallouts suck is reductive and bends the truth in some way...
---
Maybe go do something other than play Fallout so much you have to create a second account to carry your shit? Are you literally unable to fathom why that's ridiculous???
---
I've never played any game so much to the point I was like,"shit, I have too much stuff on this account for my multiple characters, let's start a new account as someone else."
---
You cant insult me enough by trying to bash my income to make me feel bad for thinking you're obnoxious, and you're verbal attack/defense proves that. Goodbye :)
---
Good idea. I never touch other players  junk. Have too much myself.
---
If you dont see a problem in how you can go from a melee God to a rifle God in an instant, then I'm not sure what else I can say to make you see the point. 
---
Catch up, leg up, saving time, it doesnt matter how you word it, it is getting a boost and a boost is an advtange. 
---
Clearly our definitions of p2w is different. You are using the narrow interpretation while I'm trying to make you understand that any boost is an advtange which leads to a "win" it doesnt mean you are winning at a pvp fight or winning against others but that when compared to someone at the same stage, you are ahead. I've been trying to explain it to you but you are so dead set on this 
---
There are so many examples of how having certain maxed out perk cards or certain combinations can make you literally unstoppable or can turn you into a crafting God which leads to caps and then better stuff. 
---
One little advantage can snowball just as fast for the right reasons just as much as the bad ones
---
I'm not an MMO person so I might lack the knowledge of other games and comparisons like you but I'm smart enough to see how this can be taken advantage to give those a leg up on others 
---
Even if your re-spec was only cards for their respective lvl, having the ability to completely change your build on the spot to counter the challenge at hand is an advtange
---
Well, I'm one of those people who prefers to play solo, I almost never group up, but I don't feel like I'm being forced to socialise.

I'll leave now....

Okay I went back and actually read your posts from 19 days ago and you said your a data miner who has seen the percentages you read the scripts and if your numbers are right and if Bethesda hasn't altered any of those numbers then your 100% right it's all rng. Off topic I wish rng would have dropped 1 explosive evergy wepon before it was patched. And that totally sucks that the chance goes down 1 percent every 10 levels so I'll never get decent legendary spawns time to make a new character.
---
Weird, idk then. My thought was heavily overencumbered like me, but this sounds like a glitch. Do you take lots of chems and play loud music? Maybe Bethesda is screwing with you? Haha idk man but I wish I could help
---
That's the ticket. Enjoy it while it lasts, it's probably not intended.
---
I‚Äôll log it and see, the buyer was really cool. He waited around and showed me evidence it was deducted. So he lost the caps as well.
---
not yet I am going to make a disco ill send you info through here !

The walls on the second floor of my house are able to be double-sided when there is a wall below them. I'll play around with walls a bit to see if I can do that elsewhere. Basically, place a doorway wall section, and then try to place another one flipped around the other way on top of it. Replace them with solid walls once the doorways are in place. The door trick might not even be necessary TBH, but that works to get walls into places they sometimes don't want to go.

&gt;Fallout 76 was being developed alongside fallout 4, which began in 2010. I wouldn't call 9 years 'rushing

Source? i call bs on this

whoot welcome to WVA Power company employee 0008
---
I don‚Äôt think the imposter needs to be nerfed. It‚Äôs pretty easy to kill, and it‚Äôs melee can be avoided. The pylons are a cool addition and the robot minion spam is easy experience for most people, and a decent challenge for the lower levels. The only thing that needs to change is the cost of the keycard and the suicide eyebots. Those things are just annoying.
---
Also I don‚Äôt think the majority of the community is made of noobs. Most people catch on to the new mechanics quickly. Those that don‚Äôt are usually just unintelligent in general and that can‚Äôt really be helped. Also, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that there are more high level than low.
---
What examples exactly? All I'm reading Is "other games do it" or "I dont have enough time"
---
Those dont justify the ability to instantly become a God in another class just because you don't have enough time or that you got screwed over a meta change
---
Nearly 100 Only two shot I ever got is the dragon last week and never had an explosive one
---
Oh ok. The last few people I‚Äôve seen this happen too apparently lucked out and the buyer gave them the caps because the buyer didn‚Äôt actually lose them, guess it‚Äôs random and you were unlucky.
---
I think you at least have a fighting chance with that video evidence. Hope Bethesda help you out, they really should.
---
Agreed;
---
I‚Äôve got a mic but I usually play when people are asleep so really conscious of how loud I am when speaking.
---
It's not ??
---
Wanna sell it? :)
---
I mean atleast we got random sheepsquatches now because oh boy! They are tough as hell
---
Anybody know how to do the weekly with the mirelurk queen Hunter and spawn do they need to all be in 1 pic because I've taken them all just not together. If they all have to be in 1 pic then that's just bullshit
---
LOL translation you want another way to sucker new players into being killable.
---
Yeah sounds like it‚Äôs just a glitch then, nah I‚Äôm sober in game minimal Chems for me ahah. Thanks for trying anyway man guess the power armours staying on the hoist for a little while longer
---
Also im still scared of the high level variants of deathclaws
---
Let me rephrase that. As the enemy level goes down the chance it will spawn as legendary goes down
---
Shame, nobody will be putting much in there at first I‚Äôll expect then until some caps are moved around
---
When leveling up you get to pick a special skill and a perk card, every park card is associated with a special skill but while leveling up you are able to pick a perk card that is in a different special skill vein than the special skill you picked to level.
---
You are only able to level up a special skill until level 50.
---
Guns/armor degrade and can only drop as high as level 50 with a higher level of the same gun being better than the lower level of the same gun.
---
You are able to sort by what you are able to craft while at crafting benches, this can be helpful when crafting things as it takes out all the recipes you are unable to make but would normally have to scroll through.
---
Legendary weapons can have up to three legendary effects on it at the same time, they drop from legendary enemies (they‚Äôll have a Star next to their name). 
---
Legendary enemies can be up to 3 stars. A three star legendary can drop a 3 star, 2 star, or 1 star weapon/piece of armor while a 1 Star can only drop 1 stars.
---
You‚Äôre able to have cosmetics equipped while still having your armor on (except for power armor), so you can be wearing a ton of good armor but to everyone else you‚Äôll look like you‚Äôre in a bathing suit.
---
Mutations are in this game and you have a chance at becoming mutated anytime you take rad damage and have a chance to cure a mutation whenever you take radaway or remove rads in any way (unless you have the starched genes perk which essentially lets you lock in your current mutations). 
---
Mutations all have a positive and negative about them, for example, one is you deal 25% more melee damage but have less accuracy when shooting guns, so they‚Äôll be more useful in endgame when you know what your build is focusing in on/isn‚Äôt.
---
Each zone on the map has its own levels it spawn in it so if you notice you‚Äôre having difficulty in one area of the map then you may be too low of a level to realistically take it on and should go back to an area of the map you were able to complete quests in until you level up enough to take on the difficult area.
---
The number of points in a special stat is the number of perk cards you‚Äôll be able to have equipped in that respective stat (except as you level up perk cards they‚Äôll take more special points to equip).
---
You‚Äôre able to swap out currently equipped perk cards with ones you‚Äôve unlocked. This means you can have the lockpicking perk card unlocked but maybe have a rifle damage perk card equipped until you come across a lock that needs picking, then can swap the lockpicking perk card back out when you‚Äôre done lockpicking.
---
There are survival aspects to the game, you‚Äôll have to eat and drink as you play but the drain isn‚Äôt too horrible on them as to be annoying.
---
Your base you put down will cost caps every time you‚Äôd like to move it from it‚Äôs previous location.
---
You‚Äôre able to craft ammo at a new workbench (will be helpful early game before you get any % damage increase perk cards).
---
You learn weapon mods from scrapping the same type of weapon so it‚Äôs best to hoard weapons early on and waddle to nearby crafting stations to scrap them.
---
Fast traveling costs caps
---
If you die the further you respawn from where you die will cost more caps
---
If you‚Äôre playing in adventure mode other players can‚Äôt do a ton of damage to you if you don‚Äôt shoot them back (enabling pacifist mode means if you do shoot them by accident then they won‚Äôt be able to retaliate at full damage regardless, but you can‚Äôt damage other players).
---
There are daily/weekly/lifetime challenges to get the paid currency to get cosmetic things for you to build with/wear while playing. The challenges can be accessed by going through the map then into the menu option then under challenges.
---
Any photos you take with photo mode will be used as loading screens
---
When you‚Äôre wondering why you‚Äôre still over-encumbered it‚Äôs probably coming from your aid tab.
---
Have fun with the game! You can choose to just build your perfect house in the wasteland, enjoy the story or environment, grind for that perfect armor/weapon, make a photo album of your travels, PvP in survival mode, or all of that all at once!
---
I found one the other week been playing since day 1 so for me anyway there super rare. I am sure others have more time to farm and likely got quite a few by now.
---
Never got a tad, butbive had 3 explosives. Best is my aae pump that dropped in a whitesprings nuke zone around level 100.
---
No it shouldn't. It's messy and breaks immersion. Get a mic ü§∑
---
I stumbled across a L96 Glowing Deathclaw when exploring - needless to say I ran away as quick as my AP would let me (I am L45). That was certainly different!
---
I doubt it. I'm sure some will prefer not to get 10% tax. Also remember some items sell well above the 25k caps limit. You wouldn't be able to do that via in game vending.
---
There‚Äôs not a source because that‚Äôs false
---
People want to pay 5K caps for an amazing gun. I make 5K in one or two days depending on the servers.
---
About time
---
Perk cards all have unique abilities that give you a boost, how does having the ability to completely re vamp that card set not give you an advantage?
---
He showed me there was only 8k left and that he had the inert flux in his charater and there was 1 missing from my account. 
---
A few weeks ago I had a similar thing but sale didn‚Äôt go thru. Coz the guy came chasing me and said I don‚Äôt have anything. Then we figure out I didn‚Äôt have cap space. Bethesda is so inconsistent..... but he had proof coz the transaction wouldn‚Äôt have gone thru if he had only 8k caps. He basically waited chatting to me for like 45min.
---
Any place that has water for purifiers and a vendor close by
---
No witchhunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game and do not accuse players of cheating. Use Bethesda's official support page to report them [here](https://help.bethesda.net/). Do not name in shame in general.
---
In addition, if you edit the name out, I can re-approve it.
---
Items didn't disappear, Bethesda deleted your duped items, you jumbo.
---
Not for high end gear mate, unless the seller doesn't know the value.
---
It might even get more posts as people will use it to advertise their items?
---
Yeah. That's a rule. Always read the rules.
---
They don't wanna read about that. That people want play the game and share their adventures, they don't want someone saying why you can't like the game.

Reddit is not a

Look for a farm that has lots of crops and put your camp near there. That way you always have crops. I keep 5 tatos, 5 corn, 5 razor grass, and 10 mutifruits. I can make all the different drinks and adhesive if needed
---
They were the same about fallout 4 until 76 dropped, now talking shit about the bad parts of 4 is taboo. It's par for the course, at it's best r/fallout is interesting, at it's worst it's a noxious aids spreading dumpster fire q
---
When I had my 3* Exploding Dragon, I noticed I could fire it, weapon swap and swap right back and it'd be reloaded. Stuff died real fast but I had to repair it a lot.
---
that sounds like the lode baring event, repair and protect some autominers and get tokens to use at the terminal outside (random ore vendor), but they are not the same tokens found around the map as of yet they have no use
---
Why even bother with TSEs, though? If you're going to dedicate the time to earn something, go for the best!
---
I've never found a BE naturally.
---
Good points. Can you or anyone explain what they meant by keeping the in-game economy healthy in relation to the 10cap tax? I wouldn‚Äôt have thought 10 caps would make much of a difference in the grand scheme of things but maybe I am missing something.
---
Bloodied build with improved criticals?
---
Explain?
---
Why is it a pain, though? It's not a big deal if you've possibly found better legendaries.
---
Downvote me all you want, the truth is that they intentionally cut content from the game so they can have something to give you later. Don't forget that stuff we have now was datamined long time ago.  They need to wait so that it all goes through their atom store
---
High quality is expected for sure, but bethesda sure as fuck does not deliver anything remotely close to quality, especially in terms of bugs.
---
Finally a place big enough for that pool table üòõ
---
I thought people might use the market to get ideas on how much to sell their items for in the vending machines but not actually trade. Window shoppers if you like.
---
Well that is kinda what happens when you copy/paste almost the entire game from singleplayer one. FO76 will never have text chat, you can count on it (i wish it would though). It would take too much time, money, effort and skill from bethesdas side and they are imcompetant/cheap asf.
---
Why not buy one?
---
Reddit is a
---
The new wanted item will be the scrip or whatever it is from the legendary vendor
---
 if you can sell it, I'm pretty sure it will be sold/ traded here
---
I suppose only time will tell, but the idea is to make caps more valuable and try to bring down all those ridiculous prices. Like the 25k+ cap sales.... eventually if caps are harder to get and more valuable, something that's worth 50k now, would drop to 20k.... something like that anyway.. I'm sure someone smarter than me can do a better job at explaining lol
---
It‚Äôs 10%. Not 10 caps
---
They take stuff from Fallout 4 and sell it to you.Wow, so much work gone into that.
---
Not worthless. I have 20 pieces of sentinel armour I could sell for 3k each or something and at least twice that in weight reduction pieces. Saying it‚Äôs worthless because you can‚Äôt sell your god roll pieces for 30-40k is silly and incorrect, especially since they aren‚Äôt even worth that much to begin with. Market is fucked right now but it‚Äôll balance out.
---
TSE being your dream? Uh, why?
---
If you're looking for fun, any Explosive weapon is fun, so why not use the best and go for a BE?
---
Cap your frames. Having too high framerates will stop you from moving but still allow you to look around/jump. 
---
Long as you keep your frames below 200 you should be fine.
---
I think the market will still be a viable option to trade/sell. This new currency is gonna be a deal breaker for the market though. No more 60k handmade deals are gonna be made. May be more profitable to use those caps for the new currency.
---
To be fair it's a dumb joke
---
Can‚Äôt agree more!
---
It's 10% not 10caps
---
If you want to see some more good legendaries, you should sell that, get a good 1k or 2k, snd put it toward a BE.
---
150ish, 200+ hours. I've never seen an explosive weapon, found a single two shot pipe weapon. Though I did once have an enemy from a furious lever action, but the server crashed as I picked it up ¬Ø\\\_/¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø\\\_/¬Ø
---
Why not just buy a good BE?
---
Oooohhhhhhhhhh. Makes more sense.
---
I found it just south of google.com
---
I might be totally wrong here, but I remember right after BETA bethesda gave us a list of feedback they'd heard, and told us, way back then that they were "looking into" text chat, I might be totally wrong and I can't find a source, but if anyone else can it'd be interesting
---
Can you imagine a 10 cap tax where each bullet is 11 caps because you set the price to 1.
---
I can make 4K caps in one day. No glitches, just normal gameplay. Sometimes you gotta use your brain in order to achieve things.
---
The most annoying thing imo is that practically all post are "I'm in my 391.548th run of Fallout New Vegas and I cannot believe I haven't seen this before!!", which gets a ton of upvotes.
---
In that trend, there's two posts on the sub that seem to get tons of upvotes: Bashing 76, and praising NV/3.
---
Market is great
---
Why not just buy a good BE? Stop settling when you can get the best!
---
I make 1500-5000 in one day, but you need a brain to do it.
---
feel free to sell me all your stuff for 5k
---
But I thought it twice. Maybe the immersive feeling that comes when you can only talk to players whom you encounter is what the whole-world text chatting will ruin. But I thought of having text chatting in the game many times, indeed.
---
I have a 1* bloodied handmade, and it does 350 damage at 20% health. Such an OP weapon for a 1*. I have no idea how much it'd be worth, but I reckon it would outclass a lot of 3*'s l, except for some AA or explosive variant.
---
Why not? People are out here complaining about no TSEs for some reason, and you have one of a few better than that.
---
There was a vocal minority who were desperate for PvP. All of those people who wanted to "roleplay as raiders" and the like who have been raised on other PvP games. And I think in p[articular Bethesda wanted it because Fortnite.
---
Bot the thing was that the majority of fallout players didn't want it. I can log into a new adventure world again and again and new hit the same world instance. But survival? I log in 5 times in a row and I hit the same world instance. Meaning that there are hundreds, if not thousands of players playing PVE at any one time and maybe 6 players playing PVP.
---
I don‚Äôt think you know what a griefer is
---
Crazy story, I lost all my plans and mods off one character recently and tonight I noticed items reapeared. Now I'm not certain all the items came back  but at least some of them didb
---
In my game for the PS4, I got a two-shot explosive .44 revolver, I like it, but it does have a nasty habit of killing me if I go crazy with it.  They're powerful, but they can easily just straight up murder your ass if you end up getting surrounded by enemies.  I've not played Fallout 76 in a while,  and while I wanna get back into it...  the amount of badness still in the game prevents me from really wanting to give it another chance.
---
Yes it was worth buying at release and it is still worth buying now.
---
Vampire and AA cant be on the same weapon
---
Duping has been fully patched several months ago, and all duplicate weapons in everyone's inventory were removed in January.
---
Even if duping were still possible, it's not like people would dupe TSE anyway.
---
So if you have tse, it drops tse?
---
I have tse rifles with rifle and demo perks...  never get explosive rifle drops.
---
someone defend the refund, bags, rum and atom shop stuff please.
---
I want to see the your reasoning.
---
You should sell it for like 2k and put it toward a BE version of it.
---
When you have to log more than one character to pay for an item, the market is not great.
---
I agree that finally getting that weapon roll or Armor roll is incredibly satisfying, but to most people it's just not enough. Even you have to admit that killing the Scorchbeast Queen and spending all your ammo all just to get a Stalker's Switchblade can be very disheartening to most.
---
 I believe the Scrip will possibly let us "reroll" on one or all of the weapon or Armor Legendary effects. That way there is still that rng factor, but we feel more in control over it. I would rather have to reroll on a 3* Minigun that I already have than have to go grind for one all over again, personally.
---
Reasonable thinking! Bots that keep posting junk messages are bastards. They, to some extend, ruin a game by doing so. I just saw a whole lot of cheating-programs-selling ads in Chinese when playing GTA V.
---
The disparity between legendary and non legendary weapons is far too significant. It would be like playing diablo 3 where finding, paying $40 on eBay for, or spending 24/7 trying to scam some good deals on a discord server gave you a 400% dps upgrade.
---
When I played MMO‚Äôs on private servers way back when there was often a @main channel that you had to manually join. It worked like a charm. Met a lot of friends through there and we even had a guild named after it. 
---
If moderation is still needed you could have a vote to kick system (from the chat room).
---
I've had a TSE Harpoon gun drop, but other TSEs have been from vendors
---
Okay sounds good.
---
The trick is to put the pool table down first  üòâ
---
Wut? How many hours? Im level 180 or so and I've found about 10 I think. They aren't common but neither really rare.
---
They ban for chargebacks, not refunds...
---
I‚Äôm not surprised. There‚Äôs more bugs than not, even 6 months after full release.
---
You've never had a 3* or never had a 3* TSE?
---
Duping got fully patched several months ago, and they removed all duplicates from everyone's inventories in January.
---
Even if duping were still possible, it's not like people would dupe TSEs.

I love how your whole comment is just way off.
---
;)

I'll be on in an hour or so if you're around, I need good grief as well.
---
Why not just buy a BE shotgun and rub it in her face?
---
They are already heavily invested into survival which is slowly turning into BR.
---
I used to play for the dailies, kept coming back every day.
---
Then the alcohol challenges attacked.
---
Fuck that. Havent played it since.
---
I‚Äôll be around, just add me, gonna nuke white spring until you‚Äôre free
---
Why not just sell it and put it toward a good BE weapon to suit your build?
---
Yeah, that's my main weapon right now. Gotta agree it's pretty nice though always having 20% is not easy life
---
Just add me next time you're on and when I'm on, make sure to let me know who you are so I don't think "Dafuq is this dude?" üòâ
---
my non-duped, level 5 chameleon wood armor? months before it was even a widespread issue? or my t51b leg that I got off Watoga?
---
regardless, there's video proof now, so there. the fact I was downvoted 30 times proves what I'm saying: the sub has been proven wrong, but will insist on it anyway.
---
No, TS and Explosive were just heavily nerfed, and neither are impossible on energy weapons anymore.
---
Why would they do that, rather than reducing the better effects instead?
---
Nice!
---
I quit playing but had my camp set up just to the north of whitespring at a lead mine in the mountains.  I quite liked that site because it was pretty much in the middle of the map and makes fast travel as cheap as possible that way as long as you travel for free to your camp first.
---
My impression was that people with a large amount of dupes were banned and had their inventories purged.  However, that did not impact either already sold items in other accounts or small numbers of duped items.
---
So there likely are duped items out there, just not new ones.
---
Why not just sell it and put it toward a BE Handmade?
---
All sandwiches!
---
This sounds like an Archer comment.
---
Explosive isn't possible on explosive weapons...
---
You're either lying or meant to say TS. In that case, really? Why not just buy a good BE instead? There's no point keeping a cheap weapon, when you can have the best!
---
It's not possible.
---
Exactly. I was already planning on just adding 10 caps to everything. Like Australia‚Äôs GST. Duh.
---
No, it actually makes the projectiles explosive as well. Hiwever, that person was lying, it's not possible.
---
Anyone else noticed their Atoms drying up? 
---
I had 3,000 at peak having not spent them from launch bought some neon, excavator skins, camp pack and that dropped me to 650, now at 700 and have been for some time. 
---
The early game rewards are more or less done and like OP I‚Äôm not going to do PVP or group activities, so my options were craft medicines (of which I don‚Äôt have the recipes for all of them) or collect resources at X, or capture Berkeley Springs. The easiest of those is 30 Atoms. 
---
Cynically the Atoms appear weighted to new players, and dwindle down as you move into the 100+ hours, which I am sure is to leverage the cash payment for Atoms.
---
Yeah, you should definitely sell that because it's a legacy, and put it toward buying a good BE.
---
Why do you care about TS, though?
---
I have one aswell still haven't used it yet
---
I think its 10%
---
Seriously...  I mean they have fun with the game.  Who the hell wants a space for that? It's like having a room in the house where you are not allowed to take a dump on the floor.
---
I would be surprised if you can sell/trade them but yeah, caps will be second rate currency for sure even more so if scrips are fluid.
---
Nope, they're not duped. Duping was fully patched several months ago and duplicates were removed from everyone's inentories in January.
---
Even if duping were still possible, why would they waste time duping TSEs?
---
No one takes caps lol
---
You trade items for items, as the name implies; TRADING.
---
Caps shouldn‚Äôt have that much power. The competitive market should be exclusive
---
One thing to keep in mind, the reddit community is only a small subset of the actual players in f76. 
---
So this will play directly into what you said "seller doesn't know the value". Most players don't know or care to put in the extra effort of making a reddit account for their sales. So the way i see it, player vending is enabling the common player to be able to join the market. What will probably happen is market will be flooded by all the new sellers and it will bring market prices down.
---
Agreed. 
---
Mirelurk Kings are a proper ball ache to put down compared to Deathclaws. Got in a scrap with 3 glowing L50 Kings and 1 Hermit crab, took me about 20-30 minutes, a bunch of ammo and grenades. 
---
It was at a deserted and ruined shack so I didn‚Äôt have cover I would have got ganked. If it was 3x Glowing Deathclaws I‚Äôd imagine it would‚Äôve been easier
---
Lmao this sub is full of cucks.Yall are fucking pathetic cucks.
---
Either that or you're paid by bethesda to write "positive" things about this garbage money grab from morons like you guys,peace out you delusional animals,keep spending a lot of money on garbage games,keep ruining
---
But you could still farm for 1* legendarys to scrap for scrip
---
Not everyone can be arsed with the HP management of a Bloodied build. I know I can‚Äôt.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø
---
Why would you waste your time making up a lie? Furious and TS aren't possible together, as they're both 1st star effects.
---
Also, why do you even care about TSE? Why not actually go for the best legendaries out there?
---
Pretty sure Bethesda said it is not something you can sell or trade.
---
To be fair, they're all trash.
---
E X P L O C E P T I O N
---
Sigh. Im sure you don't see the stuff other players have sold to the vendors.
---
Respect and Admiration for Alec. Ad Victoriam on the hunt for BOS üéñÔ∏è
---
I totally agree
---
Wait... why would you buy TSEs? Why not just buy the best?
---
I‚Äôd love to see wall mounted defenses for camps instead of just turrets.
---
I'm not defending them at all. But I am saying it was your own fault for getting sucked into this whole mess. Buy a game, no matter how raw or buggy it is. Pay more for the "extra goodies" and get what you paid for, not what was promised.
---
My game does crash or disconnect occasionally, I've never had a DC that seemed like it was caused by the SBQ tho
---
You should sell it and out it toward buying a good BE.
---
Agree 100%
---
Sorry, I‚Äôm still fairly new to 76.
---
It's a good thing TSEs aren't even good, though.
---
I've been dropped a few. At least 3 that I can remember.
---
Yeah. People having no melee don't get melee. People using PA don't get armor pieces.
---
That's just rumors and wishful thinking.
---
Why did you buy a TSE? Why not spend your caps on the best?
---
Regardless of your build, why would you choose TS over IE or AAE?
---
Yo people have been communicating with controller in text messages for a long time. And I think the consoles comes with headsets.
---
I've kept the same computer alive since 2011 except that one day the mic/speaker jacks stopped working. Nothing in bios, or a program, or a new headset can change. I'm a PC player who can't enter into any voice community. It's hurt my chance at raiding in some of my favorite games.
---
Talk about tedious.
---
Buy as in for caps, not for real cash (wasn‚Äôt sure if I made it sound as if I purchased them for $$)
---
I bought them for caps because at the time I had a Frankenstein build (still do), and didn‚Äôt want a 1HK build because I get bored quite easily that way.  TSE provided a lot of flat damage to speed up farming without having to respec while I focused on trying to farm things I actually wanted, eg Weightless combat armour with +STR and weight reduction‚Äîwhich I still haven‚Äôt found, sadly.
---
Especially those 1*  heavy weapons...  20# to hoard a 1 *? No thanks.
---
It's a game, have fun with it.
---
You should sell them, because even though TSEs aren't very good, TS and Explosive are both legacy for energy weapons.
---
Cool. Then I'm obviously not addressing you.
---
Anything explosive breaks super quick. Luck of the draw is key here id think, 40 shots in vats one of those is fixing Thomas
---
Uh... no
---
Duping got fully patched several months ago, and all duplicates were removed from everyone's inventories in January.
---
Even if duping were still possible, why would people waste time duping TSEs?
---
Same but fire axe
---
I‚Äôm still fairly new to 76, so the legendaries I‚Äôve seen vendors have for sale are from other players who have sold them?
---
Now I want 1 too
---
You should sell it and out it toward a good BE.
---
You almost had an alright comment then you went full circle jerk.
---
That's even better than TSE, I don't understand the problem.
---
I'm in this camp and I have a Reddit account I really couldn't be bothered with anything to do with the market I know it exists but don't care
---
&gt; But there is a lot of bogus in this video.
---
Uhhhhh what? What is bogus *exactly*.
---
No really. Give me an *exact* quote of something he said that is bogus.
---
While you're looking for that. Understand there is a difference between *bogus* and *negative*. Highlighting all the negative aspects of the launch, Bethesda's handling of customer problems, and everything else, doesn't make the video bogus. It's just focusing on the negative. Bogus means "not genuine or true; fake". Nothing he said was fake, just negative. Maybe learn the difference?
---
Somebody used berry mentats near you
---
It Mark's all living things with a purple mist and you can see through walls
---
Well yeah, but it's not like TSEs are even wanted anymore.
---
U on ps4? Ill give u 25k for it.
---
&gt; Not trying to be a fan boi but this video is just feeding people misinformation, all the stuff that was broken/had problems has been fixed, he makes it sound like the game is still broken and the player base is dead
---
The channel is literally called "The Internet Historian". He's looking at the launch and controversies that have already happened in a comedic light. 
---
It's not a review of the game. 
---
&gt; I don't get why people hate Fallout SO much that they have to make videos like this...
---
It's a comedy video that you're taking too seriously, mate. It was made because it was a funny topic to make a video on. Jesus.
---
They stopped droping after Dec 2018.
---
Yup, whilst you waste your time on a sub for game you hate. Genius.
---
You said it, man.
---
now am jealous .. 
---
(congratz btw :) )
---
Honestly the improved weapon repair kits have been REALLY useful with this thing. I'm nearly happy to farm more SBQs for just those.
---
This is a recap of what actually happened.
---
Source: Me, I've had the game since beta/launch.
---
So true.  Feel free to sell me yours for 500c.  I'll take that junk off your back for ya.
---
All you have to do is be at 75% HP to be better than TSE. Not to mention that TS VATS is useless and TS breaks way easier.
---
Even if you still don't want BE, then get an FE.
---
I feel likebtheyve nerfed drop rates. That and bad luck. 
---
Where do you loot? I get a fair amount of valuable drops in the areas with super mutants around west tek.
---
Yeah, I know. How long ago was this? Why not just spend some more caps for the best, like a BE or FE?
---
The deathclaw in fallout 4 at the beginning was always so scarey cuz even with the minigun and power armour it was so fast and u couldn't just hide in a building cuz it would just run off till you came outside . This was scarey the deathclaws now are just not a threat.
---
Point out exactly what is misleading about his video.
---
I've been with the game since beta/launch. And everything he mentions happened.
---
I am not sure if i plan to use it on an alt or not as i got it on my heavy weapons build. Its kind of annoying how even with out the perks it kind of shits all over my heavy weapons.
---
If you've watched his video's before, it's just exactly the same thing.
---
Well, as trader I sure haven't seen anyone selling explosive explosives.
---
I feel like the improved repair kits are totally worth farming the queen for, and using them to repair dailies isn't really too op. 
---
The atom store repair kits are for trihards though, 50 atoms and one run of West tek destroys my Mutants Explosive 10mm SMG- bought or farmed that's not worth 50 atoms
---
My main problem with it will be that I will no longer find decent legendaries for sale at stations and vendors everyone will just trade them for scrip instead.
---
I've found many a decent item at a vendor because the original owner didn't care about it or it didn't suit their build.  Say goodbye to that
---
I sold mine already when I got their BE versions, except my Gatling Plasma and Laser. However, those are legacy, so those actually are expensive.
---
Also, TSE aren't *that* cheap, but I'll let you know if I find any TSEs. Would you be willing to buy them for like 2k?
---
If you think internethistorian is "news" you are pretty fucking dim dude.
---
It's a satire channel where he memes about stupid shit that's happened in pop culture.
---
You won't get an answer. I've had 76 since beta/launch and everything he mentioned legitimately happened.
---
Probably in the first 2 months or so into release, for most of them.  The last one I bought was a TSE Gatling Laser just after they made it so that explosive energy weapons can‚Äôt be rolled.  Haven‚Äôt purchased any TSEs from the market since.
---
I bought my BEs, but West-Tek and nuked Burrows are the best.
---
How is it nonsense when everything that he mentions happened?
---
That's not called nonsense. Do you know what the words you are using mean?
---
Oh my God I legit posted this for two months straight weekly and maybe got 10 upvotes. Wtf lol
---
That's why I'm saying, you should sell it and get an even better BE than your Railway Rifle.
---
Ohhhhh, okay. That makes sense. That was smart, by the way.
---
Same. I've had the game since beta/launch, but haven't touched it since around new years. And watching this made me go "oh yeah" a lot.
---
Have all the ones I want, but thanks! Looking for FE combat/assault rifles now.  Not a BE build type... prefer autostim and regenerative armor.
---
I think that's mine... I'd hoped it went to a good home. Damn lag trade shit
---
Was there a design philosophy behind the seemingly arbitrary cap limit?
---
Can't trade the scrips.
---
75% HP BE is better than TSE, so it's not like you need the build for it. Not to mention that TS VATS is useless and TS breaks way easier. That's why you should seriously sell those TSEs and put them toward a good FE or especially BE.
---
I like mine better http://i.imgur.com/eLdq2Xo.jpg
---
Haven‚Äôt been on since after the brewing update...hoping that there‚Äôll be some fun things to do when I get back.
---
I haven't played consistently since just about a week before that as well. I've been getting on for Survival weekly challenges, though.
---
I am entitled, by law, to receive what was promised.
---
hold on to them until you figure out which ones you want to use for your build! i use 11 and couldn't go back to playing without them, lol
---
Don't do this. We asked for repair kids and got them in the atom shop. The'll never miss opportunity to add stash extenders too
---
The reward for the survival mode challenge starting 4th June - 10th is a 3* bloodied deathclaw gauntlet Bethesda are calling ‚Äúthe unstoppable monster‚Äù so if your not in a hurry you could earn yourself one for free
---
:) 
---
Even mutant super heroes are not immune to the Scorch Plague
---
RIP Peter Parker - wherever your soul is now
---
yes. the idea is quite simple. there needs to be ways to remove currency to counter the infinite currency. it doesn't matter at what scale.
---
they will be tracking statistics (or should be) of their system because manually adjusting taxes and costs is a monumental (and boring) task.
---
you introduce X amount of caps per hour (in average), then you need to remove Z amount of caps per hour (in average) - it's very simple logic.
---
"only" bad thing..what a circle jerk
---
That just means that the dupers inventories got hit. Everyone that bought one likely still has them. Considering how rare the drops are it's still likely that the majority of them in use are duped.
---
Yeah, but it's not like TSEs are in much use at all anymore.
---
Nearly 600 hours in and the only explosives I've had are a mutants explosive dragon and a junkies explosive smg. Majority of players have never had a tse drop
---
Thank you for this info, I‚Äôm still fairly new to 76 and just thought they were similar to fallout 4 when it comes to legendaries.
---
Yaoi bears?
---
They like boy-on-boy action?
---
&gt;he said he sells all of his 3 star weapons for 30 or 40k caps... 40k?!?!?
---
Hmm...He must have only really good ones. Though from really good ones, particularly if they aren't much duped, 40k is not even a lot. 
---
People play and farm caps with several accounts. 
---
&gt;I feel like requiring someone use a mule character to buy a single weapon from you
---
Oh they aren't. But how could someone sell a good weapon for 5k? There's so many players with the 5k. To whom the would sell it. Sellers solve this problem by having higher price.
---
Alter Aeon (a MUD MMORPG) is famed for their good economy (which, as most systems are, automatic). they have an article on how they manage their economy and about gold sinks. you can read it here for more information if you are interested.
---
 [http://www.alteraeon.com/articles/gold-balancing-in-mmos.html](http://www.alteraeon.com/articles/gold-balancing-in-mmos.html)
---
I think after patch 9 players can't grief your camp anymore
---
And yet they get shit for it while a modder wouldn't get any complaints.
---
Im level 146, played for 279 hours. Farmed plenty of legendaries, never ever seen an explosive let alone a two shot explosive.
---
Im like you, I want to earn it as opposed to trade for it.
---
And what's stopping you from server hopping? Nobody can make you "submit to their terms".
---
1,400 hours for 1 god roll. Ooooof. This loot rng needs some fucking work.
---
Several characters, couple 150s, etc.  Found legitimately 3 or 4, and they were not the ones I wanted.  
---
But I bought and traded for all my TSE and AAE -- still feel earned to me because I worked my butt off for the caps and tradable items.
---
Super old post, but I think they defend it because they are trying to justify their sneaking suspicion that they were ripped off. Basically they were in denial, sunk cost fallacy and all of that.
---
I'm not going to, but they keep following us thru servers
---
What was that Star Wars Battlefront EA quote that people meme'd the hell out of? Something something Pride and Accomplishment. 
---
I cannot remember the last time I did a daily challenge on purpose.
---
best legendaries I got are All Rise and Action Hero. Says a lot about the absolute junk the game keeps giving me.
---
Yeah but you could take that one on headfirst without dying unless you were playing on survival. The Museam of Witchcraft on the other hand, holds an extremely strong monster, even stronger than your average deathclaw. If you haven't visited it yet, I suggest you do.
---
You seriously haven't found any BE, FE, AAE, IE, or EE?
---
Delete them from your friendlist xD
---
Ye I have i played days upon days of thatgame
---
Def berry mentats, also if your on a team and a team mate takes it you get the benefit of seeing the living stuff without the drawbacks of increased thirst and possible addiction.
---
I never said people were still duping, or duping TSEs.   
---
Your one "gotcha" that doesn't exist is what makes my "whole comment way off"?
---
Think it sounds great to me. Who has 200 hours to farm the same monotonous activity for a crack at a weapon / armour with the modifiers you want?
---
Ive had a lot of god rolls that I would never use. Melees/heavies/pistols. This was the first I found that I would actually use. I can't wait to be let down by the legendary vendor.
---
If only that would work
---
Yeah I haven't gotten mine either and todd's my uncle.
---
I refuse to believe that anything even remotely close to an "amazing gun" is going to sell for 5k caps.
---
Then what is the current problem?
---
They can‚Äôt be sold or traded.
---
I‚Äôm hoping for two cap limits. 25k for the character and 25k for the shop. Hoping you place items in shop and set price for each item all to total of 25k. Once you have set all your items up to 25k you cannot sell anymore until they are sold. Then when gap in shop you add another item. This would prevent the scenarios you have described. 
---
Bethesda have taken a good time to get this ready. I hope they don‚Äôt leave it with dissolving caps that are lost. Not long to wait and find out. Good luck
---
A global channel would be nice, so long as it's easy to mute spammers.  More-so for PC than console I suppose, not sure how consoles type stuff.
---
Apparently, many people fail to understand how to make caps and think that having 2000-4000 caps is a LOT.
---
Legendary vendor will change that hopefullyüòâ
---
I would rather they expand the emote wheel and make all of those free.
---
Personally I wouldn't want a text chat. it sounds distracting to me. I don't think it fits with the quieter exploration part of the game. 
---
I think it would mess with the vibe of the game if you step out the vault and see people spamming chat about farming scorchbeasts and begging players to pose for photos for daily challenges. Because sadly that's probably most of what it will be.
---
Ok
---
I found 400 gauss rifle rounds in one today! Amazing indeed!
---
The economy was destroyed by dupers trading worthless items for organic god tier rolls, accumulating vast hordes of gear that they refuse to trade for anything other than other organic god tier rolls.   
---
Go to literally any big trader's trade list and you can see this. An even better experiment, post a non-duped god tier weapon or ass/sent/etc armor piece in the market, and see how many offers you get from traders offering you the SAME exact items. It's because they're all sitting on piles of duped shit. The duped items will always be the first items you get offered.
---
I think people might actually be buying aid items/ammo from vendors or something. That's the only way I can explain it.
---
As someone who just got into the higher levels from just starting, the  biggest things that come to mind are to Scrap weapons and armor, doing this unlocks mods for them.Choose a certain play style/ weapon you want to use early and build towards that, makes life much easier. Calculate your perk points, you only get 50 and they're a pain to move around later.
---
Plenty of people do. In spite of the legendary vendor coming up I managed to pick up a vampiric 50mm, and furious handmade and an as lever action in the last few days.
---
Oh lord, if crash is 100% repeatable. That's not good.
---
That could be a gold mine piece of info you have delivered there my friend. I‚Äôm gonna try that thanks
---
yeah, its because wast majority hate pvp we got survival mode.
---
That has nothing to do with duping. That has to do with the 25k cap limit.
---
Also, duping wasn't as prevalent as you make it seem. Most people got a whole bunch of dupes of the same most popular items. People just no-life the game to get many things.
---
From my experience, when I played more consistently up until a couple months ago, my consistent activity in trading subs went well, and you can tell most stuff wasn't dupes.
---
Tse is rare mate
---
I actually do remember them saying that they will look into it, but after that no additional mentions if text chat, even though it's a thing every player wants. Though I don't remember where exactly they said, I think it was on Reddit and had many articles about it, like that one https://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-is-looking-into-adding-text-chat-for-fallout-76/
---
To be honest I think I would prefer vats rifle drop for my build then TSE. Got one vats pistol for medic but still looking for rifle one.
---
Thanks, let me know, again no guaranties but worth a try :)
---
When it dies stealth mode is activated. If you‚Äôre alone use your camera. If other people are there they usually gather around the corpse for a while to identify it‚Äôs location and then be able to trade the loot.
---
What do you do with your caps? Just selling junk has got me to 5K at level 48.
---
"Steel is literally everywhere" 
---
Not in my stash after I craft some .50 Cal ammo
---
I just reached 200 recently and have never gotten one
---
Funnily enough I was just thinking about this yesterday. I've a friend who helps me with workshops, and we always power up one Plant, but it all depends on what other workshop we want. I am fairly sure my IGN is the same as here, it's something to that effect! I'd love to have a group to work with for powering up power plants!
---
I will +karma
---
When body disappears, there is alwais meat pile with your loot. you just have to find it
---
I've never finished new Vegas due to the ridiculous amount of bugs in that game. Plus the world us ugly, brown and boring
---
Which means 10 characters that all can have 25k caps each.
---
I was ganked by a lvl 50 sheepsquatch at Aaronholth last night while playing my lvl 12 explorer dude. I would have loved the ability to radio for help via my pipboy, "help needed at location" or something.
---
Thank you. I obviously don't want to raise people's hopes up too much, but I feel every avenue is worth exploring, as I've been myself quite desperate to solve those freezes. Maybe I am speaking too soon, and I will of course update this thread if my in-game performance degrades.
---
It definitely is. Puts developer efforts in prospective.  They release new contents but people don't even care to try it. They were all high levels,so you would expect them to know what's going on in the game.....unless at this stage, lvl 150 is just a aged noob.
---
Level 70 quit playing a month or so ago.  Got a level 35 tse shotgun while doing the Uranium Fever event.  I was bummed it wasn't max level but it's still great for clearing out low level packs, or killing oneself.  I swear it does more damage to me then mobs some days.
---
It was horrible. But the whole area was so well done, like you see blood everywhere and body parts dropping through ceiling only for you to encounter certain death unless you were prepared.   
---
  
---
That being said, I always had the same plan going there unless I was playing a console playthrough or just high leveled with op guns.  
---
I would hoard all mines of all kinds there, and I knew precisely which step would bring him out so I avoided that, made a minefield out of it and after all the explosions it had it's legs crippled or low hp for me to finish him off. Dayumn.
---
Got my 2nd 3* yesterday...
---
... and it‚Äôs a medic‚Äôs Gatling Plasma
---
:( can‚Äôt complain about getting no 3* drops
---
- but not what a was hoping for
---
Ahhhh thank you for explaining that. Still annoying but at least there not XP farming.
---
My guess is that it will be like the candy machine thing at watoga school - insert for example 150 scrips to get a random 3* item . Which will mean it will not be any less rng except a guaranteed 3*.
---
Who are you to judge some homobears?
---
Completely agree, no camps allowed to be spawned in that area would be brilliant. Thanks for explaining that dude. Appreciate it üòä
---
I bet with a good crew we could power one up in under 5 minutes.
---
[I don't want to go...](https://media.giphy.com/media/AiEr9b7sX5VKIoIvQL/giphy.gif)
---
Thanks for letting me know üòä
---
Yea just like real life. I can make the ¬£1 sales tax I paid for my lunch by working a little more.
---
You personally may not notice it but the effect on the economy is pronounced.
---
my ign is garlandtd just like here please send me an invite at your earliest conveniance. I am still at work so i wont be able to get on for awhile yet
---
No, its not rare to find.
---
Ok thanks
---
The part about encouraging Bethesda to do what‚Äôs good for the game I think is really important, since they have actual community members that comment and see suggestions. 
---
It kills me though in this sub when there are clear problems with something they‚Äôve done, planning to do, or still haven‚Äôt fixed that get a lot of posts but inevitably get smothered by the ‚Äòlets not forget that Bethesda is listening, we love you Bethesda‚Äô posts. 
---
We‚Äôre criticizing the game from a point of caring about it and wanting to improve it, not trying to bring it down.
---
Leaving out all the bug fixes and support.
---
My condolences.
---
Ok, that's funny right there, I don't care who you are!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
First thing i do when I join a server is to plop down my camp there. Just plopping down my stashbox, no turrets or anything. People get mad when they cant build there, but I hate to zone into the goldclub and hear that toktoktok from turrets...
---
Exactly 
---
... it was the scorch plague in the movie!
---
The ‚Äúash‚Äù disintegration graphics is similar to the scorched
---
... hmmm... now to find that Black Panther underarmour
---
The bug fixes and support don't need to be mentioned, the bug fixes are a game of wackamole, the support has been hit or miss. The video was about the event that was Fallout 76's launch, and the string of misfortune it wrought in its wake.
---
You are a fucking trashcan
---
Yeah your completely correct. I didn‚Äôt realise before they didn‚Äôt get XP for the kills, they still get loot which is still unfair in my eyes. I don‚Äôt have a problem with camps on white spring as I really enjoyed mine by the river/bridge near the water source there and loved it. Had no problems from enemies. Just griefer players. Thanks for letting me know ma dude üòä
---
The alcohol ones are quite quick, and tempted me to pick up the alcoholic perk so now the wine flows like water. 
---
I wonder if they're hoping we'll invite a friend (to buy/play the game) for those co-op ones.
---
Drugs are bad, m'kay?
---
\^ this. Im allways preaching that people vastly overestimate the population of reddit vs the community for a game in whole.
---
What if the text chat could be turned on/off like in ESO? People who like it could have it constantly showing and people who dislike it can just keep it off and completely ignore it.
---
you mean the stuff I leave in bags on the floor?
---
Oh shoot. Thanks for the tip. I think I can wait, I have an alright melee weapon as of now! 
---
Thanks again
---
This is a great in game find. Regardless of platform. Personally have this exact weapon and would say. It‚Äôs a vats killing machine. Only down side is it breaks so so fast.
---
And stimulating gameplay.
---
A lot of people are acting like the tax will just force them to play the game (I‚Äôll just go looting for caps).
---
Yes it‚Äôs a game and this is a mechanic which will make people play the game.
---
That‚Äôs the point.
---
In the real world between printing fiat currencies and fractional reserves money is nearly bloody infinite.
---
But taxing still offsets that, money is still scarce.
---
And you will need to decide if you want to farm caps, go for a walk or spend more time at work because of this tax.
---
I actually got a two-shot 10mm auto very early but it‚Äôs completely useless. I think I sold it to a vendor some time back. Level 115 and hit my first Bloodied weapon yesterday - just a sword... Never seen an explosive let alone a TSE.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt want it to completely be off limits as I agree, I think with the player vending on its way and it‚Äôs a great social hub but they just need to block the areas where enemy spawn killing can be done. Maybe Bethesda might see our moans and address it. Fingers crossed üòä
---
The negatives out weigh the positive, so no
---
Yeah thats was my problem too..got plenty of 3* but nothing I wanted. Collected a ton of 3* Wood armor lol
---
I'm level 33 and stumbled across the exact same thing - same level, glowing Deathclaw - on my way to Raleigh's bunker. I got one-shotted into oblivion and died instantly.
---
Reading this OP just makes me feel weak... :'(
---
I love this, totaly 110% agree with you!
---
&gt;What happens when you hit the cap limit and still have stuff for sale in your vendor and people buy stuff? Where do those caps go? 
---
Dissapear, just like in any other situation you receive caps while already being full.
---
Wish people would realize there's no point to  having caps, if you don't use them.
---
60$? Looooool its 5‚Ç¨ dude xD
---
This has absolutely nothing to do with the cap limit, at all, whatsoever. Not even a little bit. I have absolutely no idea how you came to this conclusion.   
---
I think duping was MORE prevalent than you think it was. A perfect example is survival mode. Back when people actually played it, EVERY prominent PvP engagement was a clusterfuck of people in ass/sent/etc or uny/sent/etc. The odds of organically acquiring a legitimate set of either of these is essentially statistically impossible. Let alone DOZENS of people running this gear. Also, if you get to see the actual armor pieces these individuals are wearing, you'll notice that, for the most part, they're all the same exact items.
---
4-6 months from December would be April - June. Don't you have another month before it's late?
---
I am level 137 and like a week ago I finally found a tse explosive western revolver with perception. I am the first one in our group of 3 that ever found one haha. I quess they are just very rare!
---
Hey man if you're on PC let me know, I can help out and me and my friends normally do them as a group and keep the costumes :)
---
I had wondered about this, honestly. I found the Tourist a second time for a friend, but there wasn't a second camera for me to take. Fortunately it can't be accidentally vendored, but what exactly are you supposed to do when it just vanishes?
---
PCMR here and pissed up FO76 was my usual Friday eve,
---
pretty sure two-shot is what makes things break twice as fast, not explosive.
---
Im level 170, never seen one either.
---
It really varies from player to player and I think a lot of people in this sub miss that fact. I love the game but hate the current state of it, even though it has improved a lot. 
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a week or so because I still got disconnected any time I launched a nuke, captured a workshop, or started a large group event. It‚Äôs so frustrating. 
---
I also had enemies with the health glitch come back, loot/bodies disappearing, freeze on exit, and a few other bugs that I‚Äôve had for ages or since beta. 
---
There was a long time I tried playing with my brother and a friend and all three of us had different bugs and problems playing the game so we just stopped and played AoE2 instead. 
---
I definitely agree with OP though. If they had just pushed back launch this would‚Äôve been a great game and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be an amazing game in another 6 months. When that time comes I‚Äôll start playing a lot more than once or twice a week. 
---
Hell, I bought No Man‚Äôs Sky at launch and I still play it because it‚Äôs been massively improved. I have the same sentiments about Fallout 76, was a pretty shitty launch, they‚Äôre making small but nice improvements and in 6 months to a year it‚Äôll be a solid game.
---
i got a two shot gun right before the nerf... felt really bad.
---
They even had played vending in their presentation last June... I like all the improvements but people are sometimes blindly devoted to the game. 
---
So far they‚Äôve released a few hours of quests, a ‚Äòdungeon‚Äô, backpacks, and a crafting table, with a few other things here and there. It‚Äôs not really a massive amount of content or improvements. 
---
I still love the game, still play it and I wish people would realize that what they‚Äôve done so far is nice but they could be doing so much more.
---
As of patch 9 (May 7th), since placing and powering a player vending machine will make your camp visible on the map, that would clearly create the issue of players knowing exactly where they are all the time, and the griefing consequences of that would be insane, so to counter that, if you're in Pacifist mode, your camp will be invulnerable to player based damage.
---
you shouldn't have renamed it. I keep hearing reports of named items disappearing.
---
could be they're just disappearing "normally" and the fact they were named is just a coincidence, but still.
---
Dude looks nice as! Jealous
---
ESO has text chat. There's no reason why Fallout 76 shouldn't.
---
Scrap mole miner suit scraps.
---
Same, over time lost all sympathy whatsoever for their case so I left. The stuff I hear about them in other subs only makes me more confident in my decision. That place is a reeking shithole in the most literal sense imaginable.
---
Actually, you don't get loot if your turrer kills a target without you tagging it.
---
For example, if a turret at my camp (not at Whitesprings) kills a mob when I zone in, it's empty of loot.
---
There are tokens also in the Whitesprings Laundry room too.
---
If you create a game that is essentially co op PVE it's to be expected that the majority of people who play it will be interested in that. Focusing on survival mode and less restrictive PVP is a great way to bring in the players who felt let down by adventure mode. Whatever the numbers are a lot more players are going to be here for the PVP now that we can enjoy the game too.
---
Oh what a feeling
---
i met few people on the trading discord that has 2 accounts :D
---
Adhesive and screws ;)
---
This mere level 33 will take some of them caps off your hands, you know, just to help you out...
---
Game is too easy....in general. Deathclaw or not deathclaw.
---
IDK I read a good portion of that thread and there were a lot of people pointing out the cause of the problem- the economy is tanked- and it kinda says a lot when the major issue that people are discussing is that and not server crashes, glitching enemies or disappearing teammates
---
Except neither his or mine are two shot and they both break insanely fast.
---
Maybe you'd know that if you had an explosive gun that wasn't duped af
---
Socially anxious sheepsquatch was to afraid to initiate a conversation, and you killed him...
---
I hope you're proud.
---
What aboult people farming vertibots during double weekend xp? I grinded my levels for 1000 hrs, and i feel cheated when some duderinos getting 400lvls in one weekend
---
Unrealistic? I've found tons in vendors as have many others. It is why I buy any 3* sold to vendors.
---
autos break fast, this is a fact of life. especially if it's a 10mm. it's not necessarily because of explosive.
---
or maybe you have low luck and got one with low durability on top it.
---
&gt;Maybe you'd know that if you had an explosive gun that wasn't duped af
---
what does that have to do with anything? duped or not, they function the same.
---
And here i am level 25 with 300 caps thinking wtf who has that amount of caps oO
---
Ok I'm a noob.
---
That needs to be set to Yakety Sax
---
I have a keyboard hooked up to my PS4
---
I agree.
---
I know what I said.
---
That's why they stagger so hard, cause of their excessively large paws
---
Another name for a cvnt.
---
Depends on the workshop you target. Go for those that take the ammo shop and the fusion core shop. They are rarely not taken.
---
So you don't remember how many acts were in the game, and you expect me to be surprised you didn't know the story if you couldn't even remeber how many acts are in the game?
---
It may break immersion for you but Mics break immersion for me. You know that whole thing where everybody is not the same...
---
I dunno why we even have PvP in this game. The first time i went to Survival Mode was just to get Action Hero. I was put on 3rd place on leaderboard just because there were only two players. Took several hops to find a server with 3 people. It felt pretty cool to be the only person who isn't shown on the map tho xD As for Hunter/Hunted i've never seen it in action in 850 hours. There is an occasional one guy tuning in but thats about it.
---
That sucks, unfortunately you'll have to play without mods.
---
To add to that it would be extremely helpful to communicate with other people in the game since I do not use Mic nor ever will
---
Average things will go in player vending machines.   The good stuff will trade online.
---
Let's say it's not a global text chat. Let's say it's something like a mail system build in your pip boy, where every friend and someone on the same server could write to you. Like your friend in game is on other server and he/she can dm you with "hey, I have a Sheepsquarch event on me". Or it is not a global, but local chat, so when you meet someone and they don't wanna use their mic. they can communicate by text chat - a bubble that appears above them, so you can still use mic, but other person that can't can still communicate. Wouldn't it be nice?
---
Ban certain words, auto detect different phrases, and let players have a simple report system of: Spam, harassment, inappropriate. Take those reports say 6+ in a single world and silence that player from public chat for 5 minutes, for the rest of that play time, and then for 24 hours after repeated offenses. Outside of building the UI, moderation could be be done in no time.
---
I wouldn't.  I did have a two-shot pump shotgun, but you couldn't hit the broadside of a barn at point blank range.  Sold that sucker right quick.
---
Hehe, same here.
---
It's tricky and I don't understand it myself. But results speak, and my friend picked up two more Vamp Explo shotgun in the few weeks since he started curating his inventory/perks. Says he's not ready to talk about yet, cause he doesn't 100% understand it yet either.
---
got tse light machinegun from uranium feverm if this counts. almost 1100 hrs btw
---
... and bowling pins ... and bowling balls
---
... and bread baskets (4)
---
Note: surprisingly ‚Äúunused enamel bucket‚Äù does not give plastic, while regular enamel bucket does (strange chemistry there)
---
Outstanding!
---
Maybe it's just confirmation bias, but I've seen a bit more bloodied gear and weight reduction gear recently.
---
Problem is, about 90% of players on survival mode are not there for pvp. They are litally the ultimate solo players who don't even want to see player icons on the map. Most of the sessions I join are filled with players with 0 kills and if someone manages to get the kill, and bacome the 1st place on the leaderboard with 1 kill, they immediately kill self so they are not shown on the map and it's back to zero kill session again
---
It must take a while to type with a controller. I'll make a note to give it a try.
---
Or they could just add the text chat mod already made for the game that works just fine.
---
Yes! I have been wanting this since beta.
---
 It would be nice to have a way to communicate with other people on my server since I have currently no way of doing that. It is near impossible to communicate with the emotes we have.
---
 Right now I completely ignore every single person in the game because I have no way to communicate with them. 
---
I am one of those people it will never get a Mic because it is extremely immersion breaking to hear little squeaky kids.  Last thing I want to do when I play video games is listen to other people talk.
---
So yes please, bring on a server wide chat.
---
 Global chat would be too messy and too many Spammers.
---
Nah, again - this thought occurred to me while watching people loot each other's bags at the Impostor event.
---
My pc runs sound to my surround sound system. I literally can't do voice chat without massive feedback or have to use a headset which would be very subpar compared to my sound system.
---
A dropped paper bag from a player death should be distinctly different from those dropped voluntarily. Seems silly that there would be an argument for something otherwise.
---
&gt; 5: Scorched Cryptids?
---
The Mothman can spawn as a scorched version.
---
I was thinking bout this the other day.  It feels like Bethesda want to keep it as 'real' as possible with the whole no-NPCs, voice chat only etc.  I get it but it made me wonder if being able to write notes would work?  That way, people can communicate non-verbally but it's a bit more inkeeping with the Fallout vibes.  Could even stick a note in a paper bag when trading or pin a note to a tree next to a CAMP vending machine.
---
Would have to have a cap, I suppose, maybe 10 active notes per player or something.
---
I think it would work really well.
---
Imagine being able to voice record holotapes as well!  Would really bring the RPG element to life.  But, obviously, that one would be very hard to moderate...
---
That's a great question. I am of the opinion that items dropped voluntarily \_should\_ appear differently from those that are dropped on death. Much like the gift box emote we just got.
---
What negatives? How would not being able to communicate be better than being able to communicate?
---
He can? I've never seen it.
---
Fair enough. And that's fine.
---
Personally I'm hoping that NW in the next DLC wave is hardcore survival pve, like the Frost/Horizon mods from Fallout 4. I really enjoy co-op where failure is a real possibility (RIP Rend), so something like co-op Horizons would be a wetdream.
---
I don't need new ways to kill people. I'd like to see people on Adventure have a way to recover things they lost by dying around unscrupulous opportunists (like myself).
---
This is why I think it's important to create a distinction between 'death bags' and 'gift bags'.
---
Bethesda thinks this game deserves more money than they already got. Make your game good and fun, and then charge money. Gameplay first, money later. Beat it into your "we need more money at any cost" people's heads
---
I'm with you, comrade. I am frustrated. It often feels like they are doing things like these challenges to encourage community building while preventing any sort of persistence that would allow us to truly build communities on servers. It's dumb.
---
Grab all weapons from dead enemies and equip the scrapper perk before scrapping. It's easy to get a couple thousand steel.
---
This would require that the bags dropped voluntarily versus those from a dead player appear differently. Gift boxes or lunch boxes versus paper bags would make it pretty clear which is which.
---
Yeah: https://reddit.app.link/4kGmYGOmrW
---
Players getting the Scorched disease is an interesting idea, maybe it severely cripples your character (not so much that it makes the game unplayable, maybenthey lose 20% of their max health and makes Stimpacks heal half as much. They payoff could be that scorched arent as hostile towards you. Maybe low level scorched see you as friendly, but higher levels can tell you're not one of them. It could also give you unique quests that need you to go into scorched hives (nests? Wherever they hide away) and collect things. There could be wierd audio elements that have this terrifying voice that sounds like hundreds of voices all speaking to you, trying to force you to go places, you need to follow them but not submit to them in order to complete the quest(?)
---
Flagging for voluntarily dropped loot would be ridiculous and has nothing to do with what I'm suggesting but I am taking for granted that we would need a clear way to determine whether a bag was from a body or a gift. Clarified in the OP.
---
This game never ceases to amaze me
---
In Eso theres group chat. You can chat to another person , your guilds , the group or the zone your in
---
I kinda hope one day that we can look back on the people of the fallout sub and see them eating their words in a big way. I mean there will always be the usual New Vegas fanboys but they'll be too busy jerking each other off on the outer worlds sub.
---
All these people saying PvP was not wanted. 
---
One question for you. Why is Assassin‚Äôs Sentinel the most sought after set?
---
Seems to be an issue with Ryzen. I have a Ryzen 7 so I shouldn't really be having issues but here we are... I'll try your solution today.    
---
    
---
I feel like this issue extends beyond internet ports though. I notice freezes mostly when people are using Explosive weapons, primarily laser weapons. The freezes become more frequent around Power Armor users (targeting HUD glitch?)
---
Or maybe you could just join them and go around killing people. Some players do that anyway.
---
I play a few hours a day usually. Logged in today; "okay, i can do... One of these"
---
I can't really say much about it being brown when fo3 was nothing but grey and green lol
---
I think my first "decent" drop was a lvl 25 medics explosive combat rifle with better vats aim that I found At like level 20 that I used up to like level 40.
---
People don't sell because of cap limits. Having a lot of good loot is caused by not selling.
---
Yeah, that's true about the armor. Yet you're making it seem like everyone with good loot lists are illegitimate.
---
#BringDeathclawGroupsBack
---
Yeah. Lately its been pretty dead
---
Tried to post this same thing sadly no one read it lol. I'm all for a text chat , unless you have it friends playing fo76 without one you end up alone 100% of the time and tbh the solo experience really sucks sometimes
---
He can yes
---
All the Cryptids can get converted if they are crop dusted 
---
Also, we **can‚Äôt** get the scorched disease, that‚Äôs like, our first main mission, getting inoculated, lol
---
I'm referring to damage, though. That's the major downside of TS.
---
You don't even need to do that, just spec into Rifleman and you can one-shot glowing Deathclaws with a non-legendary Dragon.
---
Vaccines don't work if you already have the disease, and the player has already come into contact with Scorched by then.
---
Is medics explosive vats % super common? Cause I found a lvl 25 combat rifle with those exact legendary mods and thought I had used up my luck on that drop.
---
I am level 150 I have found a lot of two shot weapons a lot of explosive weapons but never both on the same weapon.
---
I figured I might as well kill a nearby deathclaw the other day even though I could've easily avoided it, so they're definitely less scary than they used to be.
---
Sir this is by far the best post about challenges. Have my up
---
Thanks mate, will give it a shot and see how I go
---
Yeah I get that regarding the colour but new Vegas, aside from the strip, was pretty much empty. I'm not saying new Vegas Is a bad game. I enjoyed what i played of it. But its defo not the pinnacle of gaming like people make out it is
---
Lvl 60 now I think, Xbox, have seen 1, TSE Tesla rifle, unreal.
---
'I want to earn it' aka play until the RNG rolls a TSE  drop? You can try but you'll probably get bored with the game if you're after a specific drop. I'd just recommend buying one.
---
Good luck.
---
If 25k is the max because of stability issues they should give us nuka cola quantum caps worth 100/1000 caps each
---
Same. It'll be great when we can actually build interesting camps
---
I loved the Museum of Witchcraft and its deathclaw. It was terrifying.
---
Nah youll notice a big difference between the RNG of Xcom 1 and 2. Also you can't reload like that unless save scumming is on, and tbh that takes 100% of the difficulty away from the game.
---
Lvl 117 here and the only explosive legendaries I've ever seen are the one griefers shoot me with
---
I haven‚Äôt missed the point of my own comment at all. Instead of just throwing this under the rug half the time we should be honest with ourselves and try and get more change instead of what we do now. For example internet historian recently made a video on 76 and the response here was pure ignorance, defending the game no matter what. This sub is so inconsistent and lost at times that I can see why no significant change is really being made. Everyone complains for a week and then acts as if nothing happened and will just overhype what‚Äôs coming next.
---
I feel the same way but think the PVP restriction takes away from it a bit, I hope NW is brutal but I'd be so gutted if it forced the slap system and other adventure mode mechanics. I think it's more than likely it will be structured how it is now with both server options.
---
I've fallen for my railway rifle... just a shame it's standard! I will find a unique one day!
---
The best is the choo-choo :)
---
Damn Yoshi has let himself go..  
---
Nice picture as well. :)
---
I noticed this. Insane.
---
God rolls are subjective. I've had everything from Assassin's/Sentinel's armour to AA/+Swing speed/+1 STR melee weapons drop, and the only one I cared about was the \* Instigating Hunting Rifle. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
could you list those 1-stars?
---
I've found whole sets of sent gear at vendors. Not all at the same time just random selling them to vendors. So sent gear isn't that rare.
---
I've somewhere between 3 and 400 hours, and I've gotten 3? TSE guns, I think.  2 of them 2stars, just TS and E.
---
One is hunting rifle, max level, came from the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Very nearly pooped myself when I realized she dropped me such fat loots.
---
One is handmade, also 2stars.  Came from 3 star robot in Watoga, when Watoga could 3star robots.
---
Cant remember last one, I dont use it.  It takes up space in my stash until I can Vending Machine it.
---
We have to thank the dupers though, the duped weapons brought so much joy to everyone that owned one.
---
I still have all my stuff. Granted I didn't stockpile loads of the same thing. But my jetpack (lost the original in a bug which pissed me the fuck of hence why I found a duper in the first place) but I was given a groknak axe, TSE minigun, and a bunch of other stuff which I've given away by now. But I have all my duped ammo, fusion cores, scrap, guns, and mods still. They really only hit the people who had tons of copies of the same thing. My guess is most people are still using duped weapons.
---
That's due to the nerfs to them. Not because they all got deleted. You could keep all kinds of duped items just by having different mods on them. So if you modded each one differently you could have kept hundreds of them.
---
I'm almost 100, still not owning a single explosive weapon, actually not even seen it once in the stores as all, I do hope the new legendary vendor will provides me such chance though :&lt;
---
Some really great ideas there, hope someone at BGS sees this!
---
I didn't say they sucked, I said New Vegas has an infinitely better ending than 3
---
It also seems like there were a lot of features and content that were cut for stability...
---
Why didn't you mention this before? Then again, why in hell would you want this? What if you got killed during an SBQ fight, dropped your junk, someone who's a better player picks it up, kills you the second you respawn? You do realize spawn points are fixed during events right? All he has to do is pick up your junk and aim at respawn point. Don't tell me the you get to shoot first before the looter can do any damage to you.
---
I've tried countless times and never been able to join a match.
---
&gt; Upon launch, Fallout 76 debuted at third place in the UK's all-format sales charts, behind Spyro Reignited Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2.
---
No, there are still dupes that work but they aren't easy and they aren't new. Just like how they patched spam disarming traps back near the beta it's back in the game. Likewise one of the old dupes is also back. 
---
Also, not all duped gear was deleted, just putting any type of mod on the gear makes it so it wouldn't be deleted. So if you have 500 guns duped and don't want to lose them you'd only need to put a unique mod layout on each and they'd all be safe.
---
There is mercenary groups you can hire. Find them on trading subs
---
Jesus Christ you people really bitch about everything, don‚Äôt you?
---
Whats your gripe? If you didn't want PvP then don't play it. Why even complain?
---
I‚Äôm waiting for the inevitable ‚ÄúShare and follow Bethesda social media‚Äù challenge.
---
With how PvP is balanced in Fallout you should definitely be more scared of someone outside of power armor.
---
All my weapons and armor are renamed and I play this game more than 99% of people. I've not lost anything. My opinion on the matter is that power armor pieces are whats going missing (if anything) and anything else is player error.
---
My main Food Source in 76 is Deathclaw meat, since one spawns by my base!
---
**Deathclaws in 76**: Well is this going to eat up some bullets. Well, at least I'll get some crafting material out of it.
---
**Deathclaws in 3/NV**: Guess I'll die.
---
If you turn on the Poseidon Power Plant, then the power box inside the Food Cannery Workshop will power up the machine to make food without taking all that space with generators.
---
and duping might not even be fixed, I came across accidental duping a few days ago. Reported it to bethesda and not telling anyone about it, but if it can happen by accident then who fucking knows.
---
Also something should honestly be done about bounty baiting imo
---
The issue with PvP right now is that there's nothing to do. There's no additional events with interesting game modes that use PvP as a feature, so it's not fully realized yet.
---
Seen plenty of two shots, that got nerfed to all hell, but never got an explosive to spawn!
---
Like Mattola, I‚Äôm 178 and have seen lots of 2-shots drop as well as maybe 6 exploding variant weapons but never, EVER a TSE.
---
Small consolation, but reading the comments here tells me I‚Äôm not alone...
---
Buy some things. I‚Äôm sure there are still weapon plans you could learn, serum recipes to buy, building plans to learn (especially the pricy ones at Whitespring). Surely there‚Äôs stuff to buy, and you‚Äôll make those caps back easily when vending arrives.
---
Yep. One hit and if you aren't already running and don't have jump height to dodge the next, you're dead because I believe their attack rate is far too fast so they permastun you.
---
Yeah, got to do something with em.
---
I say if you die and drop your crap and someone loots it that's a reasonable death penalty. I'ts not like your losing anything valuable. (unless you're one of those silly heavy bois who walks around continually over loaded and never fast travels.) 
---
and besides implementing all this extra data on loot bags would potentially generate even more lag in an already laggy mess. (queen fights sheepsquatch fights etc.) 
---
not once have I cared if I lost my loot bag, generally I get excited about the tussle going on and forget to even loot it so whoever picks it up is welcome. I am overflowing with junk anyways. 
---
I think yongo is the most right about this scenario I think players would just find away to use it to grief new / inexperienced players.
---
[snallygaster caught me too \( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞\)](https://imgur.com/CH0CatG)
---
270. Seen easily 15+ two-shots. About 6 explosive. Never one with both
---
Yis, but you shouldn‚Äôt have come into contact with the progenitors before you get jabbed
---
(Obviously you can if you ignore the MQ and go faffing, but considering how early you do and that there are no fissures and, I can‚Äôt recall ever seeing a SB in forest; I would assume the ‚Äòlore‚Äô should be, we‚Äôre vaccinated against the tree-rot
---
Because lots of other legendaries are better than BE. Instigating explosive, furious explosive, etc. Bloodied is kind of overrated at this point.
---
Do you want to know the spawn points on the server? I had to look it up on YouTube the other day to figure it out.
---
Wow, you're just going to side step reasoned debate and double down with a string of logical fallacies? I won't bother then. Tell you what, I'm going to go and do something more constructive and enjoyable, there's a wall i could go and bang my head against. If you want you can reply with some more straw men, or a few ad hominems and I won't say a word. I really can't be arsed.
---
One thing though, your post (in general) is a bit of a mess so I'm not sure who you're replying to with the disability comments, but that's kind of a shitty attitude, accusing others of using disability as a dirty word when no one did is a whole load of post-truth nonsense. Don't sink that low.
---
It's a nice idea that'll never happen
---
Seen super Mutants do that under floors!
---
I work with teams of developers on a daily basis. Most are contractual in order to not only save the company from having to pay healthcare but so that they're easily replaced without cause. Not to mention they're paid shit for the amount of work they put in. The glory usually goes to the heads of the department and suits that ARE in fact permanent employees who get paid well beyond their usefulness. These are the dopes you normally see on panels. When you're a contract developer you don't have any say. You just do what you're told or you're gone. That said, let's be real, no developer working on a game this size wants it to be labeled as a "dumpster fire".
---
We need to build out the social aspect of the game. More team based coop. More events that bring players together.
---
Becausr bloodied is overrated, especially for shotgun, the best shotgun is furious explosive combat shotgun with an auto receiver. Because each pellet stacks the furious effect.
---
I did get a sweet BE 10mm smg from AWOL armaments that I main with on my commando. The only BE I‚Äôve gotten to drop.
---
To the sad people that have never played an online RPG go farm stuff and stop complaining that people who are better at the game have more caps than you jeez... see so many being high and mighty ohhh la de dar u play the game with low level weapons and your fine.... no one cares especially people who know how to farm, trade and have better gear.  TSE Gauss for sale 40k caps please üòòüòò
---
Can you tl;dr this it's just a wall of text
---
I suck ass at math so i want to see someone calculate how much time it would take to get to max caps doing this assuming that lobby hopping takes 5 minutes and killing the wendigo takes 1 minute
---
Dupers broke pvp.  Lots of people with full pvp gear which without duping wouldn't be obtainable plus relevant perks
---
That was my hope as well: Legendary Mods.
---
Yes please!
---
Pretty much, half of my explosives have been berserkers, the other half have been medics.
---
If you did the main quest this wouldn't work
---
&gt; And it still has bugs out the asshole. 
---
Like every other game on the market.
---
I run with v-sync off via the control panel and it does not change when I launch the game. You can tell with the FPS counter.
---
You have more patience than me sir.
---
I think he means just explosive effect, since the person he is responding to szid he never found any explosive legendaries. Finding 10 TSE would be crazy and most likely impossible.
---
That's why I said a help up and not a handout. My only concern is that it will give to much to frequently. We dont want every lvl 100 running around with maxed end game gear either.  I agree the queen can feel not worth the effort alot of the time but at least we all feel that pain together.
---
Nop after paladin its elder and its the same dark base with white detail instead of red
---
The problem is there's nothing to do. It's just a one shot spawn kill play at train stations.
---
where did you find this information?
---
Odd that medic or zerkers would be tied to the explosive effect.
---
I'd be ok with that
---
any one who uses being lgbt and thinking the metoo movement is important as an argument against someone deserves to be "verbally" ripped to shreds

Drunk and tired is how I live my life. That sucks about your guns though. I've left power fists inside of dead scorched before..but that was to be humorous.

DC Universe Online has server wide chat. No moderation is required, as the algorithms within the game do not allow bad language. I'm sure a similar thing can be used for F76. Also, if anyone is being abusive, it would be the same as area chat, screenshots can be taken and reported.
---
Anyone know a good area, maybe on a cliff, in a relatively pretty part of the map? Im gonna have to sacrifice my water purifiers but i want to be in a nice spot.
---
I have really become addicted this game since I started playing. Whenever it is the weekend I just wanna go play it so bad that my insides are burning despite knowing I have work to do for school. I have probs spent over 300 hours playing this game in every bit of spare time I had including around 8 hours every day in two week holidays. When you are playing the game, it is very satisfying but after you have played 8 or more hours in one day you end up thinking: 'what have I done? I just wasted a whole day of my real life on a video gameüò© ' Even after this you still want to play some more fallout 76. The addiction is so uncontrollable
---
&gt;! https://y.yarn.co/44a29df4-b86d-47bc-818a-0a87195cff54\_text.gif !&lt;
---
No, no, no, that's not how you do it
---
and the ones before paladin arent darker aswell?
---
ty for the response, i just moved back into my bos t-60. just have to stay out of the sun \^\^
---
No.  No they shouldn't.
---
packaging releases is harder than just oh that's broke here you go. it shouldn't be but it is. bug fixing also reduces your new feature capacity and can fuck up a roadmap if enough capacity isnt allowed for it. 
---
modders have an advantage here for sure as they dont have features to worry about or lots of changes to sync from other teams. they see something broke they fix it and release very agile but not very scalable

\*/shakes cane\* "back in my day in ultima online when you died all your crap stayed on your body, people could kill you loot you dismember your corpse and wait for you to show back up to try and claim it. and thats not even counting you had to wander around in ghost form till you found a healer or another player willing to res you, so then you get ressed and your naked except for a grey robe which marks you as freshly ressed. so you have to go back into the area of dangerous things naked and unarmed exept for a starting dagger. a place full of dangerous things that already killed you when you were fully armed. and even then you only had so long before your body dissappeared and was gone forever, oh and also the npc mobs would loot crap from you as well!  gamers today are missing out by having these extremely light death penalties, yes dying sucked so badly in UO but that also meant winning meant so much more. all you young protected noobs of this generation shake your head and are like " no way that sounds horrible" but when dying sucks that badly, when screwing up can cost you everything. by god you are not bored and just smashing through content while having a chat on the phone . you get super invested in the tough fights and you pay attention. so much more immersive. and the wins. so much sweeter. this whole thread just seems like a silly petty thing to worry about and I hope to god devs focus on making my ghoulnado instead. thats right radioactive unstoppable tornado spitting out radiated ghouls while traveling a randomly generated path of death destruction and glorious chaos. Peeps are like "oh my that sounds terrible" but trust me oh shit moments make up the best memories in any game.

Ha

Here‚Äôs a link with a few of the upcoming weapons on it, it lists what the challenges involve too so it‚Äôs quite handy:
---
https://www.vgr.com/fallout-76-survival-mode-challenge-weapons/
---
True but we‚Äôre talking the majority here....
---
The initiate, knight, knight sgt, knight cpt are a light base grey. The officer, paladin and elder are the darker base greys
---
266, 500+ hours played, and I've found two of them.  A pipe rifle and a double barrel shotgun.  They happen, it's just rare.  On the other hand, the only Unyielding / Sentinel / AP armor I've found was a level 20 leather leg ;/
---
At this point anyone in power armor is a free kill.
---
You want no enemy spawns?  Place the camp on the top of Seneca Mt peak.  The bigger one has place for crops.   Building there can be a hassle but you can put a lot of crops down if you place the camp correctly
---
But..but.. you can also add the Bobbleheads you have found (an d only the ones you have found) to the stand in Fallout 4.  I am conpuzzled.
---
There was a separate... Incident... A lot of peoples BETA preloads just got wiped when the BETA started. It was quite the piss take, a lot of people had to download it twice.
---
what
---
Outside of the text chat mod how does one send a message on pc to other players?
---
sorry you are a slow reader you don't have to bother your brain about it its all good.
---
most of those seem terrible except for the gauntlet tbh
---
Pretty much this.
---
Well im on xbox so this is time to say:   
---
PC masterrace = PC masterbates
---
Every PvP person I meet is complaining about the lack of rewards, so they are in it for the caps, junk and aid!
---
 Trading posts are no longer allowed in [r/Fo76](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fo76), see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bigeay/meta_trading_posts_are_no_longer_allowed_on_rfo76/).
---
Shhhhh.  They're watching.
---
Well when they announced this game they promised a solo player would be able to do everything in the game. So being forced to socialize when they were told they wouldn't have to annoys people.
---
I don't really like the idea of global chat, but what about a local chat system that included everyone at a given location?
---
Tbf my point still stands. 600 hours and 2 explosive weapons is the definition of rare. Especially when probably 300 hours have been specifically legendary farming
---
No, not like every other game on the market. And what a fucking awful excuse regardless.
---
Que the violins
---
Yes, absolutely. There have been countless times when my friends and I are playing and either one of our mics die, or simply aren't working. I would love to have an in-game chat (for friends/team, NOT public).
---
Last time I tried this I put the wrong disc in and played Battlefront for 3 hours before I noticed I wasn't in Appalachia.
---
Still banging on about this? I‚Äôd admitted there could be legitimate reasons for text chat and if implemented correctly it would be a good thing - but on most other games it‚Äôs been implemented poorly. As for losing your rag and searing at me because I disagree with your ideals is verging on insanity...
---
It was pointed out in the previous post to my reply that I then replied to, that disability is the only reason I thought text chat should be implemented... the replier then listed many social disabilities as well as physical disabilities in his reply...
---
I‚Äôd like to know you‚Äôre background on this knowledge as I tend to go by the government (I‚Äôm a resident of the United Kingdom) and the dictionary‚Äôs definition of disability as well as talking to a trained mental health professional, my partner of eleven and a half years!
---
So far as I can tell, your reply had no basis in fact or any particular point, apart from to throw around some spin doctor speech and avoid conforming to any particular decision either way. At least I know my own reasoning and have been open to debate, furthermore willing to listen...
---
So kindly go forth and multiply before you find yourself up a well known creak without a certain implement.

---
Too Long. Didn't Read. Frequently used acronym by lazy, ignorant people in Internet Forums, where their urge to type something exceeds their ability to read¬†. 
---
dang urban dictionary is savage.
---
The game is 100% playable and nothing to gamebreaking. Other games have also bugs and more gamebreaking (i am talking about online games mostly.).
---
Autos break fast yes. But I also have the same 10mm gun not explosive same mods and everything and it lasts 3-4 times longer than the explosive one.
---
That's the problem. They don't want players to be able to earn them. They just want to be able to claim that atom can be earned in game, while making it nearly impossible to actually complete them.
---
The earlier ones still have a little of that rusted look to them. IMO...the elder paint looks more grey, and has the white accents instead of the red, like said above.
---
It looks more pained and less like metal, especially out in the sun:) its not as flashy tho, if that what ur going for
---
Well ofcourse you think its player error when you havent lost anything. You sound extremely arrogant, care to explain how my tse .50cal dissappearing from my inventory between logins is ‚Äùplayer error‚Äù

xX_SniperExpolit69_Xx dropped three thousand seven hundred and nineteen of them on the ground a few months back. Did you not get one?

and you used tldr incorrectly. you just say tldr to tell me my wall of text was to long. youre basically telling me my text is to long for myself to read which makes no sense because obviously I vcan go on for days about nothing and extend simple sentances into excruciating lines of text for those without the patience wit and savvy to keep up.
---
The scorched plague is not a disease its a parasite. If it hits you, you are already dead ,like a zombie
---
I'm not really sure if its tied to it or if they're just more common drops. Each legendary affix doesn't have the same drop rate. I get TS the least often for primary affixes now, even though it's no longer that good unless paired with explosive. I get medics, nocturnal, berserkers, mutant and mutant slayers the most often.
---
same  
---
well, then I finished the legendary one on survival after I sold all those healing items...
---
Why not? I finished the main quest a few months ago and haven't really got back into the game for more than a browse at the updates.
---
You're right.  It should have released highly polished in July 2019 and walked off with GOTY.
---
I have a certain amount of time in my day
---
Are you having a fit, mate?
---
Mostly what I do.
---
I was alot lower lvl back then and i wanted one......

Current roster

Gorione

---
Wtb automaton
---
I'm with you on that one, I still feel like those aspects you are mentioning could be a cause, as many people seem to report SBQ / Cryptid freezes have those in common. I just noticed (so far) that opening those ports with the router seem to have brought on a smoother experience, but obviously I'll make sure to keep this thread updated if / when I experience SBQ / Cryptid freezes.
---
More like kf they want us to socialize then add in text chat.
---
Last time I was one, I found that just giving someone the 'thumbs up' transported me 100m away from where I was and the graphics screwed up.
---
Not nearly as fun as Nukashine...
---
\*fast travels to Deathclaw Island\*
---
Well that‚Äôs true. There‚Äôs stuff to buy. But atm for me it‚Äôs more like ‚Äúif I have to, I‚Äôll buy‚Äù-stuff. But you‚Äôre right.
---
I would love to have atleast local chat, this would promote communication a bit more when  players meet and also provide a better platform for Role Playing.
---
we all have exactly 24 hours in a day its universal. why are you wasting time chatting at me? go be busy my slow reading friend o/ gbye have fun now o/
---
alright ty. ill stay with the paladin then.
---
People have been asking for this since release, would help with player trading, communicating with those who dont want to talk over mic etc... doesnt seem like it's a priority for the team sadly
---
No worries, I've stuck with my paladin paint aswell it looks the best, the elder paint has white instead of red it doesn't look as good
---
Ive seen houses Next to Charleston station there's a ploughed field with a tractor and water pool and vendor .
---
F
---
Nuclear Winter and Nuclear Warfare? Who knows. More options is probably good, right?
---
Ive got text chat mod so not really an issue, just kind of dumb to need a mod to complete parts of the game. My point was that if they are going to require us to group up then they need to add text chat.
---
Also why would I want to go play on a console and lose my ultrawide resolution?
---
Kinda backwards, I know I‚Äôm at a disadvantage in Power Armor but it‚Äôs not the only problem with PvP in my opinion.
---
yes i do like the red highlights from the paladin paint. combined with the red tactical helmet. was hoping to find a really black paint like the nukashine (or the blackbird i was never able to get :/ ).
---
but im happy with the paladin style. its like you said only in very bright areas where it looks grey. in most areas, inside buildings etc. it is really dark. not as black/dark as the nukashina, but i can live with that.
---
FO76 isn't an mmo tho
---
I like the look of 51 and 60 the best.
---
I run Fireproof Rank 3, full X-01, and even hitting an enemy for a total Suppression effect of +50%, they can still kill me in the blink of an eye.
---
Sounds great, I wish I had someone reliable to play with regularly.
---
Just a question tho: With what weapons/build can two, maybe four players kill a queen in less than ten minutes?
---
Platform?
---
Just have a spam cool dow
---
yes i had the elder paint before the paladin paint. painted from a nice dude from this reddit. but after running around in elder i wanted to change to paladin because of the red highlights \^\^
---
Seems it is based on character names, as medic isn't common for me. I actually get explosive secondary more often than medics. I've only ever found that single medics gun, my most common first effect Seems to be vampires.
---
Whichever get the highest price will be the most popular for sure.
---
I might buy atoms to get the nukashine.
---
Love my blackbird though :)
---
It would not surprise me to see them periodically come up again maybe 1/ year
---
They should definitely increase the number- like 5 that can be done solo and 5 that require others
---
I agree, an easy fix on Bethesda‚Äôs end would be removing the loss of caps on failing to kill a wanted player.
---
I hope it's not censored unless its hate speech, I don't see why they couldn't allow basic swears. It's an m rated game
---
The crickets in this game are like a thousand times stronger than death claws. Something is wrong here.
---
What platform are you on? I'm doing a union soldier build and I'd be really interested in buying that.
---
does it even work still? i thought bethesda changed it so you only get xp from turret kills if you got a hit in on the enemy ?
---
Use Port Triggering, not Port Forwarding, if your router supports.
---
PS4, sorry.  I would like to note I got on this morning at 6 and the large majority of the glitchiness was not there which is promising.
---
Duecehead?
---
One smack of a hammer will one shot them.
---
Oh yeah. Other games do it. That makes it ok. Right?
---
No. It doesn't. Just because other devs are shit, does not make it ok for Bethesda to be shit, too.
---
Both are extremely cheap to repair
---
It is not like this sub is anything better. Punch of delusional tards who think F76 is good. Anytime some one says something negative but true, things get down voted.
---
So when is Fallout 76 coming to Steam and when is it going to be &lt;¬£7.99?
---
T51b has the highest stats in Physical Damage Resistance and Energy Resistance (with 514 in both, compared to the 513 of ultracite and x-01 respectively) but the lowest Radiation Resistance of all the PAs (even Raider), so its considerably the best PA for day-to-day non-nukezone gameplay.
---
And T60, except for the badass looks, the lore-bond with the Brotherhood of Steel (who doesnt want to be Part of these Badasses?), it's dirt cheap to repair.
---
Too late for that.
---
You should try this build with the Fixer gun;) sure that it will rock))
---
Super build by the way
---
Oh I agree with you there it is not the only problem. PvP could use some future balancing.
---
T51 has the highest DR in the game
---
T60 is stupidly cheap to repair
---
Damage reduction while standing or moving.
---
That makes absolutely no sense... so you're probably right knowing how bethesda does shit lol.
---
PC here, can‚Äôt speak for PS4.  I can tell you that the game is sensitive to network bandwidth and latency, so if it happens again try resetting everything - console and router (if that‚Äôs under your control).   I was having weird issues on PC and reset everything and issues went away.  It probably had something to do with cached entries not in sync with their CDN or something. Or maybe not.  Lol
---
Thanks for clearing it up. I definitely agree with you too the t60 is badass it‚Äôs the best looking power armor in my opinion
---
This entirely. I love that sub and it's one of the few where you aren't bombarded with nastyness the minute you admit enjoying the game. I'd so much rather deal with joyful homerism than the absolute nastyness that is most of Reddit, alone the FO subs.
---
Agreed
---
Most likey a scam
---
Get your caps mule on, pay me then pay the rest when you get your main on
---
Yeah, I remember the great ‚ÄúDupening‚Äù.
---
I got one at a vender once and I've never had one drop normally.
---
Yep.
---
Meh, I got banned from AITA for pointing out that insulting and belittling someone is abusive. Don't take some short dick shit bag's bad mood personally.
---
Lv 191 here never found a TSE gun ... I found only 2 explo gun in my grind.... what a shame...
---
More than one character.
---
Thanks for the extra info. From what I get from this:  [https://www.draytek.com/.upload/pdffiles/c08336eafb1c0d80f8ed387bd9946211.pdf](https://www.draytek.com/.upload/pdffiles/c08336eafb1c0d80f8ed387bd9946211.pdf) 
---
Doesn't it mean only the one device will be able to use said ports, limiting port access to only one device / IP at any one time?
---
Shhhhhh! Don't tell the parishioners, they think the bowl contains Holy Water ;) Hic. Unfortunately there is no Goblet or Grail in the C.A.M.P. inventory.
---
Thanks for the tip! I'll give it a shot. I am really hopeful!
---
Same as me :(
---
Does anyone like going out if their way to make a slick mix set? I myself like the t60/51 body pieces but prefer the xo1 helmet lol. I like having more of a unique look
---
For me personally, I just don‚Äôt think stat changes at all work when factored in. (Mutations/Leg. Effects/Perks) PvP should be an unknown or a dice-roll but not to that extent.
---
Yes, this too. 1000 hours is dedication, makes my 300 hours look tinyüëèüèº  I didn‚Äôt realise that people did that until I stumbled upon a few higher levels spawning them in at the ammo factory.  To start off with I didn‚Äôt understand why they were doing it. I fully get your frustration they need to adjust that.
---
Yes.  Do you have an IT background?  It will affect my next response since I am unsure detail level needed.
---
This is the type of thing we need on the gear store...
---
Yeah basically it uses the character name as a "seed" for their random algorithm. So some names actually are more "lucky" than others. Names with spaces ive heard are very unlucky. Here is more info if you're curious.
---
old.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/am84og/seeded_rng_theory_and_proof_fallout_76/
---
Yes after this post I know understand that they don‚Äôt get XP from the turret kills but still get loot which is still kinda unfair. Thanks for the info üòä
---
Same here
---
Ditto!
---
Lol aint that some shit. I probably have a good seed for armor. I used to get sent/cav like crazy... I haven't in a while though.
---
I think so. It's pretty crazy how divisive the whole adventure/survival mode thing is. I think both sides see the other as a threat to the development of the game they want to see. It will be interesting to see how content develops and whether we see a significant branching off. As an example people seem quite excited about player vending machines but I have no interest at all as I don't see them being viable in survival.
---
While I disagree with your opinion of New Vegas compared to 3, I find it to be something a a breath of fresh air in how you explain it. Bravo.
---
Do the quest lines.
---
They are designed to introduce new players to game mechanics and content.
---
The quest lines are created for low player levels.
---
Also, the quest lines ‚Äúshow you the world‚Äù.  Most of main locations and the ‚ÄúLore‚Äù of Fallout
---
You might not be missing any, these complete even by learning some on a new character
---
That would take real effort though
---
Interesting the next thing I need to do is to set up an FPS counter I Haven‚Äôt done so yet thanks for the info cheers
---
yeah sorry when i wrote the comment i didnt see there where already like ten people stating the same sorry for the redundant comment 
---
anyways you are completely right its bugging me whenever i see one of these stairway to heaven fortnite kind of monstrosities ruining my experience
---
They just need to add more scorched creatures into the mix as you come across groups outside of nuke zones. 
---
For example when you see a dozen scorched zombies patrolling an area they got a scorched deathclaw or megasloth  lurking/trailing with them like s pet to act as an enforcer. Should make for more intense engagement fights
---
Agreed lol
---
it was used as currency irl in the USA's cowboy days
---
I always have extra water so much I toss it most times
---
T51 also has a unique paint scheme found in game
---
Non binary gender fluid demi trans unicorn mutant. Don't you dare assume xe's gender, bigots. #cortez2020
---
Should have gave a damn about that armor piece.
---
The challenges make you feel like Napoleon Dynamite after herding chickens all day, only to find he made about a buck an hour
---
lvl 149. playing since the beta &amp; i‚Äôve never seen a tse drop. plenty of cool stuff along the way. 2 shots &amp; explosive weapons but never a tse. i don‚Äôt mind the grind for gear but i play more to play rather than ‚Äúfarming legendaries‚Äù
---
On my main character i am the same, but i only have 2 water purifiers. Im just trying to say that you probably get more water from one purifier than from five
---
There is a cap, search the subs...
---
Congratulations! I'm still hoping to come across a quad anything weapon...
---
Visit the vendor that sells expencive furniture
---
Don't forget Camps are going to become invulnerable soon, I've heard mostly from everyone it's on patch 9.
---
I barely have any caps so I will be loading mine right up.
---
 I don't use trade sites outside of the game so this vendor is much needed for me.
---
I got it Christmas 2010 on Xbox 360, and it was a buggy mess, but I loved it anyway. I was engaged in its world and story and kept coming back. The 360 and PC versions are mostly stable now (the PC version also has NVAC, NVSR, and the 4GB launcher patch), but the PS3 version still has a memory leak problem that can't be fixed afaik.
---
I resisted getting a microphone for months (I have 1200+ hours in the game). I got a microphone about 2 weeks ago. It was the best thing I have done. I have met some really cool gamers, and just being friendly will make you a lot of friends.
---
Yesterday, I went to Abandoned Bog Town for a "Defend" event. I killed everything before the owner got there. When he arrived, I think he thought I was going to challenge him for it, but that is not my style. You own it... it's yours until you leave. I was full of junk and asked "do you have a tinker's workbench?" He showed me where he moved it. We chatted for a few minutes, and I departed. I got about half-way down the road to The General's Steakhouse when I got a friend request. I turned around went back and eventually teamed with him. We played together all afternoon. IT WAS AWESOME.
---
Yes, you do encounter some folks whom you would rather not hear, but so far my experience has been so positive. Being able to ask someone do you need anything? Yes, I need lead, or steel, or plastic. I don't need anything generally so it is nice to help others out. Usually, they will ask if I need ammo. Most folks I run into are ballistic types so they don't have plasma cores. However, I do run across some folks who are level 2-20 who are storing tons of them with no idea what do with them. Just the act of giving someone 3 bulk aluminum and some adhesive resulted in about 20 plasma cores. All because we could communicate.
---
Emote morse code AKA pantomime works to some degree, but not like asking directly.
---
They would have all been on one server. Is OP on the same platform? How would they know where or when? 
---
Nice way to devalue somebody's good fortune. Just like everyone else who can't farm for shit and cries "duped" when they get plastered by anything explosive.
---
He's happy, let him be.
---
I don't buy anything because it feels like pay to win and not earned at all.
---
I got my first TSE after 600 hours played.
---
you people keep trekking around in your fancy schmancy suits and skins..me and my big yellow bulldozer will plod behind you, doing just fine, scooping up your leavings ;)
---
No way to do it without a mod from the Nexus. Then the other people would have to have it installed.
---
Its less to do with cheating and more do to with the fact that mods break the eula and TOS for using the game but you are right in that devs would likely not ban people for somthigs as harmless as a chat mod the blowback would be pretty bad on that one.
---
Eh i'll give it a try later on today and see what its like.
---
What are the plans people may have them sitting about if in game rewarded.
---
Ernest Heavygunner
---
Shirley Sniper
---
Mundungus Mule
---
Cesar Commando
---
Forget the fantastic 4 lol
---
Metal Picnic Table, Park Bench, and Sunburst Clock.
---
T51 with reactive plates is my everyday wear.
---
X01 for nuke zones or Excavator. 
---
Raider or T45 for low lvls.
---
T60 has my jet pack and easy to repair.
---
Wait do railway rifles benefit from rifle perks? Because I think they also benefit from my heavy weapons perks on my HW toon.
---
Fallout 76 is not a mmo it‚Äôs just like fallout 4 and 3 once you get enough perks and right weapons you kinda become a unkillable god I do admit some stuff is hard AF like imposter squach and stuff overall the game is not that hard I honestly think everything needs a buff all creatures even scorch
---
I addressed that in the post :)
---
Nothing to add
---
Yeah it does vary player to player. I remember during the beta when the launcher ate the game files... And then everyone on PC had to re-download the game.
---
Some were like 'I have a high end system and Google fiber! I'll have it re downloaded in a hour!'... Then Bethesda throttled the download speed and some people with 3000 dollar computers and Google fiber were suddenly reporting that the game said it would be finished loading in like 28 hours and some player with a crappy laptop and Comcast got it downloaded in 2 hours.
---
Completely random, hell people with great internet and great computers complain of long loading screens, disconnects, lag, etc etc. Some people have no problems with the game at all, but most do experience something with each patch.
---
Correction, only Mothmen, Wendigos, Snallygasters and Grafton monsters can be scorched. Flatwoods Monsters and Sheepsquatches cannot be scorched.
---
For me, it's the noise. I prefer listening for ghouls or other things. The directional audio in this game is one item people don't comment on, nor do most appreciate the efforts made by the devs. Not to mention the ambient audio. I play without the music, and it's gorgeous when using a good headset.
---
I don't think this is true whatsoever
---
Tried this yesterday and it was awesome! Imposter event, took a pylon in sneak mode and started to shoot robots. Turns out, I can melt them pretty easy and while I'm stealthed no one hits me, so my pylon was up all the event and there was no living robots around. Great feeling of being useful.
---
I don't have huge background when it comes to networking, just reading about it now and trying to understand it better. From what I'm reading it is easy to get confused as I see a lot of terminology being used that I'm not always familiar with, hence catching up on it slowly with a good cup of coffee :)
---
I heard that was the case for PVP, but for me, I only play PVE.
---
I'm not talking about sent. I'm talking about unyielding/sentinel/etc and assassin's/sentinel/etc. There's a massive, massive difference.
---
XBONE all the way. I switched from PS4 when playing FO4. The quality of the game on XBONE was better, as well as stability. I played through FO4 on PS4, then switched and did it all over many times on XBONE.
---
Oh launch was definitely a failure, I just didn‚Äôt want anyone to think I meant the game itself is a failure.
---
I have no problem remembering where I put things in game...now my keys, IRL, that's another matter..
---
Berry mentats are for pvp. Let's not make them useless by showing every dead thing on your screen, blocking the view with purple foggy shit.
---
Berry mentats are for locating stealthed enemies. Not for farming pve events.
---
I think wanting more than 20 hours to go through everything in the game isn't asking too much.
---
Still have graham?
---
Yes
---
I almost feel on larger items for sale people will just add the 10% on top of what they want. Items like ammo 1:1 sale be hard but not a big issue. Stims usually go for 8caps will now be 9,.. etc.  Won‚Äôt help but increase the cost I feel
---
Just like irl, taxes goes up, so does the cost of everyday items.
---
Sounds like 99% of the "Bethesda add this please" posts...
---
lmao - This comment deserves more upvotes.
---
I know, was just trying to point out the issue to the person I was replying to but they missed it.
---
I'm not **spreading** any **rumors**, but merely **asking** a legitimate question. I love my Shotgunner build and have played it since BETA. I think it's a legitimate question given the number of hours/levels I've invested on my main. Given there is no way to quickly re-spec my character, I think it's a question worth asking.
---
Pretty sure they both cause things to break faster, so when something is TSE it eats itself alive.
---
This is called random seed and its generated when encounter begins. Random aint usually random, its a semi-random value based on some criteria (i.e. number of moves that happened) the random seed, the chance, and produced exactly same result for exactly same criteria - so if you load and try again you gonna get same results.
---
In Civilization series "new random seed on reload" option allowed you to scumload your fights.
---
I usually do daily challenges as sidequests because I'm at the point in the game where there aren't really any quests left and challenges make me travel far and wide and play outside of usual playstyle.
---
It's not about the Atoms, it's about the challenge.
---
I'm a straight 2H melee build, and use max level T-51 almost exclusively. It offers the highest protection for normal and energy damage, and I soak up a lot of damage being a melee build. I use my max level excavator armor for nuke zones, both for the carry weight for flux/loot, and the extra rad protection vs. My daily use T-51.
---
Im also from Sweden but i play on ps4
---
Then play a PvP non RPG game.
---
There's a part of the mq where you develop a vaccine for the scorched plague.
---
on what console are you? if you got something to sell i would lile to take a look pls.. i‚Äòm on ps4 btw
---
You had me at "choo-choo" noise...
---
It's switchable through the settings. So if you don't mind swear words, you can switch it on.
---
I love it on survival lol. Its hilarious when someone tries PvP in PA.
---
Attans vilken otur att du spelade p√• ps4, vore kul att lira tillsammans annars!
---
Oh, that's fine then
---
Om man nn√•nsin kmr kunna spela p√• olika ett en tillsammans skulle det vara kul
---
Yes so am I. Especially assassin gear. A lot of  pve people just sell then as soon as they see assassins without looking at the rest.
---
Also lots of people who just plain, know what they're doing. Also I've gotten non duped PvP gear drop for me.
---
I read that in Tiny Tina's voice
---
Looks better than this does 6 months after release.
---
Ok, here‚Äôs the deal.   The essential difference between port forward and port trigger is the port forward is ‚Äúalways open‚Äù on the Internet side of the router, and port trigger will only activate the port forward when it sees the inside IP address on and receives traffic from the inside device.  So, if the trigger is not active, the router will not forward unsolicited incoming Internet matching traffic but drops it instead.   (There‚Äôs more to it, but that should suffice to get the idea across)  On the inside, the IP address specified to forward ‚Äúto‚Äù gets the forwarded packets that meet the criteria of the set.
---
And yes, both types send to one address per rule set, so static or reserved IP needed on the target device (PC, console, etc).  
---
My router / WAP (wireless access point) also gives out network IP addresses on the internal network so I setup a reserved IP address for my gaming PC and have specific port triggering rules setup to it only.  It‚Äôs also off when not in use.
---
Fancy sending me a list? üòÇ
---
Now you're not selling thomas or are you?
---
"it just works"
---
I use T60 it just looks the best I think and is cheap to repair. 
---
Used to use Excavator purely for the extra carry weight, until I got my calibrated shocks on T60. But I'm not keen on its look (despite my hubby pointing out it looks like a cute dog!)
---
The radiation resistance isn't much of a worry for me - I normally play in a team with my husband and with rad sponge and the perk that heals rads during daytime all is good.
---
Only thing that drives me crazy about the T60 is the grind to get the BoS paints for it!
---
I was just there for the screws
---
Oh, I see your edit now.  Yep, use the same protocol and ports from port forward in triggers.
---
When she doesn't just fly into the ground and dissappear or fly off into distance or glitch out and hang in the air just out of reach of my weapon
---
t-51 has best physical armor
---
t-60 is cheap to repair... I don't know why people use t-60
---
Lower repair costs, exclusive paint jobs you can actually get in game, you don't have to craft them, easy to get mods, etc.
---
wtf is R3 on the xbox controller , afaik there isnt one?
---
I'm level 70 and I've never had that drop in my pants.
---
It happens pretty much any time Bethesda does something controversial. 
---
People post dozens of [‚Äòlet‚Äôs appreciate Bethesda‚Äô ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/akzrg3/can_we_just_take_a_minute_to_appreciate_the/efanl8q/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) posts either for internet points or to drown out criticism. 
---
I‚Äôm sure there are people who are genuinely appreciative in their posts, and I‚Äôm appreciative of the work employees have put in to make changes, but the number of ‚Äòappreciation‚Äô posts directly related to high numbers of critical posts just seems disingenuous.
---
Jesus, people asking for handouts now? Just go grind some caps or sell something really quick. Don't waste time begging on here for someone to get them for you, you can get caps fast in survival just killing people.
---
Should I even watch it? It‚Äôs just some video bashing the game right? Seen those done 1000s times we get it I get it but I‚Äôm still gonna enjoy the game nothing any one says is gonna stop my enjoyment you can‚Äôt firce me to dislike something
---
So no risk for your reward?
---
Great explanation. 
---
Is there events for leveling players that gives better rewards? This is pbly explained before but i would appreciate a few hints.
---
Whoa, chill. I‚Äôm not asking for them for free. I have the caps. I need someone to see if they show up for them, buy them, and trade them. I‚Äôm going to pay more than what they‚Äôre worth.
---
That would be cool üòä
---
The thing you should do...
---
Don't try to fight someone with a high bounty. They have it on purpose.
---
I have one. Got it legit in the first couple months of the game.
---
Are you even reading what he said?  He's saying you all made a dumb choice for blowing money on stupid collectors bs
---
Maybe you don't die and drop your bag in the first place? You limp noodle.
---
I'm not complaining - I'm just saying that the vast majority of players didn't want it. And that's being proven by the usage.
---
not true, people are complaining about rewards because the current rewards are extremely lack luster, any kind of player that is actually interested in pvp does not want to be rewarded with items that can be farmed 10x more efficient outside of pvp  
---
pvp rewards should be unique to pvp
---
ya =/ that is where i saw non-us keys for cheapest.
---
thanks &lt;3
---
Thats not a fix to the problem.
---
Yes, but it's just frustrating sometimes, when see how all these so-called fixed bugs return over and over again. Don't want to be that guy, but truly hope for improvement at some point. As it's already half a year passed since its release date and still too many bugs. Not to mention many Dailies STILL not starting also with no fix in sight. Just frustrating.
---
The death penalty in adventure mode right now is already next to nothing (it's just junk!). Not allowing others to pick up the dropped loot, or worse, flagging them as wanted/pvp is straight ridiculous.
---
Guys, this was communicated from day one. You die, you drop your junk. If you're lucky, you can retrieve it. If someone else found it before you, well, maybe next time you are the 'lucky finder'. That's how it is and how it was designed.
---
Bounties do nothing to stop the real griefers lol
---
Thank you for the help and explanations, I appreciate that. I'll make sure to keep posted to let you know how it all goes :)
---
darn, well i'll just wait till its 5-10 here, I got a copy free with my xbone it just isn't worth more then that to me for what it is.  I'm not risk adverse enough to try a vpn 
---
thanks tho!
---
I pop a Radx diluted before fighting ghouls and 1 rad away diluted after and I'm fine.  Rad resistance is awful on gear. The only reason you notice good rad defense on PA or hazmat is the hidden bonus he talked about.
---
The rad defense perk card and armor armor trash
---
Did they say they were introducing legandary power armor?
---
Huh... just send him hundrefsmmds of hobbit "keep your secrets" memes until he cracks ;-D
---
Been rocking the T60 for months. It's durable as hell! And cheap to repair. I also have a T51 but it doesn't have a jet pack yet
---
I do not believe that you've purchased multiple sets of the most sought after 3 star legendary armor in the game from vendors. 
---
If you believe your opinion is right, why would you feel the need to lie to reinforce it?
---
‚Äú16x the detail‚Äù ‚Äî‚Äúthe world destabilizing‚Äù
---
‚Äúand everyone you meet in the game will be a real person‚Äù‚Äîvoice actors are expensive
---
Play in adventure mode you whiny child.
---
I completely understand why you might not want to, but it would be nice if you could ping Captainoob72 to see if he wants to do a Weapon Spotlight video on it.  He just did one on a quad+bashing railway the other day and loved it.
---
Can't wait for them to add legendary power armor you can only get in the atom shop
---
/s
---
Hope the effects are dope though
---
Legendary traits "Unbreakable" and "lightweight" were found in game files for PA, also legendary vendor has a lot of PA on the shelves in her shop, and i don't think it's just for decor
---
Subjective.
---
The moment you pick a lock (door, chest, whatever) in an owned workshop, you're flagged wanted.

"Tampered with"
---
Why not t60? I've been wearing it for months. It's great.
---
Indeed.
---
If I want to sell you 1000 bullets at .5 caps each, I sell you 500 bullets for 1 cap each, and then give you 500 for free
---
Sorry, nothing
---
It‚Äôs ok, thanks for trying!
---
tell me one thing t-60 is better than any other armor
---
/u/Captainoob72
---
Deadlines are in place for a reason. Otherwise Joe Schmo, 30 years from now would want his "canvas bag."
---
same issues here on PC
---
agree. sad truth tbh.
---
I have my vsynch set to fast in the control panel. Runs better for me.
---
The message in the upper left only shows every couple of seconds, but if I‚Äôm not detected, I usually get the damage bonus for multiple hits on the same target. No chameleon, high agility.
---
What problem again?
---
Someone racked up a high bounty to bait morons in to fight them so he can get paid? That's not a problem or glitch or an exploit. That is a strategy that is apparently working out for the dude. 
---
If someone is stimping around with more than a 15-20 cap bounty than they did it intentionally. Avoid them. It's not Bethesda's job to fix player stupidity. 
---
Besides, in 2 days we won't be able to break CAMPS, so it will be almost impossible to get a bounty that high. 
---
"Fixed!"
---
The potential for griefing outweighs the benefits of giving a hapless victim a chance to recover what they lose? I'm not convinced. There are plenty of ways that these types of options can be provided without leaving infinite room for 'abuse'.
---
Yeah , i ended up switching back to paladin...cause it looks cooler. I dont have the nukashine one , but it looks pretty nice on the ones ive seen
---
Huh, that's cool. Then I second your motion that they should have different effects. Van/Sent (or similar) power armor would be super op. Not that normal armor with those perks isnt
---
Yeah... I didn‚Äôt get that from the post at all. Says they aren‚Äôt showing up, not please give them to me.
---
Fucking mint! That's literally a perfect drop!
---
yeah this is true, its because of the 20% bonus xp, people use the dead servers to powerlevel. but these servers were Bethesda's answer for pvp players and it would be nice for it be a place for people seeking pvp to go
---
Why don't you just not do the ones you don't like?
---
That wouldn't work in player vending though.
---
Water purifiers have two caps. Cap 1: How many it can produce per hour. Cap 2: How many it can hold at a time.
---
For example: The large water purifier can produce (iirc) 5 water per hour, but can only hold 2 water at a time. So you have to collect those 2 waters on a regular basis to get the full amount of 5/h.
---
Yeah bro that's sick! Great find
---
What level are you?
---
Yeah, Deathclaws in NV were damn near immortal.  Especially those blind fuckers
---
"Haha epic let me use the bounty system that's supposed to penalize me for being a douchenut in order to get caps because someone tried to play the game as intended, oh wait they literally can't kill me haha, or hey look i have a friend nearby without a bounty he can kill him instead while i avoid punishment for being said douchenut"
---
Just get rid of the bounty system at this point.
---
Right stick click
---
I was playing FO1 a while ago and found some deathclaws. knowing how fucked up they are in Fallout 3 and New Vegas and it being a older game, I noped the fuck outta there REAL fast.
---
Didn't say it was better. Said it was great, and that's an opinion I stand by at level 330
---
I'll try to post some more when I get home tonight! It sees the occasional unwelcome guests but the rocket turrets are more than sufficient to handle a few level 1-10 enemies.
---
I approve.
---
Its a shame the camera challenges for the most part are stupid. I like the camera and want more reasons to use it. But the challenges are shafting solo players atm.
---
Honestly, I missed the part where he said that for disability an optional chat window would be useful. But I agree with you that disability is not the only reasoned "need" for a chat window. I don't have a disability but would use it because if I make even just a little bit of noise downstairs, the dogs upstairs that nap with my niece will bark at me and wake her up because she is less than 5 feet from the dog. This is why I have to play with headphones too. He thought I was "typing angrily" I was simply giving my input and maybe trying to counter argue in the fashion of a healthy debate, he just got the wrong impression from my first comment I guess. And I am not worried about the chat being "cluttered". That's nonsense, it would most likely work like ESO where hitting a button brings it up and only if you want it. It has good functionaility, its useful, necessary and not cluttered. The only people that would use it are keyboard chatters like me and were already used to chat-screens. So I still disagree with Dragonborn.  But he does makes good videos and I agree with him on other stuff.
---
Oh...GT is name here. The 0 is a zero
---
Hi this is Todd we fixed 3 things in the game and busted 18 other things that were total fine, bobby pins are now 12 pounds again enjoy....
---
980 hours played across 4 characters. Have obtained two TSE drops myself.
---
Yeah, power armors are cool, even worst of them (lvl 450 on my main btw)
---
And if you take a workshop, you are subject to PvP challenges. And yet they changed the method of engaging with the workshop to a radius rather than forcing a toggle on the workshop. It's almost like the original design is subject to constant reconfiguration while they work through how things could be handled differently or, by some miracle, better.
---
The day one argument is moot. What sort of sense does it make to allow proverbial pacifists to essentially do the same thing a raider does without actually having to kill you and providing you no recourse to recover your goods? Are other wastelanders just supposed to be invincible containers once they've secured your junk?
---
You are notified that 'another player has looted your stuff' for a reason. I'd like to enhance the features that support it.
---
Best tip I can give you right now? Join a discord! This game is great with lots of friends
---
They show your account name so people know who they're dealing with people that just make up whatever name they wanted and talk to people and I've no repercussions because snow would know who it was if it was the other way.
---
The names on the characters is not for other players it's for you to know the difference between your characters
---
Yep that is incredible
---
crafting and repair costs, why would i consistently repair at 10+ alum and eat rare mats like springs/screws, when i can use 1 plastic, 3 steel, and a few alum?  
---
 id rather run a cheap repair PA for most things, then pull out the specialised PA for more specialised things (imposter, silos, nuke zones, queen)
---
not sure if i should laugh or cry now lol\^\^ truth is, i love their games, but sometimes very frustrating...i still hope for improvement on it\^\^
---
My set is a t45 head, x0-1 legs, t60 chest, and t51 arms. Why? Because I can, and it looks neat. Besides, unless I'm in a nuke zone, I don't ever use it.
---
But does it have a SKULL painted on the X01 helmet?
---
I have one TSE Lever Action Rifle that a family member gave me, but thats the first one Ive ever seen.  I have played since the pre-BETA Stress test.  Hell in all honesty, thats the first three star legendary Ive ever owned.  I did get a three star piece of armor soon after receiving the rifle, but it was only a piece of leg armor and a raider one at that.
---
Us quarter Composition:¬†90% Ag 10% Cu; 91.67% Cu; 8.33% Ni
---
Oh I absolutely agree with OP. The game should have been delayed. I've never known an online game have such varying experiences for its users before (Or maybe I haven't noticed it before) but that suggests the game even now isn't ideally optimised for most users. Is the game really that much more intensive than Fallout 4? I can run 76 at a much higher graphical setting than Fallout 4, but according to the recommended specs, 76 is higher than FO4. That seems weird to me. 
---
I love 76. Considerably more than I initially anticipated to. But it is this weird shit that frustrates me because if the game can run for myself and other players entirely fine, why is it a buggy mess for others? 
---
I'm very intrigued at what the community can do when Bethesda enable mods proper and officially. Private servers and mods could very well bring a lot more players into the game with a build for their specific needs and requirements.
---
Because I have jetpack and calibrated shocks on my T-60 and finding those for X-01 is pain in the ass.
---
I actually had those mods before when the game would scrap them for junk and I lost them, haven't bothered finding another since then.
---
Not to mention T-60 can have BoS paintjobs.
---
That's not griefing. Workshops are designed to be  a pvp arena.
---
Shit winds are a blowin'.
---
Yup, as i said, cheap repair is it's best trait, even then, t-45 and raider are cheaper
---
We're not trying to stop the 'real griefers' - I am trying to help pacifists acquire tools that, much like workshops, permit them to partake in PvP in meaningful ways (like recovering the loot that you dropped at the SBQ or Impostor). 
---
People would think twice about grabbing a bag, or they'd be prepared to get into a team fight over it. Either way, it's exponentially more interesting than: Player A dies. Player B loots bag. Player A knows that someone took their bag. Player B took zero risks for the same gains that a Raider risks their ammo/caps/consumables for.
---
I‚Äôm sure other people on their server helped.
---
It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù, um yeah, literally everyone in the entire game comes here pretty much almost constantly. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm hardly able to gain Xp there üòí
---
Spider Scorched!
---
Does whatever a spider scorched does!
---
Then i am incorrect as to what the term means
---
You keep saying this and it‚Äôs wrong. You clearly don‚Äôt know what you are talking about or you are a Bethesda shill. 
---
Duper‚Äôs made lots of copies of every god roll they found. Then they sold or traded or gave them away. This allowed thousands of people to have guns and armor that are duped. These items are still in the game. They were not removed. 
---
Yes the TSEs (aside from the shotgun) were nerfed but they are still wanted and people will pay good caps for them. If you build is right a BE is better. If you have a high rate of fire weapon like a handmade then FE is better. But it‚Äôs still a good gun.
---
Lol right on üëçüèº. I rarely use my PA that much too tbh. But the new nuke skin (black n gold) look slick to me.  Great on mic sets even that raider one!  Prob look sick on your mix set as well
---
As I said, it would need to work the same way that getting shot in Adventure Mode does. You don't HAVE to shoot back. In the same way that you would not HAVE to shoot the player that took your bag.
---
I'd like the option to be available without the looting player being the single arbiter of that scenario.
---
I like the whitesprings for the flatish, green area. I don't mind the hills of Appalachia but holy crap... very few flat areas to build. That being said, I do agree on camps near spawn points. Running to go kill something, and someone's turret takes them out, wakens the others and takes those out as well right as I get to the spot. Sucks. I do like to camp south of whitespring. Stay outta the nuke zone.
---
But those don't look as good and no BoS paints for those.
---
Where does one even find serums for free or cheap, by which I man, are they a drop from a specific spawn of creature ‚ùîüò≥
---
Grieving if people who go out of there way to make your time in game bad. This can be by leveling your base or by contesting a workshop just to kill you and never actually clame it.
---
I‚Äôve never ever understood why the cost of stuff got so high. Like it‚Äôs a game . . . Wat u gona do with the 40k besides buy something else someone has convinced you is worth 40k. Your literally not getting any richer. Just everyone agree to reduce the cost of stuff, everyone will benefit. You won‚Äôt need all your other characters to be mules and you will still get the gun you want . 
---
It‚Äôs literally a game . . . Your not actually making 40k . . .
---
That's ideal, but we're already assuming that the bag's been dropped.
---
My discord group is in need of fusion cores always, wanna join?

I post on the fallout forum to see if anyone wants to do the challenges like that if my friends aren't on.

Here we go! Fashion
---
I'm not lying, go read in other threads tons of people have found items like these. You fail to realize pve players mostly vendor assassins because they have zero use for PvP stats and the other effects don't display without inspecting the item. 
---
Noobs absolutely sell them often without checking their second or third effect and with sent being a third effect it doesn't show without inspecting. So they sell them without realizing what they have.
---
I'm not sure that'll be true. 76 is going to be on Steam. I think the only reason it was on the Bethesda launcher initially is because they knew what a shit show it was gonna be. I don't think they'd be dumb enough to launch their flagship single player title in as poor of a state as 76 was. I don't *think...*
---
Why? I need Weightless for my Chameleon mutation build, don't care about PVP and prefer the look of Combat. Sold it so someone who'd appreciate it instead.
---
Play the game and make decisions for yourself. How about that?
---
Directly across from top of the world, the train station sits across from a large pond and a tall wall. If you build next to it, enemies have to come down a small defendable path to attack you. It's a 14 cap fast travel to WS as well.
---
Yes! Buy stuff! Get all the plans!
---
Found TSE pump shotty farming whitesprings golf club a few days ago at lvl 80...the RNG gods were smiling upon me
---
I agree. The 'another player' challenges are frustrating to us solo players. No one else I know plays FO76, so pretty restrictive. I think we need more balance in challenges.
---
Those of y‚Äôall who use these armor, is there anywhere to find a full suit? I keep finding fragments of suits that are very far and few in between.
---
I have a dozen two-shot weapons and a couple explosive but nothing with both.

Bringing in the shithawks.
---
OK i really really wasn't going to reply, but you've made this fun now so I'll dip my toe back in for a minute, then I really need to go see that wall.
---
You seem to think you're using reasoned arguments in your responses, I get that you believe that but you're really not, they're pretty garbled and difficult to follow. Example...
---
"As for losing your rag and searing at me because I disagree with your ideals is verging on insanity" - this is so incoherent it's hard to counter, but in for a penny... Who has lost their rag, me? Where? Why? Because I correctly accuse you of using logical fallacies instead of reasoned debate? Pointing out something obvious doesn't equate to losing one's temper, so thanks for you concern but I'm fine thanks, nice and calm, like my posts. There's a fleck of foam at the corner of your mouth you might want to address though. 
---
By "searing" i assume you meant "swearing"? Again, you're being dishonest, to swear at you I'd need to call you something like an ignorant buffoon, or a dullard, a dolt, or if we really want to push the boat out, a fucking idiot. But I didn't. What I did was to call you're reductive attitude "shitty", not you, your attitude. It's like when you chastise a kid, it's ok to say what that did was bad, it's not ok to call them a bad kid. See the difference?
---
Or did you actually mean "searing"? As in I was being severely critical of your discriminatory position that only people with disabilities should get a pass on using a microphone? If so then you need to work on your sentence structure cause it's hard to understand what the hell you're on about
---
Then you accuse me of possible serious mental illness. You said like to go by dictionary definitions so you understand that's what insanity means yes? That's messed up, maybe you should talk to you're partner, see if they can help you with some diversity and discrimination training. 
---
As for my "ideals", what? Do you mean my principals? You disagree with my ethical stance? That's a hell of an achievement on your part as nowhere did I express such a thing. I think you're confusing my condemnation of your "shitty attitude" with the expression of a personal moral code.  Also to disagree means to express a different opinion or a counter argument and we're still waiting on that last one.
---
Remember, this one side argument only happened because you don't like a proposed optional feature that could help and is wanted by many others (despite you downvoting them) while having zero impact on you. People disagreed with you, clearly and politely explained why and then you lost the plot and started with ad hominem attacks, straw man arguments, loaded questions, moved goal posts and unrelated nonsensical statements. If you really think you've come out well in any of this, you have issues.
---
Lastly, and I really mean that, the bricks are calling me, but this was too funny to leave out...

i was looking for a particular vid that thought might help and could not find it.  But I did come across this that might help fill in missing gaps:

I'll try. Hunting Charleston Vendor rn.
---
I really miss mods. Once you've built authentic looking structures that look like they belong in the game and you can place things like smoke coming from a chimney or placemats for npcs, vanilla limited building in 76 is so boring to me. So to combat this I find locations that are inside the architecture. Something different
---
The problem is 90% of the time the players dont have the caps to pay of the bounty if you kill them so they have nothing to loss except a pointless debuff they get if they get killed.  I have killed people with crazy high bounties and only got 10 caps just for there friends to show up and try and kill me. The system is broke. And in favor of the ones with the bounty which defeats the point of the bounty system entirely
---
I do, im a hoarder and my stash is always loaded so I have no room to keep legendaries.

Is that quote supposed to be me? Because you strait up missed the point. 
---
The bounty system isn't to punish people for playing some invisible morality game. It's to make criminals. If you want to be a criminal and bait in stupid bountyhunters who think they can take out someone who intentionally is luring people in, than that is their playstyle. Nobody is making you go after them.
---
I am going to be laughing when they sell their stuff at their vending machines for ridiculous prices that arent going to be bought, whilst I am racking in profits with my items costing around 500c each XD
---
Nice job in a compact space.
---
Can I see a trade list or an imgur or something? Anything besides "I buy the most sought after items in the game from vendors all the time"?
---
I have my camp just on the hills near the uranium fever event. Doesn‚Äôt get nuked. I had my camp on whitesprings because like you said it is a good area to build on. Appalachia is a very mountainous place, tricky getting those foundations down sometimes üòä
---
Seems ok. Another thing I‚Äôm looking for is unique locations. Like I found two open houses above the cow in the toxic valley. There is water there and a concrete farm and 2 Tato plants behind the 2nd house . Plus junk in the houses. If you do it correctly you should be able to get water, concrete and 1 house within your camp. Only downside is that it‚Äôs in the ugliest region and it‚Äôs far west near vault 76. Good spot though
---
Overall there's still some clunky mechanics and bugs to be worked out, but general stability is alot better and the things they add are fun, although they seem to forget low level players exist with new content.
---
Colour is way off in OP's photo -- didn't realise they were quarters (which still contain more copper than steel, even if they should scrap to silver).

It was grim. But. There was always a boatload of beer.

I think that you and your people may be on to something with that smart loot system I have having a similar experience with that in regards to finding random Ammo from containers to mob drops as well.
---
We‚Äôre both specced into heavy weapons.
---
I run a bloodied build and have been using a prime bloodied Gatling Plasma. I use adrenal reaction, nerd rage, bloody mess, heavy weapon perks, gun fu and adrenaline. I kill 5 adds with my lever rifle then pop a pyschotats and Gatling the queen. I stay around 10% hp too.
---
I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that one single clip of my bloodied prime gatling plasma will take out at least 1/4 of her health when I max adrenaline and use a psychotats. 
---
If you don‚Äôt believe me, feel free to add me and I‚Äôll show you how quickly I can melt that queen. My sis and I are looking to launch on an empty server too, as I‚Äôm quite confident we can cut her down alone (:
---
If ANYONE in the area takes berry mentats OR has a targeting hud on their PA, then you have a chance to get the visual effects too.
---
This has been known to cause lag in big groups tho
---
Now see, that I don't like and should be changed, not the strategy of baiting bounty hunters. Apparently the pvp debuff isn't enough to discourage that.
---
Not necessarily good for water, but south of the southern most watchtower, to the West of Watoga, is a cliff that has a remnant of a camp there. There's a dufflebag and chest, and three different times I found a Gatling laser in the bag. The spot itself is beautiful and not far from Watoga or the other train station. It was my camp for a month or so. Only enemies are mid range wolves or mid/high scorched from the tower itself. Below the cliffs there's a good chance to spawn three enemies, one of which was usually legendary.
---
I‚Äôve sent the invite. Sorry I worked the overnight so I wasn‚Äôt online, what time would work for you today?
---
They should have anti-armour and/or stun attacks and be lying on the ground basking when you first encounter them most of the time. And more chameleon deathclaws (if there are any) in 76.
---
YES!
---
" why would i consistently -snip- eat rare mats like springs/screws -snip-" T45 uses circuitry on torso, raider uses nuclear material. t60 may use more in number, but still has more rare mats required
---
I found two, way back in late december. Since then I haven't found one again. I just assume every TSE I see is duped, although I'm sure there are quite a few legitimate ones.
---
And that scrapyard by Charleston (?) has a vein of black titanium
---
I love posts like this
---
Cool. In my searches again i found a drumlin diner called lakeside grill. This place has flat land and a pier it‚Äôs in the dried toxic lake. Downsides are the location is again ugly and there‚Äôs a mirelurk queen and ghouls spawn in the restaurant. I‚Äôm currently in the mire under a bridge. It has water and wood. It‚Äôs also right next to Harper‚Äôs ferry
---
I regularly see assassin + assassin/sent/cava armor at the whitespring vendors. Many players don't do PvP and don't realize how good it is. If they happen to get a drop like that from a place that can have 18ish legendaries, they'll just sell it since they have no need for it.
---
If I see it, I buy it and give to my friend who plays Survival. I've probably bought and given him at least two sets worth since Survival came out.
---
we got plenty of help on four of the launches and more people help the fight go even quicker (6 min was our fastest) although on the 6th launch the two of us alone had gotten her to 2/3 health in under 5 min before anyone else had arrived. Only two ended up showing up that time and we finished her off in around 10 min.
---
No, thanks. I have to look up too much stuff about this game on Reddit and elsewhere. It's a bad sign when people need to google shit. I didn't even know why I had double XP a few days ago. It's more interesting to find stuff without help, but by the time I do they'll have moved on to a new bunch of challenges.
---
That rock arch overlooking the bog is my favorite
---
Me and the missus was just talking about this!
---
Just killed the Sheepsquatch and Grahm came running up.
---
I was like damn that would have been epic and here you are teaming up.
---
I think most players are pve focused. And the ones that play pvp go to survival mode.
---
Heh heh imagining all the fantastic weapons I'm going to buy because the seller has no idea what the item is worth
---
I dont think they really care if anyone plays it, they doing it daily challange to make it harder to get atoms.
---
Cool story
---
I looked online and in physical Microsoft shops and can't find the microphones for sale without importing them (at ludicrous cost), and it would immediately kill any roleplaying I might be attempting. I guess I have to play a mute. lol
---
I found a plasma gatling once, but it is on the long list of cool weapons that I had to sell because of stash limits.
---
Yeah after reading it again I see it lol.
---
Regrettably, yes.  They copied the helmet stencil.   IMO, they were trying to satisfy those who did nit get Blackbird without re-releasing Blackbird.
---
Loved this game when it was bad and still bought it against all the negative reviews ..love it more now..simple. Haters always hate
---
Terminal works with Cycling Lights. Once you find the cycling light plan, daisy chain the cycling lights  and have a direct connection to the terminal. You'll be able to change the color of the lights and the strength of the light. You can also randomise the light's color too.  
---
You can also set up a speaker and program it to emit a sound. im yet to do that but will try it out soon.
---
Yeah it's the bounty system that's the problem not the baiting other then the fact they have less to loss
---
If deathclaws were the top of the food chain people would complain that theyre OP in ever fallout and how is there not something new.
---
It's he automatically using his vats crit? If so, how?
---
Hmmm, possibly. But I feel like they have a bigger story in mind for her. And the reason the Mole Miners are the way they are is due to the FEV and the fact they're trapped in miner suits.
---
i'm a level 50 something. killed two deathclaws yesterday in under 10 seconds. boring.
---
I‚Äôll probably still do that out of laziness, no worries.
---
The 10% tax destroys caps.   Fewer caps means more valuable caps.  Caps are created every day but only those given to vendors are destroyed.  If vendor bots are avoided then the caps destruction methodology is avoided as well.
---
Its a simple matter of supply and demand.  The days of low priced good legendaries from the early game are gone - when duping was available it it was easy for those TSEs to spread like wildfire.  Now that duping is gone, the supply of good legendaries is all RNG dependent, and god rolls are near impossible to get which any player farming legendaries knows the pain of.  The legendary vendor is going to dry up the supply of better legendaries too, as people will get rid of non god roll items in hopes of better stuff.  Even lesser rolls now have value in scrip.
---
Caps are as common in game as real world bottle covers now that we send to landfills in massive amounts.  We're back to bartering in the wastelands for scarce legendaries.
---
The first time I finally took down a deathclaw in NV, I immediately saved then called my mom. I knew she would have no idea what I was talking about, but she would be supportive anyway, since none of friends at that time played. I can still remember that feeling of fluttering in my chest! I thought I could take on the world if I could kill a deathclaw!
---
The first time I saw one in 76, I panicked because it went straight for me. I just basically ran backwards while chopping with my fire axe... and... killed it in less than 20 swings. It was 15 levels higher than me. I thought it was a glitch and I got lucky until I encountered another one with my friend and it went down in seconds.

Very true!  I‚Äôve had to clean many a keyboard because of Dorito crumbs and pretzel salt.  Back in the day when ball noises were a thing the Doritos did a number on them too...but these optical mice are much more forgiving.

that's the market, don't be butthurt because you're broke

I believe Sony also requires that your PSN be visible during multiplayer or something like that, so I understand why they display the gamer ID, but they could at least find a way to have both be displayed.
---
They ARE the exact same items. Someone loaned me a full set of assassins sentinel marine armor. I got to know it pretty well.
---
They took it back so I traded for a set. It was the EXACT SAME set.

I have to disagree with everything you wrote.  Grinding is not fun.  Trading helped me avoid the grind.   With trading, it has still taken me five months to get one of everything I would want (sans one).   Without trading it would never have happened.
---
How did I end up here?
---
Remember kids, don‚Äôt sell drugs IRL üòâ
---
Yeah. It is unfair. But how do you fix it?
---
1) maybe you cant get a higher bounty than your purse can handle? Than you'd be able to wreck shit with basic impunity. Plus what happens if you spend your money when you are wanted?
---
2) No damage to anything debuff til you can pay off the negative balance of what has been collected on you? This would severely limit your ability to earn those caps back? 
---
I could really go on but I think you get the point and I'm honestly just tired of typing. Ha!

I got into it with a mod once about that, he tried to use his own interpretation of free speech for it, saying something like ‚Äúfree speech only if it isn‚Äôt harmful.‚Äù That ain‚Äôt free speech. But it was whatever, the moment he used that I knew it was an argument I wasn‚Äôt gonna win, especially since he could just ban me if I did end up winning anyways. The sub is great, I love the people there, I just dislike the mods and how they go about enforcing their own interpretations of their rules. And then don‚Äôt even get me started about the flair requirement, that was annoying as hell. They require flairs but have a tiny minute amount of them.
---
Do you want me to send you an invite to a friendly discord based in the US?
---
I feel ya. That's probably why griefing is on the rise. üòñ Best I can suggest is to help lower level players. There's a certain degree of satisfaction knowing you've helped someone else enjoy the game.
---
Shit is hitting the fans.
---
OMG, wish i had your skills, this juts makes me want to hang out there, and do nothing else, a very nice job :D
---
Simplest idea I think would work is being able to go into the negative value of caps. You have 10 caps and a 100 cap bounty you now have negative 90caps plus the debuff
---
Level 204, found explosive and two shot but never together.  Found an antiarmor explosive black powder pistol recently, I suppose that is the closest I have come to TSE.
---
Oh I didn't know it wasn't team specific, that's interesting
---
That moment when this sub is still filled with the same bitch, whiny, people that are probably active on the main Fallout sub. If you don't believe me scroll through new and or hot and you'll see how many posts there is critiquing the game. Etc like, assaultron recall cards are too expensive, my legendaries suck, and more.

Agreed, I‚Äôm one of those ‚ÄúI‚Äôll find out for myself‚Äù type of guys when it comes to games. Did it with fallout 76 which I heavily enjoy, did it with anthem which , well that‚Äôs become a rainy day game for me now.

---
well, there's no way they could produce enough content to keep up with people who play the game like a full-time job (i'm not judging anyone for it btw, i have 2 characters that combined are about level 250)....
---
i recommend playing other games alongside FO76. it's not like you (OP) sound like you'll be left behind in any way if you add some other games to your active playlist
---
I‚Äôm 100% Passive, that‚Äôs just my thing. And I hate it when griefers rip up my camp, it infuriates me, but I resist temptation to fight back. I do like, however, the risk of claiming a workshop - it‚Äôs entirely my choice, I clearly know what the risk is, and provides a relatively safe version of pvp.
---
I do notice, however, that my mindset changes dramatically when do this. I go from being totally immersed in the game to thinking too much about other IRL players and immediately lose that connection with the game itself. That‚Äôs my primary reason for staying away from PVP.
---
My own experience was similar.

Yeah it's a bone of contention due to its causing lag for many

exactly i got it when the game came out and people wanted to replace their camp often they needed to do this (even then imo it wasnt worth the 2 minutes of effort you could save by this technique) however it bugs me that when building my camp you cant do things that should be no problem at all (supports, better stairways ...) but this somehow passes the rules of bethesdas no floating rule :D
---
Fairly certain that it was something like the 3* enemies would more often than not drop 1* legendary items, so then that hit white springs the most and west tek took over as the legendary farming spot
---
Were you holding the new camara at the time?

All you'd see are racial slurs and other stuff to piss everyone off. You can hardly trust people with such a responsibility.  üòñ

Ah, I love that you said that!  I have a team of four other people, including my husband, that I play with all the time, and we loooooved hanging out here.  It was central, so travel-point convenient, and everyone I play with threw out ideas so it was kind of a culmination.
---
I actually prefer the grey green, where I live it‚Äôs always yellow and orange outside, so seeing the brown in NV just made me meh about it.
---
Smart move. They are much scarier in the turn based ones.
---
Going to ignore the other people who are also saying they've found them as well at vendors? Keep ignoring reality cause you overpaid for your gear. Lol
---
I am lv154 and I have never seen one either
---
For the bears? I'm just mad that I still reflexively get scared of deathclaws and they're not hard to take down at all.
---
I'd like to be able to turn the camera around and take selfies!
---
Many people are feeling this. There is nothing to do specially for people who have been playing since lunch. I only play survival because is the only thing left to do. I tried to play adventure mode yesterday but I server hopped 14 times and most servers had 10 or less people.
---
For new people it must be great to start the game now though.
---
Right? They add a bar and a punch bowl, but you cant drink while sitting at said bar? Come on...
---
Very much so yes.
---
For example, every single TSE Lever Action i have EVER seen in reddit and discord trading have had exactly the same 3* effects on them (those being TSE + Movement speed while aiming). People distributed the TSE's from their toons to mule accounts/friends/sold/traded alot of them away. Dupes are very much still around and in circulation. The chance of max level TSE dropping is so marginal and small that it's impossible to have so many of them around without them being dupes. I have 5 friends who have played together with me from launched, combined we have something around 5000-6000h playtime. And not one of us have ever seen TSE drop (except one low level).
---
And to say that all duping methods are patches is just being naiive and stupid. Why would people still dupe them? Because every average Joe still wants one.
---
Yes I was actually... Is this a new bug I've failed to pick up on?
---
It's already pretty explosive...if it decides to work, that is...
---
Yeah adventure is getting boring but i dont find survival fun for me
---
It's not 10 caps, it's 10% of caps. So, if you sell something for 500 caps, you only receive 450 caps.
---
Okay?
---
Oh the anti mat rifle takes down any of them! Use AP rounds and the deathclaws go down like nothing! For bears the hunting shotgun and rifle always worked well
---
Thats what i try to do if stumble onto some new players
---
I‚Äôm inclined to disagree, new Vegas for me doesn‚Äôt have that draw to keep me coming back for more and to replay it over and over. 3 on the other hand did and I‚Äôve probably beaten 3 maybe 5 times now. Whole nv I‚Äôve only done it twice
---
I still think this is pretty unlikely, especially given we've seen the Purveyor's final design and it's not remotely vault-like.
---
&gt;!Plus, her lines in the files and they just sound like a pitched up mole miner.!&lt;
---
I always thought that you should of got the disease as part of the story making it more enticing to follow the main story(light a fire under the player to give some immersive elements). I think it would be a fun thing to add for player who have not completed the vax questline.
---
Thanks, dude. I find having a significantly higher level friend to distract the bears so I can wing them for a little xp helps, too. ü§£
---
It's been explained and you keep replying back this way. It's nothing to be outraged over, and if you are the twitter owner, your feed is terrible, nothing of substance in any of the tweets I scrolled through.
---
I'll say what I said last time this topic was posted.
---
At least bring back their grapple attacks.
---
If you go back to Biv you can do one quest a day and you get a random recipe
---
Starting to wonder if subreddits are just social experiments like the vaults
---
Ahhh awesome I‚Äôll do that now :)
---
I do have other games to play but i dont enjoy these newer games as much as i used to, feels like games loose their shine earlier than before.
---
Go to Biv, once a day for a few weeks.
---
Thanks. :)
---
I do t want to get anyone too excited, but my 3* TSE Handmade was also dropped by a super Mutant at West-Tek.
---
Yeah it's decent, I'd use it more if the range was better...
---
I couldn't get the friends system to work, but I do wish I had
---
This. For sure.
---
I honestly couldn‚Äôt get into ESO, it just lacks for me in terms of story
---
I have certain reviewers whos opinions are similar to my own, and i watch their long form videos if im unsure about a game, and if their reasoning for something being bad makes sense, i dont waste my money. I dont have money to just buy games that i think are bad.
---
And i agree its nearly impossible to create large scale quests and other content to keep every one happy
---
Well, not hard to see that a Lady did this :)
---
I think when we get our camp protection in 2 days i will rebuild everything and spend a lot of time doing it, it just seems so much more worth it when somone can't just walk up and destroy everything in seconds :)

Here's the previous thread on this topic, including Bethesda response. Enjoy at your own leisure.
---
Haha true but if you‚Äôre talking about fallout 76 the hunting rifle and shotgun do work good too
---
It is a fun toy. üòÜ After mine started only working like 20% of the time, I decided to scrap it for camp space. Maybe I'll try bringing the ol girl back though...

Dude everyone else is scrambling to find the damn thing lol I‚Äôve got dozens of messages ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the body‚Äù

I cant speak for fo1 but fo2 the deathclaws are vulnerable on their claws. Get it? Death, claw
---
Look I love the people there but you can‚Äôt say anything remotely negative without being silenced
---
uhh... baka?  Am I doing this right?
---
Yeah the legendary system is rigged if I'm honest, it's almost like Bethesda don't want you to have Two Shot or Explosive weapons.
---
Most of my levels have come from grinding my butt off for levels.
---
And as for the lack of hidden "gems"/locations compared to other fallout titles and the absence of npcs makes this game feel a little more empty
---
I disagree with that assessment. I could give a damn about the XP bonus. I don‚Äôt really PvP. I play Survival because of the added challenge. I hated that in Adventure, if some dude was being a dick, there was nothing I could do about it. It‚Äôs Fallout. If my gun can‚Äôt damage something, it better be because it‚Äôs essential. I want the threat of dropping my aid. Personally, I‚Äôd like to see more stuff added to the list of possible drops, like non-unique weapons and armor, treasure maps, and ammo. But that one is probably an unpopular opinion.
---
But like that was almost a month ago.  Hiw hard can it be to access it? Non of the previous fallout titles prevented access to pipboy whilst sitting.
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
I havent played for months. Is 2shot explosive still a thing ?
---
I imagine they have a huge backlog of things to fix, new content to sort, etc.
---
I suspect this is very low on the list.
---
Id like to help you and I dont want to say you are strange, but idkwc makes a strong case. 
---
You really don't need to worry about the end of the game's life as it is not at all like the old-skool scenario of an MMO lasting only a year or two and you wasted all that effort getting your end game toon, it really doesn't apply whatsoever to FO76.
---
FO76 doesn't have a super-size landscape server that everyopne shares. They are using the new Amazon Web Services model with some datacenter housing massive servers that they 'rent' out space on. AWS 'spins up' a new server every time Bethesda algorithms see the need, and when the 24 MAX people on a server leave it, that server 'spins down' and ceases to exist. There is no server to pull the plug on.
---
When Bethesda reaches the end of FO76, they will tell the datacenter they are renting from and they will stop running the 24-max /server algorithm and that will be it. Very far off but more importantly, when Beth sees players numbers dwindling they naturally will have less temporary servers running. When only 24 players remain, they could hypothetically still all be playing on the one remaining server and not even know the game died.
---
Hope that helps, I decided to write cos idkwc was being legit and not ragging on you, and I could smell your frustration with  "What a time to be alive when asking for your product to not intentionally be destroyed by its creator is a strange demand."
---
So slap it underneath the character name.
---
Not once you got some weapons in the mid game and beyond
---
Maybe they'll sort out an end game eventually and then I imagine it'll be worth returning.
---
It already takes me forever to get the caps and you wanna charge me that much for stash increase???
---
Or free range? New ones added to the game?
---
I found that the encrypted event is really handy for this trophy if there is an abundance of players doing said event.
---
Could this fix the damn stutter?
---
Nooooooo!
---
My camp is close to the Whitesprings and sometimes I use the artillery when it's nuked and no one's around.

It's satisfying when it hits a horde of ghouls.

Remember when the Fatman was a really good weapon?
---
There‚Äôs no shortage of places to bitch, moan and air grievances about the game, is it so bad to have **one** place to share positive experiences? FFS
---
Well! Thanks for the help everyone....i died the second after the queen and my game froze while i was respawning....and i got nothing. Perfect.
---
Never seen the affixes "two shot" or "explosive" on anything for that matter. 
---
5 chars 130, 87, 82, 77, 57.
---
I don't care though, pvp is a broken mess despite the have and have-nots.

Why? They're just as easy as the lowbie deathclaws.
---
If you use you excavator PA and mod it with hydraulic braces on both arms you get 4 x the amount when you pick up any ore / vanes , just a tip :)

I‚Äôm at 135 Rad resistance and survived more than 6 clips of a fully modded Gamma Gun, as compared to the normal 2 clips

1 Team-mate that has put in 800+ hours over 5 characters, another team-mate with 500+ hours over 2 characters, one about to hit level 200

---
NOT
---
ONE
---
TSE
---
*ANYTHING*
---
No shotgun, no railway rifles, no assault gun, no nothing.
---
Between us we have seen a handful of two shot, we have seen a smaller handful of explosive. NOT ONE TSE in over 2,000 hours of combined gameplay.
---
You will never convince me that any TSE I see out there isn't duped. I am sure there are a handful that were legitimately obtained, but three people playing near daily since the BETA have never, ever seen one drop. (Been shot by plenty!)
---
&gt;Those yao guai bears have a special place in video game Hell reserved for them, though.
---
I don't get this...why? They die in one or two hits.
---
I'm not the owner.
---
Well the difference in color really intimidates me
---
Yea dude lol where you been. This has been goin on for a long time. Unyeilding/ cav armor shit is goin for like 80-100k on lfg and Facebook groups. And tse laser rifles are the same. It's dumb af. The market is ruined.
---
I'm what most would consider a whale in games with microtransactions the actions of Beth with this game and how they have handled everything? I will NEVER spend a penny in the atom shop. So their actions aren't getting more people to pay for atoms, they are actually doing the exact opposite by alienating the whales.
---
Starting new is both fun and painful 
---
It's fun because all the new stuff getting added is random encounter stuff eg: the camera so you get it as you explore and play.
---
The bad side is because of all the high level people playing a lot of the area have way too high level monsters spawning.  I started a new character recently and it's a way different experience than the beta when everyone was around the same level
---
yes the nukashine looks pretty nice! i like the dark metal parts. would love that dark metal on a bos paint
---
I think you mean gorge junkyard in the forest

I don't think Hydraulic Bracers have anything to do with the amount you get. Excavator PA always gives you x4 more ore per vein.

See those annoying as all hell turret bases at Whitespring Golf Course? Stand on the roof of the club with your ghoul slayers gamma gun and keep those pesky ghouls nice and healed while they decimate said turret camp. Enjoy watching your little ghoul puppets turn another players assholery to dust.
---
Um, what are you talking about? The last I checked, the hate on that sub has mostly gone down, and you can usually discuss 76 freely. It really depends on how positive you mean by ‚Äúanything positive‚Äù
---
Hey @ESOtaz thank you for the video, it definitely helped getting my head around it, enough for me not to feel lost. I have removed the port forwarding entries and added the entries for port triggering. The game still seems more responsive overall. I also tried playing without any entries in forwarding or triggering, and I was getting the same slow camp loading times. I just made sure to test in those 3 cases: no port triggering or forwarding / port forwarding / port triggering; just to have some base to compare to.
---
 I'll be looking around for SBQ / cryptid events and I'll keep this thread up to date, and again thank you for your help, I hope you enjoy your weekend :)
---
I've gotten much better since my first encounter in 76, but I must have terrible rhythm with fighting them. They always manage to pin me and give me the smack of death.
---
I'm pretty sure this subreddit could make a case for why eating cat shit isn't that bad with the amount of semantic, cut-throat arguing used to defend this game
---
Also as a non Power armor melee build, Stahgering is my worst enemy
---
Kill small critters

I don't think anyone really knows yet. All the info 8 know is on the 9th they are introducing legandary vending machines where you can trad your unwanted legandary weapons in for "scrip" that will be usable when the vendor comes out
---
Next update (Tuesday), you'll be able to turn in junk legendary and receive legendary scrip. You'll use the scrip, once the vendor is out later this month, to buy new legendaries.
---
What platform are you on?
---
PS4
---
When you talk i picture the comic book guy from the simpsons
---
There will be new vending machines on the Train Stations; there, you will be able to "scrap" your Legendary items for a new currency - Legendary Scrips. With these Scrips, you go to the Legendary Vendor. But we don't know wjat exactly she will sell.
---
The way this post makes it look like that there is a main one that is toxic
---
The more stars on the item, the more scrip you receive. Beyond that, we don't know a whole lot.
---
Sadly, I'm not there anymore.  I got the itch to move again and I can't stop rebuilding!  I'm down by Johnson's Acre right now, but if you're on PS4 and want to stop by my new campground, come on by!  My PSN is the same as my Reddit username.
---
that's my new way to log out. 
---
It's much faster then going to the map clicking the option button and go down to Leave Game
---
Me too. I have a spot in the mire that has water and junk. You can add me and I can show you my camp and you can see what you think.

---
Personally I wish that factions mattered. 
---
Launching a nuke could be re-worked. It could be faction-based. Enclave tries to launch while the Responders try to stop the nuke. And the Raiders are always there to stop them both. It should be a server wide event with worthwhile rewards. 
---
It would be neat if you could snap camps together and get some kinda bonus for it. Maybe it unlocks special build items. Maybe bigger build budget. Maybe if you snap 4 camps together you get a fast travel marker on the map because you‚Äôve created a city. There‚Äôs a lot of potential there. 
---
Also, there needs to be more events that permanently affect the specific world your on. The powering up of the power stations is a good start, but needs expansion.
---
I think I know the area you‚Äôre talking about. What‚Äôs your username
---
Firstly: f076's radio selection could probably fit on a HitClips cartridge.
---
Second: Spotify has many undeniably better fallout playlists, spanning multiple games.
---
Turn in game radio volume to 0, and click on a station to remove the ambiance track.
---
"But I'm on console!" \*shrug\*

Still have him?

Not trying to downplay your idea, I'm just explaining the experience from the raiders that I've met playing the game.

---
im a fan of fort defiance, surgical trays everywhere (and you can get all the straight jackets and military ammo bags while you are there)
---
With the shops now having 1400 caps in trade its easier to make a lot of caps   selling bulk.
---
I‚Äôll add you soon. You wanna come online in like an hour
---
I get the point that in long term it is needed to invest in ingame stuff to keep the game running.
---
And on one hand i agree that we should be glad there is an option by earning Atoms ingame. 
---
But on the other side i see it is about the amount dailys grant you ~50 atoms of which you only can get hardly 30 sometimes because of not implemented stuff or the need to accomplish it by server hopping.
---
Neither by looking the Atomic Shop items are often worth the amount of Atoms imo.
---
All in all it just should be something doable in a fair amount of time - as some folks might have Jobs, family etc. - and something which keeps you going/joining to not abandon the game at all.
---
Again sure we should be glad that it is an option but also we should be allowed to critizise or ask about if something is unbalanced or buggy without call one out because of a single point of view which isn't interested or depending on that matter.
---
I'll be on all day :)
---
Nuke Zones, SBQ, West Tek, Burrows, certain events. Just play high level areas or farm events.
---
Use xp boost such as sleeping and bobbleheads and some recipes, also take advantage of double xp weekends when they are active, teaming up and using inspirational perk card will help s well.
---
I'd like to think it's Hornwright's daughter, Penny.
---
Regarding player impact in terms of choice, world, and story, according to the 100 Days roadmap, it's scheduled for the Fall.
---
Events where you kill lots of super mutants, launching nukes and killing things, and West Tek Research Facility are my recommendations.
---
I‚Äôve got a camp in the mire too. It‚Äôs got a wood and water supply. Plus it‚Äôs near harper. I‚Äôm pretty sure beavers might spawn as it‚Äôs a beaver dam
---
Sure: Bethesda's forums, you'll get banned for not liking the game :)
---
DeAr BeThEsDa
---
Hah, thank you, I think!  
---
I'm also looking forward to it, but I don't mind when it gets destroyed.  With contractor on the cost to fix is negligible, but then I have lots of time to gather materials.
---
I've only gotten my base destroyed twice.  Once was a personal vendetta by a "nice guy" who got mad when I didn't want to give him my full attention, and the other was just random.  I'm guessing my husband and I were in their normal spot and they thought they could chase us out.
---
a harley riding trashcan to be exact... it's sheeple like you who play this trashcan of a game that allow me to be me.
---
I don‚Äôt have a mic so I‚Äôll use emotes to talk + wall signs
---
This is awesome. I wish I had the patience and ability to creat something like this.
---
I can only thing that maybe theres a event plan ur still needing
---
the new Free Range event comes with 4 weapon plans (3 melee plans, 1 throwing knife plan) that is unique to the sheepsquach
---
and the Imposter Sheepsquach event I hear u can earn The Fixer weapon plans (unique gun related to the quest line)
---
I can only thing that maybe there's a event plan ur still needing
---
Hmm....
---
Excavator is suppose to give you 2 x and the description for the Hydraulic Bracers mod / plan is wrong until you check it after you have applied it, it then says that the mod gives you double amount from what the normal Excavator gives you "if used in tandem" as they describe :)
---
I'd be happy to join the Tokyo-based division (PS4)
---
Do you have the PS message app? You can message too on that if needed.
---
Yes, found all the plans I need, but grinding him out with a buddy to help my other friend out.
---
This is happening to peoples mules that they keep lists of items the mule has. This isn't an accidentally dropped it during a lag spike lr sold it during lag. These are just up and vanishing.
---
That made me laugh harder than it should.
---
There‚Äôs even an app... I‚Äôll download it now
---
It also has a 100% spawn rate in one of the mines
---
I personally think levels 35-50 are the slowest, because you've run out of quests to do, but you're not necessarily strong enough for the hard stuff that gives good XP. Once you're not squishy, XP can come pretty quickly.
---
I need another starburst plan.
---
Fantastic story and thanks for sharing its moments like these that will keep me loving this game
---
Robots already drop glowing meat in nuke zones so you‚Äôre free to eat üëå
---
I was making my own fun yesterday by traveling near to where other players were and then spamming the new gift emote. Those brave enough to approach received Legendaries and Supplies.
---
I would only hope so I can get rid of these stupid quest marked holotapes from my inventory
---
It's for lead and steel deposits (all of the types)
---
1 cap
---
Yeah, you'll need both the PS app and the PS messages app for it to work I believe.
---
Yeah I guess so, but that‚Äôs the risk of being wanted. At least supposed to be.
---
the Camra and related challenges have drained me of joy two days of glitches bugs and spawn deaths has taken its toll.  i did end up in a tree once and that was funny but still no atoms for funny glitches
---
just the torso armor? man, this is tough stuff to find!
---
Forbidden Knowledge is consistently bugged for me now. I get ammo, aid, caps (25), and XP (approx 480), but no plans.
---
Not sure exactly when this started but has been going on for at least a couple weeks.
---
I saw another post about certain BoS plans not being available from vendors, not sure if there is a connection. 
---
I‚Äôm playing on Xbox.
---
Anybody else having this issue?
---
Ok downloading it now
---
Yeah I thought black titanium was super rare til I found this out.
---
I just want to be Gary...
---
I've had my CAMP near Camp McClintock since I first bought the game. I know it's far from most of the late-game areas I'm currently doing, but McClintock has tons of free loot, good spot to pick up springs and ballistic fiber. Walking distance from the Sutton train station, and ~10-15 caps away from the Whitesprings.
---
They both have a different vibe.  Blackbird is the black matte Lambo.  Nuka is ithe shiny triple waxed look-at-me sibling.
---
Basically. When fully equipped it will double your yield for ores and give a bonus to carry. There are a couple mines that can score you quite a bit of lead and steel.
---
Looks more like a phone booth to me my dude
---
I think an important perk for all bloodied would be nerd rage.
---
Ok any water though
---
Perfect, yes!
---
And they're fast as fuck. Once I was farming and over encumbered when I was jumped by a huge group of them above my level, couldn't get away. I walk/jogged in circles for probably 10-15 mins trying to shoot them without vats. I now carry a strong melee weapon at all times.
---
Bracer mod has 0 impact on the ores mined with excavator power armor; regardless of how the workbench descriptions for the arms and arm mods are written.
---
It is though. To everyone else outside of r/FO76 atleast. I‚Äôve never seen a single game kill a franchises and companies momentum like 76. Sales aside, which were t THAT great, this game was a huge flop.
---
I buy all quantum‚Äôs 30-35 caps a bottle
---
Well, kind of along the lines of everyone else, but more expanded, find a routine that works for you daily. I used to farm my 7 vendors to get my daily 200 cap limit while looking for items or mods I may want. In the process I would also hit a few events that I simply had muscle memory for, and I would keep an eye out for Uranium Fever, AWOL, and camp establishment, especially for getting plans.
---
Now that we can just use one vendor, like most everyone else would say, farm somewhere with high exp.  Ideally, if you are lazy, get a Tesla and find areas with high numbers of mobs, rinse and repeat. Whitesprings is a great spot for that, but it is also kind of a jerk move for everyone else on the server, so don't stay there all day. Hopefully something in this was useful.
---
It‚Äôs a showcase, not an auction
---
Wearing the Excavator PA givers more ore when mining Veins in mines, up to 4x.  Haven‚Äôt seen and increase in the outcropping slaying around though.
---
Thank you!  It really relaxes me to base-build.   I'm a very high-level character and this is part of exploring the end-game for me.
---
I've gotten 2 tse drops. Both were 2\* on an assault rifle and a minigun. Most tse weapons are duped which makes it funny they sell for so much.
---
I knew this when I asked it honestly lol
---
Don't feel bad. You just haven't leaned the best way to deal with them for your build. I can't one shot them but I have lvl 3 enforcer on my shotgun build and I cripple their legs immediately and they just lay there like a little baby.
---
I have a theory it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre purposely making it unattainable through in-game currency so You‚Äôll considered spending real world money on the items.  A full set or 3* armor goes for 25-90k caps depending what type it is.  Or you can PayPal 20-25$ for the set and have it in an instant.  I don‚Äôt deal with black market game sales, but I trade with many players in-game and I‚Äôve heard this all over the place.
---
Theres a stream near Summerville, it's close, but a bit downhill.
---
Yeah thats were i found it. It was the first time and i am lvl 189
---
Then after some days you die permanently. You will be petrified permanently
---
I sent you a message on ps message. You‚Äôre offline though
---
Couldn't agree more on point and also funny best post I've seen in awhile
---
58 days playing 24/7
---
Not in my stash after i make 800 45. for my fixer
---
Shit is in the air tonight!
---
Be right there; just let me take your pic too
---
the time limit is the only thing im aware of.  game only gives you 10 minutes but ive had lagspikes before that have hid the timer
---
This sounds like the opposite of fun.
---
I actually never seen a timer when i do the event.
---
There is no plot to drive you.
---
 I just want to say what I want to say.  the amount of time you have spent bitching about my wall of text you could have already read it twice. then you make the illogical decision to waste more of your time complaining to me that somehow I am responsible for you wasting your time. classic dunning kruger.
---
Awesome thanks is you
---
You know what would make pvp more interesting? No legendary effects.  You can mod weapons and armors, use mutations, but no legendary effects.  Then you'll see who is truly skilled at pvp.
---
I play Fallout. That‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm trying to start a conversation about the good and the bad about PvP, it‚Äôs a part of the game so I‚Äôd like to see it in the best way it can be. 
---
I don‚Äôt think dedicating a couple days on a character to stat-max them toward griefing other players that can‚Äôt fight back is healthy for the game. It‚Äôs why I made the post.
---
Even in the end game when you have power armor and amazing weapons, 2 swipes and you're dead.
---
You can join if you‚Äôd like. There‚Äôs quite a few of us holding and relogging to get what we need.
---
Don't overhype it please. Probably going to be hugely disappointing. If we think like that, we may be pleasantly surprised.
---
They close completely, however and are meant for protection from outside. Of course really for nuclear fallout...
---
[insert thatsracist.gif here]
---
Being a criminal character in survival mode would be kinda boring honestly. Everybody is so fired up for bloodlust already. It's the dark universe where the Vault was filled up with the best and brightest of psychopaths and murderers. (I should note this is why I play Survival more now. I want to be the good guy in a world full of murderes. Plus the XP boost is nice) 
---
I honestly don't want all the criminals and raiders pulled from adventure though. It brings an extra element of danger and they are both perfectly acceptable character tropes for this setting. If you want to play someone who is running from the "law" I'm cool with that. 
---
Try it sometime. Just dump your junk and pick a couple locks. Getting a 20-30 cap bounty won't break your bank by any means, and it can really add to the paranoia you'd expect from a post apocalyptic hellscape.
---
See I‚Äôd agree but then you get the Marsupial/Chameleon combo that‚Äôs ever so frustrating to deal with.
---
What's your psn?
---
On that note; where the Radscorpions at? For a Fallout game, they're a surprisingly rare occurrence. (Top of the World has one, and SBQ sometimes... is that it?)
---

Dunno if you still get them in helvetia, but there was always a bunch of squirrels and stuff there when fasnacht was on.
---
Can't say I've ever found a full set, but I got all my t-60 by running around Watoga (check the top of the buildings, think there are 5 spawns in the city).
---
Very nice, maybe a holy pre-war relic in a case some day? The finger of Saint Howard perhaps?
---
Just had my 3* BOS combat armor chest disappear as well... FINALLY completed a BOS Unyielding armor set and less than 5 minutes later, gone...
---
kevo0788
---
Oh really? What platform do you play in maybe I could sell you mine for 30 caps
---
Hasn't had any effect for me.
---
Ooof sorry that sounded so bad. I mean, its true. i get intimidated when i see albino and that is racist also
---
I‚Äôm talking the act of PvP, while that is tempting ;)
---
Its worded weird. I tried a mix and match armor set up for increased functionality and aesthetics. Excavator arms for the ore bonus, t60 chest for a jet pack, t51b helmet for ballistic resistance and looks and x-o legs.
---
But the ore bonus didn't work. It says both arms. But its really the chest piece and only the chest piece is required. Wearing the rest of the suit gets you the +100 carry weight. Tested this by wearing only the chest piece on a frame and it worked but  only arms did not.
---
Truth this is what still makes me terrified. Then they made them wimps in fallout 4 as it's one of the first creatures you encounter.
---
I have a 1 star two shot railway rifle. I would sell it for a million bajillion pre war money. Taking offers...
---
neat idea, but it opens a can of worms because now everyone will want to turn into a mole miner.
---
Sleep, leader bobblehead, cranberry relish, inspirational (if on a team). Then hit high lvl areas. Lather, rinse, repeat.
---
So either one shot it or instant death? Seems fair...
---
 tho it says the arms provide the bonus it's definitely the torso and only the torso. Test by putting just the torso on a frame and mine something
---
It does not sadly. The spike kind of just explodes into nothingness.
---
Solid post! Have my upvote!
---
I gotta take care of something else. I probably wont get there anytime soon. Thanks though!
---
If anyone else has one for trade I'll trade my imposter outfit for the imposter helmet.
---
It‚Äôs one of the most fun and least effective things in the game. A range boost would make it a must have.
---
wait, where did you get that info about mole miners coming from fev usage? i'm very curious about their origins lore wise
---
It's automatic only if it says automatic.
---
Np! If I find an extra clock I‚Äôll grab it and you can get the caps back to me!
---
Ok. I'll pay a little extra too.
---
Ok it seemed like a dumb question but that rof just throws me off thanks!
---
brave
---
I only use one fire axe for melee yet lately all i get is melee garbage like stalker‚Äôs lead pipe. It‚Äôs just wishful thinking. Each server has its loot pool and often times the pool is not very large. I know this because I sometimes I get duplicate items from one WS run. Two stalkers‚Äô mole miners gauntlet in a row, what are the odds? If it‚Äôs completely RNG over the total possible combinations, the chance to get two 100% identical items in less than five minutes is astronomically low, yet it happened several times.
---
Centaurs I think are like.. someone tossed into an FEV bat with lots of other creatures at the same time
---
cool i found several skins in 76, 4 has CC skins too
---
You're right, I posted another version; https://twitter.com/GatesOfTartarus/status/1125048670779396097
---
Its 10 mins or so.
---
Just like that, he had two :) add me and you can grabbit later.
---
I'm here
---
Thank you!
---
Because not all the things he mentioned happened or are being reported from correct perspectives chief :D
---
It was welcome comfort in the post-apocalypse!
---
..and another way to check would be to hold down your fire button and see if the weapon is shooting as an automatic or just once as semi-auto.
---
Thanks! I was thinking about something like that. I'll have to look into how I can get that done.
---
I really think Scorched units in unique suits of Power Armor would be badass.  It reminds me of Colonel Royez from Fallout New Vegas a bit.
---
I‚Äôm going to try that later, thanks
---
Census Violence with multiple players sometimes spawn multiple claws at one.  It's fun
---
I was going to do that but didnt want to use resources on it if it wouldnt work with what I was trying to do.  I guess it wouldnt have cost much though
---
Where?? Add me
---
Why is bloody mess only a 2 pick and not 3? I'm not experienced with the perk really, I'm just curious. I usually prioritize interesting or fun cards vs pure damage so I haven't used it in my current 3 build.
---
For melee, Incisor is a must have. Blocker is also a good pick on most melee builds. If you're a pure melee build you should also perk into stealth cards with Sneak and Ninja.
---
I don't use bloddy mess or adrenaline in my unyielding bloodied unarmed build since my damage output is already ridiculous.
---
It's fickle. I hopped probably 30 times one afternoon trying to get pump action plans (got a decent 3* drop, needed mods).
---
I saw just about everything there that is reported to spawn but the pump. And probably 2/5 you'd see nothing.
---
Yeah, lately these daily challenges are draining the joy out of the game. Daily challenges should be made to make people want to log in and play everyday, and complete the challenges. But lately it feels like the game developer made the daily challenges so hard / impossible to annoy players.
---
They even starting to force people to do PVP, hunter / hunted daily challenges almost popped every day this week.
---
alas i am on pc sir :(
---
So, you mean that basically the mod is broken / bugged ?
---
When i need alu i run down from my camp close by Solomons pond, down to the ws train station and up the 2 wooden stairs to blackwater mine, takes me 10 min's.
---
When i melt the ors after i usually end up with 120-130 alu, i did not get that amount before the i attached the Bracer's, pretty sure about that :/
---
That's why I said Tokyo (home of Sony, not me. Haha)
---
There has always been pacifist in survival.
---
Yeah, they aren't as much of a threat they used to be. I'm a level 30 something stealth character and they only take 1-3 hits from my black powder rifle if I'm stealthed
---
I have a very similar build and I switch between a Bloodied Lever Action, and a Bloodied Combat Rifle. I use Tank Killer instead of Ground Pounder, and I also have the Speed Demon mutation (dog food for life!) which I counteract with Good Doggy.
---
I can empathize with this.  Once you get to a point where you can take down most things in a hit or two, what is there to do?  You can hunt for Legendaries to incrementally improve your character, but outside of the Scorchbeast Queen, and to a lesser extent Encryptid, when will they matter?  You're dropping stuff left and right anyway.
---
I think a big part of the problem is that once you get past Lv. 70 or so, a good 2/3rd of the map doesn't matter to you.  You won't get decent Legendaries, all the enemies are trivial, and there's little reason to go there.  It would be great if every region had its own equivalent of West-Tek, but it doesn't.
---
You should have gone for the head... Jk
---
   It sounds like you or your weapon are a lower level than your enemies. My low level strategy is to take out a knee. It slows em way down. Works well on deathclaws, super mutants, mirelurks, and those pesky charred ghouls. There's a good perk for leg crippling if you like shotguns.
---
Ps I'm not totally sure but I was told specific areas have certain level ranges for enemies and it can depend on the level of whoever gets there first and makes them spawn in, so heads up wanderer
---
üòÇü§Æ
---
I also made a mixed set after making completed sets of every type. Its a t51 helmet because its the coolest looking t60 torso for jet pack xo arms and legs. I'd like to use ultracite legs but the mods have been non existent for me.
---
I would like that!
---
I'd like stuff like that, but 20/30/50 atoms is *far* too cheap for what they'd likely be priced at.
---
Sure! :D
---
With a high level unyielding/low health build, you can 1 shot almost everything in the game.
---
I was seriously just thinking about making a "Make Deathclaws Great Again" post. The burrows would have been a great opportunity for a Deathclaw nest rather than yet another ghoul farm
---
game failed to sell, is maintained by a skeleton crew.
---
Yes its a new bug haha
---
ok made a new friend but she doesnt forum. took her to take mona=ongah the server shut down for maintainance and she had to log. ;/ so now i have retaken monongah and working on fusion cores.
---
Added.
---
I have two railway riles, one instigating and one executioner's. I wonder if I could swap between them quickly for really tough enemies....
---
Everyone just exploits instead of doing the puzzle.
---
I can confirm this. Had my camp behind the WS trainststation when someone nuked this area too.  Total wreckage.
---
True
---
Honestly, they don't usually have to. The truth is, when people put their prejudices aside and actually play the game, they generally find out it's a lot better than they've heard, even to the point some of them are downright shocked how different it is from what they've heard. 
---
People generally don't have to call it good, because there's a stream of new players who realize it IS good. And the players there are the first to hold BGS accountable for any bugs and issues until it gets fixed, rather than waiting and hoping papa beth would be nice to them if they smile and defend them.
---
What you're seeing isn't people trying to defend cat shit. It's just people holding the video maker just as accountable as they do the game. If the guy making the video is outright lying or talking about something they're uninformed about, who else but the people who actually experience these issues would be able to call them out on misinformation.
---
This post should have been titled:
---
"Make American Deathclaws Great again"
---
Well, if you have enough distance you're good too
---
With all due respect, burn-out happens in *every* game, especially at the amount of hours you've got. Just stop playing for a while and come back when there's new content. The best part of FO76 is that it's an online game with regular updates, so there'll be gradually more and more stuff to do as time goes on, as opposed to a single-player game with limited replay value. 
---
Yes, the new content isn't particularly vast at the moment, but just be patient and play something else while waiting for the new stuff to accumulate to a level that'll keep you interested again. You aren't tied to FO76, there's no subscription system, you don't *have* to play if you're not enjoying it.
---
Taking breaks is important sometimes, you have to know when to step back before you become disillusioned. It's a lesson I've learned many times with WoW, except it wasn't so easy to step away in a case like that because I'd paid money to be able to play.
---
Look dude, I came into this post happy to help out another member of the game's community. But if you can't be arsed to help me, why the hell should I help you?
---
I setup my camp there now and I just got to see a missile come out of it that someone launched!
---
You didn't know about the double XP? It was on the title screen when you logged in...
---
&gt;It's a bad sign when people need to google shit.
---
Some of y'all never played Morrowind and it shows
---
I looked into it and you‚Äôre totally right, my bad. Forgot all about that- didn‚Äôt realize there were TWO mentions of Vault 76 this far in advance, go figure.
---
Don't laugh, CaptainNoob did a weapon showcase on it and it wrecked everything in its path!
---
The easiest way to fix this issue is to let us do a selfie with the camera. I know it's an old camera, still using a film, not even a digital camera. And yet it's year 2076... I assume people 57 years from now don't even know what is a "selfie" anymore lol
---
True story, one day when I picked up the controller I prayed to RNGesus, ‚Äòplease drop me another bloodied explosive weapon, I‚Äôm asking you just this once‚Äô. Walked into WS club house a three star ghoul came right at me, killed it and looked at the loot, a three star bloodied broadsider
---
No XP from turret kills unless you tag them.
---
I‚Äôd be glad to have turrets etc so long as I got a chance to tag anything so I got XP without wasting ammo.
---
Same I with setting up home near the fissures around watoga that‚Äôs where my camp is and a few more together would make it much easier to farm SB
---
I don't think anybody would be willing to pay 1k for level 25 "fun"
---
That was an amazing wholesome story! Wish i had friends like that but the solo gaming is my life
---
I‚Äôm level 100 and I‚Äôve DEFINITELY never seen one. Also in the same boat as you, would love one but I refuse to purchase it.
---
I mean... You understand them pushing Hunter/hunted and the alcohol stuff....
---
But not them trying to urge more people to play co-op?
---
Atoms are paid currency, just offering daily challenges that are pretty easy to accomplish is pretty solid. The fact that once in a while there's 1 or 2 I can't complete doesn't warrant a complaint.
---
I'm also pretty sure a 5 second "Looking to complete challenge" post here would fix your issue.
---
The Xbox app on your phone makes it so much faster to type messages.
---
No Scorcheds or Super Mutants on those coins? Counterfeits.
---
Wait, really? So can you tell me- no details, just curious- does she actually speak English or is it the same garbled Mole Miner gibberish?
---
Bought one from the white springs vendor....
---
Just make a friend to do the camera challenges with, it‚Äôs kinda fun tbh. I don‚Äôt always mic up, but I usually have better experience when I do. Messaging works fine too though
---
Alrighty thank you all , all I need is one more leg and I've got the set, just need screws
---
It's not a bad sign. People are just impatient and don't want to find it organically. 
---
The camera isn't going any where. So you're not going to miss it.
---
And as for double XP? It puts it right in your face when you start up the game.
---
I ve test its cool but not very fast ^^
---
Complete set of Cheap one star mutant slayer armor plus Westek.
---
Your railway has probably been mass produced after you sold it ü§Æ
---
10 mm pistol - does more damaged to scorched and bullets explode. I named it plague stopper.
---
Everyone had speculations on how it should be. It doesn't really matter now, It's not going to work like that. 
---
It's just buying legendaries with scrip.
---
The only thing people are really unsure of at this point, is how much scrip you'll get from each * legendary, how much they'll cost, and whether or not serverhopping will change the inventory.
---
Todd didn't have to use the word 'rolling' when talking about the vendor, since there's apparently 0 correlation with rerolling in the upcoming system. 
---
But, it's possible that it was an intention to implement it, and then BGS said, nahhh, to hard to implement, or a million different things that led to it being reduced down to just buying.
---
I dip back into Fallout 4. Those settlements aren‚Äôt rebuilding themselves!
---
The bots in watoga make for great metal farming. Or just capture a workshop with aluminum ore.
---
Dude the mire camp is badass! Really nice on on that one.
---
Welcome!
---
It‚Äôs a fun idea, but I don‚Äôt think so, tbh. Firstly; is there a source in the game that says FEV created the Mole Miners? (i dont mean that condescendingly I‚Äôm genuinely curious, i havent found any lore about their creation). Secondly, that‚Äôs GENERALLY not how FEV works. It‚Äôs not some kind of zombie virus. I guess it‚Äôs theoretically possible that a modified strain could be passed on by blood or touch or something, but until we see evidence of that I personally doubt that getting wounded by a Mole Miner turns one INTO a Mole miner.
---
*insert Indiana Jones facepalm*
---
My guess is that each star will earn you scrit, with a multiplayer based on how many stars there are.
---
1 star item = 1 scrit
---
3 star item = 9 scrit
---
New legendary items will be available at prices starting from 500 for a 1 star and 1500 for a 3 star. 
---
This is purely speculation based on almost no facts whatsoever.
---
Thank you!  I love building around in-game structures too, but it's so hard to find them and actually have your camp place since they're so popular.
---
T60 is dirt cheap to repair.  T51 is superior DR.
---
I feel like I received that one from claiming a workshop.
---
What platform?
---
I have two characters (lv115 and lv130, i played overall 250h) and found 2 TSE (a dragon i kept, and i think it was a shotgun lv30-35 i got when i was 40-45 with my first character, didn't played shotguns, sold it to a npc, i don't regret it though, i never made a exchange with an other player and never will except if real life friends start to play F76).
---
Honestly I don't care about TSE weapons, or explosives in general, so i don't care really much not looting them. I prefer instigating/vampire stuff. Looted a vampire explosive shotgun two days ago though (on a legendary dog 3\* during a workshop defense lol). It's overly efficient, but not really fun to play with it. I will keep it just to see how it will do after the shotgun explosive nerf.
---
I farm my legs only at "west steack", whitespring, the asylum, and burrows/city upside (it's a crappy place legendary wise, but quite fun to run, and there is a vendor), and of course i take.retake a lot of workshops, there is really often 3\* legs in those events, it's free to travel, and that permit some fun pvp encounters sometimes when someone try to take one from you.
---
I disagree. There's someone for every weapon. Somewhere there's a guy that's building an auto pistol character, who needs a gun for mid level. 
---
But again, I also said from the start that nobody would even pay 1000 for it. 
---
This was my feelings on the state of the game and its player base. On one hand, you have the super vocal "caps are worthless" elite gear traders. 
---
On the other hand, you have the people saying "30-40k for one item" that want to get to that high tier, but they're upset about the outrageous prices. 
---
What I'm also saying is the sliding scale economic model, not the jump off a cliff economic model.
---
Yeah lol adding a 0 wouldn't be enough.
---
Would be more like 1200/1500 bundle price
---
Ore aluminium isnt fast  :/
---
Lucky you, I thought wood armors are always one star üôÄ
---
3* Mr. Handy Buzzblade
---
Bloodied 
---
50% Limb Damage
---
Can't remember
---
I call it Dirty Handy
---
If death rider is the t60 then it isnt out yet
---
And Flatwoods Monster nearby causes pink mist.
---
Its gone forever :(
---
Do you plan out your builds in advance? My decoration and design skills suck
---
I heard it is filled with 1 nuka shine
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had several 3* and I‚Äôm lvl 65. He‚Äôs gotta mean 3* tse
---
Yeah it is, cheers :) Just saw a note on the War one saying it works on all armours so I wanna grab death for X-01
---
I haven't gotten the challenge, but the Flatwoods Monster counts as an alien for killing the various different types of creatures so, in theory, it should work.
---
Yes all the new skins are a complete reskin to look like the one in the pic it also says it in the description
---
Yeah me too. I spend a lot of time exploring around trying to find new spots that have unique existing structures I can build on. I've wanted a spot with a bunker or cave like your camp in the Mire. That was super cool.
---
PErsonally I'd prefer if they just made the atom store prices actually reasonable and just not allow us to earn them in game. At least it feels more honest, I'd pay a reasonable price for some stuff (I'm not paying 10 bux for a power armor skin though), and I wouldn't feel pushed to try to make atoms and not actually play the rest of the game. As is their prices are ridiculous, the grind for atoms is unreasonable with the challenges they give you (not to mention they already are not that generous with how many atoms you can earn even if you do them all). And now to top it all off they add in repair kits which for me means I absolutely refuse to buy atoms period (because now you'll find the in game stuff and not just the make atoms stuff starts getting annoying so they can encourage you to just pay for repair kits to make it less annoying).
---
So on X-01 it'll look like T-60?
---
Yes man
---
I think you could have just listed point 2 and it would have been enough for me!
---
You could literally make your own "Feed the People" event :)
---
I believe you can put an automatic receiver on it which would make it work with Commando.
---
No it‚Äôs not.  Albinoism ‚Äòain‚Äôt a race thing - it‚Äôs a soul-sucking ‚Äúholy shitballs what the fuck is that‚Äù case of pure freakdom and should be killed with fire.
---
Ich you attach an automatic receiver on both rifles they will benefit from the commando perks.
---
I have a furious explosive .50 cal with a prime receiver that I named Killer Queen. Mostly for SBQ fights of course but I will pull it out on an unexpected Mirelurk Queen to mow her down pretty fast.
---
Another fave is a 3* handmade rifle that I named The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale.
---
Also have a double shot non-explosive combat rifle that I named Double Shot Espresso.
---
Fasnacht Sausage? ;)
---
Squirrels, opossums, foxes and rabbits drop them sometimes.
---
Happy hunting!
---
Yea but a week or two ago the weekly challage had take a pic of the flatwoods monster and an alien... needless to say that no one was able to finish that challenge
---
Easy now friends, we all have different methods of communication
---
Hate to say it, but server hopping Golf Club has always been the most lucrative for me for legendaries, and xp.
---
around 2-3 legendaries on average, like half a bars worth of xp around that level, and still pretty fun for me, especially when all the ghoulies get pissed. I play stealth, but sometimes stealth straight up breaks, especially when you're in an area before the enemies load in.
---
Protip, check the map when you load in, if someone else is in there, just server hop again. It's not worth the trouble of competing for ghouls.
---
I do second that statement lmfao. and then i saw an albino Radscorpion... BURN IT WITH FIREE
---
Yao Guai are broken. They swipe very fast compared to deathclaws.  I crippled one and walked in front of me and started blocking it, and it managed to attack so fast that it broke my block and nearly killed me.
---
Deathclaws have lost their teeth only because they can't pull off the stunts they do in Fallout 4.  They don't dodge shots anymore, they don't grab players, and they also don't have that bloody mess perk that makes anything they attack explode into chunks.  That was my favorite part of them in Fallout 4, is that anything they kill just exploded, doesn't happen anymore in 76.
---
There is a marsh in the northeast area that always has a mirelurk queen and ifyou are lucky, a king (not always the king). On top of that there are eggs that can and will hatch all over the place. So as long as the king is there and you can make sure they die together you can easily get the picture (The spawn are so easy that I'd do the first two and then worry about getting a spawn to die near the other two). Granted, this is given that you can kill both (I got my friend to help). You could try to see if you can't get a pic of them and the spawn together before you run away too ;).
---
I'm not sure what the mechanics are for low level spawn triggers. It could revert to something more random when there's nothing nearby but a low level. That site is always so crowded that it's nearly impossible to do any testing with low level spawns.
---
This is a very common f2p tactic and it also is using hte same psychology casinos and such use to get gamblers to keep gambling. Give a lot at first and let them feel the rush of "winning" and then slowly peter it away so they keep trying to get that same rush again.
---
With the scrip machine coming next patch I bet lots of people are hoarding every legendary now that they k ow they can unload them.next week for scrip.
---
There's nothing implying that that's her last log, especially since she creates a new one for the server after a nuke is launched (found at, I think, site Alpha? Whichever the middle one is). I think she was severely wounded, but recovered. She's the friggen overseer, after all!
---
Don't pick other peoples locks, i learned the hard way. Picked one. Then had a much lower level try to kill me, i just kept about my business, but this kid wouldn't stop so I dropped him with my black diamond and left. The kid respawned and kept at me so I drop him again all wile trying to walk away. The kid must have been getting frustrated because some level 250 comes out of nowhere and drops me. I just left the server then and there. We need an oops emoji.
---
No it doesnt lol well not ps4
---
It's just East of Haven church, by the sunken church!
---
?
---
Sometimes I do, but mostly it's, "slap something down and keep building until it works".  I get a lot of ideas and suggestions from friends too!
---
I'm on PS4 as well. If I actually happen to come across another Flatwoods Monster during the challenge, I'll update on here with what I find out!
---
Ah sorry i thought it said bone rider haha
---
636 hours level 147. 3 two shots. Lots of vampire weapons. Never a TSE....
---
&gt; snap camps together
---
I started playing a few days ago along with my wife and cousin and was disappointed we couldn't do this. So we have individual little hovels instead of a mighty shack.
---
I was gonna say shiiiiieeeeet. Hahahaa i cant believe they have one called "bone rider"
---
Damn lol I have no friends just my partner
---
Lmaooo my bad, they had war rider too
---
Maybe it's all in the delivery?
---
People sure love being called tards. They'll agree with you in a heartbeat.
---
Totally worth it. I had the plan for the BoS combat armor chest piece drop from Savage Divide #1. Been farming that thing for the longest time!
---
I know that. Was just saying that people will be more likely to trade in caps for scrips instead of dropping 60k on someone‚Äôs lever action rifle off the market
---
Unlike ‚Äúfucking lol‚Äù, which is an in-depth analysis.
---
Plans
---
That‚Äôs as may be. I think New Vegas is a pretty good Fallout, but not as good a *game* as 3 or 4; understandable considering Obsidian‚Äôs lack of familiarity with the engine and with first-person open world games in general.
---
Lol butthurt seething cope
---
Feed the people at mama Dolce's gives the canned meat stew item, that gives 10% xp for an hour, and is quite easy if you have decent weapons given the level cap of enemies. It combines well with other events.
---
In general, the best way to level is to get a lot of people in one event that spawns enemies, and use aoe or rapid fire weapons to tag as many enemies for exp as possible. A number of events tend to attract higher level players, which can be a blessing or curse. In the top left area of the map the free range event can attract players quite frequently, and if you start it but don't start herding the cows you can usually invite other players. The more players in an even the more enemies spawn.
---
Most events with only one player aren't particularly interesting or rewarding, but with 4 they can become quite hectic and fun with large numbers of enemies spawning.
---
It really wouldn't be because the Overseers parents were poor
---
Hoarding is a mental illness.
---
I agree. Those things give me the heebie jeebies!!
---
I've encountered a few people that are pretty good teammates, and also play with some great friends that I know in real life.  It's invaluable to have some trustworthy people to play with!
---
Wow ur friend won't tell u lol
---
Once everyone literally just laughs and tells then yo go fuck themselves, they will starve.
---
They may all have been 1*. As soon as I seen the word Wood that was it.
---
You and me both. I tried the original Fallout after I finished 3, and noped out in less than an hour.
---
Gladiator used to affect unarmed weapons but I'm pretty sure that was patched. It doesn't seem to work for me any more. And I'm pretty sure Iron Fist never affected 1h weapons.
---
So, for your bloodied build, are you running a full set of unyielding armor, cause that should be your next step. Also, don't forget about radicool perk for an extra 5 str. With a bloodied build you should have 3/4 of you up as radilation damage anyways.
---
Lol that's bad dude why are you defending giving a multinational more money because someone else did too
---
I'm sure you can.  On consoles, left on the D pad swaps between the current and previous weapons.  I'd bet there's a key binding for quick-swap on the PC version.
---
"multinational"
---
Wut.
---
COPE COPE COPE WITH ME
---
Guys please don't leave I got scammed to pay 300$ for a broken product maybe years after release it'll be in the state they promised when selling me it
---
OMG, lol
---
Beautiful.
---
To me it's still fun..I'm always trying to get good legendary drops..I'm a grinder..so I don't really rush thru things..after playing so much I really developed a particular gameplay style..one thing I did notice tho..was that WS does not appeal to me as it used to..I used to live there..I can't even remember the last time I was there during a blast zone..if I was it was for about 5 minutes..then I just went somewhere else
---
The ski resort and top of the world is a great area. Each ski pole with scrapper perk provides two aluminum each
---
I guess I'm viewing it differently. It is a two shot weapon that fires grenade rounds, so two shot explosive. I don't know what BE weapon is. I haven't used trading markets so I don't know how to just buy the best.
---
I used a keyboard before, from when I used it all the time on ESO. despite the crashes and lack of instant update to text chats, the app is definitely better.
---
So far its looking like the Rider skins are rotating weekly. First week was Plague, second was War. We dont know which one comes next but whichever it is won‚Äôt be in the Atom Shop until the weekly reset on Tuesday.
---
How so?
---
All my partner and I encounter are dicks. Being almost 30 we're both pretty over the juvenile griefers. Shame you're on ps, lol. I do have a ps4 pro but that's just for exclusives, nothing online.
---
I named my 10mm pistol the "Wasteland Classic".
---
It's definitely new, &gt;!but it's still gibberish. That said, they changed the design, so they might change the audio too.!&lt;
---
Yeah I agree but i assume it wouldn't be more than 200 or 400 atoms if something like this would ever happen
---
Got involved in a land war in asia?
---
I love how folks assume that ‚Äúduped‚Äù means cursed. It doesn‚Äôt mean that, it literally means ‚Äúexact copy‚Äù.
---
there‚Äôs an alien statue in a closet in the taxidermy place in lewisburg. i‚Äôm not sure if it would count but it‚Äôs worth a try, i think.
---
Did they remove the random encounter for this guy? [https://imgur.com/Qyh71bY](https://imgur.com/Qyh71bY)
---
Bobandy
---
i I know but always empty for me... I have never luck when i farm here
---
Of course you‚Äôd have a game. You think games didn‚Äôt exist before micro transactions? And the atom shop is FO76 is retardedly over priced. Which shows me, MR. TODD HOWARD isn‚Äôt about making a game at all, but milking a franchise for every drop of money he can by squeezing stones.
---
So my idea for cool items from the atom shop still stands. Shut it down, and make a better game. Hell...I‚Äôd buy 10$ worth of atoms to spend on FO76 remastered if it turned out to be a better game. Put that in there.
---
I've only named two items so far. Both are nods to fandoms.
---
1. Cultist Dagger - The First Blade
---
2. Gas Mask with Goggles - Are you my mummy?
---
Add me supahkillaclown. I'll be on tonight. If you want you can browse my mules stash and if anything catches your eyes it's yours ü§ô
---
If it's like the Crossbow, 2 Shot can put 2 spikes in their bodies.
---
It expands with level I was told.
---
 Agh man I hope they do, that sounds really disappointing. I was hoping she could give us mild lore on the mole miners...
---
I tried to play high once, took me 4 hours to clear west tek because I had to search every single corner, some places multiple times because ya know, high and forgot. It looked new and then I‚Äôd be like hey wait who killed that guy?!? Let me search around for this mysterious person.....it was me...it was always me
---
No, it wouldn't be over that. I'd estimate around 250 atoms per pack at least.
---
Purified to toxic water = I will not buy anything these people make
---
That's a delusional belief. I kill them in hand to hand on a regular basis.
---
You were told wrongly.
---
On which? The fixer?
---
Are those two queens
---
Ok cool thanks
---
No that's budget I think, talking about the area you can build
---
Oof, you're right, that was the budget wasn't it.
---
There is no alien in the game yet so it is impossible. Already found out last time they had a challenge taking a picture of an alien toys and flatwood monster don't count.
---
you are only allowed to carry 1 at a time when you are allowed to do the quest
---
I don't know if there's really much more to them beyond "ghoulified miners". Tbh, all I really want is something like their outfit to wear, ala the special protective suit from Old World Blues in New Vegas.
---
I support this. OP is being a bit hyperbolic in his description of deathclaws, but they could definitely use a buff to live up to their name.
---
I agree with you, the main thing keeping me around was the trading market but it‚Äôs so shit right now. People are pricing items too high, lack respect, or knowledge and get shitty when you don‚Äôt agree with them. 
---
P.S. dO yOu hAvE a BE LaZeR? 500k caps?
---
So my toon had 35 in my inventory already when he got the quest... so that‚Äôs when they just disappeared ?
---
In the order that the screenshots are shown seems to be what they are being released as. Next should be death.
---
Fallout 4 kinda sucked didn‚Äôt it? And this is coming from someone who has got the Platinum trophy for it. It‚Äôs a good game in its own right but as a Fallout game, it‚Äôs awful.
---
Power Armour was supposed be a late game reward, Deathclaws we‚Äôre supposed to be intimidating but 15 minutes out of the Vault and you‚Äôre fighting one and winning.
---
lol
---
Didn't work for the weekly challenge where you took one of every cryptid, Flatwoods monster was a separate thing to alien
---
Just tested it with and without bracer mods, the increased ore yield is absolutely from just having both left/right excavator arms equipped on a PA frame regardless of any bracer mods. I think your confusion comes from the fact that when you inspect the left/right arms it will always show the  unique effect of "Increased mining yield when left and right arms are used in tandem regardless of if you have rusty knuckles, optimized bracers, etc for the mod on those arms.
---
I have never seen a sheep squatch am I missing something? I did the quest but it ended kinda abruptly
---
There‚Äôs BIV, the Imposter Sheepsquatch and Nukashine.
---
"You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder, You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder, You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder, You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder"
---
Plus real Sheepsquatch‚Äôs tearing up Appalachia.
---
Right now Free Range Event is Guaranteed Sheepsquatch but i think it spawns like a death claw now. Last time i saw one was at the super mutant camp behind Top of the World.
---
Yeah it is weird bigot. Hetero is so straight white male. Ugh. Fascist.
---
Yesterday I was waiting all day in a clown costume at the house of scares but no one came to my party :(
---
Oh, and the Burrows.
---
If you are in adventure, don't be afraid of high level players approaching you. Ive gotten some of my best armor and weapons just given to me because they out grew them.
---
My favorite weapon in Fallout 4 was a laser rifle that did radiation damage. I called it The Duke, and extra points if you get the joke. So far, I haven't named one in 76 yet, mostly because I'm at a crossroads as to what I want to do. I have a sniper build, but I'm really tempted to switch to a melee build I came up with because I have a rather nice AA combat knife that would be amazing if I specced correctly. Although I wouldn't mind getting another good revolver, like the one I used to have, and naming it Thunderer, a historical reference to Billy the Kid.
---
I'm new. What would be the perfect legendary effects for a heavy gunner build and why?
---
Really? I was on my weakest toon and got attacked by 2 lvl 50 scorchbeasts and a 65 legendary sheepsquatch (yes, at the same fucking time) and still didn't die. Long fight doesn't mean tough fight. So it took me 30 minutes to kill them all, because I had  a 10 mm pistol and a cane as weapons. I did gain tons of weight space, since I went from 65 stimpacks to 15.
---
Explosive .50cal rounds were always my go-to in NV, get a hit on a leg or something and cripple the other ones hiding nearby.  If they ever somehow got closer, riot shotgun
---
You also have to remember, that there is a very vocal minority of people who post to groups such as these here and on FB, there are tons of other players and I'd go so far as to say, the majority out there who don't. (I play with a bunch of them.) 
---
While, I haven't played the early games (I came in at Fallout 3.) I see Fallout 76 as a fun escape which will hold me over until the next chapter comes out.
---
That would be good oh and why a circle why not a simpler shape like a square or rectangle
---
Eat an addictol, try again :)
---
Im actually not on a console. :) But thanks.
---
Yeah i did kill one with only melee and 5 stimpacks and no power armor
---
Yup definetly running radicool, I have 3 pieces 3 star unyielding I just need to get comfortable not being in PA.
---
I spent far too long trying to click on the *image* of your store page, rather than the link to your store page.
---
A lot of the 20 atoms stuff is usually easier for me
---
At least you didn‚Äôt lose items out of your stash
---
The flat wood monster counts toward another challenge I did a while back. I think it was killing one. They‚Äôre kinda random but I usually ‚Äúfound‚Äù them while exploring out in the middle of nowhere. Listen for a spaceship kind of sound.
---
Buy from Ebay.
---
When you finish the quest all your technical data is removed. And the reward is same as returning just one data. So there is no benefir collecting or carrying more than one.
---
Would storing the rest in my stash been the better way to do it?
---
Over by the snake icon for me. Its awesome.
---
Not addicted to anything.
---
The survival challenge this week is horrible.  Gathering the wood is ridiculously annoying.  I thought it was just grab 250 qty of wood not grab 250 different nodes....
---
I'm up there with you. probably nearing 2K hours at this point, if not more. and I lost 3 pieces of equipment, only 1 a piece of power armor. one was a legendary, too.
---
you do you but I've seen posts like 'I've laughed but then it happened to me :(' more than once. and I'm damn glad it happened because people here need a wake up call.
---
I've checked reports dating back to release and I believe it has to do with server de-sync. the game thinks you're doing something, like pressing R to reload (R is the key to drop items on PC) inside the pipboy, when you don't have it open on the client. so it drops whatever is highlighted at that moment and you'll only notice it on fast travel/login because it works the same as in Fo4, the game saves/refreshes your character on fast travel.
---
and then there's named items disappearing. as far as I can tell, they work a bit differently and can just vanish for no reason other than being names.
---
but like I said, you do you.
---
It's a massive multiplayer online game. By definition that means it's a game that can be played by many people at the same time. What is the max people for a server? 30? Sure it's not like WoW standards, but that's still a lot of people. So yes it's an MMO.
---
Okay thanks to everyone. I was just worried that I will sell all of my legendary items for scrips and later on Bethesda will say fuck no and all of best trade items will require actual legendary items and not scrips.
---
I feels like the daily challenges are only becoming harder and harder to complete. That's ... sad  :"(
---
Circle is the easiest to code. Just set a simple "x distance in all directions from box placement" hence circular. A square would be a lot more player friendly but they'd have to add some geometry/math

I uh . . . y-you know the point of a vaccine is so that you *don't* catch that disease, right?
---
Factions and some unique names predictable farmable / grind items. People play to collect. We do events for plans, recipes, unique outfits. 
---
We need more good / interesting legendaries tied to timed content. Not pubg / fortnite challenges. Raid like events that require a bit of coordination and are on a timer.
---
Pin some to other nuke sites ... and different boss fights. Give me hordes that overrun some areas in massive waves. And give them each a chance at useful unique loot.

Demolition perk doesn't increases dmg on explosive weapons anymore does it? Thought it was a flat 25% bonus.

Yeah it's not so bad when you have Barbarian, Evasive, fire proof, blocker, dodgy, and serendipity(phew, I think I got all that I run.) Plus the grounded and scaly skin mutations. Even with a sliver of health I can tank pretty ok.
---
Nope, it didn't.. :(
---
lots of ideas.  Fallout in a candy kingdom wasteland...kingdom hears in a Disney's Gummi Bears scene I mean the possiblitites are endless.  And of course they will always look way sicker at night since they all will be light up displays.
---
I tested it myself and saw no difference. but maybe I messed up somewhere, who know. it's been really, really long.
---
I tested 2 level 5 pipe weapons with similar base durability. durability varies greatly between weapon level and your luck stat.

I don‚Äôt have any proof that I picked it up but I do have it
---
But if you had the disease from *before* you got the vaccine, the vaccine won't help you. The player comes into contact with numerous scorched, and potentially a Scorchbeast, too, before they get the vaccine.

---
Most monsters don't get above level 64 bosses go up to around 90
---
Agree
---
Highest level I think is 95 or 99. No higher than that.
---
No. Each monster has its own specific level cap
---
They're capped currently, pretty sure 91 but I could be wrong. The SBQ last night was 91 &amp; it's "endgame"
---
It's up to the buyer how much something is. If we don't pay that price, the price will come down. There is always someone around the corner ready to undercut the current price.
---
It's nearly simple... Nearly because we have to get everyone to do it...
---
ERECTIN' A SENTRY
---
You will have to buy it of someone who has a spare or wait until next year I guess
---
they scale with level, but every monster has a max limit as to how far they can go
---
That does suck.  My husband and I are in our 30's and regularly encounter players that are older.  I think PS4 has more of an older/easygoing base, but I have encountered a few assholes too.
---
Bloodied explosive LMG names Scorched Earth III
---
Yep
---
It's 95.
---
Contesting the workshop to kill someone isn't "griefing." I'm under no obligation to keep it after I kill my target.
---
I wish there were lv 200 deathclaws and supermutants. But yeah they do scale, highest being like lv 68 for supermutants and I think 70-80 for deathclaws.
---
You can‚Äôt get it normally now the events over ..will have to trade or buy it from someone
---
I think she's going to be the final boss. A giant, mutated overseer who cant help but attack you  all the while screaming for death
---
Ahhh ok. Bummer. Thought that‚Äôd be the case though.
---
&gt;Caps are worthless at end game
---
Exactly. If you want a BE or AAE Handmade/Lever Action you will need to find something of equal value eg. Assassin/Sentinel armor pieces. In the end it's about supply and demand. The supply of these weapons is tiny in comparison to those who wish to buy them.

Flatwoods monster is an alien afaik

---
Different enemies have different level caps. The highest I've seen for certain enemies:
---
1. Mole Rats - level 21
---
2. Super Mutants - level 68
---
3. Deathclaws - level 91
---
4. Mole Miners - level 40
---
5. Scorched - level 68
---
Each type of enemy seems to have its own level max for some reason.
---
Mobs will always be mixed with a slightly lower level variant. For example, you'll also find level 48 Super Mutants with the level 68 Super Mutants. You'll find level 42 Ghouls with level 62 Ghouls.
---
Yeah thought so but wanted to confirm. Bummer. If you know anyone with spares let me know :)
---
You gotta follow the liquor randy!
---
76 seems more like a "pilot" to create a larger game eventually. Better PvP, different loot, DLC, etc. Only problem I can see is "pay to play/win" style like WoW. 
---
Specially with players wanting 30k caps for an item, would not be surprised if someone were to offer or ask for $5 in an alter-coin (lol). I feel players are killing the game.
---
I never noticed a difference and Im level 205
---
I think i tried that myself for the first time i did that quest on my alt and it didnt work. I didn't get another quest after taking the saved pages from stash. After you have done it for first time the pages dont show the stack anymore, they just show as one questitem, no matter how many you pick up.

Your speculation sounds like sth they might do, only I hope it doesn't get as grindy as that: your numbers would mean to find and exchange either 167 3* or 1500 1*-weapons or armor for just **one** new 3*-item.
---
With current legendary drop rates, this would take around a week for more experienced and ambitious players (remember, in exchange for just **one** good item), and would keep the good stuff from the vendor (provided there is any) for all intents and purposes out of reach for casual or time-constrained players.
---
So my hope is that Bethesda uses the opportunity to turn Watoga back on in terms of legendary spawns, and increases the spawn rate on the whole as well. To be clear, I do support some of the changes they made in Whitesprings (players crouching and stealing spawns in the Golf Club has virtually disappeared, even the turret bases next door seem less attractive to the ghouls these days), but it happens to often now that I solo kill the entire ghoul population of the place (and I mean **all** buildings), and only have one or two (in most cases, crappy) legendaries to show for it. So, please do either improve the quality of legendary drops, or move the quantity back to normal (i.e., status quo ante)!
---
Everyone's only non-robot vendor. Would love to see more mutant, ghoul, hell even deathclaw NPCs.

Best of luck man, maybe you have mods installed?

my first tse was a 2 shot explosive dam res lever ation back when the game first came out i was lvl 60. Ive bought a tse handmade so more than likley it was duped from someone but recently i found my own from the imposter.
---
If people stopped paying such large amounts of caps for items the price of those items would have to drop.
---
Then that would render the entire innoculation quest pointless, it's Bethesda Brand Plot, so the vaccine has to work for the plot to advance, otherwise the dwellers would probably drop dead on contact with ultracite, god knows about setting foot in the glassed cavern without protection

Pvp works when sentinel/assassins is nerfed. Until then, it's just the haves and have-nots. I think its those two. Just making damage worthless is so broken.
---
Lol, did you misunderstand the post? First of all if you don't like games that includes grinding for your gear then maybe call of duty would be a better option for you. I never said trading was bad. A lot of my gear was made from trades. Gear I got from grinding and traded or sold so I could get gear I wanted. I'm very greatful for player trading. Even though I disagree with your vision of fallout76 I still do respect your opinion. üòä
---
 Why I bought Plague Rider, I like my X0-1. ;)

thats what weapon is worth if you dont like the price dont buy it. assuming it wasnt from pre duping era then he worked hard to get it. its really rare to get a god role like that until the vendor comes out

I mean where person one contest workshop person two follows owner all over the map killing them outside the workshop area

I 100% believe you as I watched a friend basically solo the queen with a bloodied My Handy Buzz blade.  Bloodied adrenaline builds are no joke.

Try hunter mode via the radio. Might spice things up

I do not understand what you wrote, would you please elaborate?

Just gotta hop once or twice, make sure it didn't put you back on the same server.

I forgot about top of the world for aluminum. I hit defiance last night &amp; was absolutely treading in someone's footsteps, not a frigging tray in sight (plus tables were devoid of the plastic dining ware).

At least Top of the World is easier access if it is cleared.
---
Because when enough YouTube's say something the weak minded start to believe it
---
Exactly, it's just like a real life economy. If people make a stand and collectively say 30k caps is way too much for 1 weapon, then the suppliers will need to adjust prices.
---
 Well there's Stabby and of course Stabby Stabby. I usually only carry a couple of em'. ;)

Sorry I'm stupid. In the holotapes in references multiple times how her family was poor but they were still happy and stuff. Which is why her dad worked in the mines and stuf
---
Just a heads up, Flatwoods Monster now counts, as far as today's challenge is concerned. Just snapped a pic myself.
---
Agreed, imo you should try something yourself before you judge it. Now having said that, a few YouTubers (Juicehead in particular) tend to be really fair with the game, they will commend it where it succeeds, but also acknowledge when an area needs work and not just focus on one side over the other.
---
Manyatruenerd found her tape where she‚Äôs dying. Don‚Äôt know if she did but listening to it, it‚Äôs likely.
---
You deserve all the upvotes
---
Juicehead atleast gave the game a chance mean while some people were shiting on it before it was even released
---
Okay asshole. Someone needs to grow the fuck up. 
---
Survival seasons should fix most of the broken mechanics anyway.
---
The community should start doing something about this.
---
I know there is an initiative, but I have not seen anyone yet say, "oh you want 20k for that? yea... ill give you 6k."
---
Couldn't agree more, F4 was kinda meh, but it at least felt like something from the fallout universe, 76 has mostly assets from 4 so I guess thats' a thing, but aside from visuals there not much more going for it, Where's the atmosphere? Where's the dark humor? I suppose the atom shop counts for dark humor, but yeah
---
Do those entail new questlines?
---
I hate you so much Ron (yes)
---
That's not the only bad thing. That was the bad thing that caused all the other bad things.
---
Looks like Bethesda has turned you toxic, too! ;-) No, honestly, that sucks if that is what happened. But purified to toxic water sounds not random enough to be explained by a bug, so maybe there is a reason for it? Like being in the toxic valley for too long will make your water turn bad?
---
Bethesda's only purpose is to make you buy more Atoms with real money. They aren't even fixing those 6 month old broken challenges that can give you +40 atoms.
---
Better enlist help with the Imposter. She‚Äôs a handful
---
True, pretty sure its like machine at watoga school. Insert xxx amount scrips for a random 3* .
---
Gonna still be huge rng
---
Need a yellow with a blue stripe that say MDTA.

Also do said places show up on the map I assume?

Ah, didn‚Äôt notice that. Sweet

Dude are you ok? 1400+ hours to this broken game. Seriously?

Click on the posters at any train station.

Things like this would give more reason to play with other players

---
Well, what if I give you some ground mole rat?
---
Yeah, maybe. Though they don‚Äôt behave like typical Ghouls, they seem much more sane and organized; just extremely hostile to all non-Mole Miners. Also there seems to be a little more to it than just ghoulification;if you look closely the Purveyor doesnt seem to be wearing gloves, showing she has weird yellow skin and long claws...
---
That is also not griefing. Not my thing, but one must be smart enough to realize that when you accept that you are open to PVP when you take a workshop, nothing says "only within the confines of the workshop area." Seems the issue here is you writing your own interpretation of the rules and expecting the world to follow them.
---
Hope so
---
My only interest now is rebuilding my CAMP. But its such a chore when you can't do simple things like snap stairs onto other stairs. When you finally do manage it and want to move it you can't because it's now apparently a vital part of the structure and can't be removed, even though it isn't attached to anything else except the other staircase. So you end up with a stupid floating staircase sticking out the side of your house that can't be deleted. Frustrations like that just make me close the game, once again it's Bethesda laziness and a "fuck it that'll do" attitude.
---
Great points
---
The oddity to the levelling everyone has mentioned are ghouls who go up to 62 but the glowing ones that are much tougher are 58. The whole level cap seems to be based around the player softcap of 50. I'm guessing the devs didn't take in to account that people would way exceed that and turn into geared up superhumans. That being said you can tank through most high level things in PA and a sledgehammer. The game could use some harder enemies.
---
Yeah fuck him. The often touted encycopedia of fallout knowledge and lore that didn't play a fallout game until 2008. He's nothing but a mouth piece for Bethesda.
---
I have a *Bloodied The Dragon that I named Ulysses Crosshairs and a lever action rifle called The Settler.
---
I spent a week with my camp in Toxic Valley and this never happened. Now I am in the Divide on a cliff overlooking the Bog. Just a badly written game. That's the only explanation for this. Or it's intentional on Bethesda's part. Either way it's crap from Bethesda.
---
That's pretty nice
---
Omg I‚Äôm so fucking happy I just had to stop playing with a really nice group of people because I couldn‚Äôt tolerate one of the little shitstain griefers they had so this is perfect.
---
Ok let me refine my words. In my opinion if you are just looking to kill other players by contesting a workshop then in my opinion it is griefing.  You want to have open pvp with no limits then play survival.  I stay away from workshops because people seem to be more into attacking people in adventure now and I'm not much into pvp. It would be one thing if they kill you and leave you alone after but thats not what they do. They keep it contested and just farm you for caps. If they just captured it and be done with it it's fine but making people have to leave a server just to be left alone is in my books griefing.  You dont have to agree with me but that's how I see it
---
Most likely won't be a feature as it wasn't in fo4, just new varieties of walls to expect.
---
Unique locally though
---
I've named a PA frame "This One". Not funny but it helps.
---
500k? Would need a few character to hold that amount.
---
But seriously the current 25k cap limit is way too low
---
Yeah they are rare. I actually lost like 4 pieces of mixed ones with bolstering, vanguard, cavalier powered, and sentinel effects a couple days ago. I left them in a mailbox to transfer between characters and then the server crashed so....many many hours of farming down the drain. I got 2 of them from the imposter sheepsquatch actually. One from the awol armament event in Watoga, and one from whitesprings farming.
---
Hell if I could craft a brick wall that had a different colored interior side, I would spend the time replacing every single wall. Totally worth it.
---
https://youtu.be/7s3XK87FQpM
---
It doesn't need to be a hovel :P
---
The Monster Mash event at watoga high is perfect for farming heavy combat. (Have half a set of vanguards from it) 
---
Youll usually get a one star from the event, almost always combat armor. Then the 2-4 legendaries that spawn during the event can get you a nice 2-3 star drop on occasion
---
     ummmmm ...Russian for Trump?
---
They're evolving.
---
Yea apparently people are buying items for over 125k they just have multiple accounts with characters holding max caps. I don‚Äôt understand how people have that much time
---
Yeah I agree. That's probably your best bet on getting a new interior colour, with a brick exterior.
---
I would love to rename more weapons, but I learned yesterday that there is a limit to how many items you can actually give a name to. Found out when I tried to mark all the stuff in my stash that waits to be turned into scrip.
---
That limit must be somewhere between 20 and 30 items, or maybe a bit higher, because I've prefixed a lot of fav clothing etc. with dots and underscores, respectively.
---
As it is, my favorite Tesla is called Shock Therapy, and my favorite Western revolver is The Dirty Harry.
---
Yeah youre right i should prob take a break, maybe ill get the itch to go around and explore
---
Level 161 400+ hrs and after load in I'm like uh.. I'm seeing other players in the level 400+ range so I find things to do üòÇ staying busy with dailies and quests I didn't do. I will always join in on a SBQ for the loot..
---
Thanks, i hate it.
---
Level 112, only got 1 TSE and it's a black powder rifle. Got it when I was like level 20.
---
The Watoga Monster Mash event seems to be bugged, out of the last 10 times I walked in there it's only triggered once.
---
Survival eliminates fast travel and you can lose aid items. It's not for everyone. Demanding that people who want to PVP at all go to that mode is ridiculous. That also does not make attacking workshops (the pvp things) just to fight other players (you know, PVP) griefing. Would you feel better if someone took the workshop and moved on?
---
If you don't want to PVP and you think basic PVP is "griefing," the solution is simple: don't participate in PVP events. That's like someone with a peanut allergy asking someone for a peanut butter sandwich then complaining when their own actions caused them to go into anaphylactic shock
---
You get the new quests from posters in stations. But dont get too excited.. All the new quests that have come since launch can be done in 2-3 hours.
---
I have two accounts at max caps almost all the time since theres not much i need or i cant spend caps on
---
I'm not trying to argue I'm just saying my opinion.  If you dont agree you dont agree.
---
Games still vanilla, I didn't know there were mods for fo76 tbh lol
---
They were elitist pond scum, let them go.
---
Something like The Master, with opposing personalities would be kind of cool, if a tad derivative.
---
Yeah ive been messing with camps latley, yesterday i moved my camp 4 times just for fun
---
I just hope for walls with CLEAN paint jobs on them. I mean, I'm building and painting the place, right? So the paint shouldn't look like it was applied before the bombs fell lol
---
I couldn't say if it started day one, most likely not but the birth if fallout 76 was the attempted addition of a co-op mode for fallout 4

I‚Äôm at level 215.  I just got my first tse this past week off of the Scorch beast queen.  My husband at level 230-ish has gotten two so far.  It‚Äôs just rng and I hope you‚Äôll have future luck too.
---
Let‚Äôs not talk about X-01 calibrated shocks though.  That‚Äôs still a sore spot.  Thank goodness for the trading forums.
---
Bethesda seriously didn't know the lengths some players would go to in fucking over other players. I'd say that in terms of MMOs, this is a failed experiment in a "player run economy."
---
Sometimes they spawn at the whitespring and in the forest south of silo alpha. Those are the areas I see them the most.
---
"I'm not trying to argue, I'm just saying that water is dry. If you dont agree you dont agree." You don't get to do that when you spew blatant falsehoods and misrepresentations. If your "opinion" is wrong and conflicts with facts, you should be called on it.
---
Ok, but what does any of what you've written have to do with my comment? I wrote that I would like to think that the Purveyor is Penny Hornwright;  I don't understand what the Overseer's Parents finances have to do with that?
---
pretty much what i needed to know, thanks
---
If I had to theorize, based on my very rudimentary knowledge, the mole miners are probably miners that got trapped in a mine where some sort of mutations occurred, naturally or otherwise. 
---
Maybe they kidnapped a bunch of people to create more of themselves ala The Master, maybe they're finite. Idk
---
Right? That's what I was thinking.
---
You play on xbox one?
---
On PC I believe there are, but it can really fuck with the game apparently
---
Not everyone is selling things for 40k+, but many of the organized traders (people on /r/fo76bazaar and the like) are, because they value caps less for the abundance they have. For them, the currency has devalued. I am amazed they'd even sell for that much, a lot of the big traders won't sell, only trade.
---
I'd expect 10k for a TSE railway rifle just because of its rarity, but that assumes I'd sell it instead of use it.
---
What ever I'm wrong you're rights I'm done. I guess if a level 30 gets harrassed by level 200s because he captures the junk yard thats just pvp because got forbid a low level players wants a workshop. Pvp in not balanced and there are way to many ways for people a abuse it to make other players day hell. In my opinion pvp should only be within the workshop area so they cant hunt you all over the map.
---
Up to you to try or not, but I'd give it a go if you didn't just try....
---
just as rare as any other 3 Star legendary drop with a roll you actually want. 
---
almost impossible
---
Meh. I've listed it a few times on market reddits with no nibbles. I'm not really worried. I've got a 1* bloody handmade that wrecks face pretty consistently. If I'm helping people level I can't use it because it one shots level 68 ghouls, and two shots super mutants.

If you drop all your technician data except for 1 then u can complete the quest for 1 at a time and still get the reward of 35 technical data. Just be careful that there arent other players around.

I have a mule specifically to hold on to crap for the legendary vendor. Once that arrives and I offload, all they'll do is allow me to transfer items to alts.

I've been getting loads of bloodied 1 stars... have yet to get a bloodied 2/3 star. In the last week I've gotten a bloodied power fist, assaultron blade, dragon, hunting rifle, pickaxe and a cryolator. Actually I lied I'm looking through my inventory right now, the cryolator is a 2 star with +50% limb damage.
---
...aren't there 308 receivers that actually do more damage than the 50?
---
As someone who played Fallout 2 when it was new(and fallout 1 shortly after), I couldn't be more.happy with Fallout 76. Its kinda the experience I always dreamed of for Fallout. 
---
Sure there are problems, but I'm confident they will be fixed with time, and I'm actually enjoying the process of seeing the game change and evolve.
---
There was a good decade after Fallout 2 came out where all us fans pretty much gave up on ever seeing a sequel(Fallout Tactics doesn't really count). Bethesda acquiring the IP and putting this much effort into it really was a miracle in my opinion.
---
I see. I should probably stay away from them for the moment, my games fucked as it is out of the box
---
And what will we be able to do with this scrip? If it's for buying new legendary I'm going to be really disappointed. Cause they are all going to suck. I really hope it's tokens for a random reroll of the legendary effects.
---
Yeah, unfortunately. Haven't heard of that issue before
---
sure there are no humans.. but give us Ghouls. ones of the non feral flavor. they could give a new batch of quests if you find them. they could come from one of the vaults
---
I would recommend here:

---
I see a bunch of two shots, haven't seen explosive in awhile. My big find is a level 35 TSE pipe rifle. I've tried everything to make it not suck, it just can't put out enough damage to make it useful.
---
yeah. Player vending!
---
If you're talking about the .50 cal hunting rifle, yes, there are two: hardened and prime. My bloodied rifle isn't a .50 cal, it's a level 50 rifle with the hardened .308 receiver. It's worth noting that the hardened only does like 2 more damage than the .50 cal and it's drastically easier to make .50 cal ammo.
---
Where did you find it? I've never seen one in my game.
---
Hopefully the framerate cap the other guy in this thread mentioned fixes it
---
...ok, clearly I need more coffee, I read that wrong the first time 'round.
---
What about the alien though?
---
Have my upvote.
---
The wasteland was so deadly that every last single person in W.V. died.  **EVERY LAST ONE.**  But here comes dude with a fist weapon waltzing through like the wasteland was a game of whack-a-commie.
---
I am not asking for a nerf to bloody nerd rage specifically, but it only takes one hit for me to kill a lvl 91 deathclaw **without** sneak.  I can kill a beohemoth  before he finishes his wake up animation.  Between dodgy and serendipity, I probably tank a dozen hits from these 'scary' mobs before worrying about a stimpack or AP refresh.
---
Yea I get why and how people have that much, the excess amount of caps really drives all the prices up. I hope they come up with a decent sink to help out with the inflation
---
All enemies have fixed max levels. Ranging from i think 20 or so to 95 depending on enemy type.
---
And I guess the instant one shot kills are just fine?
---
Happens to us all lol.

Ima just adventure and find random stuff and buy some, I ain't to r/choosingbeggars. Whens the update anyways?

That‚Äôs the only time I lost Census Violence:  the power station with the death claw and the ants, on my pistol character.  Was 2 then 2 then 2 again in close succession.  Was not a good day.
---
Sadly yes. Just like the Cranberry bog is no place for a level 5, the forest is not for level 200s.

Why not build near the Billings Homestead near the existing camp?   There are already tons of default crops nearby you can add to whatever you make in your camp.

Walk around.  I‚Äôve killed 3 flatwoods monsters today, so they‚Äôve upped the spawn rate.

They should have a mole rat costume you can make from a long quest line. It would grant you some stealth when sneaking and it would also double as sleeping attire!

You could completely eliminate PVP by enabling pacifist and not taking workshops. If you are level 30 and take a workshop, you accept all the risks associated with it.

They changed the behaviour a couple of patches back 'to bring it in line with the rest of the events' I guess...
---
It no longer triggers as it did - like clockwork every time you enter the school as long as ~~45~~ (oops, they 'rebalanced' those timers too, silly me...) 1h 15mins have passed since the last 'activation'.
---
Now it is the triggered by proximity and 'Dropped Connection' could trigger instead.
---
What ever I'm done arguing take you win or what ever it is you want.
---
Last night I found myself in an unexpected battle with a Lvl 71 Chameleon Deathclaw. I had it down to about 15-20% health when out of NOWHERE, two massive Yao Guai bears ran up and jumped the deathclaw. 
---
Poor DC had no chance and died in maybe 1-2 seconds max. 
---
His life was mine to take, and the bears took that from me. Vengeance was attained and now I have a dope picture with 2 dead bears and a deathclaw gathered in a nice pile.
---
[](/kcelestiapleased)Thankfully we'll have camp invulnerability here in a few days, and slap damage is already gone. Soon all they'll be able to do after you mute them is walk around you "menacingly", I guess.
---
There‚Äôs also a Tin foil hat in the frat house on a skeleton
---
These are the posts that make people dismiss this subreddit as nothing but circlejerking.
---
NG+ with the planned legendary character would be awesome.
---
I don't understand how this explains server hopping
---
Yeah I don't get why people are acting like those who have messaged turned off did so specifically to screw with others and not, you know, literally any other reason
---
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just standing there, MENACINGLY‚Äù
---
It does, up to 60%. Not huge, but if you‚Äôre playing damage as a game of inches...
---
170 here. Seen plenty of 2-shoit or explosive, but not together. They are super rare. Most you might see from others are past duplicates. I don't want to even guess what the chance of getting one, let alone on a decent weapon, would be but its probably equal to pulling 5 perfectly preserved pies in a row.
---
This would make the "CAMP cannot be placed" issues worse unfortunately.
---
Is there a way to get explosive ammo
---
If you log out and it‚Äôs not in your stash...it‚Äôs gone buddy.
---
It wasn't our idea, actually. it was a reddit post here like a month ago
---
Don't think it's going to happen. Maybe some tweaks like last time.
---
god i want one &gt;&lt;
---
This is hilarious.
---
No NPCs should in FO76. That‚Äôs the selling point of the game. Everything is going to be done by the players! Building settlements, establishing trade, creating content, all driven by the players! Except...we were given zero of the tools, random world selection, and no permanence. Fell real, real, short of the mark on that one. But, at least we can buy power armor skins for 20$. Perfect.
---
Pretty sure no. You don't have to add ammo, so I don't think there's a way to change it...yet...
---
Still an issue. Wtf, Bethesda?!
---
I learned something new!
---
Yeah. Beth really missed the boat on what daily and weekly challenges are supposed to be. Especially the level up ones. Choose a challenge and use it. Not have to level up 3 times, or try and fit them all into one ding.
---
It's just not feasible for most people
---
I assume that we go on to rebuild it. A pretty sure a large portion of vault dwellers would join the Enclave.
---
"I have a 4 storey house"
---
...
---
It's not even that it's just the fact that people always pick on the players under lvl 50 I mean I dont care when people come after me im high lvl fully capible it's just I hate it when they go after the new players who are still learning the game.
---
Its not a 100gb total The 50 GB update is replacing files. It‚Äôll probably have the same exact install size. Calm down
---
Flatwoods Monster and Alien aren't the same. If you check the World challenges for taking camera pictures Flatwoods Monster and Alien are seperate.
---
Ahhhhh I see. That explains a lot. So it sounds like I just need to server hop after claiming if I‚Äôm not planning on harvesting any of the stuff.
---
[](/celestiafrown)I dunno what to tell you man, some people suck.
---
But yet they give you 30 minutes for fertile soil and an hour for powering Poseidon. The ten minute timer is absolutely insane. Especially for an event where most people will not take pylons, theres a non stop flow of other enemies, and if you do manage yo get people to take pylons so the sheepsquatch is invulnerable, it lasts a few seconds before he cloaks again. 
---
Bethesda really really needs to add about 10 more minutes to this event time. Considering that it even costs caps to generate it to begin with.
---
True that. I'm always short on one of the masses.
---
I have the same thought.  Mole miners are simply humans that have been affected by the radiation.  My head canon is she was wounded, they took her in, suited her up, but being the badass she is, she still retains some of her humanity and is looking to help the players, not fully understanding who she used to be.
---
I do think her being part of Wastelander content is more likely.  Though if she is bringing in a bunch of outsiders to MY Appalachia, we‚Äôre going to have words...
---
Recent drop?
---
Yup, I‚Äôm on Xbox one
---
Hoping we're gonna get some of the items missing from FO4 added; junk, concrete and different metal wall sets, fences, more decor bits like the raider heads on spikes, planter beds and greenhouse building sets. 
---
Would like to see the robot workbench return too but not sure how they'd implement that. Could just have constructed robot camp guards at its simplest, or if some effort went into it we could have our own roving robot traders, supply caravans between camps etc.
---
When we‚Äôre dancing on the ceiling!
---
Plans and outfits will probably be the hot commodities. I'm stocking up on nuka and quantum grenades though. Hoping there will be a market for them.
---
Weird...  
---
I'm wondering if we did the tests in one of the middle, and quickly patched out cycles, the reason we did these tests is we found the OMOD's (Beam splitter and Flachettes) had the keyword "WeaponTypeShotgun [KYWD:00226454]" (why we thought the perk would work in the first place) and it's no longer on them

I want to play a game without downloading 50gb is that too much to ask?
---
I read an article how it's best not to do PVP unless you're above lvl 100.
---
imo, I see the separate PVP mode as a way of saying "GRIEFERS HERE"
---
There have been somewhat contradictory comments (though always vague).  On one hand, it seems the script will be to purchase legendaries, on the other hand, we've heard about re-rolling or customizing.  No one is quite sure which one it will be.  Maybe both?
---
My bet is on a randomized or a weekly set of items for purchase.  I'd rather have a single effect re-roll, but if that's the way it goes I wouldn't be surprised if it was a total re-roll.  Possibly the ability to add a start (up to #, probably 3), but that seems too minor.
---
Nice, thanks.
---
Hey man it is what it is. At least these updates make the game play better supposedly.
---
There's a large friendly community on PC using the chatmod addon.
---
I‚Äôm your huckleberry.
---
I'll be on shortly and be on for a few hours now. I'll be back on again later tonight after dinner and Game of Thrones.  I'll look for and accept your invite and watch for you. Come and find me when if you see me online. IGN: jchamlin

Buckle up

Rabies can take anywhere from 10 days to 7 years after exposure for it to start causing symptoms, and you can get the vaccine any time between exposure and syptoms and it will halt it and stop it from destroying your brain.
---
The scorched plague is fungal, not viral, but the same can apply.
---
If you weren‚Äôt on PS4 I‚Äôd sell you one.
---
Tell me about it...
---
I own one of the very first ps4 models made. 
---
I know it‚Äôs outdated and all that. But still has the same 500gb as the slim. (If memory is intact) 
---
I now ONLY have RDR2 and FO76 on my console beacuse it tells me to delete something every time a update comes out. 
---
I know I can just install again after the update. But this just seems ridiculous. 
---
This is a very serious problem as I do NOT want to delete rdr2 to make space for an update!
---
PLEASE WATCH BETHESDA
---
:(
---
Man I hope that's changed or there's at least some sorta terminal log giving us some lore on her, such as explaining why she's the only non-hostile MM and she's helping the 76ers.
---
Bring a lore guy the most interesting part of her inclusion to me was that she was a MM and we'd get to know more about them.
---
My friend I'm level 369, and hit 300 about 8 weeks in, have only seen (5) explosive weapons on this account, and zero TSE's..  
---
Some people are just luckier than others.  
---
That and I think there is a seeded RNG
---
thanks got the hat.. now i need to find a flatwoods monster.
---
Yes, let's keep the deathclaw being the strongest enemy in every single fallout game ever made until the end of time without ever adding anything new.
---
That will never get boring.
---
Yah.  It is pretty stupid how far Molerats will follow you.  They will keep up, somehow digging far below roads, through rivers, lakes, streams, and even climb extreme heights.  I have speed demon perk along with a jetpack and they still bite me.  I had Molerats follow me from Flatwoods to the parade event.  At least I had the help from marching robots to kill them off.
---
I hope so. I buy a lot of ammo.
---
Clean purifiers, clean generators, clean beds, hardwood floors, but no clean walls?! It really doesnt make sense...
---
I hate that stock HDD. Removed so many games to just update Seige. With the pretty slow net here the idea of replacing it isn't exactly ideal either.
---
I thought they allowed external storage these days, but never have looked into it. Can't imagine loading games over usb would be great anyways.
---
I had one to help me level recently, but I had the turrets recessed and blocked by walls to prevent them from gunning down things when I'm not there. I'd port home after some questing, remove the walls, and start drawing the buggers out with a few shots. I moved it when I tested it and realized that the friggen ghouls were still rushing the camp regardless of defenses when I was absent, so it'd screw people over anyhow by making it harder to gather/find them even if it's not shooting.
---
Personally, my rule is "If they're not home, it's coming down."
---
Probably a month ago. There were two 3* Legends outside. Been back several times and got jack shit.
---
All I did in FO4 was build settlements for hundreds of hours.....
---
Deathclaws in 3: Welp, this is going to eat up a dart. At least it won't be able to move and I'll just kill it easily.
---
Deathclaws in NV: Welp, this is going to eat up one round from my Anti-Material Rifle.
---
One of the dumbest updates. lowering the bar for people to play, we need a real world war to toughen people up again.
---
It doesn‚Äôt require a 50gb download, do some research on whats actually happening before you complain.
---
You might be, but not everyone is. Remember the outrage about armor kits? Pepperidge Farm remembers. The hate became particularly frothy, and usually when that happens, the opposite opinion gets its own flood shortly after.
---
Presentation is key. "I love you bethesda" is annoying, but so is "I hate you bethesda." Calling it a shit game is not useful for criticism, nor is decrying the opposing opinion as "circle jerking" when it is presented politely.
---
You post on disease rates a while ago is on point. It makes your opinion known, does not treat the problem as a personal affront, and does not pre-emptivly complain about people disagreeing. You post is a \*rarity\* on this sub.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt understand why no npc ghouls or super mutants like the fancy lady in fo76
---
I just don't like the lack of any dialogue choices and the fact that there are no human NPCs. The choices and being able to impact the world and directly interact with these big factions really made Fallout for me, (I started on 3 and New Vegas). And to my mind Fallout 76 has none of that no choices apart from character building, no way to impact the world at all because everything resets (powerplants, Scorchbeast Queen, imposter sheepsquatch, etc), and I don't really think the faction questlines (apart from Enclave and maybe raider) are that interesting because everyone is dead so you don't interact with anyone really. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the game but for vastly different reasons to all the past Fallouts.
---
Yeah, I know.
---
No it's ok... I am not mad just hopeful
---
I didn't understand the decision either - after an inordinate amount of time spent playing and modding Beth games the one thought that has not crossed my mind once is 'do you know what would add depth and entertainment to this game? PvP' - but after a rather lengthy - for reddit standards - discussion with a fellow player a couple of days ago I am satisfied with the reason he put forward: is a cheap way to add 'something to do' when people that do not know how to entertain themselves in a sandbox run out of content.
---
In the end of the day this game is a live service, you need to keep people engaged or 'recurrent player spending' goes out of the window.
---
Instead of the fermentor perk on the chemist‚Äôs bench why not have a bonus to explosives or healing items?
---
FM is the only Zetan in game AFAIK.  So you‚Äôll likely get both checked.
---
Well I dunno about you but even as a guy running a heavy build with about 15 guns on my person I still find Deathclaws terrifying and pretty hard to beat since I'm not running a OHK build
---
I thought the Enclave‚Äôs presence on the oil rig was there since the bombs, like the bunker would‚Äôve been?
---
[](/kcelestiajudge)I wonder how it will work with the 10% tax. Will people sell ammo in stacks, or will we have to price on a per round basis? If it's per round then you won't be able to go under 2 caps per bullet, and at that point it's just not going to be worth it.
---
Uh, no? There isn't?
---
And yeah, that's what sucked.
---
The only reason I die to a SB is because my VATS won't target them and they land that acid on me
---
Depends on how many you have tried. It's been 2 patches since I ground tdata, but paint plans have always been a rare drop, around 5%, not getting anything from submitting 20 data is not unusual, nothing from 100 would be, nothing from 200 would mean a change to loot table drop.
---
Yeah, I miss being able to walk right in and have it start up. I farmed so much xp back in the day. Memories... üòî
---
Maybe matchmaking the levels of players could fix this?
---
So that no lvl 12 could ever get in servers with lvl 312‚Äôs. 
---
This way, maybe, pvp would be more appreciated as you know your enemy isn‚Äôt much further from yourself.
---
So basically the red guys from Lonesome Road?
---
Keep it unplaced.
---
No it's easy. If nobody takes the pylons I'll take all three by my self. You just need 3 perks cards some food/chems and 10-20 stimpacks depending how long the fight goes on.
---
Juicehead gets shit on here as much as FO76 gets shit on on YT.  He's not that bad.  He's gone off the rails a couple times posting plain complaints about things (not that he was totally wrong), but mostly he just posts what's out there.  He's interesting enough to warrant a chance.
---
There have been a few other out there who *really* ONLY shit on FO76.  Like, blatantly bottom feeding.  Juicehead doesn't fall into that category at all.
---
As long as you dont move/place your camp, your camp will return when you go to a server that it can be placed on
---
I hope we can sell ammo and plans as well. Certain rare junk will be good to I think.
---
Fighting someone with those is a nuisance, but have you ever thried to fight while using them. Jumping 20 feet into the air and draining all your stamina makes dealing damage more difficult than someone who stand their and can just vats blast you with your evasion attempts being pointless.
---
The only legendary effect that should effect players is the assassins effect. It's all the other broken damage bonuses and defense effects that make people unkillable and let them instantly kill whoever they please.
---
Your camp will appear on next server. You won't have to place it manually.
---
What did he say in the video that was actually false?
---
Ya, wondering this as well.
---
The Swampfolk from Point Lookout would like a word with you.
---
IE is just a single, one-time +100%, so that's not really helpful against strong enemies that don't die one hit. BE has a much higher damage boost cap than FE, and FE is not very effecient on non-auto weapons.
---
BE isn't overrated whatsoever.
---
There are two flags internally, one for whether the weapons keeps firing when you hold down the button, and one for whether it uses Commando. The plasma flamer barrels add the first keyword but not the second, for example. The rate of fire doesn't matter.
---
See now this could be a viable option if implemented correctly.
---
Each pellet does not stack with the Furious effect, and Bloodied also has a much higher damage boost cap than Furious
---
Mule.  Leave vault, switch caps over, go back to playing on main.  Think of it as a mobile bank.
---
I definitely think the idea of powerful Scorched ‚Äòbosses‚Äô would make their impact so much better and make them seem far more threatening. Particularly if named characters we encounter in audio logs during quests turn out to be powerful Scorched later on; like, remember the Overseer‚Äôs boyfriend and how he became Scorched, and we had to kill him? That was GREAT. It really drove home what a threat the Scorched are and the emotional impact of seeing a loved one turn. We oughta have more questlines with that. Like, imagine how much more awesome and disheartening it would be if at the end of Glassed Cavern not ONLY do we fight a Scorchbeast, but a powerful Scorched Taggerdy and maybe a couple other Scorched BoS soldiers who went with her for Operation Touchdown.
---
Omg and no clean yellow couches!! I like how the yellow couch blends with the ugly walls but they are dirty too! With no clean variant. So no matter what you do, theres always something beat up and worn out. I'd also like to see clean safes. Would make my vending area of my house look way more official.
---
TSE gatling gun 5mm 3 star dropped for me last week. Rare legendarys have better chance to drop if you play over a large part of the map in different places.
---
My completionist blood is boiling. üòÜ  I'm on ps4. Sn Mantrayne.
---
You simply cannot say that without sharing the picture.
---
Well, yeah, you wanted one, but why didn't you just get a BE or FE or something?
---
doesn't count it seems
---
Billings is good.  There‚Äôs also a place south of sunnytop station that is relatively flat.  Not to mention if you like power line towers some of those are flat beneath, so you could have a 2-3 story place up in the tower with crops below.
---
One thing I don‚Äôt think the game gets enough credit on is how many nice places there are to pitch a camp.  I‚Äôve got 5 characters and I‚Äôm only rock solid on 2 of their camp locations.  I think I‚Äôll end up with north and south savage divide, mire, bog, and TV for their camps.  Ash heap is a nice place to visit but don‚Äôt want to live there!  Forest is just a lamer savage divide :)
---
I've taken multiples ones as well, then get targeted by the imposter and go down. No one even bothers to protect those who take pylons. You're lucky if you get servers where people participate because I rarely do.
---
Aaaah snap, I'm on Xbox üòì
---
there a good spot one may spawn at?
---
It might work, but \*only\* if you can also negate the insane amount of caps already out there. The people indirectly setting the market already have so many caps that they don't care about caps and are capable of buying all the upgrades. The problem is, because major traders don't value caps, caps have less value for the small tier traders, who then pass that down to personal buyers.
---
Personally, I love it, but it won't fix the economy by itself.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 so feel free to use it lol just watch out for the Incredible Grahm
---
They probably will someday though. At the cost of atoms of course. Maybe some vault doors too. Make it look super pristine. ‚ò∫
---
Ahh, so you too mate.
---
Feel u man...
---
I don‚Äôt know much about these things. 
---
But why is it in general that the updates require WAY more space than the update really is?
---
I know that in FO4 there was a mod that made the game pixel use the storage of an actual pixel. 
---
Pixels were apparently using 4x the storage of what it should. 
---
This was why the center-area was always lucky AF
---
I have it for the PS3 and my youngest munchkin grabbed the cord and it plummeted to its death. I had hundreds of hours into that game. RIP. üò≠
---
Hit two at Freddie‚Äôs.  I was going to go back there and try it.
---
Yes please.
---
I'm saying that duplicates of the same exact item in everyone's inventories were removed to just have one copy. I'm not saying that literally every single dupe was removed.
---
You don't need the right build for BE. Any HP below 75% is better than TSE. FE also only works well on non-auto weapons, but it's still better than TSE. TS VATS is also useless and TS breaks easier.
---
I've just experienced this bug myself, and I was about to record it and post it to Bethesda Forums.  I wanted to "clean up" the screen a little so I hid all quests except "The Missing Link" and "Flavors of Mayhem", and I spoke to her.  It just suddenly worked!  I now have "Key to the Past".
---
Eventually Biv will hopefully give them all. I still need 3, and haven't gotten a new recipe in weeks, though, even though I still do Biv EVERY. STUPID. DAY. :(
---
Bridge looks new. Obviously modded.
---
Also pretty much f****d up that conversation. Sry I‚Äôm new to reddit XD
---
Or, you know, max out stealth and take them all out without taking any damage.
---
They've added up to 3 with an update. Can't add an overwhelming amount at once, remember server stability and new players starting being overwhelmed.
---

We all need more screws :/
---
Nah, the f76 crowd seems to be more mature people than 16yolds
---
I dont pvp at all , but i think its cool it excists üëç
---
Not sure what others have told you but it won‚Äôt count, it‚Äôs a broken challenge. The Flatwoods Monster lacks the ‚ÄúAlien‚Äù prefix in the files
---
Yes still happening to me. Super annoying because I wanted to get a plan for a couch there.
---
Dismissing it as "whatever, you win" does nothing to change that you were factually wrong. Pretending it was simply a difference opinion is rather insane.
---
Just jump up on the roof of that cabin. He can't get you there. I can  even take him by myself, learned from YouTube lol.
---
I don't think adding 10 minutes is going to help much. If your team plays to a plan then the imposter goes down within a couple of minutes. If it doesn't then you're just burning stimpaks.
---
What would really help is having more prep time, so that people can figure who's taking the pylons and switch their builds and hotkeys around. You get far more prep time for the SBQ, which needs less.
---
Fun fact the black powder rifle/dragon have a very fast fire rate when theres multipule rounds in the magazine
---
[](/kcelestiacute)You know the radiant quests in skyrim? Go to this dungeon, and get the thing out of the chest at the end; rinse and repeat? I would be so happy with one of those.
---
My bro has a patchwork set.
---
IF Implemented correctly, exactly! XD
---
They only spawned during the event unfortunately.
---
I always find a bunch of small critters running around Flatwoods though.
---
Now if I can just find one...
---
Got my first legit TSE last week. A level 15 pump action shotgun.
---
So does x-01.
---
Someday yeah I hope. I know new stuff takes time to program and they are always making something new so we will see.
---
Thats what i thought but someone else said it does work now
---
Knowing Bethesda they would probably scrap to steel.
---
Do you have 4 'base' CHR or 2 if those are acquired through 'Herd Mentality'?
---
Yeah, I found that out the hard way.
---
I don't really get the "cheap to repair" comments, since I use PA practically all the time cause I'm lazy, and I really love my jetpack, and repair like a few times a week. 
---
Ascetically of course any option is valid. Do whatever you prefer. But not wearing a certain armor cause it takes a couple screws a week? Dang guys lol
---
Granted I'm ranged, so I guess if you're melee you'd have to repair more often, but even then I'm right in the thick of things because my best gun is a Vampire Shotty, so I have to be snugged up with whatever I'm shooting.
---
House of scares, or fred's bbq?
---
Because back then the prices where not completely coocoo
---
Pretty sure its better to get 2-3 quests every two weeks, than wait months for your ‚Äú20-50‚Äù lmao
---
4 base

House of scares

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ba3oyb/technical_data_hunting_some_tips_and_data/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share  
---
 its been a couple of patches since I did this, but I have not seen any changes, have fun!
---
To be honest, prior to making a reddit account i would just sell stuff i didn't want to vendor. That includes a few 2 maybe even 3 star items. I didn't care for them and i didn't want to just drop them. Someone elses trash, could be your treasure.
---
If you even give the option to go back to the last server, that means the server has to hold a spot for you (there are player limits after all).  
---
So any time anyone leaves a game, a spot must be held (unless the server can detect crashes and lockups vs. normal logouts (easy), time outs (probably fairly easy), alt-F4 or other manual kills (probably hard), and non-local and non-server stoppages (probably very hard).  If a server has to hold a spot open for...how long, 30 second, 1 minute, 3 minutes?  That's effectively increasing the need for server space by a fairly decent percentage.  And that costs $$.  How much is hard to say, but figure if there is one logout/crash per server per minute, that's anything up to about a 10% increase in server capacity.
---
Not sure what that amounts to in actual costs, but it's non-trivial.
---
the tin foil hat is my bigger issue
---
Haven‚Äôt seen intestines drop since the event. Of course I‚Äôm not out looking for them either but When I see a smaller critter I always take them out just in case.
---
It's probably just a glitch, and will disappear eventually.
---
Yeah I've never heard of a "normal" alien in 76. Will have to see.
---
Great idea bro
---
Is one of the games with the most constant content delivery right now tbh
---
&gt;Didn't even mention half the positive things about the game
---
Like...? 
---
&gt;Took context out of a lot of stories. (cheater ones for example)  
---
What context did he miss? 
---
&gt;Undervalued the enormous bug fixes and stabilty improvements to the game.   
---
He mentioned the patches and what they did.
---
&gt;Takes the zero score metacritic reviews seriously.
---
When a game has tons of 0 score reviews why should that be ignored?
---
The rest isn't even worth replying too.
---
to be fair, he did take a workshop, and I understand the whole "pick on someone your own size" sentiment, but that's how it's been set up.
---
I think Beth could make it better by allowing us, as others have mentioned, to have the option to surrender a workshop if challenged..that way low levels can move aside without the grief.
---
Every single duplicate of anything was removed from everyone's inventories until only one copy remained. That's what I'm saying.
---
Also, the dupes aren't used very much because they're mostly TSEs. Yes, every method of duping is patched.
---
Not really. It's good to hold onto, though, because often a weekly'daily challenge will want you to wear it for something.
---
I have to agree. Twice this past week I logged on and just parkoured around the map for a few minutes and logged off out of shear boredom. I'm maxed in caps, completed all my quests, perks are right where they need to be and I have endgame gear. It's senseless wasting bullets to farm for things I don't need. The Borrowers dungeon was a complete bust. They really need to consider introducing some challenging dungeons or new difficult quests.
---
He's called *Internet **historian.***
---
Someone helped with the yesterday ones.. I'll be back online in a few hrs if ya want to do todays
---
I found mine in the sorority house

Well the free range event is kinda like that

Every time I hit max caps I buy shotgun shells from the subreddit lol.
---
kinda similar to what we have with events, but more events and more variety in them would be nice.
---
Anything short of an Anti-mat rifle or brush gun and your were toast
---
What's a toon?
---
The queen only appears when fissure site prime is nuked.
---
They die fast if you don't get hit by them. Getting hit by a Deathclaw isn't as unpleasant as getting hit (and get stunned) by a Yao Guai.
---
First time up the tanagra town tree they killed me a couple times.
---
"Yes, every method of duping is patched" No they are not, im aware of one which i talked about in one other post earlier this month that is not patched and which i will not reveal or use bacause i hate what duper scum did to the economy.
---
I understand the workshop part but he also proceeded to follow him back to his camp and destroy it. Which is where I decided to step in which I got over 800 caps from the guy lmao!!!
---
It's actually pretty easy to see.
---
If you have a new install of 50gb, the update doesn't delete your game, and then install the new update.  It has to download the update, then replace the files on your device before removing the update files.  Both have to be present at the same time to do the update.
---
It *could* be structured to download in chunks, and replace one bit at a time, but that's actually not nearly as easy as it seems.  And it's terribly inefficient (multiple CRC checks for instance), and opens up the update to lots of places where things can go wrong if there's a glitch or an interruption.  And unless the game files are split up into small chunks (again, not at all efficient), you're still stuck with at least one or more very large pieces that have to get replaced in one go, so you may be able to bring that 100gb down to 80 or 90gb, but that is still a problem sometimes.
---
Nope but a machine to scrap legendaries for the currency the use is
---
Take a break. From the game and the media surrounding it. The first time I tried I couldn't resist picking it up again as soon as I saw some new feature on the sub. Then 4 hours later I was going through the motions again and bored through my mind. A couple weeks after that I sat it down again and stopped going on here (this was like a month ago so I popped in real quick to check and saw this) and I'm hoping whenever I do get back into there will be some good mechanical improvements to the grind/loot cycle.
---
I don‚Äôt bother with the SBQ. the last 3 times I tried it got down to 50% then bugged.
---
Yes.
---
How come they believed to empty the world of human character was a good idea ? Holotapes are a cold thing...
---
Bethesda's loot system is simply awfull. The legendary seller is a failure, he doesn't sell mods...
---
I am quiting, it is happening. Meh !
---
No. Legendary Scrips are coming in the May 7th Update. The Legendary Vendor will be in the following Patch
---
Every time that change a file the entire file has to be reinstalled
---
People call it TSE because it has Two Shot and Explosive legendary effects. BE is Bloodied Explosive, better than TSE. There are many others that are better as well.
---
Ah, okay.
---
I mean, while it makes sense for them to be account wide, I think there is nearly zero chance they will be. 
---
You can always pass the legendaries back to whatever character you need the scrip on before scrapping (?, scripting?) Them. 
---
Not really any harder to transfer scrip than it is to transfer the legendaries. (Okay, yeah, less convenient)
---
Yeah, because they're not duped like TSEs were.
---
No. The vendor is set for the 23. 
---
I think this update is for player vending and the vending of legendaries for scrips. 
---
Scrips are currency for the upcoming legendary vendor.
---
Too true
---
Is it a one and done scenario? Or if Fissure Prime is nuked, can the event to kill the SBQ trigger more than once? Like if someone had already nuked FP, killed the SBQ, then I join the server and Fissure Prime is still a blast zone, is there a chance the event to kill the SBQ will trigger again on that same server?
---
What platform are you on? If you're on PC, [ACME](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/253) has *fantastic* texture replacements for the plaster walls. I cannot recommend it (or any of Rigell's other work) highly enough.
---
Alright , thanks you !
---
Found one, once. Didn't drop any loot.
---
In NV there was that area in the bottom right of the map with a bunch of deathclaws. Spent all my ammo on the high walls shooting down at them.
---
They were a real threat early on in 76, but now they just take a couple swings to kill.
---
Then why don't you reveal it to the devs? Even if there *is* a method, it's definitely not affecting anyone much because it hasn't been patched or widely noticed.
---
Telling heavy gunners to not claim works shops is like telling everyone else dont craft ammo. (Fusion cores) and dont tell me you have plenty, I can go through 7-10 on sbq fight alone.
---
yes, that part was a dick move and uncalled for and I'm glad you dusted him.
---
I have a bloodied melee build and I only use 3 points for the 2h damage boost cards. I spend more points for damage prevention
---
Ps4 sadly. Would love texture replacements in fo76. I have so many ideas..
---
Sorry was implying it is broken also.
---
i dont have time to explain this stuff to randos so
---
If like to update again, that has helped a bit as well. At this point it's good enough for me to give a shot. Got back into it and it's rather enjoyable. The HUD is a little confusing if you have more than one quest, and right now my carry capacity is laughable but that's something I can figure out. Thanks pal!
---
The Freak Show has them sometimes, when there's not two mirelurk queens there.
---
Unfortunately yes, that's why the game is so easy
---
Want to send me your GT im semi reliable
---
I completely agree with you. There are very few enemies that pose a threat past level 50.
---
They left it open ended so that future content could involve her again. A frustrating "ending" for the time, because I didn't think it was the last available, but apparently it is.
---
Glowing meat steaks from super duper and looting perks alone can get 500c pretty easily from lucky hole and blackwater.  There‚Äôs a few loops out there that can get you vendor maxed pretty fast. 
---
Make sure you‚Äôre using grape mentats when buying plans, and you switch out your perks.
---
I've been thinking about this for a little while and I came up with a few.
---
You know how the normal human scorched are still, frozen in a pose but come active when players come near. Something like that except reskined as the petrified version. Maybe even not show up as an enemy until it becomes active, to keep it as a surprise. The overall idea of this enemy is that it's incredibly durable and but slow, but summons scorched (preferably not just human scorched) to it until it dies. Possibly to a mini version of the scorched beast area attack.
---
Another idea was packs of scorched in the wilds, but these wouldn't just be human variety, instead it would have mostly wasteland creatures like radstags, gulpers, deathclaws, etc... I like the idea of 4-6 smaller scorched enemies and one bigger that maybe the boss, like a scorched megasloth, deathclaw, yug guai, etc... so when you stumble across a deserted building like a watchtower in the wilds, you might find a pack of scorched creatures, instead of a pack of human scorched.
---
Er, customer rather than beggar right? It's not free.
---
I think the 3,784 rage posts when repair kits were announced may skew those results a little...
---
Okay but there's a few issues with transferring legendaries;
---
1. You either need an alt account
---
   1. You need a very good gaming pc to run two instances at one time, I can barely run two instances without my computer having a stroke
---
2. or you need a trustworthy friend with a lot of patience
---
Not to mention it still sucks that if it's not account wide then that basically means using it would be a bitch to deal with. Imagine having to go and calculate how much scrip you have on one character, moving your legendaries to said character, grinding those down, only to realize you're like ever so slightly short and your other character had just enough to top it off?
---
Had a level 10 camping there yesterday with turrets, and he was halfway across the map. I racked up a 900 cap bounty on that one.
---
V-Sync **Fast** has made so much difference, the stuttering and lag has gone, still testing different areas but this seems to me the magic bullet to the lack of performance on my old gtx 750ti, that and turning off grass in custom ini, thanks again !!
---
Iam no long reddit user. I only use it for Gamenews and Fallout trading. what is that? :)
---
Who said i havent reported it? And you think that if i found a way by accident im the only one who has bumbed into it? You are just a silly silly person with your stupid claims about stuff you clearly don't know anything about.
---
I been saying this since the game came out. Fallout coulda greatly benefited from the borderlands experience. Coop FPS in the fallout world. That‚Äôs what I expected when they said ‚Äúmultiplayer fallout‚Äù not this hot garbage lol.
---
I guess a mixture of dissatisfaction, disappointment, self-delusion and lack of foresight.
---
Fallout 5 is a long long way away into the future and somehow a sector of the player community talked themselves into believing that this was going to be in fact 'it'.
---
However when confronted with the reality of the game: a live service, created on a modest budget by reusing assets and mechanics wherever possible by a studio with little experience - but making up for it with enthusiasm and the wish to prove themselves I guess? - riding on the wave of popularity of the franchise and the ubiquity of live services as a proven method to make a quick buck for the shareholders that don't give a monkeys ass about anything other than those sweet sweet numbers rolling in their Dutch bank accounts - they just could not take it in and 'flipped the lid' so to speak.
---
You had me at ‚Äú400 stash weight‚Äù
---
Damn, talk about being an asshole for no reason.
---
I haven't heard *anyone* complain of any duping methods, so I really don't see how my claims come off as stupid.
---
Such as one of today's dailies, take a picture of an Alien while wearing a Tin Foil Hat. I have that hat, and I would love to complete the challenge, if anything counted as a fucking Alien.
---
Do you know a good place to find the Flatwoods monster?
---
This level 91 glowing diseased deathclaw I fought was way more terrifying than a SBQ or any other creatures I've killed sans high level mire lurk Queen's
---
This is why I haven't started the BoS quest line on my other character. I've got so many I really hole they address this.
---
Plans, desured ammo, and legendary gear. Recently got back into Fallout 76 hard, and i need better gear for my main character. 
---
Im gonna be selling meds and chems mostly.
---
This would have to be managed. If outside the workshop area, can you re-enter? If so, could someone just step outside the area, heal and re-enter combat? If you'd like a limited radius outside the workshop, what should that be?  
---
And all of that is without taking into account programming concerns that I don't personally understand.
---
ConGRATulations!
---
Yeah, that's generally true for bloodied builds. Everything except the queen drops fast, so you're better off spending perks on survivability and even utility. Blocker is great for melee, Serendipity for non-PA. Fireproof prevents a lot of dumb deaths and protects you from SBs.
---
And?
---
Sure, as long as "surrendering" it drops your junk bag and makes it impossible for you to retrieve it -- the thing you'll be dropping the workshop to avoid losing. The option to surrender a workshop (assuming it dropped PVP flag) would give people an easy out if they are losing a fight and don't want to lose their stuff.
---
I happens everytime fisure prime is nuked. It's not based off a new player entering area. You want her to show up again, you nuke site again. You  can definitely do it back to back.
---
I would assume you can with anything above 10 Caps or else you‚Äôre going to lose a whole cap to a script that won‚Äôt let you have any caps at a decimal point
---
A slippery slope to what?  
---
I don't really see the issue, the game was never designed with the idea of people having mules to hold extra items and caps. Yes, its true they allow you to have multiple characters but i feel the idea for that was just that, to allow you to have extra characters. The idea that it should be easier and more convenient for people to use mules to circumvent the limits they have placed on the game just seems wrong to me. The reason we need new cap sinks and 10% fees on vendors is because cheats and people using mules have destroyed the value of the cap for the normal player. I've seem many posts about items being traded for 50,000 caps or more! this shouldn't be the norm, the cap limit is 25k, nothing should cost more than that.  Anything they can do to bring those prices down and keep the game more balanced for the casual player the better.
---
I think that if someone tried to take a workshop the owner should have the option to surrender it if they engag in pvp they are in pvp till killed
---
Oh I thought that you believed the Overseer to be Penny.
---
Theres only like 5 currently available
---
Anything and everything really. Looking forward to it. But like someone else said, food would be good. If there was street food I wouldn't cook my own. A cafe at Watoga and Whitespring would be a social bonus beyond the scope of player vending.
---
I don't think I've gathered that many nodes on adventure since release.
---
Firstly, i know everyone has the right to play the game as they like and i respect that (within the rules made by bethesda) but these sort of levitating camps just f\*\*\*\*\*g make me furious when i encounter them in game. And i destroy them on sight.
---
Dont suppose you know if we getting indestructible homes to, dont really fancy having my home location displayed on the map for griefers to come and blow it up....againüò≠üò≠
---
It's probably coming. When the mayor dlc are done and the atomic shop have done its purpose and it's released for steam. Maybe will even get private servers.
---
...why? Camps like these are super cool!
---
What I‚Äôm wondering is whether there will be a daily limit on the amount of scrip available from the scrapping machines, I suspect there will be a limit and that it will take a few days to scrap the legendary stockpiles we‚Äôve all been hoarding ü§î
---

---
Never make the mistake of challenging the Deathclaw Quarry at the start of the game.
---
Painful memories of me doing that just to see how long I would last.
---
Seriously? A family having fun together is circle jerking? You must watch the extra weird porn.
---
Nice snap! Looks great
---
I love the axe so much (mine is a suppressor), I just wish it hit harder than my All Rise. Still searching for something stronger...
---
Those are amazing! Really
---
Oh yeah The queen is scary as hell to for a non power armor build
---
I don't disagree with you. As-is, this build is ideal for discouraging PvE (enemies spend a lot of time shooting at the floor that they cannot damage) given how inadequate defenses still are against high-level mobs.  
---
My friend that lives a hundred meters over in a nearby cave has a mob spawn \*every\* time he goes to C.A.M.P., and I had a similar experience on a rock plateau at map-edge in the southwest.
---
Yeah. I don't think so either. We've seen 2 expansions of inventory space but when it came to camps they didn't expand it, they just separated lights/turrets budget from the rest. If they could've done it they would've done it then.
---
Oh nice
---
Somewhere I read that this wouldn't apply if turrets are on the camp? So it wouldn't change anything I guess? Not sure where I saw that though...
---
Actually, it's no human NPCs. There are lots of npcs. My favorite is Rose. Hell, every enemy you encounter is an NPC. Those holotapes? Every character you encounter through them is an NPC. The holotapes are the dialogue. NPC simply means "non-player character" and it's insanely broad.   
---
Anyway, the lack of human NPCs makes sense canonically. Automation overtook WV. Most people left. Those who were left behind didn't have the numbers or the ability to deal with the threats that they faced. You'd know this is you paid attention to the story you think is somehow missing because the pixels on your screen don't look like humans.
---
Guess I'm lucky, lvl 165, no idea of my hours.
---
First to drop was a TSE lever rifle.
---
Then a TSE pump action shotgun, and a day later a lvl 25 like it that went to a friend.
---
I then ran into a guy who traded me a TSE Gatling Laser for 500c, as they were pretty much useless back then.
---
Load up Fallout 4 and set the difficulty to max. See how that first deathclaw hides stalking you waiting for an opening even following you back to the settlement. It needs world boss status.
---
One thing to keep in mind. Silos have a cooldown period. So would only be able to launch 3 nukes (3 silos) on that world. Then you'd either have to wait for cooldown to end or server hop and repeat cycle. If not mistaken, cooldown is something like 3hrs, but server hopping to a fresh world would bypass that.
---
And yet we make a gauntlet out of their claws and it's a fearsome weapon. So much so there is an anti armor version. Bone and claw destroys armor apparently. Maybe if the deathclaws wore a gauntlet of their own claw?
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151
---
It is just my personal view of them. You can think they are cool, and its fine by me.
---
151, never looted one either.  So yeah, the duping issue was a major problem.
---
Me and my friend killed at Deathclaw at lvl 15, now they're just another food source.
---
"The first time I tried I couldn't resist picking it up again as soon as I saw some new feature on the sub. Then 4 hours later I was going through the motions again and bored through my mind."
---
This exactly, ive been trying to hold off picking up my controller
---
Are they ever 2-3 *? Every time I‚Äôve done it it‚Äôs only 1star
---
[](/celestiahurt)If only events sent you to more locations, I'm sick and tired of the teapot, the little uranium extractors, and the many hilltops and countrysides that the hordes patrol.  
---
We need an excuse to go places again, to reuse some of the cool content we never really appreciated with the first time. Places like the burning mine, the unmarked bandit camps, the buildings in Watoga, the top of the world Mezzanine level. Y'know anywhere they put those end of dungeon steamer chests.
---
I just don't understand why you'd be a dick and destroy camps like these "on site"? You know you can ignore them and keep going about your business, right?
---
"Facts" LOL
---
Facts are the workshop/"PvP" design in adventure mode are inherently flawed. If one person is following me around the map while another is contesting a workshop I own and never taking it just to kill me, then that is the definition of griefing. 
---
If it's done once, sure. Maybe even twice. Any more than that is plain old griefing. It's simply bad design. It would be no different than you attacking someone, then becoming wanted. If someone kills you to claim the bounty, you'd be OK with that right? Now what would you do if you respawned and were still wanted? Are you still OK with people being able to know exactly where you are on the map and can kill you whenever they feel like it? 
---
You're silly to think contesting and not taking over a workshop to get dumb kills is normal. A user's option should not be having to leave the world because of a bad game design with regards to workshops.
---
I understand this is an old post, but I was searching for something myself, and stumbled upon this..
---
Just my 2 cents of contribution:
---
If you are planning on trying it on PC, please keep in mind that even with the best possible setup it will still have performance issues **IF you will set everything on Ultra settings**.
---
The main culprit here is the drawing distances of absolutely everything in the game (monsters, items, trees, grass etc), so you will be better off with selecting "medium" settings and then adjusting the quality of textures, lightning etc to High manually - main idea is to have the "Fade" settings at their minimum.
---
Cheers!
---
honestly I'm not sure of the mechanism of workshop challenges..if you are a challenger do you just slide into the area and start shooting, or do you have to formerly contest the workshop?
---
also, I'm ok with someone just backing out of a fight without losing their junk (but losing the workshop)..this IS adventure mode, so I wouldn't sweat that..
---
someone suggested freddy's house of scars, but ive yet to find one around it
---
Yes it is. Go look up the numbers bloodied doesn't have top dps.
---
I've set mine up just down the cliff side from the Palace of the Winding Path. Had to do some precarious leaps down from the top to get to a large ledge that can't be access except from above. Perfect spot - never been attacked by anyone or anything! Great view down onto the Toxic Valley as well.
---
I don't really think so. You're still going to want specific things, and have stuff to sell. It'll just be easier to make for people to visit your CAMP to make sales.
---
Cool!
---
I got from around lv 50 to 100 in like 4 days of farming that event... I really miss being able to trigger it at will üò™
---
I believe so. At least, that's the generally accepted  view. I'd like to see Pacifist Camps in this coming update.
---
I'm well aware lol. I've been waiting for them to get fixed for like 6 patches so I can decide properly. My main is a medic build.
---
What like jet pack &amp; that kind of thing? Pretty sure they don't get removed when applying paint.
---
Is it easier to launch a nuke after you've completed the main quest? Or do you have to do all that awful garbage all over again?
---
Yes there is, just like how the old spam disarm on a trap bug came back so did an old dupe.
---
Darn!
---
Free speech isn't a free ticket to cause harm to others. People are free to react how they will. it's the government that cane lock you up for it. That's literally it.
---
Unless you control the space your speech is heard, you're subject to any one person in control's rules. As long as they aren't the federal government.
---
Yes because everyone wants to run the exact same cookie cutter bloodied build
---
It *literally* does. Bloodied caps out at +99% dmg at 1% HP (+1% dmg per 1% HP lost).
---
Furioues and Junkie's cap out at around +50%, those are the second highest.
---
Yeah all enemies are very easy to deal with, they should make higher level versions of enemies that would actually be a threat.
---
Imagine a Scorched lvl 120 compared to the lvl 68 which requires one bullet to kill
---
Even a Lvl 95 Behemoth melts pretty quickly
---
I wish there was a way to actually know how many players there are. 
---
For that matter, it says there's 183K in this subreddit, and 2.5K in Appalachia. What does that even mean?
---
seems im having no luck, jumped to a few servers
---
Oh no I agree with you there, I hate the idea of something going way out of the value normally possible for the game, I hate it more when people straight up sell things for real life money. However as much as it's not designed for mules, the fact that it can't even be traded is something I find sorta depressing, the game is by no means bad just it's always some major flaw with everything they add, it's never the way they themselves hype it up to be, everyone wants to blame the players but it's THEIR fault for not giving us information beforehand. I get it, people would end up paying lots of caps and other stuff for it, but at the same time it just seems counteractive to block people from trading it around. The ingame economy was fucked from the beginning tbh, I do hope it gets fixed eventually, even a little.
---
And thank you.  I‚Äôve had so much fun farming this stuff because of your guide.
---
Yeah me too and that kept me hooked on the game for a long time
---
that warning that it will destroy your mods doesnt mean that, it means it will destroy your old paint job it is just worded oddly
---
To be fair, Radscorpions were very common I Fallout 1 and 2 because both Games took place on the west coast which had turned into a massive desert after the bombs. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon to fight tens at a time, but I found them easier to deal with in Fallout 1 and 2 than they are to deal with in 76.
---
Fixed?
---
I don't view it as bad design. When I own a workshop, I am constantly on my guard. I don't visit my CAMP (to avoid people destroying it). I listen for people who are coming for me. I can get the jump on them better than they can me in most cases. There's nothing flawed with a player being able to attack you if you own a workshop.
---
Not everyone who attacks a workshop wants the workshop. I farm junk by killing players at them. Actually owning and maintaining the workshop is too much of an inconvenience. They can keep that. I just want their plastic.
---
Maybe she'll be an NPC when all the regs show up this fall (prediction).
---
I understand that but what harm is there talking about a repair kit in an atom shop?
---
I had a camp like that too some time ago. It was always under attack. There are clearly spawn points around the map that have lots of activity around them. My current camp (which i made/moved because of constant attacks) havent had a single attack in 2 weeks now. As far as i know, maybe the turret buffs worked.
---
I haven't heard *anyone* talk about it.
---
Still not as bad as that mole rat with the mines strapped to him in FO4.
---
AA explosive out dpses bloodied and you don't need to bd low life.
---
Me to i so want it. hate fast travelling back to my crib not knowing if its still there or in bits and pieces lol
---
Wait what there‚Äôs still people that play this? Anthem is a better game yet that community has been damn near abandoned
---
No
---
Very true... The first Fallout game I ever played was NV and I remember after dying multiple times trying to take on the deathclaws in Quarry Junciton, I finally found a Fatman and thought a few mini nukes would teach them a lesson.  Those things brushed off that nuclear energy like it was a dust storm.  Learned a very valuable lesson then that I still carry with me, Fatman weapons and Mini-Nukes are useless
---
Haha this game is trash
---
It's just the silo run, if that's what you mean. Takes about ten minutes once you're used to it.
---
I would like it smaller, sorry but we have a group that has put our camps as close as we can and it is at around 90 away from each other is as close as we can and if someone builds down the hill we cannot place our camps. I would love to have neighborhoods built by the community but as it is it's no doable.
---
I'm planning to add plans, recipes, outfits, some healing (I tend to make way more disease cures than I need so I've been saving them), probably also some legendary items if I think someone else might find them useful.
---
No shit, nobody is just going to give out a dupe and get it patched.
---
No, it doesn't. AA provides a flat dmg boost of around +19%.
---
They broke like crazy and it took a week for my team of 4 to save enough fuel for a queen fight. They would literally break after 200 fuel. I could break one in under a minute with no visual effects on the queen, almost zero friendly fire healing, etc. They needed a thorough overhaul. As of Tuesday, that process will be complete.
---
I mean I haven't referred to anyone even if referencing/complaining that there is one, smartass.
---
Youre right, im probably gonna take a break atleast for a week
---
Oh OK, so all that cargobot dipshittery isn't required?
---
You actively contest it and it flags both of you for PVP with each other at the same time, meaning that if you're on guard you can easily handle an assault. This is especially true now that turrets can wreck someone. If you're good with turret placement, attacks are barely an issue at your workshop. If someone catches you away, then you can easily see them coming -- they'll probably have to run to catch up to you so you see a red dot making a beeline for you.
---
As for being able to get out of losing junk, no one made you take a workshop. No one forced you to accept the risk. You shouldn't be able to have the benefits of ownership and then immediately abdicate them when you face the challenges associated with them.
---
My advice is let them rot with their goods. If they cant sell them for that money price will drop.
---
Rofl, you must not have read the post a few mknths back when someone tested all the combos and the antiarmor explosive outclassed bloodied and didn't need to be low health.
---
That's because energy heavy weapons used to break very easily, and TS intentionally breaks faster than others.
---
Probably the only really scary part of the game, and damn does it pair well with the rest of the game. Really made me think about Deathclaws as more intelligent and developed characters instead of big hulking angry brutes.
---
You need a keycard every time you launch. Either off the cargobot, or sometimes people sell them for around 100 caps each
---
What? That sentence makes no sense.
---
What would you do with 200k caps. Takes 8 characters to carry it all.
---
Well that's good to finally have an explanation for üôÑ any other pro tips for me?
---
That's a lot of cores. What kind of build do you use against the SBQ?
---
Sadly it is for a single player.  I typically rent from redox and barring some collection stuff it's extremely rare not to do all scripted quests and such in 10-20 hours.  More then that and your off to MP.
---
Personally i have yet to launch one. I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd say it gets easier. I see lots of posts buying nuclear keycards to nuke queen. Meaning they no longer have to bother shooting down the vertibot for it as part of quest. With that said, can probably bypass a few other steps maybe? I've heard people launching nukes in 20min. But that could just be because they've gotten so good at completing all the steps quicker.
---
Those are evil üòà
---
The Sheepsquatch is a decent enough threat but not enough to keep me playing. Maybe throw level 120 mobs in the Borrowers map and include side challenges like the silos.
---
Sorry, don't need a warm towel. The AC is running.
---
48, was 46 at the time, have a non-legendary combat shotgun ~100dmg and it took AGES!
---
Flatwoods monster now counts‚Äîthey made this change. Been reading about it in other posts.
---
Mole Miners have pet molerats that have mines strapped to them in Fallout 76.  They make the same beeping noise that Super Mutant Suiciders make.
---
I've got one I'm saving for player vending that I intend to sell as a premium novelty item.
---
I don't really care what you view it as. The large consensus in this subreddit has been that the ability to simply contest a workshop should not allow for the initiation of PvP. It allows for one user to follow you around while another can just contest the workshop and keep killing you. These are the same people who will have their friend fast travel to the owned workshops towards the end of SBQ event (good luck "having the jump" on them), contest it, then kill you and take your flux as a reward.
---
This is exactly why they changed how you become wanted now (have to do a certain amount of damage). It's why accidental shots don't make you wanted. It was bad design and they have addressed that. They will likely do the same with workshops in due time.
---
Also, you want their plastic but plastic is the only mat that can't be obtained from a workshop. Makes complete sense.
---
You "PvP" this way because you can't manage in Survival. It's pretty damn obvious.
---
Correct but I was giving a reason why anyone would want to wear the T51.
---
Welcome to the Fallout 76 subreddit, where at least 5 of these threads are posted every day. Sometimes every hour.
---
It will place normally if it can then next time you log onto a server. We get this all the time and sometimes I choose to stay on the server because maybe i am off to do something elsewhere on the map and dont need my camp or just curious as to who is in my spot. All is ok the next time in get placed on a server though.
---
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I knew there was a high chance I was being an idiot on this one (hence the post). Thank you so much for the heads up!
---
I like the fallout universe and i like building my base and climbing the loot ladder to stronger and better guns
---
I haven't met them yet--only level 32.
---
welcome to the club
---
I finally hit the 25k limit but only because I can't find anything to buy. I am even buying pipe plans at lvl 142 just to spend some caps.
---
Forget destroying their camp. I spent 5 minutes one day shutting the double door at the back. This guy in PA would run over and reopen it. This went on until he gave up and faded away.
---
&gt;Like...? 
---
Most of the updates were succesfull and brought good content.
---
&gt;What context did he miss?
---
You need to use cheat engine to access dev room, players dont stumble there by accident. 900 hours guy was actually an exploiter.
---
&gt;He mentioned the patches and what they did.
---
See above, you would know he undervalued them if you followed the updates to the game.
---
&gt;When a game has tons of 0 score reviews why should that be ignored?
---
If you unironically give a game  0 score on metacritic you aren't acting like a grownup. 
---
&gt;The rest isn't even worth replying too.
---
cool have a nice day.
---
Did you play during beta?
---
Fair enough. Is getting guns all that drives you forward? Do quests get better?
---
I mainly only play rpgs, i don't know many who got through all of the witcher, GTA 5, dragon age, fo3/NV/4, skyrim, etc. In 20 hours. Except for speedrunnners you're gonna take longer than 20 hours non them.
---
Disco ball and I swear there‚Äôs a bed I‚Äôve only seen on him.
---
If you're not launching a ton of nukes then you may find plenty of cargobots through random encounters. I often find them at Pleasant Valley and Watoga because the inhabitants start fights with them.
---
Cargobots are much better with a team because you each get a keycard.
---
Yes, and no. Played the beta and hated it, played the full release about a week ago for like 5+ hours   at a friend‚Äôs and I hated it just the same
---
People don'tkill you and just spam sorry million times before killing making you concede
---
Sweet fine. The vendor bot occasionally spawns there. Great grab
---
There‚Äôs never a guaranteed spawn for it, unfortunately.
---
np bud it had me scared at one time as well :)
---
You do realize that people carry junk on them at workshops (also, you can definitely get plastic from workshops, but that's neither here nor there), right? For someone who has opinions on the matter, I find it strange that you seem to be woefully unaware of the facts.
---
As for survival, I do OK there. I just like to be able to fast travel and hate that you lose aid items. It's a preference.
---
I stopped playing after sheepquatch and after I got to level 100, but I found the most joy with the game playing with friends, listen to music, and making camps. I think doing the enclave quests the game gets really fun but the endgame could be better. Still a really fun game with friends
---
Is paying for a Sherpa a thing on the marketplace? I hate to pay caps to circumvent tedious quests, but if I'm buying keycards I'm already there.
---
You need to grow up. Stop complaining that you can't play the PvP mode disengaged from PvP.
---
If you want the extra benefits, you have to accept the extra risks. Including showing up on the leaderboard.
---
Just stash them prior to triggering the quest, and pull them out one at a time to turn into the wall.
---
Different people like different things.
---
I like killing people and taking workshops
---
Okay. So do I. But if you read my comment I gave a few conditions for you to get stun-locked. If you can avoid these you'll be fine
---
I don't know why are you so eager to recommend my works in this community and on youtube but thank you -)) Much appreciated!
---
Sometimes I feel sad about people being unable to use mods on other platforms, I can't imagine playing it without so many of them -(
---
OMG what an elegant and simple solution... why have I never thought this or heard it said already? Fuckit, here's my upvote.
---
I killed four today.  Including an albino and a 91 glowing deathclaw  with my gauntlet and no PA.  tje bears scare me more!
---
To calculate the multiplier by which you multiply the base damage of a weapon is: ((damage/damageresist)(.15))^.365
---
Let's say a nonlegendary weapon does 100 damage, and you're shooting a target with 100 damage resistance. The equation would be ((100/100)(.15))^.365. That's roughly .5, so you multiply that by the base damage of 100 to get 50 damage actually done to the target.
---
Now let's say you're using an AA version of the weapon. You would use the same exact equation, but 50 instead of 100 for the enemy's damage resist. That would give you roughly .64, multiplied by 100, doing 64 damage. That's a +28% increase from a nonlegendary version (I remember now, it's always 28%, not 19%. My point still stands because Bloodied caps at 99%).
---
Bloodied, as I said, is +1% per % HP. Bloodied is better.
---
Can you link me to the post, by the way? I hate when people spread misinformation, so I'm going to try to get him to delete his post.
---
What do you get in the workshops?
---
That's not a low level area.
---
Is there some kind of player-specific cooldown on top of this?  I've seen it where a player who frequently launches nukes was doing a silo, and he was locked out from launching it because of a cooldown, even though I was there and able to do it in his place.
---
Just to fix my bad wording... I dont like the fact you have to turn a certain lvl whatever at the location... if it was just to lvl up at the location I'd be ok with that
---
Putting together a set, what would you want to pay in caps? And what mods?
---
No clue but I found 50+ ultracite power armor mods in a cash register once. Saved me a shitload of grinding
---
You get plastic from the world, it's not the workshop that is generating it. That is a fact.
---
If people are carrying junk on them at workshops, that's on them. Most normal people stash their junk and carry what doesn't drop.
---
As for you doing "OK" in Survival. Sure, whatever you say buddy.
---
TL:DR
---
Grind to be competitive with people who grind
---
Exploring the environment. Was mostly what I did in FO4 as well. I think the environment and some of the "story telling" they do with it is probably one of the strongest points. Won't float everyone's boat but I always have enjoyed just roaming open worlds, be it horsing around in TES or just driving pointlessly in GTA. 
---
Also really enjoying the testing of builds, trying to maximize their strengths and reduce the weaknesses. This was more or less lacking in FO4 unless you specifically chose to do so. I am a fan of the restriction created by the new perk system (er, well, maybe besides swapping in hacker/lockpick/etc, that is tedious). 
---
Now that I've got my builds in a stable place doling out decent damage I've started joining in on the endgame events and its breathing a bit of new life in. Watching slivers of health drain on the SBQ with each hit from my sledge was rather rewarding after all the building. Not sure how long that'll last though, and its leaves a sour taste when the SBQ glitches out.
---
No it is very sad but there is a chance for a 2-3 * weapon
---
I‚Äôll pay 5k for calibrated shocks on both legs, jet pack, and targeting hud
---
So take a break and come back later. Shrug.
---
That has been my reaction. I have played Fallout since 1 was released new, no xbox game whatever it was, and played all the others. I tried to ignore the 76 hate and pre ordered the game. I have tried to like it over and over, I make a character and get to about 30th level and start over trying different things to make my own fun, it is just not fun for me. I am not a multi player game players at all, but that is totally avoidable in 76, yet the game just is blah. A long while ago my friends were super into WOW so I bought it and tried to play that, I hate MMOs, but they were having a blast. Same thing, it was just meh. Same quests, kind of junk community (at the time) so I just stopped. Since launch it has changed a lot but for me, it is a solid Meh. The lack of lore consistency with the other games also annoys me, I know why they did it that way, got to use all the assets and such. The story way they introduced the new lore is just bad. 
---
Now, if 76 ends up being a reboot of the series, that is totally fine with me. Let the next fallout continue with the new lore and new direction. Maybe the next fallout will be better, as it is 76 I just can not like. It does not have the humor of the other games, the "story" is just meh and the developers seem to have been given their different parts in different studios and not allowed to talk to each other about what and how to connect it all together. It is not bad, but as a huge fan of the others, it is just not something I can get into. I know people that love it but it is just not for me.
---
It can be at any of the random spawn locations... no way to narrow it down unfortunately
---
Unless you‚Äôre also good at the game, if you‚Äôre wearing power armor in a non-rad zone you aren‚Äôt.
---
So true xD
---
Take a picture of another player, wearing raider or responder gear, while intoxicated, in a rad storm, in Morgantown.
---
why would you insult polish people I'm not even polish
---
I belive you, but there was another thread her today saying the same as me, 2x without and 4x with :/
---
But that means that there is no point at all wasting that much caps on that plan since it's doing nothing at all ?
---
All the peoples junk and they're caps and an adrenaline rush
---

---
Got them made into stickers with some alt versions of each too. :)
---
Fair enough, sandbox style rpg's tend to stretch longer.  Tradeoff is they tend to have a lot of dead time between points, gearing up, and a.wide array of filler quests among the gems.
---
The update preview article says mole miner vendor, that would be so cool. But I don't think they meant it how I read it.
---
Here's a link to a thread where a guy made a map. It's really helpful. 
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i\_made\_a\_map\_of\_resource\_deposits/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/) 
---
As you can see, there's quite a few nodes near Vault 76. Also, it helps to "tag for search" in your junk component view the things you want.
---
So stop wearing power armor in non-rad zones man.
---
It‚Äôs really that simple.
---
You know it disadvantages you; take it off.
---
I finally found one by doing Queen of the Hunt and hopping til I found one. It was really tedious...
---
That's the armor known as server lag.
---
Junk extractors don't drop plastic? Interesting. Also, plastic was a single example of the wealth of junk you can get from people at workshops. Your focus on it is...strange. And yes, I get my fair share of kills in survival. 
---
Do you want me to spend 300 words bragging about my delusional view of my prowess like some would do? Nope -- I do OK. I gain a net benefit in terms of drops and caps. Nothing too fancy. Still don't see what this has to do with how workshops function.
---
I thought it stopped with the locations after you hit level 76? If Im correct, then this post makes no sense, as I LOVE that easy challenge every time I play. Open up challenges, see if Im going to be wearing a tux or my responder paramedic outfit, check whether I will equip a sword or whatnot, and then just play. Easy peasy every single day. There's almost no variety, if Beth adds a dozen other 'variants' of the quest I may join you, but right now it's literally the easiest thing I do when I login.
---
Haven't seen this yet. Level 54. That's terrifying.
---
Sorry, fixed. I was texting someone else and combined my replies for some reason.
---
Hmm not sure on that one. I have yet to launch one myself. Just know what I've read/seen from others. Most people who farm the sbq have a team. So even if their is a player specific cooldown, I'd imagine they take turns.
---
If you're averaging a level a day, then the challenge is possible every day. You only need 1 level to do this.
---
I had my camp there for a long time and got attacked once in like thirty levels
---
I had this happen last night, started to assume a bug, and then my squad mates explained Im probably in an area with a monster. I closed the map, spammed VATS two or three clicks, and sure enough a radrat nearby. Killed it and the fast travel option was back. Hope that works for you@
---
Is not like we can report thees rats 
---
Its time to take the matter in our own hands time to finde the mole amongst us
---
Mainly see ticks, these no creatures really down there
---
Yeah, I think I have a lot. Is there anything you'd specifically like to know about?
---
Im so jelly...
---
I don‚Äôt have the materials though so Ill do 6k if you want
---
You sound like someone who has a personal grudge against fallout
---
You want plastic so you kill people for junk. That has to be one of the slowest methods for farming for plastic. You're the one who brought up plastic, not me. 
---
Still haven't addressed the issue of being able to just contest a workshop to initiate PvP. If you contest a workshop, then you should have to own it. You shouldn't be able to continuously contest the same workshop over and over. That is bad design. Your failure to realize that is laughable.
---
And no, you're bad at Survival. That's why you stick to hunting people at workshops, Mr. Fake News :)
---
The way I deal with the Cargobot is to equip Enforcer and a shotgun and just start shooting at it.  Eventually, you'll cripple its engines so it will slow down, and then be unable to move at all, and you'll be able to finish it off with a Gatling Gun pretty easily.
---
Between my mods, music, etc., I know how nice it is to have your stuff plugged, so I try to do the same with the stuff I dig. My friends deal with it all the time ;) Coming back to my CAMP and having it look the way I want to makes for a more enjoyable experience, which counts for a lot, or having different options for power armor than the standards, etc.
---
Also, The Responders are generous folk. haha
---
I like grinding for legendarys and doing events
---
Ok cool. Gimme a bit to piece together. Paint job? I can do most BOS jobs.
---
I‚Äôm down for this. I can start up Poseidon in about 20 minutes solo with jet packed power armor.
---
Its okay. He's just a bit stupid and doesn't understand not every console has a R3.
---
Yeah, was kind of expecting close to that with this game since it is a fallout game and was marketed as fallout online. So I figured it would have fallout amounts of quests and story.
---
So yea. Legendary vendor
---
I switched my bloodied explosive gauss rifle to prime and it was the best move I ever made, it creams scorchbeasts out of the sky...
---
I've never figured out how to hack terminals and it's been 800+ hours. Please help so can stop asking my older brother to do them for me.
---
&gt;i recommend playing other games alongside FO76. it's not like you (OP) sound like you'll be left behind in any way if you add some other games to your active playlist
---
i didn't play fo76 in months and still there is no content to make me log in again especially considering i can probably finish it in like 2-3 hours
---
I need this alot
---
Can you do the knight cpt paint?
---
&gt;And i agree its nearly impossible to create large scale quests and other content to keep every one happy
---
but who was ESO,GW2/WOW
---
Yeah, it's not well known that is got readded like the disarm bug.
---
Yeah they are overpowered whenever i find those level 76 glowing Yao GUI they shred me in 2 hits and I‚Äôm level 78
---
[](/kcelestiaawkward)It's like borderlands except with far more weapon variety(between all the different weapons, the combustibility of weapons, and up to 3 game changing legendary effects it's like being a kid in a candy store every time I see a legendary enemy), and all the exploration elements of the Fallout universe. Plus with mutations I can play it kind of like a movement shooter with a massive arena against tons of cool enemies.  
---
I like it.
---
I've also seen the mothman south a bit closer to the location marker there (devil's backbone?), on top of the cliff.  And I've seen the flatwoods monster once below that by the flag pole.
---
Mothman may have elements of a random encounter per person, as opposed to a fixed location (probably both, he definitely does have fixed encounter locations though).  I haven't seen the flatwoods monster enough to take a guess though.
---
Molerats are bullshit in 76 tbh.
---
I'm in the ammo factory the other day, molerats attack, these hairless cunts burrowed through the second floor grate walkways and disappeared. 
---
You serious? Like, what the fuck? How the hell is that even happening?
---
I'm just bored doing the same challenges everyday... same with the alchohol challenges... its not really a challenge.. it's more of an annoying chore.. yes maybe if there was a MUCH larger list of things on it I wouldn't be complaining at all... but its boring and not a challenge
---
Personal? Haha üòÜüòÜüòÜ  nah I saw the shitstorm brewing and I stayed away.
---
Wheres your camp at? If i dont like it ill destroy it on sight.
---
Bloodied gatling gun with +25% fire rate and, if possible, 90% weight reduction. By far imo.
---
You could always go and build your CAMP in a relatively busy area of the wasteland, where you'd have visitors.
---
Yeah, game crashed for me on ps4 accidentally doing that yesterday.
---
Uhhh, when did Deathclaws STOP being terrifying?
---
To be honest, i don't personally really see any need in using them. When taking into account how much more their ammo costs and how low the damage gain is. The game is so easy that there is no need to minmax with them. Ask yourself.. Do i have any difficulty killing enemies without using them?
---
I‚Äôll consider it a finished game once Whitesprings stops lagging like crazy even when I‚Äôm the only one there.
---
You trade in your legendaries for scrip which is a currency so it has no weight. You then will use that to buy what looks like randomly generated legendaries from the purveyor
---
Look for parantheses, brackets, and less/greater-than signs that make a closed pair. For example "()" or even with characters between them, like "[#%^*]". When you select them, you either remove a false answer from the options or reset your tries.
---
Also, exit when you have one try left, because they reset when you exit.
---
Huh?
---
Sorry for OT, but does Queen of the Hunt spawn on a regular basis for you? This is one of my favorite events, but it spawns next to none for me (last time was somewhere in january).
---
It's actually pretty efficient, since we're apparently still focused on a single category of junk I used as an example. Can usually get about 600 in a couple hours plus the spots that are on a cooldown between collections like the cat house, etc. On top of that, I get a pile of everything else. I have 15 mules full of junk at the moment.
---
Not liking the mechanics of survival (losing aid items and only being able to fast travel to stations) does not equal being bad at it. As I said, I gain a net benefit from playing there when I do.
---
If you contest a workshop multiple times, you're paying for it each time. I really don't see the problem.
---
[](/celestiafrown)There's a Crystallizing barrel, and a recoil stock for the Cryolator. Think that's it tho.
---
It's in the Savage Divide, though, which means they could be attacked by level 68 Scorched, Super mutants, and Scorchbeasts. I have my camp east of there, and get attacked by all 3 regularly.
---
I've never seen it either
---
&gt;Coming back to my CAMP and having it look the way I want to makes for a more enjoyable experience, which counts for a lot
---
I know, right! This is one of my favourite parts of the game -))
---
We might be able to price per round, but the tax removed would be per purchase not per item, if that makes sense.
---
Like, for the auction house in wow, its exactly the same thing. The game takes a 10% profit cut. If I put up a 20 stack of an item, I can choose to either give it a flat price or price it via each individual piece of the stack. The 10% comes out of the total, lets say, 100money the person spends buying my 5money per item stack, and so I end up with 90money.
---
game has no end game and no content worth grinding what did you expect?
---
There actually are a few. You have the revolutionary event where you RP taking over/defending a fort with some robot help, there's the monster mash, and I think a few other versus ones too. Hunter/hunted by itself can count as a separate mode because it is quite different from regular gameplay. Survival mode is more just the regular game for people who like pvp. Again, I don't mind it being in the game, but I don't like missing out on significant rewards just because I don't pvp
---
And considering there are numerous copper spots in the Forest, why send a low level character all the way to the Divide?
---
Awesome!
---
I hope so. I also hope we're able to sell plans.
---
Send bobs and vagana
---
This is really cool. Nice work.
---
Just short a couple mats. Will send you a private message.
---
Im the diehard Fallout fan and I love it. 
---
When I played FO3, NV, and FO4, as soon as the story was done Id roll a new toon and play hundreds of hours with mods, alternate quest completions, different factions, but mostly endless looting and exploring and building. Countless wasted hours in FO4, for example, where I didn't even meet Preston in Concord, just went around taking settlements and collecting loot and destroying mutants and ghouls. It's why I play any of the modern Fallouts. 
---
With the exception of NV, I've never been excited for a Fallout story, they're all pretty weak. Not the entire quest system in these games, but certainly the main quests. FO3 I find the weakest followed closely by FO4, ouch!
---
So why do I love 76? Cos it's the parts of Fallout I love the most and done to fucking perfection. West Virginia is the best Bethesda/Obsidian map to date, hands down. The endless looting and killing is exactly what I want to waste my time with, well-tuned and with my own music playing in the background. I have loved many games over the years but the ones I end up playing hundreds of hours in are the ones that sync well with my ent lifestyle.
---
He's most likely talking about the rolls the legendary items you can buy from the vendor will have
---
LOL I really dont give a shit. It was what it was and you cant change that for me.
---
I'm at level 190 and I only faintly remember seeing them once or twice earlier on
---
I'd like to join in on this, i was just running out of things to do and this seems fun. My in game name is the same as on here
---
What about shot up road signs or just any ol' weird/wonderful looking signs?   I'm sure that would be a keeper.
---
*Same on Xbox One. It sucks especially if you have a workshop and freezes.*
---
#FIX this Bethesda!#
---
They give rad protection.
---
Oh man I can't wait to be able to build stuff like that. I'm still on "shack innawoods" tier.
---
I stand toe to toe with them on a regular basis. You are just digging deeper into your own bullshit.
---
No problem.
---
The currently available ones are the only ones you can get at the moment. There's some script in the game for taxidermy that hasn't been activated that will allow us to get them upon killing the enemy in question
---
I always ask myself ''Do i really need that bullshit Bloodied tse quadruple shotgun?'' After that i kill some ghouls  with my vanilla shotgun without mods and always end up with ''Nah dont need that shit all good''
---
All we are is shit in the wind~ Kansas
---
Oh friend. You're so socially tone deaf you've missed it all the way. Your first comment was kind of an annoying "no kidding moment". I figured you might just assume people don't know, but then you explained to me the problems which I had just said I was waiting for them to fix. 
---
You're mansplaining the game to a mid 30s father in the top 5% (maybe 1%) of players by hours logged. 
---
I've been playing fallout since 1, and video games since the mid eighties. I'm gonna assume you mean the best and just say bless your heart for trying, but you're not gonna save me honey. Good luck with the rest of them.
---
You are actually able to carry as many as you can it just only shows up as one in the inventory. You get more rewards for turning in 2 than 1 which is proof
---
So true. In survival mode you just can‚Äôt complete when almost everyone uses automatic explosive weapons against you. Most PvP encounters are over before you even realise they started.
---
I'm not lying, just calling it something different. It is an explosive weapon that shoots two projectiles. By definition I would say that is two shot explosive. It's different than exploding bullets
---
Where do you farm legendaries?
---
I'd also add that, while this wasn't a Fallout fan thing exclusively, Fallout 76 as a game is a lot more muted and slow than a lot of modern gamers are used to.  It's more of what the old Maxis might have considered a "software toy," a game you can endlessly tinker with and play with your own goals in mind.  And if you don't have any or aren't good at inventing your own, you're probably going to find yourself bored.
---
I stated in a 'pls grow our stash space' that my stash is fine as it is assuming the servers take a hit if they increase stashes, but you may have hit on the happy medium here - leave stash as is and toss some more build budget our way. Would encourage Atom store spending as Ive stopped buying CAMP stuff since my CAMP wont be changing until I want to move. Time to give you my upvote!
---
That's more where I was going with my question.  I have an Automatic Handmade that has no issues with lvl 50/65 SB.  Level 80's can take some time but still are manageable.  I guess I'm just curious if the difference was enough to legit justify the switch.  I suppose not really...  Or maybe I can still switch one weapon just to do it, heck why not right?
---
Did you get it?
---
I have had water purifiers in larger cleaner water and in shallow more toxic water and I am convinced shallower water yields less.  If I come back after an hour of grinding to the large pond it is 5 each for two industrial but in a shallow toxic creek (North on map) it produces about 2 or 3 each per hour if you are lucky.
---
Can confirm that dirt purifiers are 2 max hold and industrial 5.  You empty them and they fill again.  Dirt purifiers are not affected by location for output.
---
Never apologise for being awesome! üòÖ

Huh, didn't expect the 20 hour thing to be 76.  I've probably got a couple hundred hours in it and still do a few a week.  I got a fair bit of amusement just hunting down the stuff on map.  Pretty much anywhere they put a cartoony image has some little story.
---
You are one crazy guy, do you know how dangerous those things are ?
---
You will get you as.. handed to you and you will be carrying you own body parts in a bag back to you camp,  lol
---
Close to Nonya
---
Trade for them
---
You have 15 mules, so you have 3 separate accounts? LOL!
---
Not to mention, your inefficient method of farming for junk only works if the workshops are actually taken and you are capable of killing the person who owns it. On numerous occasions I've been on a world for hours where not one workshop gets taken.
---
You're bad at Survival because I've killed you in Survival. You've actually been in a few screenshots on the PvP discords (though that was when Survival came out). I haven't seen you in Survival any time recently (most of the people who play Survival regularly know one another by now). There's a reason I called you Mr. Fake News :)
---
When you kill someone that owns a workshop, you get caps. As long as that person's level is above what it costs to contest the workshop, griefers are fine with paying for it. You don't see the problem because you aren't able to see anything more than a narrow minded view of how you think things should work.
---
There's a reason there's a post almost every other day in this subreddit on how bad the workshop contesting design is. There's also a reason you don't see posts from people who are saying the workshop contest system is perfect and shouldn't be changed.
---
Get a grip dude, you're not convincing anyone of anything.
---
I found a 3* bloodied handmade with extra damage while aiming down. I made a bloodied build and used it for about 10 minutes before realizing it's boring as shit. That thing's getting yeeted straight out of my stash as soon as player vending comes
---
Yeah
---
I will have a look into it. thanks :)
---
This is perfect!
---
Add me. Dramatic\_Prophet. Also need it
---
im pretty sure the other commenter is right about that also i think you wont get the mods from scrapping
---
there are certain mods in the game you can only buy from vendors or find as random spawns your best bet would be to visit the vendorbot phoenix every once in a while and check its modsection
---
Both. Two shot = two hits instead of one, even though the damage is only slightly higher. Explosive = splash damage, more hits. Twice the splash damage means way more hits at once = RIP condition
---
Then who takes the pylons?
---
And no nuke exclusion zone, nuke anywhere!
---
Camps take no damage from PVP when player is marked as pacifist.
---
do you have the paint plan? i just scrapped my left leg by accident and need the paint on it when i find another
---
Thanks, very nice to know :)
---
Is Luck of The Draw bugged? Barely seems to do shit for me at rank 3

Stutters/Hiccups got my melee character killed a few times yesterday. Nothing major lost but annoying all the same.
---
The Ability to set up different perk specs ...
---
Getting so sick of equiping three lockpicking perks everytime I see a 3\* lock =(
---
Oh well, i really hoped i could learn the mods by scrapping like most other weapons, if not there is no point buying that plan, since most of us would wait until we find some kind of legendary version and apply the mods to it :/
---
I my head I justify it like this:
---
Todd: 'May I please have 200 bucks to implement nicer particle effects in Starfield?'
---
Zenimax: 'Sure thing but... do you know how other publishers are making billions for their shareholders with Live Services?'
---
T: 'Sure, I have heard about it, but...'
---
Z: 'And you know how we don't have a live service ourselves right? I mean, we have shareholders, which is 50% of the scenario, we just don't have... you know... a live service'.
---
T: 'Yeah, but that...'
---
Z: 'So, are we going to have one of those, you know, live services?'.
---
T: '\*sigh\* hold my Black-Briar Mead'
---
T: 'Here, a live service. We made it on a budget by cutting corners here and there, we put that new studio to use in the process and it has a shop full of shiny stuff that players can buy, now can I have my 200 bucks please?'
---
Z: 'Why that was quick, the mead is still cold! splendid job Mr Howard! Of course, of course... but first... those 'particle effects' you talk about... they are, you know, going to be locked behind a paywall of in-game currency right?'
---
T: 'sSZzzblarghFus  Ro Dah!'

Someone said that there was a hitching problem associated with having too many friends and friend requests on your friends list. But it was something like 100+ where you would start to see an issue.
---
There are lot of people using them because they have tons of duped flux to craft ammo with. Ever wondered why there are people selling flux for 50 caps each? :D Surely if i was a duper i would be using Prime weapons for the small gain since i had no problems with mats. But for average player who kills Queen once in week  or two and finds random nuke zone here there.. The cost can be really high.

There is usually on in the trailers in southern Berkeley.

You can get the Crystallizing Barrel and Recoil Stock from scrapping.

I found some in Wally's water park too. I wonder why they go to miscellaneous instead of junk if worthless?
---
Damn u! XD
---
Well I had my there and never had much of a problem, but you are right that side of the map is higher level. Maybe look for another
---
Yeah and thats why I had hesitated to do it.
---
I am the liquor!
---
like the confetti we got in helvetia for the floor, we could get trash to give it a more wasteland vibe
---
You‚Äôve almost certainly found trade-able armor, look for sentinel and cavalier pieces, you should be able to trade a few for an explosive weapon.
---
Also, I have found several explosive weapons at vendors, people sell the craziest stuff!
---
Ditto.  Only TSE or BE or AAE or FE i have seen are the ones mentioned here.
---
Yea, that‚Äôs what I was going to suggest. In rare situations you will get something that you could potentially use but for the most part, I think I find stuff that everyone but me can use. Which is fine by me. At least it has value.
---
As a lower level that actively seeks high levels to fight..
---
Player level is irrelevant past about 55. I'm level 69 and regularly kill 100..200..300+ characters. As long as your cards and gear are right, level does not matter. All being level 345 does is lose you more caps when you engage.
---
I picked up a 1* instigating Fat Man today, that gun is ridiculous!
---
Blimey, what a mess. Hope everyone is okay.
---
100 x this
---
This is like the fifth new-to-me suggestion that I've been instantly behind today. So many fresh ideas and this is definitely another good one - would let people who want to OCD their 5/day as usual, and still encourage us to sample the new stuff upon release... is a great idea, have my upvote
---
My instagating rifle- first shot

Cheers and thanks for the upvote!

I‚Äôm game. Psn - brm138
---
..if it actively makes it known, then a surrender option shouldn't be too difficult to implement, though I'm no programmer :)
---
Then it's just deciding on what the consequence is for forfeiture.
---
 Though I don't prefer your way, I guess the cautious workshop holder could always make sure he was "junkless" (with a stash there) and thus minimize any loss.
---
Yeah I noticed that moving in one direction sometimes helps. Even though im not in caution etc.
---
I just bought the plans off him. I knew it was in game but had never seen the plans anywhere before.
---
You on pc?
---
Reward for BoS Technical Data returns don't improve the more data you return at once. Every other point were golden.
---
text chat and perk loadouts would be great
---
Thanks, I'll try this and see if it gets better.
---
Because you could‚Äôve traded that piece for literally any item you wanted.
---
I've no proof of this, but I've started to believe what that one user suggested earlier about how the types of Legendaries you find are skewed toward the ones you have the most of.  Meaning that if you carry a lot of Bloodied weapons, you'll have a slightly higher chance of finding Bloodied weapons.
---
But such things can also be skewed by the Legendary "server" being lazy and just spamming the same prefix, as it often does when you kill several Legendaries in succession.
---
No I play sadly on Xbox :/
---
It's a good opinion that you have. Workshop pvp should be limited to a largish radius around a workshop. To combat gaming the radius and to provide a way to relinquish ownership, if a player leaves this radius after a workshop is contested then they relinquish the workshop and pvp ends. 
---
The solution is really not as complicated as people want to make it.
---
It isn't a matter of being able to do the challenge... I'm tired of doing the challenge it's been on for weeks
---
Grind caps and buy them
---
Or even make certain perks like hacking, lockpicking, crafting things etc etc passive so that they are always on. Only combat affecting perks would require switching around.
---
Yeah, I was playing along as well... Oof. It was pretty obvious from the emoji you used beforehand.
---
You didn't list any problems you were waiting for them to fix, so I don't know what you're talking about there.
---
I love how you're flexing your age and play time as some form of accomplishment, just shows how insecure you are. Grow up, dude. You don't have to be so condescending, you just come off as a weirdo.
---
Thanks! Just yesterday I got the plans for the nuke cola quantum power armor paint, I could probably repeat the process and get extra plans to trade for explosive weapons üòä
---
Anytime I Express this opinion people attack me saying that people should just not capture workshops then. Pvp at the workshop is totally different the pvp in watoga because you have the junk yard
---
Thx for the correction :)
---
Don't listen to Golden Shower Comando, he's just stiring the shit storm.
---
You can do 3/3 all at once, being over level 76 means that one is in the bag. I usually get a fasnacht mask (still possible with the default in game one) and some Responder gear, wear it all at once, one level up, done. It's the easiest next to crafting healing items.
---
If your on pc willing to trade / will be selling when player vending comes out
---
Step 1. Get fireproof
---
Step 2. Max it out and either leave it on, or swap whenever scorchbeast is attacking
---
Step 3. Go live your best life.
---
Mods too, some can be pretty heavy! Fingers and toes crossed.
---
np :)
---
Yeah it's that easy

Deathclaws *are* terrifying to a point.  That point being once you get past Lv. 50 or so.

To be honest, I'd have no objection if the Glowing Deathclaw (or some variant above it) had the same durability as the Sheepsquatch.
---
Golden shower? How original, then again with mind like yours it‚Äôs no wonder you‚Äôre triggered over any type of game bashing.
---
+Karma
---
Yeah, at least make them each leveled. Pick lock costs 1 picks lvl1, expert costs 2 picks up to lvl 2, master costs 3 picks up to lvl 3. Same for hacking.
---
No. I have 6 separate accounts, three of which are currently in use for muling. Not hard when you own two Xboxes.
---
As for killing me in survival, I am not following your logic. Everyone dies in survival at some point. Unless you're saying that you're so unskilled that my dying to you automatically makes me bad, I am afraid I don't quite understand the point you're trying to make. In any case, I log over to survival a few times a week. You call me "Mr. Fake News" because you looked up my previous posts where I identify myself by my Xbox gamertag. 
---
That you are so incredulous about me having so many mules indicates that we've likely never met ingame and you probably don't even play on Xbox.
---
Now onto why this subreddit fills up with the same thing: People parrot their favorite YouTubers or posts they randomly see. A lot of stupid things (see the massive controversy over canvas bags or a small, inconsequential buff for wearing matching costumes with your teammates for a week) get repeated, and this whole "make it even easier for a completely optional PVP system" thing is ridiculous. Eliminating slap damage? Good idea. Preventing CAMP destruction most of the time? Also good. Allowing someone who opts-in to PVP to enjoy the benefits of something to escape any consequences by just abandoning the workshop? Dumb.
---
For me it has been, have 2 be levers, full unyielding sentinel armour bloodied  fatman be gauss and three characters with max caps, play hard sell harder
---
Got into my first Hunter hunted game, pretty sure I got hunted because of the FIVE GODDAMN MOLERATS INSTA BURROWING AROUND ME AS I RAN. Sounded like a train.
---
Well, you say that, but if you run the SBQ often enough, all that Flux really piles up, and the stuff ain't light.
---
You'll get there. That was my first C.A.M.P. (humblebrag). I spent hours and hours in fo4 settlement workshop honing my skills. I've got two more camps built that I'd like to share. That video's thread didn't go anywhere and it discouraged me a bit.
---
I'll film and upload tours if there is interest.
---
&gt;Though if she is bringing in a bunch of outsiders to MY Appalachia, we‚Äôre going to have words...

Words... expressing...?  
---
Gratitude?

Appreciation?

Excitement?  
---
Curiosity?
---
Because aside from the *(generally)* awesome player-base that makes up 76... Waste Virginia is kinda hum-drum w/o any outsiders :(  
---
There's no [karma system](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b730e5/raider_mode_instead_of_survival_mode_better_name/) *^((through things like pick-pocketing, or theft outside of an owned workshop with locked containers))* :(  
---
There aren't NPCs to have a multi-choice conversation with *^((we aren't able to obtain new canon-lore through players))*   
---
There's not even a DJ on the radio to mix things up with an occasional chuckle *^((I vote for Grahm or at least the Free States vendor bot))*
---
Truth be told... I loved listening to the radio in FO3 and 4 *(I listened to it in NV but wasn't a fan of the playlist).* but Wayne Newton as the DJ in FO:NV is what made me not turn off the radio completely... Which is what I've done in 76. The lack of DJ and the fact that some songs are now missing from what was in FO3 and 4, plus the new ones being ho-hum to me (I hate that they added such a newer song from the Beach Boys), it left me enjoying the game more with the radio off in 76. :\\
---
Lovely gun. Nice find.
---
It would be nice to have so many 'friends' that it becomes an issue... heh... :P
---
I'd be fine with surrender if it throws you across the map, drops your junk bag, gives the attacker caps equal to if they had killed you, and marks your bag for the attacker so they can easily pick it up.
---
Why are you against Adventure mode changes to make it so that the HUGE number of gamers who want NO pvp anywhere near them can see what the programming Bethesda created for workshops is like? Do you think non-PvP gamers should miss out on this very enjoyable building mechanic? Huge free budgets and resource collectors and reward plans, they should forget the exist? Even with Survival mode workshops for the PvP minded?
---
Please explain to me why you don't think Adventure-mode only workshops shouldn't be looked at.
---
I'm surprised no one has gone into a "OMG Pay-to-Win" panic over the "Wear an Unstoppable Costume" option.  Although, I guess the Mistress of Mystery outfit might count for that.
---
No thanks, it's already annoying to get randoms sending team requests, and the ability to 'wave' to everyone on server would just open the floodgates for the idiots to spam constantly. Two or more on one sever and 'ping', 'ping', 'ping', 'ping'
---
Better watch yourself he might grab you by yours.
---
Its weird. I had it pop up more with rank 1 than at rank 3. Stopped using it.
---
Make non-combat perks like lockpicking, hacking, crafting stuff etc etc others passive perks that are always in effect. And have perk loadouts for combat affecting ones that would only be changeable in camps (for balance reasons, for example in survival mode/pvp)
---
I've met them in Welch, Lewisberg and in the tunnel between Lewisberg and Watoga.
---
Do you still have this
---
I saw fabulous cranberry relish xp guide on yt. H: shielded- marine, operative, bos, under armor. 2 star bos combat armors @outrageously low prices. I hope to trade things easier. W: drinks, fancy food, ammo, clothing, bulk items
---
Yeah, but you shouldn't call it TSE, because it's not. It's an explosive weapon that has TS.
---
I get your point. I really do. But let's think this through: Flagging players who pick up (death)dropped junk pvp/wanted will result in no one picking up stuff anymore, which totally defies the death penalty. Why not suggesting to not drop any junk at all? Because that is basically what you're proposing.
---
Like i've mentioned before, the death penalty in this game is already ridiculous low, it's just junk. Where would be the challenge, if you take that away?
---
A bit of a silver lining for me. Whereas it would've been better if each model got it's own unique skin I like the T60 best. Everyone says the T51 is the best for damage but I hate the look, now I can just slap this on it. Whoever designed that is the worse, no detail and might as well just use a bucket for the head. I even like the T45 better. (I like the X01 except for the helmet, it reminds me of the skeksis from the dark crystal)
---
I'm 161 and never had an explosive weapon drop let alone a TSE. I used to want to earn my gear, but then I realized it would never happen. Now everything i use has been bought or traded for lol.
---
With green thumb I ran through whitespring and had 200+ fluorescent 100+ yellow, getting flux is not that hard to craft a high amount to craft prime ammo, especially with super duper on for both crafting flux and ammo
---
Well is a bit rude if you don‚Äôt like the game just don‚Äôt comment, why are you even in this community anyways if you don‚Äôt like it?.
---
I wish. That's was the whole reason I got so excited when I found one. Now it just sits in my stash. The reload sound is quite nice though.
---
I found my first two shot explosive combat shotgun lvl 50 when I was killing the queen at lvl 350? 
---
So yeah, most are duped lol
---
Might be only thing to keep me intrested in the future
---
That is why i said "for average player" :)
---
Honestly the absolute draw for me is getting to play with a friend in the same PA universe. When I first started playing, solo, I found the game not nearly as enjoyable and realized I really needed a friend there to complete some tasks. I'm not saying you can't play the game solo, but I'm a casual gamer and playing it solo was proving to be difficult at low levels. I can tell you the exact moment I realized it too: I was level 10 or so in the Savage Divide on the tracks near a shack where there were super mutants. I was doing fine picking them off one by one but just as I was coming around the building two more walked out. I backpedaled, shooting them both, and though I knew I could kill one and survive, I couldn't do both. If I had someone else there with me, someone who could help damage or split the two super mutants or stimpack me when I fell I wouldn't have died.
---
I love Fallout, I love Post Apocalyptic settings, I go to Post Apocalyptic events irl, but I'm not down with the lone wanderer and his dog. I'm not Mad Max. I like cooperation, I like being helpful and in a group, I like surviving with another person(s). When I finally had someone else to play with me it changed the whole dynamic of the game.
---
Suddenly there was someone else there with me who had my back, I had their back, and we could get through WV together. We were eachother's companions (but honestly if we could have cosmetic animal companions we would be beyond thrilled; ESO does it, come on come on!). Together, I've now played close to 300 hrs. We completed the main story, we've launched nukes, we've just about discovered every place on the map, and have seen/killed everything but an owl. Whenever I begin to feel a lull in my interest in playing, my partner suggests something we can do: go back to a location and find the story, do the challenges to get atoms for items from the Atomic Shop, do events, etc.
---
 Yesterday I spent time claiming workshops to complete a challenge and I enjoyed setting it up to surprise her when she got on. I discovered how useful a workshop was in getting build materials and though it requires a little bit of babysitting it beats grinding a bit. That wasn't the best part though. When we were off doing another task, someone claimed my workshop and we decided we'd go and take it back if they locked up everything (I had ft back to the workshop to defend it against liberators and another player was there, I unlocked everything as a thank you so she could enjoy some spoils, but she took the workshop as soon as I left to go back to my partner). By the time we returned, someone else took the workshop and locked everything, so we put our junk away and proceeded to take it back.
---
It was thrilling to engage in pvp with her, and after I scrapped the items I built (except for some turrets because we were trying to be quick), killing the other player's avatar a few times (they eventually brought a level 200-something to help and my partner killed that avatar to her surprise), we logged out and talked about how exciting that was. We're both a bit keen now on trying survival because it gives us something else new to experience. 
---
So, that's why I play: to play with a friend and experience the same game, making my time and investment much more worthwhile. I don't mind belaboring this point about success happening in PA settings because you work together with other people not against them, because it happens in the virtual world too. We get altruistic good feelies dropping plans, aid, ammo for other players, dashing in to help kill an enemy. We feel intense success killing the SBQ or Sassquatch impersonator, just as much as killing a scorchbeast with just the two of us. We help eachother succeed quests, even when they're on opposite sides of the map (also assuming the game doesn't bug out). Imo, F76 is best played with at least another person, if not a group, who makes the grind time go a lot better, a lot faster, and who will celebrate small successes with you like finding six hardened masses.
---
Tl;dr: Playing with a friend or group of friends is by far the best experience of the game. If you're playing solo you're missing out on some great co-op experiences.
---
The best use of "pics or it didn't happen"
---
Yeah, I'm only missing Cranberry Moonshine for weeks now. It's getting quite frustrating
---
I can kill ‚Äòem solo, but not guard the Brahman too.
---
[](/kcelestialaugh)Wait, Fireproof works on the scorchbeast screech attack?!? This is the best news I've ever received.
---
Wait, you bought BE weapons with caps? Are you perhaps trying to get rid of one of those?
---
I'd just like to add I've met some great people in this game. But some of you are the kind of human beings that make this world a bad place sometimes.
---
On the other hand, the rewards from claiming and defending a workshop are pretty good. If they make balance changes to workshops I'm sure that it would include reducing rewards for defend and retake events.
---
Just wait for it to land and one-shot it with your melee weapon, you don‚Äôt need to waste stash space and perks and ammo just for sb which drops zero good loot anyways
---
It's considered an explosive attack. Once I started regularly doing scorchbeast and SBQ hunting, this was the happiest revelation of the game. 
---
Makes that walk from Watoga a lot friendlier.
---
Make some friends. it truly isn't hard. Hunter hunted is very easy, go around the map, sneak vats crit in the head with any weapon and you win
---
the only real important stuff thas happen are
---
we now have a camera
---
the sheepsquatch is in game
---
and 2 of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse power armor skin are out
---
The only thing I ever used workshops for was the events. I have no reson to cap on on my high level characters but on my low level ones I risk being hunted by high levels lol
---
ugh, that's severe. I don't think even the Japanese had to deal with repercussions like that at the end of WW2 ;)
---
we'll just have to agree to disagree then :) but many thanks for a civil discussion üëç
---
Plans, weapons and outfits I don‚Äôt have. I‚Äôm gonna be selling and extra stuff or other things I don‚Äôt need or want. Hopefully I can sell ammo too. Catch me at whitesprings on Xbox!
---
Yeah, I'm putting the caps away for when that hits. Still doubt I could afford it. PS4, anyways. I appreciate the offer, though.
---
I had this last week trying to enter MedTek, I did a hard reset on my XB1 a few times and it did nothing, tried again last night and it started to work properly ü§î
---
Try again in a couple of days mate, sorry I don't have a step by step to get it working
---
Almost level 250 here and i've found only one explosive weapon (a .44) so far. RNG is a b\*\*ch sometimes...
---
Well, it‚Äôs the only receiver to upgrade the single action revolver with and it does quite a bit more damage on that gun. Probably less useful on others.
---
Best thing to do is stay in one location, preferably old Fred‚Äôs bbq or the southern belle hotel, and server hop til you land on the event. Once it‚Äôs started, don‚Äôt herd the Brahmin, just start sending team invites to any and all available players. Even if people don‚Äôt join your team, some looks on the map to see what‚Äôs going on near you and join when they get a chance. I usually always have 3-5+ people by the time we get to the yao guai
---
As long as it doesnt jump of my plate and burrows into the ground before I can eat it.

What kind of plebbit hive minded attitude is that? Freedom of speech exists where I‚Äôm from, am I not allowed to comment against popular opinion on the one of many echo chambers?
---
The problem aint the flowers, its the other mats you need to make pure flux. And 200+ / 100+ i call bs my friend :)
---
Not trying to change it for you. Just pointing out the fact that if you can't even remember how many acts are in the game of course you'd not remember the story.
---
Those people didn‚Äôt have the ability to resplendent.
---
Have you died once in this game?
---
If so, the wasteland was just as dangerous for you as it was for them at a point.
---
They just didn‚Äôt get to come back to life and find better weapons and armor
---
So much this!
---
Or at least make Master or Expert Level only use 1 card
---
Well I‚Äôm just feeling a bad vibe from you that‚Äôs all and it‚Äôs not just me.
---
Where do I go to start the sheepsquatch stuff?
---
It's reasonable. The primary complaint/excuse is that people follow others around griefing. If that's the case, then the consequences of a single death should be fine. 
---
If that's not the case, the entire premise is destroyed and the argument that surrender should be an option is meaningless. After all, if no one is attacking you and you want to give up a workshop, you just need to switch servers.
---
Good thing I scrapped mine for the atom challenge.

Had yet to see one myself, until another player alerted me to one for the purpose of this challenge. It was just slightly southeast of Gulper Lagoon, in the Mire.

I'd like to see what you've come up with. Always good to have inspiration!
---
‚ÄúOriginally created before the Great War by the government and the military to supplement human troops in battle, deathclaws were derived from mixed animal stock, primarily from the very common Jackson Chameleon. They were then soon to be refined by the Master, by using genetic manipulation and the Forced Evolutionary Virus to enhance them as one of his minions. The resulting creature is incredibly fast, powerful with its sharp claws, and almost intelligent.
---
Despite their apparent origin with the Master, deathclaws were a relatively common sight in 2102 Appalachia.‚Äù
---
Sauce: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Deathclaw
---
It wasn‚Äôt the Enclave that made them OP, but the Master from Fallout 1. Even still, it‚Äôs hard to imagine that the Master saw any potential in Deathclaws in their current state. 
---
I appreciate your attention to detail in lore!
---
Daily quests are bugged and have been since launch. I have not been able to repeat Queen of the Hunt for the last 6 months along with 90% of the other dailies.
---
They need to be close enough to get a shot that registers on the camera first, with their name popping up. I'm not sure if you can use one you summon yourself, but the cargobot that ends the Collision Course event always works for me. Just wait to take the shot until it's dropping the cargo.
---
From what I know X-01 and scout plans dont exist, you only can purchase mods from the enclave.
---
You died to me while I was in PA LOL. The fact you couldn't kill me while I am wearing power armor means you're bad.

I play with a handful of people, and not one of us has more than allowed number of accounts, except for one who uses his friends xbox account to store weapons/armor on. Not once have I heard of anyone, since beta, that would need 15 mules LOL. Guess none of those accounts have any aid, since you're so afraid of Survival.
---
No one is saving they should be able to "escape the consequences" of owning a workshop. I am saying that having the ability to contest a workshop over and over without actually taking it is bad design, especially since it allows you to repeatedly attack the person who owns it. The only time you've even come close to addressing it is by saying it costs caps, so what's the problem. That asinine reasoning has already been shot down. Come back when you have a valid reason why you should be able to contest a workshop multiple times without taking it.
---
The subreddit has numerous of these posts because it's happened to numerous people, numerous times. Don't bother replying back until you can provide a valid reason someone should be able to repeatedly contest a workshop without having to actually take it. Anything else you say is likely more BS (15 mules LOL!!!!)
---
*cries in melee*
---
Yeah, and that's why I said that I haven't even heard anyone talking about anything like that.
---
Hahaha. Worst thing is you turn around and they dissapear into the ground again.
---
They need to make huge actual GAMEPLAY changes rather than just adding content. 
---
They need to change the way rare gear is earned. 
---
They need to revamp the legendary system. 
---
They need to make combat interesting. 
---
They might as well drop PVP because it is probably the worst attempt at PVP I've played in years. It is insulting as someone who loves so many PVP games
---
They need to add activities other than killing things. Fishing, hunting evasive wildlife, crafting that feels worthwhile (why bother making a collection of rare and complex meals when they just spoil -_-)I don't know what exactly, but I do know that the only thing I find myself doing in this game is going to the same 5-8 places looking for enemies a high enough level to kill in order to be any fun/get any good loot.
---
They need to create high level or hardcore servers where enemies are just ridiculously hard. People like challenge, but people don't want to have to handicap themselves in order to get that challenge. I shouldn't resort to using a crossbow out of sheer boredom simply because the game is way too easy. I should have a great enough challenge surviving the wasteland that I am motivated to tweak and perfect my build just to survive.
---
They should have reset servers where everyone starts new after they make some balancing changes. The game has been greatly improved in the last few months. Let us experience the way it should have been experienced.
---
Many more legendary effects. Shake up the meta! 
---
The Burrows, Sheepsquatch, the imposter were all FANTASTIC content drops. But let's not forget to spice up nukes too! Nukes were very well designed and can still be fun with a few changes. Add regional bosses that have unique drops. Create faction events that involve teams trying to Nuke each other. 
---
I ask for too much, I know, but I want the game to be more because I love it and have faith in Bethesda (although it is fading)
---
Yup, none are really for sale, because the be gauss just sold for 25k
---
I have done that many times
---
Thanks. I'll try that. 
---
I've always been getting as close to them as I could get but nothing worked for me.
---
Take one of the workshops that has the vertibot pad, grafton steel, Poseidon power. Repair and take a shot of it head on from the front.
---
The what?
---
Bro, you have literally 5 times the amount of hours in this game as me.
---
If I get 10 solid hours of fun out of a $60 game I'm happy.
---
I find myself by the whole "He's 200 levels higher than me" posts. I like to take my level 100 out for a spin to PVP over my 250 because I have just as much chance to kill someone with a lot less cap loss.
---
Exactly what happened. I could hear them and I kept getting damaged, turn and they all blink out of existence.
---
I've covered every quest and side quest in the game taking my time and short of being too low level twice I ended up doing all the quests in about 15 hours of taking my time. I know MaTN had the same issue if you watch his play through where he gets hyped up exploring somewhere expecting some bit of lore and there being nothing.
---
An event timer on the map screen and proper notifications, possible to toggle in the pipboy would be the best. I assume you want a server wide emote to call attention to players about events?
---
And the sheepsquatch imposter too, it goes invisible every time it dies and gets swarmed by exploding eyebots, so people shoot them and send the invisible corpse flying and you have to spend an eon looking around for it while everyone is going ??? the whole time.
---
Stealth builds have got to be the most boring by far, I think that's why most avoid them. It just isn't fun.
---
there is a new event called free range the event usually trigger at big fred's BBQ shack
---
Okay, I'll post them tomorrow then. I'll PM you. üëç
---
I‚Äôve been having more luck avoiding pvp in workshops by absolutely filling it with clutter. I use every free bit of scrap, throw down 20 turrets, 100 fences just thrown down randomly, a siren going 24/7, Punjabi boards and beds thrown all over the floor, dozens of signs on posts and more.... it‚Äôs a nightmare to move thru and when you peek into the workshop you‚Äôve got to think ‚Äúholy ****, what in the world is all this mess?!‚Äù Not sure how many caps to takes to contest a workshop filled to the brim but you‚Äôve got to have second thoughts standing there looking at the chaos.
---
I understand where you are coming from. There is a need for some balance to things like sentinel and cavalier. Small changes maybe 5% damage reduction instead of 15%. However, with the right build sentinel is not that big of a problem. Now what you are saying right here about dedicating a couple days to making a good PVP character. If it is that easy and "griefing" is such a problem why don't you make one of these builds?
---
This came up before - go to a workshop that has a vertibot, take it over and repair the landing pad (takes 30 aluminum). A vertibot will appear and you can take a picture of it.
---
Confirmed that it works for the one at Grafton Steel Mill.
---
Next week - Buy atoms in the store! Reward: 10 atoms
---
Honestly. Even with a fat man, it usually ends one way.
---
Right because only a handful of people know of its existence and aren't going to release it publicly because that would end up getting it patched.
---
Lol that sounds interesting
---
That makes a lot of sense for sure. I love open world sandbox games, I have 1300 hours in Fallout 4 and 800 in Dying Light and Shadow of series. Issue is 76 is too open, there is often nothing to do, either too low level or the area you are in is just empty. Normally NPCs fill these holes so they are not so apparent, 76 it just has the holes still. I tried 4 times to 30th level to make my own fun, I just could not, been gaming for 35+ years, 76 has been one of the only games that I have just walked away from, Dragon Age Inquisition being another, it was too full for an open world sandbox. It will stay unfinished, I just can not get into it, even with 1000 hours in the other 2.
---
Crickets will chase you to the ends of the Earth too, but at least they can't teleport up to rooftops.
---
There are 4 sidequests in the taxidermy place in lewisburg. 
---
There are two other side quests as well but I cant recall where they started. Someone will jump in here. 
---
The free range event with the real sheepsquatch can be triggered at Groves Family cabin in the north west of the map (low level), the BBQ shack in the savage divide area (mid level) and at Southern Bell Motel in the mire for the highest difficulty one.
---
There‚Äôs an event called ‚Äúfree range‚Äù I believe and you end up fighting them or you can find them naturally around the world mostly cranberry bog; and there‚Äôs a poster that starts a related quest line at most train stations
---
F fixing it. How do I get mine to have that many shots?  :-)
---
Yep ... I guarandamnteee that I NEVER carry "Junkie" weapons ... but get them ALL the damn time.
---
That shotgun Nerf is going to hurt this statement bad.
---
Got the taxidermy stuff done, was hoping there were more mounts available though
---
I've been doing it there but it hasn't been working for me. I guess I just gotta try all angles.
---
They used a badly implemented teleport mechanic, it's not even bound by the overpowered Blitz rules that the 76 Devs left out because they knew teleporting was OP.
---
There IS a mole rat costume...I'm wearing it (sorry, I'll get a pic later).
---
Sadly, mole rats hit me ALL the time so no immunity.
---
Yeah thats where I made my camp already. It was a pretty good idea since its got a lot of water and space for crops.
---
Also make sure the name of the robot shows up at the upper right.
---
I‚Äôm not all that bad lol, I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way.
---
Somebody lured them to the robot parade once, it was interesting.
---
And you dont have as many people running from the meer sight of you.
---
Oooooh. So to understand correct, scrapping scout armor doesn‚Äôt give me mods like when I‚Äôm scrapping leather or metal armor?
---
Which is why I also said no one's even referencing it to begin with.
---
I've been doing that but I've been trying to take the picture from the side, not the front.
---
The truth is i am not really having a melee build its just a mix match of perks that is decent so i need at least a regular two shot 50. Cal
---
That and saying hi to people I know across the map. :p
---
Ah, the Diahhoris Borealis.
---
You were forunate to spot it and not get caught outdoors!
---
Theres 5 out now but I think theyll probably drop the others with the pioneer scouts drop. Kinda makes sense since its centered around earning ranks for the scouts. You'll probably have to kill the specific beats as a daily or something to get the plan drops... all purely speculating here.
---
I tried that. Got bored real quick. The settlements feel dead AF. None of the settlers talk to each other, they all bundle up like penguins in the snow despite having a huge living space, the survival mode is so poorly designed that you can kill everything in the wasteland and it takes like 60 in game days for everything to respawn so that entire time there is almost nothing to fight (some areas respawn regardless of this rule). Also, from the very start I felt like Boston has absolutely no charm as a setting. I always disliked it, despite beating the game multiple times
---
Yeah, I have no content left to play but I used to make sure to log in and do daily challenges. But they‚Äôve gotten so ridiculous lately that I haven‚Äôt even logged on in three days now.
---
Oh okay your talking about enemy's not players got it thanks for the info wont be makeing a new character then lol.
---
That's what I've been trying to do. I guess I'll just have to keep at it. I thought this would have been a low effort atom challenge, but I've put too much time into it.
---
Calling others out on their "hive minded attitude" while participating in the negative circle jerk without having played the game yourself is quite tricky you know...
---
Why is it so unbelievable that I took 10 minutes to create some mule accounts? My Xbox is right next to my kid's, so muling takes a few minutes. It's pretty convenient to have a mule for everything since I am a bit of a hoarder.
---
Also, nothing I have said has been "shot down." You've simply ranted and continued to rant. You should be able to attack workshops repeatedly because if the timer runs out on a capture, you fail and have every right to try again (even if you let it "fail). Anytime ANYONE owns a workshop, they remain open to attack while they have it. It's in the little confirmation box you tap every time you attempt to take one. If the workshop owner is truly bothered, a quick server hop fixes everything.
---
Oh, yeah, since you're so sure you've killed me (no idea why this is important to you, but let's explore it) and that you're so bad that dying to you makes me bad...what weapon was I using and what was the name of your friend who messaged me? I've died once this past week to someone wearing power armor. It was this morning when someone finished me off after I killed his friends.
---
*Laughs in Enforcer on top of thousands of broken Deathclaw kneecaps.*
---
Roaming, farming And events. Mainly farming. Well, just farming.
---
You did when you claimed there were no dupes
---
My body is ready
---
I Mean I've Made new characters so I can level with the lower level Legos I got lol
---
They could add Deathclaw Mothers, give them as much health as Mirelurk Qween's and higher damage.
---
I've more or less disproved that theory completely, it's an observational bias thing, they stand out because you already have them, unless your on a "bloodied seed"..  
---
Only real way to see trends is to do 3 - 6 hours of legendary grinding on one server, tracking every single drop in a spreadsheet, nuked zones of course speed this up..  
---
Once you have 350-500'ish drops server hop and repeat two more times (or over different days)..  
---
Generally the patterns start popping up then.
---
This is also true. Honestly, it's been about the same since level 55ish. Same chance to kill someone, lower risk.
---
What? What does that have to do with talking about a current supposed duping glitch?
---
Talking like that is why nobody likes you.
---
How the hell things like this don't get noticed always amazes me. It even makes the same noise as when Fallout 4 would crash. Goes with the territory I suppose.
---
On PC it's just tapping the # key for your favorites.
---
Don‚Äôt know why the sensor box is so small on this one. I‚Äôve walked up to destroyed robots, taken a picture and it registered - why not a downed cargobot?
---
Or get a shotgun with enforcer perks and force it to land.
---
..on a slightly different track, but I'd like to get your opinion. Say I was building the Excavator armor and needed black titanium. I'd love to claim a workshop, get what resources I desire, then relinquish my claim. I know I could just server hop, but there are people, like me, who like to maintain the continuity of the present world, if possible. It's just role playing.
---
Would you be ok with un-claiming a workshop voluntarily if it was outside of PvP?
---
Do I have to complete the event to get the staff or is it just in random places ?
---
same here bud all the mire dailies have been bugged for me months
---
Yea roll of the dice of what he carries lol
---
You would have to make 5 additional gamer tags, then go through setting up each mule account and leave vault 76. Takes much longer than 10 minutes. But please, continue spewing BS.
---
"If the timer runs out on a capture, you fail". Except the timer doesn't run out, the person leaves the contested area while their friend kills you. Rinse, repeat. That is flawed design. 
---
The fact that you are stating a workshop owner has to leave the world to "fix" an issue of being griefed over and over is you conceding that the current system is broken. Good job! Please pat yourself on the back.
---
As for killing you. Do you suffer from reading comprehension issues? As mentioned previously, this was shortly after Survival came out. Reading is hard, I know.
---
But LOL, you died to someone else wearing power armor. Please, just uninstall. It's clear you're bad at this game.
---
I've got 2 character past 50 without seeing any two shot period.
---
Yep. Emoting with the camera will make you fly
---
i mean...its basically a rug on a wall right?  doesn't seem too technically challenging. not when creating a consumer rpg anyways.
---
I'd be fine with it if no other players were in the general area to prevent someone dropping the workshop when they see someone approaching. But you can get black titanium faster killing mole miners and stuff.
---
I grew up in the late 70's-80's when Adrienne Barbeau (The Overseer) was at hear peak popularity and she was one of my first celebrity crushes. So hopefully we get  a boob shot at some point...
---
When is camp decorating coming, if we can sell place able junk I'll be after all the comrade chubs I can find.
---
Did you check your perk cards?
---
If only there was a picture of a roadmap somewhere that answered this question...
---
You don't need a god roll to kill scorchbeasts lmao. 
---
Just use the right perks for your build.
---
I don't understand why we needed burrowing molerats in the first place, they're just awful enemies.
---
Good to know! Thanks
---
I did this by jet packing into a vertabot in Watoga. You have to be ridiculously close to its center of mass for it to register.
---
Xbox, sorry!
---
I agree that‚Äôs a bitch ass move.
---
I'd have given more than 25k
---
The subjective nature of what constitutes 'dumb' is irrelevant. I can't believe you're so quick to be okay with false advertising because, why exactly? Is it just 'fuck the rich'?
---
But he just is a responder bot..I don't  have the option to trade .
---
He isn't a vendor. I reckon I'm missing something. I do all the right things to get him to spawn.. but  when he shows up with his eyebot all I can do is ...nothing ?
---
My town got hit by a tornado a few years back that killed 150+, and destroyed a third of our 50,000 pop. city. 
---
It's pretty accurate.
---
11 serums? I honestly have JUST figured out what kind of build I‚Äôm after (very late in my game lol) and I still am not sure the best strategy to use them so I am just holding onto them for now
---
u/phr3k he *literally* was by mobs of people who planned to start up slander rallies in his comments
---
What system?
---
Honestly it depends on what I fancy that day. Level 125 and still finding plenty to do. 
---
Also someone mentioned farming and yes, sooooo much farming!
---
Ugh. What a bunch of shit. Any time people have the chance they fuck things up. I am also high lvl and haven‚Äôt found a TSE yet but I‚Äôve never had any interest in duping or buying duped items.
---
I currently server hopping at Lady Janets searching for that bot haha. Will be posting on here if he spawns (Xbox)
---
There are two different ones. You have to get the one that‚Äôs usually at Charleston train station by the little red shed. He comes with a packed Brahmin and like two eye robots.
---
Yeah, somewhere along the line, they changed what "Gather Wood" means, even in Adventure mode.
---
It really doesn't take long to leave the vault. Perhaps "10 minutes" -- intended to indicate that it doesn't take much time at all and clearly not intended to be taken literally -- was a bit low, but it's not pretend that an account takes much time at all to set up or that we spend a lot of time in the vault.
---
And if someone wants to attack you while their friend contests a workshop, that's on them. If you want to let them, that's on you. You could leave the server. This goes back to my point that you agree to be open to PVP when you take a workshop.
---
You're right. The fact that you somehow remembered a random person you killed at an unspecified time following the release of survival and connected him to a completely different Reddit username you totally didn't just find through a search of his posts somehow got lost in the rest of your nonsensical ramblings.
---
Once again, killing someone who has a workshop is not griefing, but if you are unhappy with the consequences of workshop ownership, you can of course leave the server or choose not to take a workshop.
---
My heavy build. Not optimized, but shouldn't HAVE to be. I focus on crippling and minion control.
---
Seriously. If you have been playing since release and have over 900 hours in then you have been playing more than 40 hours a week.
---
There's a spreadsheet a dataminer compiled a while back, listing which can be learned from scrapping, and what can't.
---
Open world pvp, no seperate pvp mode, no safe zones ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Blame the game, not the player.
---
Right?
---
I like playing 76 just like fo4, NV or fo3. (As much as possible) 
---
Just now with a friend or 2. Mostly alone tho. 
---
I‚Äôm still walking around the wasteland just exploring, doing some quests, crafting some cool gear and building an immersive survival camp
---
And just really getting into the apocalyptic vibe of fallout. 
---
I rarely join events except when I‚Äôm walking past them. 
---
Ain‚Äôt much into getting all the best gear right away as I think I will earn it when I deserve it. 
---
Even tho I‚Äôm always helping new players in anyway I can (plans, gear, weapons and whatever), I mostly stay to myself, just thinking that This is ‚Äòjust‚Äô another regular fallout game XD
---
You could swap from commando to rifleman, and mod the handmade to the non automatic hardened receiver. This way both thomas the railway rifle and the tse would get the full benefit of 9 ranks worth of your primary weapon damage perks.  
---
Just a thought, though nm about all of this if railway rifles are "heavy weapons".
---
&gt; Alternatively, you can also buy ATOMS *anytime you want* from the ATOM Shop ! 
---
You say that, but you might be surprised how often the "Atom Service" is off-line.
---
Thank you.
---
Ty.
---
The 10% is the same as mutants (if mutated) but only applies to players. It's really not that great of an effect. AA blows it out of the water
---
Just because someone can don‚Äôt mean they have to. And by making the voice of doing something is a dick move. No matter any way you want to spin it.
---
That sounds so extra just to take a picture of a robot to get atoms.
---
Look at the screencaps again, and find the answer to your question yourself.
---
I kind of have a rooftop garden. My CAMP is just south of Morgantown Train Yard under that red railroad bridge. My garden is up top in the dirt and gravel area right before the bridge. I‚Äôll have to compile a photo tour after I have my vendor area set up.
---
they're better than regular weapons. that's about it.
---
ts also gets an accuracy penalty.
---
Oh lawd
---
It also repairs them to 200%.  It is a card you equip only when you repair weapons.  For armor use the "Fix it Good" card for 200% repairs.  You do get a small kicker in strength / power when the item is in an "over repair" state.
---
Yeah, I thought this challenge would have taken me 20 minutes max, but I've spent most the time I've been playing this week just to take a stupid picture.
---
My process hasn‚Äôt let me down yet, the one time I relented cost me 60 dollars. I look at both sides too, which is the main reason I follow this page, and with every post being a bug, a suggestion or frustration, I‚Äôm not missing anything.
---
Sent a request.
---
It was the last one I needed. I tend to be a completionist for any challenge not PvP related. ;)
---
Hopefully the legendary vendor will help with this too, along with bringing down the cost of items traded amongst the community, fingers crossed.
---
The people who harass you in adventure mode by following you and punching you non stop and as soon as you retaliate they reveal they have marsupial and a TSE shotgun are also the worst
---
xbox pc or ps4?     When I get that trouble on xbox one the solutio is to go back to xbox home, get game highlighted, xbox button, quit application.  Then usually it work when loggin back in the game
---
Are you still playing FO76 and are you still willing to sell serums for around 250 caps?
---
As far as I know it does not.
---
Had to leave the game, but i found him a bit north of lumber mill up on the rocks. Good luck.
---
lmao
---
you actually bought those? before or after the TSE craze? because nobody sells BE anymore.
---
MDTA... lol
---
oh I totally forgot to say! its PS4
---
Holy crap! Glad you‚Äôre ok and hope all are well!
---
Because if there is no mechanism to contest a workshop, then it is first-come first-served.  There ought to be ways for others to fight for a scarce resource.  Although I do not think workshop pvp should extend much beyond the borders of the workshop itself.   And I do not think camps should be destructible in Adventure ever (unless they‚Äôre behind the Whitesprings Golf Club ).
---
Doesn't really matter, for someone who is constantly going about facts, don't post falsehoods. Pretty damn simple if you ask me.
---
You are open to PvP when you take the workshop. Sure, nothing wrong with that. No one is arguing that there is anything wrong with that. Everyone is saying that the ability to contest a workshop over and over to get kills is what is broken. Are you that bad at reading?
---
"You could leave the server". You could do with some common sense. 
---
Killing someone once to take over their workshop is not griefing. Killing someone over and over by contesting their workshop and not actually taking it is griefing. Plain and simple.  
---
There's nothing wrong with killing someone with owning a workshop. There is definitely something wrong with a game mechanic that allows you to repeatedly kill a person who owns a workshop without having to actually take over that workshop. Once it's contested, sure they can kill you. But at that point you should either no longer own the workshop (which should leave it in a contested state), or the person who contested it should be forced to take it over, even if they leave the contested circle.
---
Big oof. If i didnt hate railways, I would have kept it
---
Absolutely agree, just the other day i was randomly killed in my camp near the top of the world while in my pip boy because i owned silva homestead, literally half the map away.  
---
I saw the guys doing that around the map to everyone who owned a workshop
---
I got it on PS4 after maybe 4 server hops. Cost me like 900 caps but was worth it
---
I mean, if you're playing survival, then what did you expect?
---
other than that, just don't shoot back.
---
You also have to take in account for things he kills and you accidentally don‚Äôt. Also if one has group xp but isn‚Äôt sharing, that can happen too. I‚Äôve also seen where shared quests don‚Äôt actually share. So the party leader might get more xp than the other.
---
.nice.
---
Is your intelligence higher level than hers?
---
Yep.   If its two shot, its garbage affixes (if any).  If it's Explosive, it's a junkie, or nocturnal .... One Instigating Gat Explosive (which I used to be all the rage over, but am now a bit miffed by, with its fire rate .... seems slower every patch).
---
Killing certain amount of enemy‚Äôs change how much exp you guys are getting
---
Nice!!
---
TSEs are hardly a god roll anymore
---
Thanks! üëçüèª
---
I think explosivs are really rare. I'm now lvl 130 and the only explosiv i found is my gatling gun. At least it's a good one.^^
---
Would be cool, and make a lot of sense, if the bonus to assassins acted like bloody mess, after all other bonuses are applied.
---
It is kinda impossible to test this out though.
---
dont sell any legendaries right now they are adding a machine to train stations next patch that breaks down legendaries into a currency the new vendor will use when she is added later in the month
---
Why so the players that hide in the bunker can get the rewards that they "earn" from their hard work cowering in the dark.
---
Im on about 20 resets at this point.
---
What location were you trying?
---
Yeah I can help with that. Add me, my psn is same as my username here. I‚Äôll give you some plans for free as well, I‚Äôve got way too many of some duplicates
---
I am but there was a casualty of 12 and a lot of property damage.
---
.50 cal works but a shotgun + enforcer also works. shoot at its wings and wait for it to land. then just whack at it.
---
also don't forget dense mod for your armor. it stacks with fireproof. and grounded if you don't use energy weapons, screech is explosive + energy.
---
There's no rules against it so your perspective of what's a dick move and what isn't doesn't matter. It's intendet to be this way.
---
Don't like the rules? Play milkdri.... adventure mode.
---
Diarrhea Borealis!?
---
At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localised entirely within your skybox!?
---
Plasma grenades are so good
---
Bloodied, hmm perhaps. I don't have bloodied but I'm pretty sure it drops for me more often, than for example stalkers. In fact I think it's been a while since I've seen stalkers. Bloodied isn't super common though, but I have a heckload of them as I've found quite a few on vendors too.
---
And both first effects and should be generally(as in theory) equal, as both can be in gun or melee. But that doesn't mean they would be equal since Bethesda desides the odds.
---
I don't really think there is any reason for any more complicated rules, regarding drops. See, the game has so many different legendary effects, and since each has it's own slot it can occupy. I think we all agree that the drops are highly RNG, right? So if there is any more complicated system, then it's effect is subtle enough that we agree on the high randomness of things. So why have that effect in first place?
---
I'm currently level 200-something and so far I havent't found a single decent level 50-weapon.
---
Congrats with your finds though!
---
thank you!
---
The pip boy menu only displays 1, no matter how many you collect. I assumed because of that we could only carry 1 at a time
---
Helped a lot. Thanks!
---
The simple solution I've heard before would be that when someone attempts to take a workshop from you, something should pop on screen giving the option to fight(defend) or hand it over(relinquish). Simple as that. In adventure mode I should not be forced to do pvp. 
---
If people want guaranteed pvp, then go to survival. Because I'm sure there are many like me that want to play, explore, do events etc. without the stupid shit that comes along with pvp. Just my my opinion.
---
Because now that there is a survival mode where pvp is open right out of the box, there is no need for any of it to be in adventure mode. Getting rid of the camp damage is a great start as is greatly reducing slap damage. 
---
Pvp is one of those rare things (in this game anyway) where you can make two different groups of players happy. Pvp in survival and optional/no pvp in adventure.
---
i use them with starched genes and class freak perks, that takes 5 points in luck.
---
Me too. That's why this challenge is annoying. The last robots I need to take a picture of aren't registering on the camera. I might have to get the jetpack mod for my T-60 and use the same tactic as you.
---
Hopefully this will work for you guys but everytime I do Forbidden Knowledge and I fast travel to Camp Venture, the Queen of the hunt daily starts up.
---
Go checkout the various trading reddits, but it's a rare plan, and people seem to be willing to pay a lot/offer up really good trades for it.
---
This is purely anecdotal, but I feel like I've seen quite a few people with it for trade, which makes me wonder if there has been an uptick in the spawn rate for it. If that is the case, the worth of the plan will likely see a decrease in value.
---
260? Wish me and my friends made it that far, when we all hit 100 we were able to 1 to 2 shot most mobs and things became easy and boring
---
Then we played on PVP servers and ganked everyone in sight and had a blast :P Best thing to do when you run out of things IMO
---
I've addressed these badly-made points several times. If you own a workshop, you agree to be open to PVP. Period. This includes at your CAMP, at Whitespring, on the moon, whatever. It's why I take precautions while I am workshopping. I actually read the dialogue box and understand/accept the risks.
---
If you feel someone is "griefing" you, you have a lot of options: You can block them. You can leave the server. You can adjust your behavior in the future and not take workshops if you find the risks unacceptable.
---
Pretty simple, really.
---
It didn‚Äôt flag me for unlocking the trailer. It did flag me for touching giddyup out in the open.
---
Negative. She even was the one to pick the perk card that gives 5% more XP when in a group.
---
RNG isn't earning it.
---
Could you elaborate on that, please?
---
Who the fuck are you again. Ok yeah some internet no name excuse maker for people taking advantage of a broken system. You‚Äôre probably one of those idiots waiting for a spawn.
---
Seeded RNG I wouldn't doubt.  They already have and hold the players that have been going from the beginning ... enticing newer players to stay .... that's what gambling systems are all about.
---
I agree
---
Yeah, sorry if I was unclear, I didn‚Äôt get flagged for anything listed above besides grabbing giddyup.
---
Oh it doesn't give the effect to just players either, it gives the effect at everything in the area, players, enemies, robots, squirrels, etc. This not only causes lag but game crashes for many.
---
Do I have to share the quests manually or is it done automatically? Also, she is the one that has the 5% XP perk when in a group. So I don't get it...
---
Check back this tuesday they said theyll keep us updated then
---
Melee build.  
---
 I take out SBs with an executioners combat rifle.
---
If it lands close enough, I switch to blade of Bastet or cultists dagger, then swap back.
---
Not the fastest method in the realm, but it works
---
I do have fireproof 1.  Glowsight3 helps on occasion.
---
I live in New Jersey near the area that got hit pretty damn hard by Hurricane Sandy. When I went out to see what was left, it was...sobering. Some of it still isn‚Äôt rebuilt yet. Houses now rubble, fallen trees littering the streets, ankle-height water everywhere. Let‚Äôs just say that I wouldn‚Äôt have a hard time picturing what a Fallout game in New Jersey would look like.
---
It should be automatic.
---
Should i use leather armor for the energu damage?
---
And in that case i need a good shotgun
---
Very weird, then. You'd think she'd be the one being ahead of me with that perk. Thanks for your answer.
---
No one is disagreeing with the fact you agree to be open to PVP. Everyone else is stating you shouldn't be able to repeatedly contest a workshop without taking it over.
---
OR 
---
If you own a workshop, then someone contests and kills you, you should no longer own that workshop.
---
No one is arguing that they didn't agree to PvP. Everyone is arguing that taking a workshop shouldn't mean you are open to PvP for the lifetime you are on that server, just because of a bad design of the workshop mechanics.
---
You really have a hard time grasping simple concepts. No wonder you need "15" mules LOL
---
Can you still climb walls with the RR?
---
I have one I'd part with. What do you have to trade for it?
---
I was across the big metal bridge on the other side of Charleston Station (the side closer to Charleston proper)
---
When I‚Äôd served hop it‚Äôd put me near the train tracks and I‚Äôd go back towards the Station and he popped up by the Pulowski tube there
---
Go back to the 70's- 80's with that misogynistic bullshit.
---
Thx
---
Not really sure what are you after?
---
Get out of here. Wasting our time. Use google.
---
Why not just play it, it‚Äôs really not all the bad now
---
Take a picture of an alien with a 105mm lens while wearing a tinfoil hat. Oh, and that wasn‚Äôt me exaggerating, that‚Äôs today‚Äôs 20 atom challenge. I haven‚Äôt even seen an alien in my 414 hours of playing.
---
I have adrenal reaction and twisted muscles serums for you if you want them.
---
Okay here: Jeff kills 4 enemys 
---
Bob kills 8 enemy‚Äôs 
---
Bob gets more xp,
---
Tada
---
I hope to reach more people here eventualy :) I got offered a Jumpsuit for it so far, but somebody told me that it is much more rare than the outfits and that only one would be to cheap...... i have no idea......
---
I server hopped 4 hours and got him once. And he didn't have the Hunters coat or Longshore.
---
Doesn't mean you should mesh the idea by force. If you want to kill people there's a mode for that, but killing others for fun at any time shouldn't be integrated into the adventure mode.
---
Give your caps to other players.  Like me.
---
Thanks. I might give this location 5 more tries then move on.
---
they were supposed to be super rare. Ive been here since beta and dont think i have seen anyone specifically mention actually finding a TSE. maybe a few times but even here seeing even the claim is rare.
---
Nah man, i'm one who's seen the issues comming the moment this mode was announced. Of course you're gonna be spawn/trader killed when there's no guard or safezones.. that's one of the games core issues with the lack of NPC's.
---
Stopped playing alltogether a while ago since beth choose to still go with this shit rather then finishing theyr goddamn mess. But hey, you have fun.
---
Don't really have anything specific unless you want to part with 2 or 3 star Unyielding arm. I'm open to whatever though... The Gatling is level 40, Stalkers, Less VATS cost and Explosive.
---
not really. no need to stack leather *just* for SBs. fireproof + dense + grounded mutation if you don't use energy weapons is more than enough. heavy metal/marine/heavy combat are the best armors in the game.
---
any shotgun will do, really. the secret is enforcer, you don't want to actually damage them. whilr airborne, they're too far away for a shotgun to do any real damage. but enforcer don't care, just keep shooting at their wings to cripple them.
---
avoid non-legendary DBs because they can only hold 2 shells.
---
Need them? Nah. But I have been saving for player vending since it was first announced and stuff tends to accumulate. Plus, it's convenient.
---
I grasp your "concepts." I just consider them meaningless because the premise is faulty. When you agree to be open to PVP, that's for the lifetime of your workshop ownership (not the lifetime of your presence on the server as you have said). Seems pretty simple to me.
---
Losing the workshop after a single death as you suggested would be bad design.
---
I don‚Äôt play it either. I just want to see have a fair chance and have fun that‚Äôs all.
---
Where is that revealed that the mole miners are infected with FEV?  I must have missed that.
---
Its only natural to be bored after so much time playing. Take a break - try not to think of the game as a MMO because it surely isnt designed to be one.
---
From the latest Inside the Vault:
---
&gt;The more Legendary Scrip you have when the Purveyor arrives, the more legendary weapons and armor you will be able to buy!
---
When they used the terms 'items', I was still on the fence, but this seems specifically to indicate that the re-roll system isn't in o,ace (or possibly will be in place next to purchasing armor and weapons, but that seems unlikely).
---
There is still enough fuzz, even with that, that there may be something interesting involved, but honestly the way they worded it there pretty much takes away any hope I had that we'll have any customization options for our existing weapons.
---
In the interview linked around here, Todd did say "...you can basically...somewhat customize and roll for the legendary that you want."  I suspect that statement will land back in the big pile of 'things we were told that never happened'.  Even with the weasel words, I don't see how buying from a list of items is in any way customizing, though the word roll could mean a lot of things.
---
I don‚Äôt play it either. I just want to see people have fun and a fair chance. You take care
---
Well... I don't know what I expected. I just thought it would be shared. Thank you, though
---
wish you were on pc
---
Jeeez. Thanks.
---
Also all legendaries that spawn at events. Hate when people don't let other tag, or when i am kitting legendary for more than 30sec and other guy is f***ing blind.
---
If this post is just filling up the space I can at least be happy I said it to y‚Äôall.
---
Sadly don't have any armor like that been getting one star strash recently. How much dmg dose the gataling gun o at level 40. I currently have a two shot gataling  level 50 that dose 197
---
+karma
---
Good to know thanks
---
These [inbred](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Swampfolk) bastards.
---
Homo bears?  Isn't that redundant?
---
I still havent left the vault on beta character but i made a new guy for extra storage and it gave me it
---
Mole rats will follow you longer than scorchbeast. 
---
And I've had a scorchbeast follow me from the northern part of the cranberry blog all the way to Watoga.
---
Eso/gw2/wow keeps everyone happy? Those games seem to be played for long times because they follow an addiction model.
---
With all 3 Heavy Gunner cards and 5 ranks of demolition it hits in the 230-250 area I believe.
---
Better coverage, creates an under glow through to the top floor, allows easy distribution for conduits and power radiators so there aren't wires going everywhere, ect.
---
Don't worry, you kind of just run into people to play with. Also, the game gets a massive update Tuesday, so a lot of people will be on, and possibly making new characters.
---
It really isn't bad, it just gets you page views to say its bad.
---
Yeah man that has happened to me so many times that I just paid Caps for all the outfits and stay away from the event altogether. Not to mention the insane amount of stims is takes to participate in it.
---
The way I see it, the SBQ would be just as dead (or not dead) if those people didn't show up at all.  I don't care if they get rewards.  It has no effect on my experience in the game, and I really doubt it affects my loot table chances at all.
---
Dunno how old you are but thats my experience growing up to 23 y.o
---
Sorry don't answer if you don't know. There is a reason I am asking this; I only find events dating from months ago. If you can't help, don't comment. No need to hate.
---
Losing the workshop to someone who has contested it and killed you is not bad design, it's literally what the developers have stated was the intention and is something that will be fixed in a future patch. Since it requires a server update and client update, it takes more time to test the patch and roll it out.
---
It's no different than attacking someone and becoming wanted. It's good design that you lose your wanted status once you have been killed and someone has claimed that bounty. It would be bad design if you continuously respawned with a wanted status with no way of removing except for leaving the world.
---
15 accounts just for junk, then more accounts to store legendary items. Yep, we ALL believe you. You're just making yourself look even more foolish.
---
Your opinion on this matter is fairly meaningless anyways. The overall consensus is that the workshop design is broken. This is why it will be changed in the future.
---
By all means, continue thinking broken = good.
---
Agreed, we dont need teleporting assholes who ALWAYS come up from behind you. Could be sprinting and they still get you, could be jumping and they can still bite you.
---
I agree if you shoot back you asked for it.
---
fast travel, farm, hop to another server, farm, hop to another server, farm, hop to another server, farm........ And just to get useless 1\* legendaries!!
---
It doesn't run on my pc, even through it should... Crashs my pc because of overhearing.
---
Well TSE is a legacy legendary role now. You either get two-shot OR explosive, not both.
---
No, yeah, it is definitely worth a lot. I suggested going to look at the trading sub reddits so you could see what others are being offered. You'll be likely to get anything you want for it, possibly even a couple of things. I'd dust off your wish list and prioritize it. You could even search for people who have whatever it is you're looking for, and offer it up, rather then waiting to see what people will offer you.
---
Cool sadly I don't thing I have anything you might be interested in like I said only been getting 1 star weapons and armour apart from a level 45 Lazer pistol that has zelot, +50% limb damage and 15% vats refill
---
With my luck I‚Äôd probably find a explosive lead pipe lol
---
I made a second character and still can't complete a few challenges for whatever reason. SOME did end up working on my second character atleast. My main isn't even a beta character either
---
The Inside the Vault specifically said 'weapons and armor', so I'm going to have to conclude that the 'customization' idea is off the table.
---
It doesn't specifically exclude other items/options, but the fact that they made that specific statement seems to indicate that mods/re-rolls, etc. won't be part of it.
---
Yeah, had several times with no spawn points at all..bye bye junk :/
---
&gt;Caps dont mean anything when there are still duped items floating around
---
It's the exact opposite that is true. You could actually buy god-roll weapons for caps back when duping was prevalent. They were in greater supply. After multiple copies of weapons/armor within any one account were deleted, that supply has dried up. Idk if Bethesda was looking for duped serum plans, but if he's selling them at 1-2k each, then probably not. Normally they would sell for 7-8k. I don't like the idea of making dupers rich but it kept prices low (even though there were some a\*\*holes who would charge you 25k for any TSE weapon).
---
It really seems like the enemy design in this thing is just "let's make something annoying" instead of "let's make something challenging"
---
For sure. Maybe a present box if you drop intentionally :)
---
It was, before BIV was added to game. Since then most of challenges are just anoying. When i saw today challenges i just quit game. I could farm SBQs atleast, but there is huuuuge chance to waste 30minutes for bug, noobs, apocalipse make me fail. 
---
Great times when you have to level up once, without stressing how long those drugs will last, nothing specific like drink beer from moon stone and kill sun,..... 
---
"Kill 5 dogs" best content that was ever in FO76.
---
glad to see they are on the move to fix it :(
---
Would having  high level luck have anything to do with finding legendary items and weapons?
---
Oh jeez, the. I have no clue, 
---
 where‚Äôd you get the game from?
---
What does ‚Äúhate‚Äù mean to you?
---
Before you answer, your answer is incorrect.
---
Thanks
---
Yes. They did happen. And everything he reports is how it happened.
---
I don't think an onslaught of slap damage could kill a passive player unless you're a bloodied build or something to that effect.
---
Why? I love bounty baiters, just the other day I made 2k caps off a full team of them.
---
The scrub pvp‚Äôers left in adventure aren‚Äôt anything to worry about.
---
And 90% of the time they pop a stealthboy, because they are trash without it, thing is they are pretty trash with it, I‚Äôve killed tons of these stealth bitches with a 1 star auto bloodied tesla, all I have to do it auto fire it at the ground and the chain effects wreck them, it‚Äôs pretty hilarious.
---
Did I say slap damage. I meant TSE. Don‚Äôt put words in my mouth asshole.
---
Well, you do know that you can get rid of that by simply waiting 30 seconds... They'll emerge and you can take care of the issue. All you need to do is stand still 30 seconds
---
This would be a question for the retailer where you purchased the game. Bethesda or users here cannot answer, sorry
---
Whats a game scene
---
15 mules (not accounts), with the potential for 30 (5 per account, 3 accounts in use, 3 more I haven't used much). You're just as bad at math as you are at the rest of this. It was two mules until the first carry weight change forced me to spread things out. Not exactly hard to understand or believe. I know plenty of people who have a healthy amount of mules, though you need a second Xbox to really pull it off.
---
Workshops are lost when the capture bar fills. Your "wanted" analogy is, like everything else you say, faulty. Different scenario, different mechanics. Here, I'll fix it for you: "It would be like if someone captured the workshop, but you still retained ownership and could continue being killed." See? Doesn't work.
---
Furthermore, your idea that the consensus is that workshop design is faulty...is faulty. People with negative opinions are more likely to express them. This is a fact. You're seeing an echo chamber and failing to realize what it is.
---
Most people probably heard something about it and said to themselves 'Hmm, yeah makes sense' and moved on.  It's not a big enough blip on anyone's radar to make a big deal about it (unless you were specifically affected, which 99% of people weren't).
---
I remember hearing something like that a while back, whether it was that pass or an earlier one I can't remember.
---
Thanks for the answer still
---
You need to go up on the roof, there‚Äôs a black hatched metal roof hatch that has a picklock on it next to the porta cabin thing just across the bridge that runs between the roofs, a successful pick lock of this hatch will load you into that room which randomly spawns either empty bottles, nuka quantum or a cap stash
---
Actually if you‚Äôre getting spawn camped I hate to say it but you must kind of suck.
---
The way spawn invulnerability is set up now, if you spawn in at a spawn point you are at the advantage for 10 seconds, because for 10 seconds no one can hurt you until that time is up or until you fire your weapon, allowing you the opportunity to quickly find the spawn camper and get the first shot on them.
---
Tons of scrubby people abuse this and run straight from the spawn to where they know you were last, so they can get that first shot on you, while you are helpless.
---
So if they‚Äôre still killing you every time even with you having the first shot, you‚Äôre outmatched and need to spawn somewhere else.
---
did you get out of your armor since logging in? cause if you logout IN the armor then log back in you get another 100 lb carry weight.. it's a useful bug
---
Underrated comment.
---
Believe me when i say that my hours are small compared to some hardcore players/traders, theres some pretty dedicated people playing this game
---
From the launcher for PC. I should mention that the last time I tried playing was months ago. Is the game that good now? I thought it was catastrophic even with recent patchs (making it more grindy...).
---
Surgical trays at the asylum is my favorite spot for alu. Snag some ballistic fibre while you're at it. Rare outfits if extremely lucky.
---
OMG the stims! I hadn‚Äôt needed to worry about my meds in months. I hit this event twice and now I‚Äôm having to restock.
---
Thank goodness for Nuka Cherry
---
&gt;survival
---
there's you problem sweetie
---
don't shoot back and don't play on survival if you don't want people camping on train stations
---
Here goes another 4 hours ...wish me luck.
---
Depends where you bought it from, you need to read the conditions, I would imagine you should be able As a note try buy from amazon, they have a great return policy .. I got mine refunded no questions asked.
---
Yes they were, but MODUS and some holotapes make reference to trying to contact the rig, but it goes bad because of the lost connection and what not. Now that the players fix it, they should be able to commune with the main enclave.
---
G2A - be wary of scammers tho
---
This is me. All day, every day. Yesterday I was trying to finish part of the mainline quest near Fissure Prime. Someone nuked it, so I threw my Excavator on, rolled in and after doing a few hits to the SBQ (b4 and after regen) I plodded around with an instigating heated sledge and bashed adds while the team that summoned her went nuts. 
---
Old Yler and I had a field day. Until my 1 power core drained and I had to turtle step. 
---
So much loot. So much junk. So many deaths. Something satisfying about getting that mission marked off.
---
Still up?
---
You never engage .. I block and report anyone who does this in adventure mode ... they never going to see a cap from me, that's for sure ...
---
Should "being unpleasant" fit more? "Get out of here. Your wasting time" straight out the bat acting as if I was wasting his time. Literally, he could've not answer.
---
funny I also have the game and he got alot wrong
---
If you only played for one week then you barely scratched the surface on things to lose. If youre on pc though it could be a mod issue
---
People still crying about this? It doesn‚Äôt matter if the zoning is changed for camps either, people will find the next best place and line turrets up there, like the turret base I saw at west tek yesterday.
---
Best thing you can do, get over it and move on, in and out of game.
---
oh nice .. thanks for that Op
---
Nope. Found quite a few explosive items back in December when my luck was ‚Äò1‚Äô lol, now it‚Äôs 8 for the mutation etc but the explosive drop has slowed down.
---
I guess I should just give it a try and see how it goes. Thank you for the help.
---
In the pip-boy, explosive adds 20% on top, and Demo Expert applies only to that 20%. With one point you get +24% total and with 5 points you get +32%.
---
No-one really knows what explosive does though, apparently including Bethesda in some cases.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôd activate all the pylons and hide on the roof of the house and just stim myself while everyone clobbered the crap out her only to not be able to loot her invisible corps and when I did it was some 1* poop. It‚Äôs a nice addition but needs some work for sure lol.
---
I accidentally traded my furious power fist to my stepbrother instead of the zealot version. Thankfully I know where he lives (with me) so I got it back pretty quickly.
---
I'm just tired of ignorant people killing everything they see instantly and not letting anyone tag legendaries.
---
Had an hour left before I had to go to work and I decided to launch a nuke with my last keycard. Got into some pvp action with a small group trying to hijack the nuke after I did all the hard work. By the time I launched it, I had 20 minutes before I had to leave. 
---
Saw five 3* legendaries and didn't get to tag a single one of them. Some ignorant jackass with a TSE shotgun was just running around blowing everything away.
---
Thanks, shotgun prick. Nice way to end my day. A wasted nuke and zero loot for my 1hr+ effort.
---
I wish I still had a reason to play.  They could solve it by adding in a collection of high-level trophies.
---
Leveling up is a negative now, never seen that in a game before.
---
Nah, as someone already said, literally down the road in a. trailer, every time I am Berkley I grab one, if you on XB1 and can't find, pm me ..
---
Xbox
---
Counterpoint; you‚Äôre wasting time by finding information easily available on Google, like the commenter stated.
---
I play with a group of 17 people, not one of us would ever need that many mules and we pretty much the market set on certain kinds of items. We also produce thousands of steel, lead, and ammo. Not once has any one person needed more than the amount of accounts allotted to them (save one person who had initially used a friend's account as a mule prior to stash increases). We've all been playing since BETA.
---
You stating the current state of how things works doesn't mean that the current state is not faulty. Your failure to realize that is due to you being disingenuous with the actual premise of the issue here. There's a reason why they are changing how it will work in the future. I guess the developers also have a faulty premise on how things should work, maybe you should enlighten them as well.
---
"People with negative opinions are more likely to express them". That is not a fact and is just something you pulled out of your ass. Show empirical evidence of this and then maybe I'll believe you. 
---
The consensus that workshop design is faulty is a truth, which has already been affirmed from one of the bigger threads on the issue which has someone from the community team stating that this was not the intended use of contesting a workshop.
---
gg
---
I love this sort of thing - random things you find whilst exploring.
---
Beautiful, thank you!! üôèüòÑ
---
Great ideas all and of course asking this is way too much but as this game was intended to last for many years i have hope that things will change. 
---
And dont forget that this is not the same bethesda as 5 years ago, they have expanded/grown alot since Skyrim and Fo3-4 days.
---
U also have infinite run for those ten seconds I've noticed..use speed demon your old of there
---
Old Yeller! I'm stealing that! :)
---
You're not supposed to be able to remove foundations to have a ZERO foundation base.....not yet or not ever.
---
This is exploiting plain and simple and nothing is special about it except that it was exploited into existence. 
---
You know you can shoot bases on sight as your business right? I've learned that from all the griefer visits to my camp. Being a dick is abusing exploits to make floating unrealistic bases.
---
TSE isn't that good anymore. If you have an AAE I'd use that.
---
I first check dailies and weeklies and see which ones I can do quickly and which ones will take longer, I then try get this done as my main goal. Also keep an eye on my next level up for my daily to make sure I don't miss it, then I decide what else to do. Hate doing quests, but might do those if I got nothing else to do or events like Free Range for fun. Built a base at the farm for the Fred's BBQ event, so may continue working on my base for fun .. or help friends with their dailies if they need help.
---
Your theory does make some sense, and I can definitely see that happening. FYI, the buttons for reloading and dropping stuff are the same on PS4 (the square button), too, so that problem wouldn't affect PC players only.
---
I think I haven't lost anything (of value) in my 750 hours on PS4, but then I'm mostly melee and don't have to hit &lt;reload&gt; all the time... 
---
That said, I can totally see UI / server lag cause this: say you've got your gun out, see that you need to reload, but you were about to do sth in the pipboy menu. So you hit the pipboy button/key, but it doesn't open right away, so you half unconsciously hit &lt;reload&gt;, wonder for a milisecond why you don't see the reload animation, but ‚Äìoh!‚Äì there's the pipboy coming up, what was it I wanted to do again?
---
While the server gets the commands &lt;pipboy&gt; + &lt;drop&gt; and executes them like it is asked to, and your highlighted item is on the floor, but you won't look for or even see the bag because you haven't dropped anything, right?
---
And btw, this also nicely explains why people would be more prone to accidentally losing named items, as many will prefix them, say, with a dot, so they automatically top the list, where they will often end up to be the highlighted item.
---
Two easy measures you can take to avoid the headache: 
---
1. rename useless crap (that you want to sell or scrap) so that it tops the list, and rename your best stuff to the bottom (prefix by underscore),
---
2. put favorited items up top (not in the game right now, so I can't confirm this) IF favorited items are also protected against being dropped, like they are against being scrapped.
---
Really cool the way they exploited a bug for their personal gain right? cool neat haha nice
---
Wait destroy power armor in one hit
---
Well there goes the rest of my screws
---
Up your ass
---
you're getting shadow muted btw lol
---
and it's a pointless thread, then. just don't play survival if you don't want to get spawn-camped. simple.
---
*sweety buns*.
---
I tried it, didn't find my answer, posted here to seek advice from some people. How am I "wasting time by finding information easily on Google"? You mean 'You are wasting time because you are not finding information on Google'.
---
Assassin's does apply after everything else. As a general rule, any damage bonus with a different target or weapon type condition is applied separately. +10% is still weak though.
---
The 15% from Bloody Mess is added to the bonus of several other general-damage abilities, including Adrenaline, Psycho and Adrenal Reaction, before it's used to multiply damage.
---
That's a bad location for one.
---
Still not seeing how this affects you or your game play so
---
They are literally in the main quest line... come on!
---
I hate complaining about it because I enjoyed my time with it.  There are few games I can play for 400 hours.
---
It's just a shame that I want to keep playing but there's nothing of quality left to do.
---
No my game doesn‚Äôt even crash anymore and in my opinion it‚Äôs actually good now
---
People already pointed out that XP doesn‚Äôt come from turret kills, but even the argument on loot is moot point if they aren‚Äôt there with the the turrets. Dead enemies loot doesn‚Äôt ever instantly transport itself into the owners inventory.
---
Kill a gulper at a location with gulpers isn't impossible, pal. And I'd get a friend for the pictures at x wearing y. The alien challenge is annoying though.
---
Not me. Server disconnect got it first
---
And this affects you and your game play how exactly? Oh, right, it doesn't. Chill
---
Yet still no compensation :)
---
U sure
---
No like Harold. I want to fight a tree.
---
100s of times I fast-traveled to an event just to find it's over. Yeah, event timers would be...handy.
---
For queen battles and heavy I suppose? Ordinary scorched aren‚Äôt worth the ammo. For gatling gun the prime receiver does more damage but the firing speed is at 400, so the total damage output in a given period is the same as non-prime but with speedy receiver (500). For the minigun the prime barrel does the same damage as the tri-barrel, but the latter has more range and accuracy. I primed my miniguns then converted them back to tri-barrel instead.
---
So you must be right huh? because you don't see? 
---
You're unwilling to see how a floating base created from exploits impacts the game.....remember how people abusing exploits caused massive server disconnects and ruined the image of hte game?? HHAHA HHA HHA HAH A ADI Im going to rape your family, but i dont see how that affects you. :D
---
Thats most likely bcuz there is NO shared XP. You only get XP when you actually did some damage to a target.
---
Loot however IS shared in your group.
---
Scorched are supposed to be like drones in a bee hive. So the best way to make them interesting is to allow them to spawn in much larger numbers.
---
I was enjoying the game taking pictures of 76 different creatures...hoping that completing it would at least open up a new set of camera specific challenges. Alas...there is no more. Camera is dead.

That was really difficult.

Buy one. If you want a plain explosive bring 10000-25000 caps. If you want an extra effect bring a lot more.

R3 is what it's called on Playstation if he was a ***R e A l  H a R d C o R e  X b O x  G a M e R*** he'd call it RS like areal man. And don't call me bud you sound like a boomer
---
It‚Äôs a going to be a risk scrapping all of the legendary items I could potentially sell before I know what I‚Äôm rolling for but I‚Äôm probably going to risk it for a 3* biscuit.
---
There is a mole costume, found in dolly soda, but no mole rat costume unforunately
---
Or a land war in Africa
---
Actually TSE's don't do any damage to brahmin, probably patched, I tested this by shooting them to see if they would take damage and they take no damage.
---
Nice Guide Op :)
---
I was so confused yesterday, dozens of level one diseased and legendary eyebots. My first instigating hunting rifle.... level 1! Going to tart it up and give it to a newbie fresh out of the vault.
---
Nobody says RS on the Xbox and every game says R3. Also the bud is a Midwest thing lmao
---
I‚Äôve gotten one as a drop, but I‚Äôve gotten other items valuable enough to trade. 
---
It‚Äôs kind of about getting lucky enough to find one item that can trade you into wealth. For me it was a Vampire‚Äôs Vats/Vats Radium Rifle.
---
Abusing exploits is one of the things that gave the game a bad image. What a great community member you are to continue the tradition. :D
---
World Class Speedrun
---
Which part do you hate the most?
---
Also you have marsupial or jetpack you can jump across to the wall beam brace point (where the V of the two braces comes down), then jump up to the catwalk.
---
You confuse "need" with "want." I'm a hoarder. A collector. Nothing wrong with having enough mules to accommodate that. 
---
You keep talking about changes, but I have seen no official announcements. Just Googled and am coming up dry. Got a link? 
---
Speaking of links, this one should clear up the claim you questioned -- that people are more likely to share negative experiences and opinions than positive ones by a wide margin --  (https://www.marketingcharts.com/digital-28628) [check the study it references]. There are numerous other examples if you for some reason have an issue with it, but I'll let you find them yourself.
---
Mid-late game NV with all the DLC is just nuts. I realized I was a bit overpowered when I was yawning through groups of super mutants.
---
If you want to decorate walls, sadly bricks are the best way, as they are the only 100% flat interior wall.

---
End this floating exploit shit.
---
This will change Tuesday with the addition of ‚ÄòSurvival Score‚Äô. All those XP‚Äôers will end up top of the board fast.
---
as far as I can tell, the pipboy has a mind of its own and will highlight whatever it feels like highlighting.
---
the "solution" I found was remapping reload to F and physically removing my R key. haven't lost anything yet, but I only been doing it for like 2 weeks.
---
I'm pretty sure it can also happen with vendors and even your stash. essentially anything that can move/remove your items. so right now I'm avoid using them as much as possible.
---
Launched my first nuke ever today. I nuked the fissure near whitesprings and someone else nuked whitesprings. Naturally I explored both areas. A horde of glowing whitespring ghouls killed me. Tried to spawn in at the whitesprings train station, game crashed, now I lost access to both nuke sites and all the junk I acquired raiding Site Charlie.
---
oof I‚Äôm 90% in the low 100‚Äôs with caps because I‚Äôm really bad with managing my caps
---
Yup, they don't count as Scorched for the mod (only mobs that have "Scorched" in their name)
---
You're better off with a Vicious Receiver overall
---
I started a new character at about patch 6 and that still can't get a load of achievements like Heart of the swamp or atom challenges such as discover locations.
---
Yup
---
Yes mainly through the facebook groups I have seen.
---
But you got them there using one of those methods in the first place, didn't you? You went out of your way to circumvent a limit, you'll have to do the same again. I'd imagine that alternate characters are intended to be just that, and not mules.
---
Www.google.com
---
Literally the only thing i spend money on is fast traveling. Bot a couple plans. I make all my ammo
---
I did, I also wanted to see it in a core community standpoint as sometimes reviewers + youtubers give a different narrative than people who play the game more than others.
---
Haha pc but i appreciate your sympathy.
---
Make Fallout Great Again - MFGA
---
I've seen this posted many times and I think its a bad idea. It will just break up the player base. We already have Adventure and Survival then to add a level 50 version of each? They're going to add a prestige aspect to the game that will make you go back to lvl 1, which I think is a great work around to this with benefits in doing so.  Just my thoughts on the matter.
---
Ignore him. He made a joke about raping my family and deleted. Ignore this c u n t
---
Well it is asking too much, but yeah other games that have had years of longevity have changed their selves entirely through updates and patches. And I do believe that 76 is fundamentally flawed in several ways and unless things change then it won't have longevity
---
I‚Äôm a hoarder too, I have a mule with just bloodied and AA weapons. Still don‚Äôt need 15 mules.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna go dig through thousands of reddit posts to a find a link to a comment just for a guy who talks out of his ass and believes he could never be wrong.
---
Your link doesn‚Äôt make your statement any more factual. More reading comprehension failure. Surprising!
---
This sometimes happens when I first load in. There's a lag in the game.
---
Yea but it gives me a morally good reason to greif and ill take it. Just like if you base at the Charleston train station. I'm leveling both of those.
---
You are correct...my bad.
---
I don‚Äôt mind burrowing enemies but 76 and 4 both relied on this teleporting ‚Äúburrowing‚Äù too much. They should just balance it a bit more and have it be the Mole Rats desires option when retreating. For the most part I think they should just behave how they did in 1-NV.
---
I play for an hour or two most mornings. I like to head to Whitesprings first to check out the vendors and then head out to the parking lot for target practice and blowing up all the cars. Then I just work on quests or wander around finding new places.
---
Just to be clear: you're unwilling to back your claims and dismiss evidence that supports mine. Cool, cool.
---
I hoarded for a day and my stash is full. There are still plenty of people clogging them to vendors... just not in every server. Server hop a bit and you‚Äôll find something.
---
You need to have a friend just join your server with you to hold the bot and then you just rejoin the server over and over until you get it...
---
Yeah, if they pop out of stuff to attack, sure, that's OK. If they're constantly using it to chase you indefinitely, that's not OK.
---
Huh, interesting. I remember the first time I did the event and people (myself included) were blazing away with exploders and the Brahmin died. Maybe they did patch that.
---
Wait what? Please explain to my dumb mind
---
over 800 hours here. 
---
its very stable and much less buggy still some work left of course
---
i got 800 hours worth of entertainment and counting so thats a very good deal for me
---
google the content crap yourself that is a big question your asking.
---
I wish it was a mole rat outfit honestly
---
honestly i definitely think it‚Äôs worth coming back to. quite a few bugs have been patched, servers in general are more stable, STASH limit is now 800. 
---
some DLC (i guess it‚Äôs considered DLC idk) has been added and with it have come a number of new side quests, new locations, new events, new enemies, new weapons, and new camp decorations. 
---
turrets no longer take up a LOT of your camp budget, and the budget has increased overall. 
---
also if you‚Äôre into PVP, a new mode has been added. it‚Äôs called Survival mode and pvp is completely open there. iirc fast traveling still exists but when respawning after you die, you can only respawn at vault 76, your camp (or a team member‚Äôs), or a train station. also upon death, you lose all your junk and some random aid items. they also added atom challenges specifically for survival mode that reward legendary weapons, and you don‚Äôt have to make a new character to play it. 
---
i hope you come back to the game! ^ ^
---
Name what he got wrong then.
---
You‚Äôre mistaken, picking the lock was the only action you listed that can get you a bounty, thus that is the reason you got a bounty.
---
I don't know what's worse, the crickets in the game or the same crickets in real life. These buggers are realistic AF imo.
---
Look at his videos. hes already running it asshole.
---
Watoga's not bad either.  The robots drop a fair amount of steel or aluminum, and there's a lot of robots!
---
I'm on Xbox
---
Yes!
---
Just spent a good amount of stuff for an LMG with instigating and explosive. The volley with sneak bonus gets a 68 Warlord to 0% hp, but then he "gains" 5% of his hp back.
---
Much disappoint
---
Thanks üòÄ
---
Yea they're all the same. But my carry weight dropped a good 85 90 lbs
---
fair point gbye o/
---
Whitespring is good for Legendaries but not the best. What makes it good is speed of run, quality of spawn point and the fact that you are also getting a good junk, chem and XP farm as well.
---
&gt; They should have reset servers where everyone starts new after they make some balancing changes. The game has been greatly improved in the last few months. Let us experience the way it should have been experienced.
---
Agree with everything you said pretty much except this.  That would be absolutey awful if I lost my character and had to start from scratch. I've put in 250-300 hours that would be absolutely infuriating and there would be no reason to ever play again.
---
And of course the damn sea gulls. Or maybe rad gulls?
---
Great thanks more looking for high star enemies
---
Sorry darling did I pinch a nerve?
---
I've been wearing mine almost nonstop since I got it. It's so damn classy. My favorite look is combining it with the assault gas mask
---
Yes they do. This has been confirmed by data miners.
---
Yes, the challenges seem to get more and more annoying, time consuming and just grindy. 2 months ago i could easily accomplish 4 of 5 challenges in about 40 minutes a day. One or two probably in 15 minutes. Now 3 of 5 challenges are almost impossible for me, the rest can take up 2 hours to complete. So i leave it. 
---
Congrats Bethesda you tell us "you can allways earn atoms for free simply by gaming". Earlier i could earn 160-200 atoms a week. Today its a dismal 60-80 per week. 
---
And now, i won't buy them. I would once in a while, but not if BSG continous to take the p\*\*s on peoply with this and there pay-to-win plans....
---
The worst crime BSG committed was not controlling the major economy breaking cheaters early in the game.  They allowed dupers to run wild selling god tier weapons and armor like candy.  Nearly all the OP gear you hear people using are most likely duped items.  If you actually get a  natural OP drop, everyone will just figure you traded or bought it from a duper unless it's a non-popular weapon/effect.  Duping is STILL a problem, but not like before it's more subtle but OP sets are still being duped sold regularly.
---
Alright you‚Äôve convinced me to move to Whitespring
---
The only people that can answer that are the Bethesda mods, so making a post on here about it is kinda pointless, send a PM, or submit a ticket.
---
Also my best guess is the reason being the bundle already included plenty of stuff.
---
Shotgun? NERF? [ rifle build here ]
---
I made the exact same experience... tse's get nerfed,  but not these rats...
---
West Tek is good but the runs take much longer. I'd say all things considered they are comparable.
---
Too much of a hassle...I always store my junk frequently anyways so I never lose anything except durability
---
Make everything terrifying
---
I'm sure I just jinxed myself by reading this.  Goodbye, useful guns.  Hello, replacement wood armor.
---
I always thought the collapsed floors and debris from flower pots being like 30ft in length really unrealistic, but damn. Just blew that idea out of the window.
---
Pretty shocked how much interior damage high speed winds do irl
---
Now I‚Äôd be really thankful if they just hide in the bunkers and don‚Äôt do jack shit. In a few recent sbq and ISS events there were a bunch of lower level players showed up for the reward. They didn‚Äôt contribute to hitting the boss but keep ‚Äòtagging‚Äô the scorches and gutsys. When I killed them and kept firing at the boss, those guys will rush to the dead scorches and gutsys to loot them right in front of me while I was blasting the queen and sheepsquatch. I end up killing myself with my explosive weapons several times simply because they never pay attention to what others are doing and only worry about their own little rewards in the middle of a boss fight (steel scrap i suppose?).
---
Atleast I tried helping :,D
---
...abusing exploits to build a base? You sound dumb.
---
Looks dope!
---
Yes. This had been confirmed by data miners. There‚Äôs been a longtime persistent rumor that scorchbeasts were only classified as animals; they‚Äôre actually (per data-miners) classified as both scorched and animals. I‚Äôll see if i can find the post
---
And what will you do Tuesday? Best thing to do is to go ahead and get used to getting over it, because you won‚Äôt have any other option come Tuesday.
---
and if you‚Äôre looking to buy, the mr handy in artisans corner in whitespring sells bulk junk!
---
When I make my fast travel all my good shit will be sitting in my stash box. I may stash my armor too and go naked.
---
Ya know what really breaks the game?
---
Crybaby douchbags that hate in everyone else and grief them for no reason. Don‚Äôt be a dick
---
Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen
---
It's definitely not as fun to explore, i had a blast crawling through the D.C. ruins, finding hidden away locations and working around rubble, but in new Vegas the really wasn't any "ruins" to explore. This makes sense considering the games lore, house was able to defend Vegas from bombs with lasers, but that doesn't mean i like it any more.
---
I think that they need to make more intricate quests. I have heard that the vault raids are coming out around summer time, so maybe they could make them challenging, but rewarding for the bravest of players.
---
They could add in loads of dungeons at once without telling anyone and it'll surprise us
---
Killed a glowing diseased (65) ShepSq today. Right outside the rusty pick.
---
I just came here to question your choice of name.
---
Also I super know these aren't the answers you are looking for, but if I give them up front it at least gets them out of the way and keeps the thread active.
---
Which system you on?
---
I'm sure they can figure a way of adding it to the atom shop.
---
Ski poles .... guess where.
---
Nice stats! Although the ammo for that type of weapon is quite heavy
---
My PS4 is the same. Chat audio goes to my ear via as chat headset. If you don't want to talk to or hear someone mute then.
---
The thing that you PC games forget is there is no keyboard on a console controller. Yes, I know you can buy them but that's why I game on a console - I don't want a keyboard.
---
As long as text chat could be completely turned off at my end, I would have s problem with it but I still think you are supposed to feel isolated in this game. Not getting messages from cap sellers, people looking for pvp, wts the weapons... All that crap doesn't have a place here.
---
No I understand these are great spots just not having much luck lately
---
It's easy to end up with a ton of spare flux, especially now that HR fluids, glowing and hardened mass are instanced. Even if you're using primed weapons, that's normally three or four types of flux that you have no long-term use for, and it takes up a lot of stash space.
---
I used to get more flux from the queen, but the queen's harder work now and the flux is easier to manufacture.
---
Add tenderizer and bloody mess.
---
Yep, vendors never have legendaries on their own stock. They got just plans, some junk, some aid items, then few select non-legendaries typical to that vendor. Sometimes they seem to lack these non-legendaries, no idea why.
---
Also vendor default inventories are instanced. What you see, is what YOU see. This is particular for some mods they carry, most notirious for the X01 power armor mods only found one one vendor, and only some of the time. X01 mods are rare.
---
People have to server hop and check the vendor a lot, if they want to buy them.
---
Or people share certain roaming vendors on trade channels. They carry certain rare outfits at least, but because it's instanced, people have to individually go check if they are selling them for them, or not.
---
But anything sold to vendor, becomes available to everyone. It's very similiar to how containers work, vendors are probably containers. 
---
What you initially see is for you(although many plans have 100% chance to be there now), but anything placed by other players, become visible to everyone.
---
I‚Äôd settle for fixing the queen fight where it doesn‚Äôt crash half way through. You guys no that awful sound I‚Äôm talking about. It used to never happen to me always heard about it until lately. Launch a much fast travel to watoga game crash, die during the queen fight black screen of infinite loading, halfway through the queen fight and thousands of rounds of ammo game crashes. I do agree with your post though.
---
Alisha Parker's rooftop and History of Morgantown, but that's not in the main quest line.  There is also a garden lookout tower.
---
Much stronk, very power, wow.
---
I think you dropped it instead of deploying it.
---
Yeah the first wave of dupe deletions was news worthy
---
Thank youI, i try to be articulate and fair, like i said, i think New Vegas is a amazing game, and i have hundreds of hours put into it, more than 3 actually, but i think 3 is better. If it wasn't for 3 being hell to get up and running on any kind of modern system I'd play it more.
---
I don't know if its the main quest but in the Mistress of Mysteries quest line, you go to Lewisburg. There  are a ton of rooftop gardens there
---
That‚Äôs very kind of you! I don‚Äôt really know what to do with them yet though!
---
he got out of he didn‚Äôt deploy or drop it
---
GO TO A TRADING SUBREDDIT!
---
I mean. I can kill you if thats what you want? Seems like it might be easy. :)
---
I was setting up a camp for patch nine, Level 200 came up to me, started hitting me with melee while holding a TSE,I have a AA TSE 3\* shotgun, Just ignored him and he went away.  
---
Too busy for nonsense.
---
No *Atomic Shop voice*
---
Nah I'm good thx tho. Don't feel like killing you much
---
Not really. I don't get it with the challenges You can't transfer atoms.
---
Storage yes. I'am having a second charakter solely for storage. Thought about buying a second account for a transfer/storage charakter. But at the moment i'am not willing to give bethesda another dime while they still fu\*\*\*ng the fans with there pay-to-win integration aka repair kits....
---
Try Amazon for a physical copy, I got it that way at a decent discount.
---
Apparently you haven't tried since the last patch. They changed it so that everyone who tags a monster gets their own mass/fluids, so you can easily come out of a Whitesprings run with 20 of each.
---
Hmm yeah it's so difficult to talk since so many people pull out TSE when ever just explosive is mentioned. I've found zero TSE. I've played about 750 hours I think. A lot of it just hoarding and exploring, but occasinally I've liked to farm spesific places, particularly liked WS whenever there was organized group farming and resetting it over and over.
---
600 hours and only 2 explosives is a bit low I think, but I guess within the realms of realistic odds, particularly depending on how one have played those 600 hours. Even though 2 star enemies can drop 2 star weapons, chances are better when you deal 3 star enemies.
---
Maybe drop rates have been adjusted in like 2-3 monts. I'm very certain my first explosive gun was IE western, it was my best gun for really long time, I've had it since December. It even handled the explosive nerf pretty well. Only like a month ago I traded for IE shotgun, effectively retiring the IE western.
---
If you think about it, explosive is just one of 7 second slot effects a gun can have. I wouldn't call that rare. Weaker explosive guns are often sold for caps, which the vendors shower anyone for 10k a week if you just bother to play about every day. Decent explosive guns can be traded for medicore/decent 3 star armor you have personally no use for. Only good explosive guns are difficult to get.
---
But I was really wondering the person who said mentioned to be level 172 and have found zero explosives. Either they were referring to TSE, it is the common and sad thing that gets confused all the time, or they must have not really played that much and got most of this experience from some glitches. Playing normally for that much, and not getting a single one, that seems too unlikely.
---
Xbox and yes that seemed to work for me!
---
I don't eat at McDonalds but I don't hang around at McDonalds telling everyone how much they suck for eating there.  
---
I'm sorry that you're lonely, but maybe stop being a cunt.
---
Nobody cares what you people think.
---
The text bubble is visually horrible. Why are people afraid of their own voices?
---
Poison is it's own damage type.
---
There was 6 minutes left and nobody there. ?
---
Lol? So being a dumbass isn't supposed to annoy me?
---
Joplin? I drove through a while after and it was crazy seeing the damage. I had lived there for a few years, several years before the tornado.
---
Don't expect anything good from the legendary vendor.  Many people are hoarding legendaries of any kind waiting for this scrip machine to show up.  My guess is it will take a HUGE amount of scrip to buy any decent legendary or roll for a decent effect. The patch notes were unclear, but I'm betting it's just a vendor selling legendaries using scrip, not caps.
---
No, you haven't provided any evidence that "supports" any claim you have made. 
---
But keep moving the goal posts. The workshop contesting mechanic is flawed. You can even own a workshop and get killed without receiving a notification that you workshop is being contested. More brokenness. But hey, "By Design" right LOL
---
Please reply back, this is getting many laughs :)
---
How can i protect myself from poison?
---
yes, when the event started I was overencumbered so it too me 4 mins to lose the weight
---
use armor with poison resist legendary prefixes. otherwise there are some aid items that help (atleast one Magazine)
---
If you left because you‚Äôre an elitist piece of floating trash, you‚Äôll hate it, if your a fan of fallout you‚Äôll enjoy it, you made the choice to leave early on and are possibly one of the people who did nothing but complain about how bad it was ever since, if that is true please stay gone. Most of the early bugs are fixed, new bugs exist, is the game better than it was, yes, is it fun at high levels, I have 2 100+ characters on different platforms, i enjoy it, but again the amount of fun is directly proportionate on how much of a soggy shit bag you are and if you like to bitch about stupid shit.
---
There's legendary effects for armor, I believe there's perks for it as well.
---
Whatever bro. Enjoy being angry and alone.
---
The stupid thing didn't save my mutations

Haven't seen any armor that protects from poison yet
---
I'm not the one trolling Fallout 76 subreddits with bullshit lies, bro.
---
But u can kill them or at least some of us can kill them
---
" Just don't play solo, play the way Bethesda wants you to play their game" says the person who prefers not to play solo.
---
I just mean you state how a lot of people have valid complaints and you also state a lot of people defend the game which i believe most of the time is also valid. Problem with internet historians video is he glassed over a lot of the good stuff about the game. Didn't even mention the fact that you can earn atoms in game. I think we have a healthy mix in this sub and just because the game needs improvement doesn't make it bad. That's all i meant
---
Fallout 76 is all about buying Atom Shop items with real money. Anything else is not important.
---
So that's a "yes" then. Cool.
---
None for me yet üò≠
---
I like atlas observatory, I ran into as many as 3 legendary gutsies there two of which have always been 3* 
---
Also nuclear waste dump between the savage divide and cranberry bog usually has a 3* super mutant. 
---
Also does anyone ever farm the nuke plants? How are the insides of them?
---
there is one in a partially destroyed camper trailer outside Berkley Springs workshop. It's the one with all the UFO scribblings on the walls. The skeleton in the corner next to the safe is wearing it.
---

it only spawns on two star or greater.
---
Ah well that explains a lot
---
Eating? Nah man. You'all are not eating. You're making a scene cause there's people who eat a different menu then you do.
---
Consider me the dude who's laughing his ass off watching the recording of your stupid asses.
---
Keep believing what you want, doesn‚Äôt change reality. 
---
Tell you what, I‚Äôll dig through thousands of posts to find the link once you provide proof of the 15 mules all with junk on them.
---
LOL
---
Not sure it's been a while will let you know once I do
---
When will it be in Atom shop?
---
best spot right there
---
But if they use that character strictly for pvp than it won‚Äôt matter
---
Oh well for some reason it won't show the mutations but with the right ones you get 19 perception and agility which makes it so you are incredibly stealthy. Also the primary weapon will be a bolt action pipe gun.
---
Yep agreed bad choice of words on my part, didn‚Äôt mean rumors. I just think people can over react and I am right there with you. Looking at my character over the weekend I am still as hard hitting as it has been prior to the patch so I am breathing a bit easier. If Bethesda boogers this up so badly that it isnt worth using them I will just walk away. I have been through too many games in the past where they nerf‚Äôed the more powerful weapons for no good reason and leveling the playing field just because is just stupid in my opinion. Sorry didn‚Äôt mean to imply you were doing anything other than asking a legit question :)
---
Oh wait here they are lol. I love talking to myself in post. Lol sorry.
---
The burrowing mechanic is bad enough, but at least it's justified. What isn't justified is when I'm standing on a broken wooden roof frame and one burrows out of that. Do they have wormhole technology now?
---
If the burrowing was confined to dirt and we were being treated to a low-key recreation of Tremors then they would be a lot less hair-tearing.
---
#EVOLUTION

Don't go by YT without a really really strong filter on your viewing, lots of people there going clickbait lately, especially for any game that has any controversy.
---
You can get the game at discount, you'll very likely get 200-300 hours AT LEAST before things start to get repetitive.
---
If you like FO style games (exploration), you'll enjoy it.  Beyond that, it's up to what you like.
---
IMO, if you can get 300 hours for $60, it's more than worth it.  You can probably get it for $30-40, depending on your platform.
---
Bugs...it's a Bethesda game, it's screwy and buggy.  But it generally works fine.  The servers are stable, there are few really fatal bugs.  But don't expect perfectly smooth sailing, there are always issues with Beth's games.
---
Got to Morgan Town Airport and you can trigger the cargo bot event which brings it in really low. Took me 4 snaps to register it.
---
The turret one was an issue, seems it had to be open and engaging me to work so I went to one of the relay towers, shot a mutant and it opened up allowing me to get the pic.
---
Biv counts as a robobrain
---
The rest I got at whitesprings / enclave bunker.
---
Legendary farming is a big part of my game, and I thought it was just my imagination or a streak of bad luck in the fact that I haven't been getting anything \*\*\* for the past few weeks.  Is there any evidence that the loot tables/spawn rate was messed with?  RNG tends to go through hot and cold streaks, in my experience.  I assumed I was just in a slump.
---
I did get a \*\* raider arm today from AWOL, but the other two \*\*\* gutsies gave me \* stuff.  Out of probably 50ish legendary pieces I've looted, maybe 4-5 have been \*\*.  I haven't gotten a \*\*\* piece in weeks.
---
Maybe 100% player damage debuff for 4 hours lol
---
Definitely my next stop, thank you! üòä
---
I meant asl.
---
Someone's cranky because their mother forgot to breast feed them.
---
I have played the fallout series for decades precisely because it was an immersive, witty,  dark PVE experience. I AM their base! I never asked for teaming up or PVP. I sure as hell don't like overt attempts to nudge me into them.
---
Meanwhile I've caught sight of the Flatwoods monster at least twice.
---
Betcha it'll never show up when it's part of a challenge.
---
Lol, nice. üëç
---
Find a place to build a camp that has a node there. Try somewhere uncommon, or take over a workshop and farm it there.
---
The prime receivers do extra damage to scorchbeasts.
---
Bud Lite maybe, I live near Chicago and never in my life have I heard someone say bud unironically
---
I was rather amused Friday night - spawned in, went to the golf club - it was full of level 1 eye bots... 
---
and they were all dropping level one 1* legendaries....
---
Gathered them all and left them in a paper bag at the foot of the stairs.
---
It helped me, I have an old gtx 950 üòä
---
1200 atoms a piece
---
Maybe it goes by browser history XD
---
If you want the numbers, it's +25% damage against scorched &amp; scorchbeasts, which equates to +36% after the damage resistance calculation. The base stats are the same as a hardened receiver (or powerful automatic?).
---
It's more efficient with some weapons than others, because each unit of ammunition always costs 1 flux and the quantities vary massively. Gatlings are particularly good, I believe. On the other hand, if you're using a shotgun or lever rifle, you'll struggle to farm enough flux.
---
Upgrade your PC, wouldn‚Äôt have this issue if you had a console.
---
It's in the doors section, it is non powered and functions the same as a regular door.
---
There's an old-ish game called "Two Worlds" - not too bad, open world RPG in a similar vein to Elder Scrolls (although, obviously not a patch on those games). Anyway, THAT game had an interesting feature in that if an enemy saw you it would follow you *forever*. 
---
Like even if you fast-travelled to the other side of the map it would make a bee-line straight for you and, eventually, would catch up and try to fight you. Lead to some really interesting encounters, like you'd be chatting away to an NPC in a village and suddenly "AAARGH it's that wolf from the woods from an hour ago!".
---
Thank you, I thought it might be in the 20-30% range but was unsure
---
Damn Radgulls stealing my cram...
---
Well the game mode is an half-assed abomination. Stop playing it, it makes Bethesda think that it is successful as is
---
If you have Excavator PA and don‚Äôt mind smelting, there is a small hill on top of the cliffs between Tangara Town and the Ransacked Bunker. Fastest way to get there is to FT to Tangara, and go about 300 yards south.  You‚Äôll know you‚Äôre in the right spot if you see a radio beacon just east of the hill.  The hill has a small indent at its base, and there are several Aluminum ore veins inside.
---
FYI this hill also has various other veins along its side, including copper, silver, and gold.  If you travel 100 yards east along the cliff edge, you find a few lead veins, too.
---
The first thing you have to do is get rank 2 of the starched genes perk, otherwise you'll "cure" yourself of the mutations if you pop a radaway.  After that, you just consume the serums and reap the benefits/drawbacks.
---
Adrenal reaction gives you increasing damage as your health goes down, but at the cost of 50hp. Twisted Muscles gives you +25% melee damage and increased cripple chance at the cost of -50% VATS accuracy with guns. There's 13 in total, and your build/playstyle will determine which ones you'll want. 
---
The full list is here. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_mutations
---
Some like Marsupial (triple jump height and +20 carry weight) and Speed Demon (move speed +20 and faster reload) are great for almost every character, while others are better suited for specific builds.
---
My bloodied (mostly melee) build runs with Adrenal Reaction, Grounded (+100 energy resist, -50 energy damage), Marsupial, Speed Demon, Twisted Muscles, Healing Factor (health regen +300%, chem effect -50%), and Scaly Skin (+50 damage &amp; energy resist, -50 AP). When I'm below 20% health and nerd rage kicks in my bloodied baseball bat does over 1,200 damage per swing, and my bloodied lever action does almost 350/shot.
---
Anywho, my GT is the same as my reddit name, so if you want either of them just let me know and we can hook up next time we're both online.
---
I'm not going to go through the trouble of doing that. That's more time-consuming than making more mule accounts. I don't see why you're so hung up on that: junk mules aren't even that outrageous of a claim, and numerous ones that had to be created because of the weight limit even less so. You gather a lot of stuff in over 800 hours of gameplay.
---
Weird that you refuse to back a claim you made unless I perform this arbitrary and pointless action though.
---
I make ground mole rat burgers out of the little bastards.
---
Sill, it depends on your level and your build.  
---
A L200 heavy weapons build is not going to be impressed by a 1* anti-armor grognak axe, but that may be gold to L55 melee build.
---
I always see a lot at Harpers Ferry, they normally are lvl 68
---
I haaaaaaaaaate molerats.. So annoying
---
There are bugs, but nothing critical. Main issue for me is pvp balance. once you got right weapon + armor? you can annihilate 90% of server
---
They maked prices better, but then  started to make impossible challanges so you can't get atoms from them, and people are getting about 40% atoms less. So not it's still shitty. Also there is repair kits you can buy to repair your stuff on the run directly from  shop, which basically means you can buy junk for repairs for real money
---
There was plenty of content: Fastnacht(it was great, but over already), survival mode(shitty because of shitty pvp balance), sheepsquatch quests and events (are great and still in the game), Burrows, pretended to be new First "dungeon", but basically just new whitesprings with ghouls, Nukashine quests and moonshining with new alcohol (great content) and new legandary trader, player vending machines new quest line and backpacks in couple of weeks.
---
You can come back now, but i think real game will start fter vaults opening, late summer/autumn is a good time to start playing, if their managers don't kill this game with shitty mtx decisions before that
---
So you need rad away?
---
Said the dude who's salty cause people play the game like it's supposed to.
---
10-1 even BSG hasn't figured it out. They push out the legendary scrip machines to buy time and try and figure out how these will be used.  It will initially suck and everyone will rage that the legendary vendor sucks big time and is a rip off.  They will then adjust the vendor and it will be decent, but not great.  It will be a legendary sink though.. You already don't see many legendaries at vendors right now because everyone is hoarding their crap legendaries for scrip.
---
They don't seem to be very deadly. Not 100% sure how much of it from my level 2 fireproof perk.
---
Go bloodied. It's fun with a shotgun build.
---
I suspect Tenderizer stacks per pellet, so that's a really good one-pointer.
---
You cheated not only the game but yourself
---
I hope people didn't think I meant als.. I only saw the title and the picture before I got to the comments. Don't people usually say "af" and not "asf"?
---
Use Radaway. You should have at least a few of them unless you've been actively avoiding looting any body or container you come across.
---
Grabbing every pole gets you around 90 aluminum, but you gotta kill some stuff and look around ... they're hard to spot in some cases, but not a lot of players seem to care to farm them.
---
So cozy ;)
---
i do not understand the question.
---
I completely disagree. As of now like 3/5 of the map is barely touched by the current player base. Why have so many lush environments and cool locations and have no reason to visit them? Especially when the only thing to do in this game is to kill things and make a CAMP, why are there so few places that are fun to kill things at? In my last 20 hours of game time I've had no reason to visit the forest, toxic valley, or... The mining area
---
Tried this several times and never worked for me. Its not like its my first encounter with a molerat.
---
Every challenge but the one weekly challenge that required you take pictures of cryptids, has had a flatwoods monster and alien count when killing a flatwoods monster. They are shown separately, but they count as the same thing. That one weekly challenge however incorrectly had the alien requirement set to a different alien (the green zetans that aren't present in fallout 76 as of now), so that challenge was quite literally impossible. That challenge is the only exception. Flatwoods monster has counted as an alien for everything else so far.
---
Yesssssss.
---
Having a higher standard of living would allow me to move forward. But I do not find Rad Away. And neither does anyone who wants to help me finish mission. I'm stuck
---
I can mod it for you no problem. Just let me know
---
lol. same here.  Check Whitesprings... just vanilla guns/armor most of the time. Seems everyone is hoarding for the machines.  Just don't expect the leg vendor be anything but a let-down at the beginning.  They will make it too expensive and too limited to satisfy the masses.
---
Planter boxes that can be placed to grow crops maybe?  I would like this very much
---
Harpers ferry, sometimes they spawn at the Garrahan parts, usually some in grafton too.
---
Yes indeed.
---
Trying to get rare legendaries and event outfits mixed with exploring whatever first crosses my mind.
---
I am looking for it as well, let me know if you find it, I will too!
---
That's definately an overstatement, but it doesn't really matter since you're already sure you're right.
---
and the meat jumps into the ground as soon you‚Äôre trying to take a bite.
---
Im just glad they dont have a random instant kill attack if youre not wearing power armor now.
---
Thank you so much! &lt;3
---
I do not PS and not Rad Away. Nobody helps me and I can not move forward. One shot and I die
---
Can you please list active online only games that get regular new content and dont have any ingame microtransactions?
---
Because to my knowledge, there arent any
---
That is correct. I forget the majority of reddit is younger than me.
---
Absolutely üëå
---
I've seen two of them at once, that was fun, wish I have Galucigen grenade with me
---
Not on right now but I'll be happy to give you as much as possible
---
Nope. Just a flat % debuff on hit, but it's a good perk.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a80jf8/tenderizer_is_better_than_you_think/
---
I would love this since my camp location has no ground to plant in whatsoever.
---
Eh, I still pick up a few cheap 3-stars every so often, and a few good (not god-tier) items.  I see things on most servers where there's decent activity, though THOSE are getting harder to find.
---
I think I've found 2 SBQ events so far this weekend, and only a few places where people were farming WS.  1, maybe 2 encryptid events.
---
Picked up an assissin's explosive handmade earlier.  Got a couple 3-star knives and grenade launchers.  A couple bloodied +1 other shotties.  The handmade will probably stay on me, the rest will be scrapped for script or stuck in a vending machine for a few days first.
---
i had a TSE shotgun a long time ago which dropped from SBQ.  At the time, I didn't realize how sought after they were or how to negate the splash damage affecting me. I tried using it, promptly blew myself up, and thought, "Good God, this weapon sucks."  So I sold it to one of the train station robot vendors for a pittance.  Never seen one drop since.
---
Absolutely amazing ideas and great post.... Points out that Bethesda seriously needs to overhaul the game. Shame that they laid out a DLC map before the base game could be where everyone wanted
---
Nvmmmxc vc
---
I can sell you one for 50k caps.
---
If you've never left the vault how do you know the challenges are broken?
---
Take a break
---
That won't trigger Forbidden Knowledge though. And you used to be able to sell one that you had stored to the vendor and buy it back and it would start the quest. But that doesn't work anymore either.
---
Well, not all people can talk all the time. People have noisy families, children, pets, they can be shy, they can be playing while everyone else are asleep, they can even not have a mic or be disabled. And still all of them should be able to communicate with other players. Bubbles won't be worse than huge emotions icons we already have in game. Plus there are lots of ways to implement text chat in game, those are only ways I've seen working nice in other games.
---
I do not have many possibilities. They kill me right away.
---
I think for events with bosses, it's best to just give the legendary via reward rather than looting. 
---
More so with Imposter Sheepsquatch, the corpse always disappears or gets stuck underground. And there's been a couple times, even though I have dealt damage, the SBQ drops nothing like I haven't.
---
Ps4 has trophies, i didnt get that trophy or the level 10 trophy until i made the new character
---
What sort of damage does the pistol pull with both rifle and pistol card stacks?
---
already found one who paint it for me. ty for your response!
---
It felt like this. Only that they jumped up and bit me several times on my journey from the Vault to Watoga. I would stand still for 30 seconds as mentioned in another comment but they would just burrow and dissapear and reappear later. When they started bugging me while I was shopping I last encountered them at the Top of the World. But alas they were still targeting me deep underground and waiting for the right moment.
---
Agreed.
---
The scorchbeast race template has the keywords ActorTypeCreature, ActorTypeAnimal, ActorTypeScorched and ActorTypeScorchbeast.
---
Assuming that enemies inherit the keywords from their race, both Scorchbeasts and SB queens should be all of those. That means they'd be affected by Scorched Killer receivers, as well as Hunter and Zealot legendaries.
---
Harold wasn't much of a fight though. You either stopped his heart or you could set him on fire lol
---
I was going to buy the cheap EU codes, but wasn't sure if they are region locked or not.  Sounds like they might not be...   I ended up getting it from Amazon as well cheaper than retail.
---
I'll let you have this one, you seem like you need a win.  Good luck with puberty and  have fun as a future incel.
---
The cavalry is coming to help dude. We need a name. Friend us and we will help you.
---
How do you get to level 10 without ever having left the vault? The vault has maybe ten minutes of content, and enough to get you to level 2 by the time you exit. What are you doing inside there to get to level 10?
---
I have heard theories it could be Vivian Garrahan, as well. I love the idea of it heing wither of these.
---
Because how is pointing out what is already good gonna solve the problems? You give more emphasis to what is bad and what doesn‚Äôt more then there is a higher likelihood that things will change. This sub is barely a healthy mix it‚Äôs an inconsistent mess that can‚Äôt decide what it wants but the majority will collectively defend the game if anyone but them complain.
---
the REAL apex predator üòÇ
---
Wanting to see if you still have 50 TSE Gauss Rifles with 250 Damage Resistance During Reload? 
---
Seriously though...have you contacted Bethesda?  Even though it says the decision is final and calls it a "rare in game item" maybe they can vote on it or explain their decision more?
---
Just listen for the heavy breathing ;)
---
God. I would love to have a tattered cloak and weathered rebreather outfit. Holy crap that would look badass.
---
Depends.  
---
I‚Äôm a 1H melee build,
---
I used a vampire machete from L20-45.
---
45-78 has been L45 cultist blade, L45 blade of Bastet, and (IDK the level) 1* vampire switchblade.  
---
Black diamond also does reasonably well.
---
Out of power armor (rarely now), I liked the mutants death claw gauntlet, but has speed issues in a mob.
---
I‚Äôve tried the Super sledge and AA grognak axe (2H), but again, are too slow when in a mob.
---
For questions of effectiveness: 
---
Did a solo kill of a 1* Legendary sheepsquatch last night with a 1* vampire switchblade (modded with serrated blade).
---
(And a week or so ago L91 glowing death claw with same weapon.)
---
Lets not even talk about Crickets. üòÇ
---
These would make badass stickers. Great artwork!
---
What system are you guys on?
---
I got bloodied explosive railway
---
They will probably in the future follow you across servers.
---
I can't say for sure, but I'd suspect that region locks are in place.  I'd check around to be sure, or if you use a good VPN it might not be an issue.  Not my area of expertise unfortunately.
---
I just hope they dont advertise them as challenging as they did with the burrows cause they had no challenge
---
Logic would be they could only do it in dirt. How they dig through concrete foundations?
---
If they want me to keep getting stuff for my camp from the Atomic shop, sooner or later, they will need to up my budget.
---
That‚Äôs because there is a glitch where if you load into the game in excavator armor it gives you+200 excavator bonus. As soon as you get out you will lose that extra 100 lbs next time you get back in it.
---
Congrats!! One of the best outfits in the game.  I wear mine with the BOS hat and surgical mask or the green hood with a different colored bandana.  Still trying to get the longshoreman outfit.
---
Sell your legendary item for legendary caps (scrip) and use that caps to buy legendaries. Sounds pretty straightforward, they want everyone to have easy access to their dream Legendaries.
---
Have you proved that? Because many effects do appear to stack per pellet, including cripple rolls and condition loss.
---
Don't they already the rewards by just tagging the SBQ then running out to loot the body anyway?
---
Weird you refuse to backup a claim you made while wanting others to believe you're always right about everything.
---
15 mules is outrageous. I and numerous others have played since beta and haven't seen a claim like yours.
---
There are planters like everywhere. I wish we could make a green house or something. I'm not good with settlement building, but I sure would love to put more time into it than what I'm limited with. 
---
Guess I'll have to get creative.
---
I saw the Flatwoods Monster once a while back when I was like around level 20s. But he teleported away before I could get to him
---
Awesome! I'm still searching. Will update if I find it
---
I do. I‚Äôll tutorial you on how to get it but I won‚Äôt give you any.
---
one more thing. auto pacifist disabling if you choose to contest a workshop. that way you can fight back without having to scramble to turn off pacifist mode in the event that you forget it is on
---
Yeah it sucks it took me about 20 photos for it to register. You‚Äôve got to be close to it and just run around it snapping pics until one of them counts.
---
A quantity slider for crafting for ammo or chems.
---
Brotherhood of Steel Anti-Air turret counts as turret
---
they are when its all the same item
---
Your account will be banned forever. Accept it.
---
That could be what happened. I've had a ridiculous amount of stuff until recently and I was always in my excavator suit
---
Because you duped the ammo?
---
Things that sound mildly pornographic for 200, please.
---
Man I just love them pine trees
---
Fuck. Yes.
---
Stable Flux and screws
---
Other than raider requiring pvp i love these ideas.
---
Maybe have ears drop from crowned enemies at raider camps as a pve option
---
Its frustrating when you kill a 3* Legendary and get 1-2*, i think 3* should drop 3* otherwise theres no point in habing different * enemies that all drop just worthless items
---
Absolutely
---
That pond has a good chance to spawn legendaries, and there's a soda machine right in front of the concession stand for your Nukashine and Nuka grenades!
---
That is what I have done, for now.
---
From now on I will keep an eye on what is the 'dis OP, plz nerf' build du jour in PvP and avoid it like the plague.
---
Said that as much as I blindly hope to be wrong I have a gut wrenching feeling bloodied will be next.
---
Maybe I will get lucky and they will sink their teeth of VATS crits builds first and in the meanwhile tomahawks or vampiric plasma Gatlings will be the new cause for concern and I will "survive" a couple of patches.
---
Hahaha
---
I honestly didn‚Äôt. I bought it from vendors or crafted it myself
---
... My whole question was is it possible for me NOW. As I saw many people being able to a long time after the 30 day limit.
---
Yall unlucky. I got one about a month after launch. And I've gotten quite a few more since then, and I don't even religiously farm. Maybe once a week on whitesprings or harpers ferry
---
Just google. Why ask us to write a whole resource for you that's already out there?
---
I recently decided to take a break, and come back later. Started playing Morrowind for the first time. 
---
Then they announced the release date for player vending and legendary vendor so looks like I'm coming back sooner than I thought.
---
No you didn't.
---
Yeah.. Stay gone. You duped.
---
All you need is med-x and a vampires weapon ;)
---
Got my first TSae drop at roughly level 210. I feel you. But that being said it makes those high tier legendaries feel very rewarding once you get one
---
Considering it's a secondary slot effect that you can only get on regular or heavy ballistic guns, which are only a small percentage of potential items that can be legendary, yeah it makes sense that it's so rare if you think about it.
---
Darn I play PS4 but thx anyway
---
Beg to differ. Trading discord is full of people trying to buy BE badly, upwards of 40k for certain ones.
---
Dude you have to understand, that these questions get asked dozens and dozens of times per day up to a point where it‚Äôs getting super annoying. Please do a quick search on this sub yourself and you‚Äôll find all answers you‚Äôre looking for. There are tons of threads like this.
---
yeah that's my concern, it's a thing that *only* drops during fasnacht, which is over
---
So why make it an ingredient in a recipe that drops weeks after fasnacht is over

lol.  wow.  looks like the FO community has really gone to shit, eh mate?  
---
it's called a message board bro.  i'm here for the interaction and people's thoughts.  If I wanted to go be a pleb, I'd set IGN.com as my homepage.  But thank you for your pointless comment - speaking of wasting time.
---
I almost always have one spawn in around the golf course in Grafton if that helps any.
---
Why are people acting like it's hard to craft that much ammo lmao? Super Duper and Ammosmith, really isn't that hard to get this much ammo. If he plays enough getting all of that in a MONTH is easy as hell. I'd understand if he got that much ammo in a day or two but a month? There's no telling if the ammo was duped or not. A lot can be done in a month.
---
I wouldn't over react bro.  Either you can contribute to the thread or you can ignore it.  Thanks hope you find the help you need.
---
Stabby McOwlface.
---
Sell what exactly?
---
You're not wanted in this game anyway so don't even bother .
---
starting?  lmao...  i quit on like 2nd week.
---
mind explaining what it means then?
---
Captain Owl
---
See how much a vendor sells it for vs how much they pay for it and split the difference.
---
Quests on all characters. Exploration. Events. Farm for gear / build.
---
lol.  you hanger-ons are real sensitive about the reality that this game was shit upon release.  quite the remarkable thing I'm witnessing in this sub at the moment.
---
Oof, Hurricane Sandy. Not a lot of good memories here. I thought my town had it rough afterwards but that changed when I visited Sandy Hook. Place was a ghost town. Everything was completely devastated. I saw a boat that was thrown into a house. Random stuff littered the streets. Absolutely nobody around for miles, except for the occasional other drivers passing through. The town was all but abandoned for the time being, save for one Dunkin Donuts that was still open (for some reason)
---
Nowadays they're doing much better, but god was that pretty depressing to see
---
Black Widowl
---
Press enter.
---
I would totally be into a railway rifle if I could put a suppressor on it.  Even though its only effective half the time, Covert Operative is such a dramatic boost that I keep it equipped full time so as not to forget to pop it back on.  It would be nice if its effect also worked while cloaked and/or in shadows, like shadowed armor mods.
---
"but the market is starting to get to a point where you have to have the best gear possible to get the best gear,"
---
This is getting me. It's still really hard for me, at like level 110, to take down harder enemies, or groups of level 68 enemies consistantly. But, that is exactly what it takes to get the gear I need to make that easier. But it's more than that. Beat enemies, need ammo, so spend hours grinding for plastic. Make Ammo. Beat more enemies. Fix gun. Beat more enemies, need ammo, more grinding for plastic. And sometimes grinding for caps because I do want to get plans to upgrade weapons and armor and they cost a ton.
---
buying, yeah. not selling as far as I know. not in the market at least.
---
I think there is a way to nerf it without nerfing it.   Damage stats and legendary effects can stay the same but they can change how perks and legendary effects interact with it. 
---
Tank Killer, for example ignores not just armor, but also a percentage of protection offered by legendary effects.
---
I‚Äôd really like a better way to say ‚Äúhey kicking off an event come help‚Äù.
---
the 3 min announcement prior to a nuke is good. Be good to see that on Encryptid and a way to announce other events as well.
---
We also need more events like that.
---
No left is a normal scorchbeast
---
That's a fair point but again there's gonna be prestige. So those areas of the map will become viable places to go to again for a time until you get to lvl 50 again but I'm going to assume there will be multiple levels of prestige. Unless you're not gonna participate in prestiging your character I guess.

She's more of a gray.

At the moment I am trying to run the quests with my new character and just completed Mistress of Mystery. I never did that many quests with the other character so thought I should do them now.
---
The problem is that I start with a task for the quest and always get sidetracked really fast while exploring. After a while I‚Äôm out of Stimpaks, healing salve or ammo so I head back to camp to restock. Then it‚Äôs the same all over again!
---
And that's the problem. They can't tell if it's duped or not. It's an unfortunate side effect when dealing with dupers. Since they can't tell the difference, some legitimate players will also get caught in the bunch. Sadly since you can't prove anything. You have no choice. Just consider it lost and move on. If it's that easy to make more, then make more on a new account?.
---
They did do stuff, lots off stuff. Mostly good, some not so good, some quite contentious. Hope this helps.

Patch 9 comes out on Tuesday
---
You can always just hop into your suit then server hop to get the extra 100 lbs back. I used to live in PA 24/7 bc of that glitch but now I‚Äôm constantly overweight anyways so it doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Following. If anyone has one for Xbox pls :(
---
We need a reason to revisit lower level areas.
---
My AAE Gatling gun is immaturely named Crank N Spank.
---
The crap has hit the fan
---
I love bloodied gatling, i have a one star and use it indoor all the time and never worry about blowing myself up.
---
Screech?
---
I'm 369 and have found (5) explosive weapons and zero TSE's, I had more than 5,000 Legendaries in my first 8 weeks, so accept the RNG gods and know they love down and hate others.   
---
1) False, completely.  
---
2) Partially true, as only 3*'s have a chance to drop 3*'s... 
---
3) More Legendary enemies = more chances, but "good" to "God-Tier" are valuable for a reason.   
---
4) Generally Max level drops in UF are 35 - 40, but especially for armor, one tier from top level means nothing...  
---
Heavy Combat armor at level 40 is DR 17.  
---
Heavy Combat armor at level 50 is DR 20.   
---
Does the 3 points really matter?
---
How is it shared? When I pick up a gun or ammo on top of a shelf she claims she can't see it anymore. Or is it only for containers such as boxes?
---
Stash space is now 800. There‚Äôs multiple new quests and events. The game is a lot more stable now. 
---
This Tuesday they are releasing player vending and the first part of the legendary vendor. You can scrap your legendaries to get script usable when the vendor is released.
---
The ‚ÄúEver Upwards‚Äù questline is being released and introducing backpacks into the game this Tuesday also.
---
I‚Äôm not overreacting, I‚Äôm giving you facts. I didn‚Äôt even insult you or said anything mean. So why don‚Äôt YOU stop overreacting?
---
Mine is at 256 damage
---
Didnt think so
---
My man hahaha copy and paste. Save this !! Post it everytime someone asks haha
---
I have a decked out version of the same one! In the mire right
---
Come back we miss you
---
good to know - thanks
---
50 Stabs of Gray
---
I don't mind just  hopping to another server.
---
That sounds pretty sweet.  Thanks.
---
Yea. I personally experience none of these frequently, and my dad, who is on PS4, doesn't either.
---
yea near the crashed plane  ;)
---
ps4 id Dared2Play
---
They can tell the difference. There was some dude who recorded himself crafting 100k ammo in 2 weeks.
---
No ban for him.
---
All these "i was banned for no reason" people are simply lying.
---
'Easy access'... Hmmm... Given how much faffing is involved in getting something as mundane as a couple of calibrated shocks for the x-01 I think that is a little bit on the optimistic side...
---
I hope you've started seeking help.  This reaction is abnormal.  Thanks.
---
It boggles my mind that they created a PvP mode but intentionally kept troll mode in Adventure just to annoy as many players as possible.  This is the only reason I can think of to explain why Adventure still encourages trolls.
---
People are speculating the Purveyor is going to allow you to make Power Armor gain Legendary stats or she will sell those types of pieces. I don't think she will sell things in a typical fallout way.
---
I look at the challenges and see if there are any quick atoms to be earned(not anymore apparently), then do a quick run at WS just to see if there's any good loot in the vendors, then farm the ghouls once, then choose a random point on the map and start walking in any direction.
---
There's so many good games to play right now, putting that many hours in any one game definitely means you're missing out on a lot of other adventures.
---
Personally I usually have 3-6 games in circulation to play depending on mood and when I get tired of one. Even though I'm only gaming maybe 10-15 hours on a good week.
---
You can get a ton of toxic soot flowers in the Toxic Waste.
---
Whatever. ‚úåüèª
---
That is absolutely monstrous. The Railway Rifle is easily one of my favorite guns from the series. Luckyyyy~
---
You might be on to something
---
Anti-material rifle  with explosive rounds. 
---
Who wants to hunt?
---
You should add some commentary. I struggle with getting ideas for camps so hearing you talk about your ideas and inspirations would be really cool.
---
That's what I do as well, they want you to engage, I might even tease them with the pvp emote but still not engage .. I still block and report them for unsupported behaviour, I know it does nothing but it feels good :)
---
"Make more on a new account" What about their gear/time spent into this game? Just lost for playing the game legit. They need a better way to monitor this because banning people that are making a certain amount of ammo within a pretty long time frame is ridiculous. If they're able to tell how much ammo was made in a month they should be able to tell how much was made within let's say a week or two. A month is just far too long to accuse someone of duping.
---
finally found the plan , was drop by sheepsqhach, it was a throwing weapon, so i got the 80 atoms..)
---
have fun guys ! and girls !
---
- 1. I have heard that rumor too and have done it that way for a large percentage of my gameplay. I don't do it enough to say one way or another but it doesn't hurt to try.
---
- 2. 3 stars just means that that is the best they can drop, not that they will.
---
- 3. Horde events I hear are the way to go for better chances. 
---
- 4. I still do Uranium Fever and West Tek though when I feel like looking.
---
Not the answers you may be looking for and hope the more knowledgeable amongst us can help. Best of luck.
---
I thought about doing that. I haven't got the mutation adrenaline reaction yet just because I didnt want to lose the 50 health but I know if I did and then used radiation to keep my health low I would do even more damage. So far I haven't really needed it. The main reason I have been hesitant is I dont want a scorchbeast to one shot me. Right now I can kill them pretty fast plus if I get it and find I dont want it then I have to buy all my serums all over again so I've decided to go without it for now.
---
Ok, I added you.  Now entering the wasteland to get my mothman egg fix on.  üòâ
---
If you are talking about the 'regular' ones (paramedic jumpsuit, police, fire breather) quickest way is to roll a new character.
---
I have never seen them drop or spawn 'in the wild' but you should be able to get all of them with a new character in 3-5 hours tops.
---
Huh, seems like NA keys go for 60 bucks while EU keys are 20... Any reason why? Also, i imagine the EU keys are for EU servers only?
---
I'm not proposing that the penalty be removed. As of now, if someone chooses to leave their junk behind or try to retrieve it, it's a conscious choice following the consequences of dying. 
---
I'm recommending that we allow players that have been robbed of that opportunity by another player that chance to do so directly  and force scavengers to consider the potential consequences of their choice to loot someone's bag after they die.
---
As of right now there is no risk to this. When a player is killed in pvp, the revenge mechanism at least gives the dead one a chance to choose between trying to get their stuff back or not. This would be no different. 
---
Why should a dead player's loot be any more free because you didn't shoot them yourself?
---
Yeah pretty sure I read people were killing them .. but yeah I hit him with my TSE and nothing .. which is good news .. the NPC's do enough damage, glad they changed it if it were like that before ..
---
I enjoy urban exploration, and a lot of times when I'm lurking in an old east coast factory it feels like I'm in the game. With 76 being my other hobby, I've recently had to remind myself that I'm actually participating in real life and test floors/stairs before committing them to my body weight.
---
Was there for SBQ last night and I was doing constant damage. Once it fell I got the loot from the Event but no exp from her and there was nothing to loot. Her inventory was empty. This is the only bug I have encountered in this game that is this terrible and noteworthy. It really shouldn‚Äôt be possible.
---
It's coming in two part's pal
---
There's a search box right on top. And, surprisingly enough, [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) has tons of info.
---
Hey buddy, you just blow in from stupid town?
---
what pisses me off is that this is possible but yet stacking stairs isn't, god forbid I want to have a tower of power, yet someone can have a floating house
---
Pretty much, yeah.
---
Well so much for our friendly community. 
---
Camps no longer are overwritten. There is a new option that If you spawn in with someone established in your spot, you can either stay or try a different lobby. Also as more missions are added you may find fewer areas to build. 
---
Camp budget has been tinkered with and feels bigger without actually being bigger. . 
---
Stash space has doubled. 
---
New content with questionable appeal. Free range is good, encryptid has multiple issues, burrows is disappointing, fun camera glitch. 
---
Old bugs are fixed, new ones popped up. Net result is still fewer bugs than at start. 
---
Pvp is slowly being restricted in the original "adventure mode" Pretty soon the only way to be griefed will involve workshops. Pvp"survival" mode is in beta and going through changes.
---
I have been playing about 3 weeks, I hit a similar thing around level 27  to 30, It was mostly sorted by venturing out of the forest. Yeah you will get creatures trying to nibble your dangly bits but that happens. Explore, Do events, Do side quests. I found once I hit about 31 it started to feel less of a grind because I was now exploring a larger area.
---
Where are you spending most of your time? At your level, I would recommend you exploring/doing events/taking workshops in the toxic valley, Savage divide, and the ash heap.
---
Ahh, gotcha.  However, if potential damage doesn't land, then it isn't worth it.  At least to me.
---
But when a scorch beast queen is so big, well, the pointbis moot I suppose.
---
Agreed.  I'd be perfectly fine if an actual *** enemy was much rarer, but always dropped *** gear.  It's so disappointing to get a berserker's machete or nocturnal wooden leg from a *** gutsy.
---
The hunters longcoat? If so, what platform are you on? I‚Äôm on Xbox, and I‚Äôll give you mine
---
It was shit at release. Not now. You don't deserve a refund anymore, missed your chance. You are simply a hater.
---
Yeah Sandy Hook got hit bad.
---
I have seen him multiple times at the pond  just south west of the vault .. I am going to start my search there, more than once. Also saw him south of Point Pleasant (Mothman Town) in the forest area), so I will head there if I can't get him at the pond. He spawns all over, every from Huntersville south to the bottom of them map, also saw him near Harpersferry in the forrest between HF and the Red Rocket .. it's random
---
I'm sure you can make ammo, that's not in question. I'm saying they can't prove it. How would they tell the difference between your dupped ammo and my crafted ammo? I'd imagine they are identical. Hence legitimate players getting banned along with duppers.
---
I get what you're saying but I just don't really see an incentive to nuke anywhere else. Whitesprings gets tons of XP, loot,  and flux.
---
SBQ is the same with the added bonus of more loot from the event (sometimes).
---
Nowhere else comes close for farming purposes as far as speed/ efficiency.
---
I wear mine with the Sentry Bot Helmet. Looks cool and acts as a gas mask.
---
When I say your post, Aten_Ra's comment wasn't visible. I would totally trust him more than I, based on his amount of gameplay.
---
I'll buy it from you now (if you're on PC).
---
The meta immediately becomes Berserkers with no armor but Perk Cards. Plus side, low point of entry. Down side, everyone does it.
---
I personally might say that the limit is about lvl 70 (if you have a bunch of low lvl cards that need replacing) but yeah stats don't change after lvl 50 only thing more lvls really show is more time which normally means better gear.
---
And with the damage scaling as it is there may even be some advantages to going up against someone as a lower lvl with the best gun you can get hold of for that lvl
---
You‚Äôre welcome. There‚Äôs several factors that could lead up to it but she shouldn‚Äôt be more then a couple levels higher at any point. The game still has its bugs but thankfully, the game is finally playable.
---
Thanks for clearing that up.
---
You can sell it to vendors, they nerfed the price, but still worth something .. not sure about other flowers ..
---
I've found stuff in the overseers box a few times when I started my mule. It was apparent that the items were left by another player
---
They‚Äôll remain after you log out. Anyone can pick them up if they search that container. I suggest the cabins near vault 76 and maybe the bus to the right after exiting the vault.
---
I feel like we should shave Todd Howard's head, march him through the village while shouting "SHAME!  SHAME!  SHAME!"
---
Of course, we all play the game in different ways. I get tired of the grind, I get kind of depressed doing the same shit I need some kind of variation. That being said I grind crafting for profit and workshops for XP (for low level alts) so you know, pick and choose.
---
I think so.  I used to see it somewhat frequently a few months ago and now it's almost never.  Just my anecdotal evidence tho, I think I've seen others say the same though.
---
Okay good to know. I didn‚Äôt know that only way to get a 3 star item was from a 3 star enemy. I also hated waiting for the enemies health to refill so glad I don‚Äôt have to worry about that anymore. Thanks for the reply, it helped me out.
---
Glad to help, here for you man.
---
Gather lots of steel and aluminum. Go to a workshop with a vertibird pad. (You don't have to own workshop). Build said bird. Shoot it down. Rinse &amp; repeat. Birds are about 300-350 xp each
---
Okay I will try out some Horde events. Willing to try anything at this point. Thank you.
---
Just do a quick WestTek run and pick up all the guns.  You'll get a fuckton
---
Is Mutant‚Äôs also applied after everything else?
---
So cool!
---
You're absolutely right.  And it's not just Fallout these days.  Every game feels like a grind of doing the same shit over and over. 
---
I just wish their were more viable options in this game in particular.  I want to have options for Scorched Earth type events.  Not just the SBQ.
---
Yeah, what tradey said. Someone made a reddit walk through on the quickest way to do it with new characters. Can't remember his name tho
---
Take over the dirt track and you can mine it there.  I go set this up then shoot down to agriculture center and clear the farm hands.  They drop lead, aluminum, and steel.  You can also usually pick up a few fire caps in the basement.  Work my way back up the river collecting blood leaf, soot flower,and snap tail.  Craft a bunch of healing salves, disease cure, and then shoot back up to dirt track and collect aluminum.  Do this very so often to keep my crafting junk up and have surplus of healing salves.
---
What do you mean land? When you're ADS, TS is treated as a single projectile that simply has +25% damage. When you're hip firing, TS is treated as two projectiles of 62.5% of regular damage.
---
Regardless if you're maximizing TS potential, it's still not even near the best, so why use it?
---
Yeah I killed one at Top of the World also
---
Stick to the high level areas, Mire and Cranberry Bog, for sure.
---
Well they've been trying hard to please everyone while still maintaining some RNG factors in the game. They increased stash size several times, made PA mod plans easily available and now placed all vendors in the farming central, all because of player complaints. I'm sure they will make legendary farming a thing of the past. Collect a few legendary rolling pins, sell them for scrips, and buy your dream lever action, that's the road map they've planned for us. 
---
The only downside I can see is there will be fewer and fewer people playing since there won't be anything to grind for after everyone has got their god tier stuff.
---
That'd be cool.  Maybe an option for group loot too?
---
New Pip-Boy hoot dis?
---
Well it's not outlandish to think that they can connect a few dots. 
---
I remember seeing on youtube so duping method that involved crafting lots of knifes so the server lags out. Is it that stupid to assume that they have a way of checking for such abnormal behavior?
---
If you look at the screenshot op posted you'll see that the first line is 
---
&gt;This account has violated the TOS by **exploiting a system issue that results in item duplication**.
---
That's the reason for the ban, not owning 100k+ items. The 100k+ items are the proof bethesda used.
---
It's what World of Warcraft veterans call their alts
---
I disagree yeah most are mature but last night I played with some guys that were just using racial slurs every 10 seconds like WTH.
---
Yeah vault 76 area or suitcases in train stations
---
What platform? I‚Äôm on PS4 and don‚Äôt have an issue with consumables. Most of my crashes are after I get done crafting and try to use another crafting bench/stash or right after a fast travel.
---
I know I had a lot of issues when I had my stock PS4 hard drive. Sony didn‚Äôt put good ones in. What seems to help my crashes the most is that pretty much after each patch, I uninstall the game and redownload it. I found that Bethesda isn‚Äôt very good with patching and causes some of the files to become corrupt.
---
why assume the bad?
---
this can be an equivalent of the steam workshop for mods.
---
(current mods from nexus can be cheating, like lock sweetspot exposure, or glowing cap stashes, they can be verified by beth if deployed on their side)
---
Depends on the build
---
Overseers camp, the cashe box or the tool box
---
We've been using a policeman uniforms for these challenges. Try Morgantown Airport, inside one of the military tents.
---
I've been wandering around the forest, down in Ash Heap and the Savage Divide, but they kick my ass quite regularly. Quest wise I'm on the Blackwater Bandits part of Key To The Past, but I think I'm a little under levelled for it. 
---
I explored a lot of Toxic Valley when I first started (managed to complete the Kidsafe quest quite easily) but haven't been back in a while. Might have a gander and workshops might be a good shout as I haven't done many of those.
---
It might come with time. Technically the game is only really beyond beta standard as of two patches ago. I hit a wall a while back and actually reinstalled FO4 and New Vegas thinking it would give me that old hit I got from classic Fallout. But I was back within a day...
---
I agree with you there, but problem is they don't currently have better monitoring in effect. They probably just have a generic check for all items equal to or greater to 100k in less than 30 days.
---
They can simply port some planters from FO4. Probably trying to figure out how much are we going to pay for them in the cash shop...
---
There are no 'regionalised' servers in that sense.
---
The restriction is that it needs to be activated within the EMEA region.
---
You might be able to get away with using a VPN to activate the key. Once you have done that you can launch the game unrestricted.
---
I am not sure but from what I have seen there is a %damage requirement on the SBQ and Imposter Sheepsquach.  I got to a Queen run after final prepping another silo for a second a nuke only tagging the queen with about 20 rounds in the ass from my TSE handmade.  I got the end of quest rewards but there was nothing on the queen for me to loot.  
---
Before it is asked you can prep a silo, fast travel, and come back to finish launching.  The longest we did this was for about 20 minutes.  But anyone can go into the silo and launch your missile also.
---
That's pretty sweet I love the glowing one the most I'll prolly get some later when I get home.
---
Also love your RuneScape drawing too lol played that from like 2004 on and off till a couple years ago
---
It's crazy. The fact that other people above us in this thread are talking about buying and selling weapons for 25k+ is beyond me. I got a full time job and 2 kids. Ain't nobody got time for all that.
---
Thanks for this - I was just hitting a bit of a wall so it's good it's not just me, I feel a bit more inspired to push through if its only for now.
---
Nice, I call mine Stabby the Legend.
---
Late 20s to 40 are probably the most grindy. Personally I would do some whitespring loops to get through those levels more quickly and then go back to normal gameplay but it's not for everyone.
---
Happened to me, what fixed it was getting into a team and letting your teammate go on first. After that, I could go in :)
---
I‚Äôve got a BE combat shotty I‚Äôve been holding onto for just this issue. Was hoping I could keep using my quad explosive double barrel instead, but thems the breaks I guess.
---
Yeah though when you first push out of the forest expect some challenges. My first fight in toxic valley was against a deathclaw and 3 yao gai...it did not end well...
---
Don't see much wiggle room in "This decision is final, and no further appeals will be considered."
---
What... what does you being a girl have to do with any of this? To be clear, I'm not a gamer dude trying to be accusatory, I'm also a girl, and I'm genuinely baffled.
---
Yea, I agree. I got tired of the boring White Walls so I built my camp inside out. I've got the brick on the inside and the white on the outside.
---
I loaded into a train station, and the vendor was gone and the door was open, I could walk inside. It was weird, another person came by and was using the vendor just fine, but it was invisible to me.
---
Can‚Äôt accidentally sell a god-roll since I never got one :/
---
I wouldn‚Äôt suggest eating the candy. For all you know, Chester the molester joined fallout and managed to get the only working van with tinted windows from the dev room. Fallout doesn‚Äôt have abortion clinics, so travel with care.
---
I‚Äôm pretty inconsistent i swap and change cards as it suits me. What cards are good for AAE build?
---
Maybe I just pushed out of the Forest a bit too early. I've been out to the edge of The Mire so that probably explains why I'm getting mullered. Standard Mole Miners are sort of at the top of my level at the moment.
---
Here's your screenshot, i edited it a bit to show you some bits you ignored.
---
1. The reason for your ban was exploiting some system issue; NOT owning 100k+items. 
---
2. The decision is final.
---
https://i.imgur.com/55PY8n4.jpg
---
I dont know maybe I should though. What do you think?
---
What is tenderizer?
---
I wanted to know this as well so I could figure out what junk to keep and plan ahead. But I don't think it exists anywhere. If you can specify some items I can check for you.
---
Pa or no pa?
---
Yeah I'm a rifle build.  I swear the game knows what I want because I have gotten a few maybe not god  tier but realy f'in good melee and heavy drops too lol. My best is a 1* AP Handmade for guns that my character can use.
---
+1 for collective knowledge on a hobby we all enjoy!
---
Yup, except this has been an issue for donkeys, not just for the last month.
---
Only this morning I experience a CTD for daring to quench my thirst.
---
Said that, irritating as it is - more so because if you crash while you have active dailies kiss them goodbye until the following day - I only encounter this like once per playing session.
---
I have made it a habit to never use consumables of any kind between triggering and completing the Camden Park daily.
---
Yeah I just hit 41 and can now take care of most of the ghouls at whitespring if I dont get ganged up on.
---
Means hey girl want some candy while I take photos of you then cure your skin in salt to preserve it only to wear it later as he listens to 80s pop music...
---
I mean yeah creepy
---
I think that‚Äôs a great idea that would add an entirely new social component to this game.
---
I have never found one before either. Lots of 2 shots, 4 explosive guns. Never a tse
---
Stuff that doesn‚Äôt depend on low health ie adrenal reaction, bolstering ,ect.. 
---
For aae , you want to use either unyielding or assassins for the most part with some qol pieces mixed
---
Same. Never got one. Always separate. But somehow everyone else has one. Got mowed down earlier by one.
---
Limited to workshop area. Yes. 
---
Should have rewards. No. 
---
Do you know how easy that would be exploited? Just spam those all day long with a friend. And if a cool down was implemented it would defeat the purpose of workshops, essentially making the players workshop invincible/un-contestable doing the cool down period. And if the cool down period wasn't substantial then it could still be spammed.
---
Okay, I'll try
---
Agreed there are some of them around. But for me in EU, I've only heard 3-4 people in 300 hours talk toxic. I'm not kidding. 1 of them talked bad at me directly, the rest at the Scorchbeast Queen. So that's my experience and what I can share. Hopefully you'll meet less or none at all of those people again.
---
I see what players are hanging around flatwoods and make them presents to what ever level they are, sometimes its armors sometimes guns I also give a lot of upgraded under-armors.
---
How the hell did he get the bag placed just so?!
---
I call my favorite instigating shotgun Ol' Slappy. I don't know why, just seemed to fit. Also have one called Furious AF.
---
Say that to a swarm of Cazadores. Even at my highest levels, I used to snipe them from as far away as I could and the pointy-assed motherfuckers would STILL find me and fuck my shit up.
---
I assume you are not doing PVP since you want to use  power armor?
---
Yeah. You're their base for the classic Fallout experience. 
---
To be fair though, this game was marketed as something new. Similar but not identical to a classic Fallout experience. 
---
They are going to provide a mix of challenges that promote their vision for the game they wanted to make. Not around the game you want it to be.
---
How about this situation that actually happened to my team-mates and I today.  
---
We're happily doing our thing in adventure mode, I notice a guy with a 40 cap bounty on the map, so I fast travel back to my camp to remove the rad shower just in case.  While we're all doing Collision Course in our responder gear, he starts wrecking my house.  I leave it alone since I'm busy and the rad shower is in storage anyways.  Almost immediately after, a nuke drops on Fissure Prime.  Guess who's there?  There's also a camp with the maximum amount of low level turrets set up as close to Delta as possible.  The guy still has a large bounty and at least a portion of the server starts gunning for him, which is when everything went completely off the rails.
---
Joe Grief and his buddies actually teamed up to launch a nuke and draw the server's high level players to one spot, make a camp that would prevent the queen from ever landing, and used the fact that players would likely be in pacifist mode and accidentally damage the fragile camp to create an epic cap collection fest for themselves.  They relentlessly griefed the majority of the server for who knows how long before everyone figured out what was happening.  I personally got one-shotted three times and lost 200+ caps each time, and both of my pals did as well.  I figured out what was happening pretty fast and alt+f4'ed out before I lost even more money.  One of my teammates got super pissed and tried to get some revenge with her bloodied unarmed build and some stealthboys, but these guys were geared up with sentinel armor.  She had no chance.
---
Guessing that there were probably a dozen players at the site on a Sunday afternoon, those bastards got rich AF, not to mention the loot bags.
---
I have to give them credit for the most diabolical creativity I've seen in 76 so far.
---
Put it in a world container and take it back out.  Might take a couple tries but it'll trigger for you.
---
In the middle of transitioning away from P.A. 
---
rocking 2 bits of bolstering armour and rest 2-3 Star Unyielding. All is either combat, robot or marine. Also have nerd rage so more of a bloodied build right now. But I‚Äôm interested to know what AA builds look like
---
I was mostly just being silly. I saw the post the other day where someone left a bag of shit on some dudes bed, and thought it was funny that shortly after I saw that someone left me a bag in the exact same manner with somewhat interesting things in it lol.
---
Purchase what you you want. Yesterday I traded for 2 assassin sentinel pieces &amp; since then I've picked up 5 assassin pieces off of enemies, unfortunately mostly leather &amp; not very good, but what you have can help determine what you get.  Look out at whitesprings resort/station &amp; watoga station for mercenaries off of the vendor.
---
Also search for decent servers, if you see a *** legendary outside of westek or multiple 3* legendaries at whitesprings, stay in that world &amp; grind, grind, grind. 
---
Some servers do produce more 3* items than others
---
If you constantly have low health and an unyielding set BE is better but AAE would be better over all.
---
I can get behind most of the ideas here to some degree with some caveats. 
---
If the workshop owner is inside the workshop zone when it is contested, the challenge should still result in immediate pvp enabling. This should be the intended source of tension and risk, as the benefits are being actively taken advantage of and thus should be subject to loss and protection. 
---
Outside the zone or across the map, a prompt to either forfeit immediately starting the claim timer is fine. This prevents remote sniper shenanigans and while it may lead to owners lingering on their borders hoping to get help or a better position to defend from, the claim process still works as intended, and the moment they set foot in the zone, pvp is enabled. 
---
The half hour cooldown for loss is arbitrarily throttling the potential defenders ability to assault claims. With the buffer created by the choice of being present or not, I think this solves a nonexistent problem. 
---
The caps penalty equalizing is fine. I think the incentives for Survival need to be increased dramatically, while not necessarily increasing the penalty. Doesn't have to be caps. But encouragement should be directly related to the play mode.
---
You go gurl
---
Ah, thank you!
---
It'll give you a good boost to your strength, and you can always swap aqua boy back in if you want to take a swim.
---
Oh, I see. The assortment of items they left seems very specific, so it's not just your typical "clearing out inventory" drop. I wonder what they were thinking! I've yet to have anything like this happen to me, but it'd definitely be funny to find.
---
I think the burrows is really good. Lots of enemies, tons of quality loot. It can be really difficult to find your bag if you die though.
---
For #4 the mobs can only drop their level and below . So for the mole miners 35/40 are the max they can drop
---
Actually experiencing a thing repeatedly has that effect on a person.
---
I'm not a very nice person so I was a bit miffed when a week after I managed to learn all the plans in the game - sans the Barbed Walking Cane which as of 1300+ hours I still have not found - which took much bartering, 'eventing', 'vendor/spawn looping', server hopping and digging the devs went ahead and put the majority them in the vendors anyway.
---
Said that I have the distinct feeling that finding a 'god roll' in that vendor will be as easy and straightforwad as getting a WS Jumpsuit.
---
Meow!
---
Can't wait to wait 5 years for my 50 quests to drop.
---
Or sit the fuck down while I spill some real tea
---
Its random
---
Yeah i agree
---
God this subreddit is arrogant as fuck. You think I would make this post if I duped? I wouldn‚Äôt be complaining because I would know why. But I‚Äôm sure you know better than me since you know everything right?
---
Same here! At first I was like, "Oh cool, I'm glad it's not shit and it's just some aid items" thinking maybe it was just a thank you for keeping my camp open for people to use. But, then I started thinking about how specific the items were and how odd it was lol. I probably didn't need to go into so much detail about my gender, but it seemed important to mention since the items were kind of oddly suggestive. lol
---
Lostkind, I'll do it for free
---
Yeah I would go for bloodied
---
Legit I didn‚Äôt. Bought it from vendors or crafted it myself. This subreddit community seems to think they know everything about everyone though.
---
As someone with 1100 hours played here is some advice. 
---
1. Create new characters. Why? It keeps you grinding and gives you challenge again. New characters also give you another CAMP to fiddle with. I have 5 characters. Each with their own specific build. I got 1 PA Heavy, 1 PvE melee, 1 weight reduction weapon hoarder, 1 PvP and 1 Pistol character. The fun part is you get 5 camps to use. Gives me a lot of variety and choice. I can also sell 1400 caps on each character, which gives me a lot of free cash to spend on things that seem expensive. Like bulk ballistic fibre or even Nuka-Cola's. 
---
2. You have to nerf yourself to make the game more interesting. I tend to run around in none legendary armor or even my hazard suit to crank up the difficulty. 
---
3. You need friends. I spend 90% of my time after hitting the 500 hour mark just talking to people. 
---
4. Seek out new friends to assist. 
---
5. Trading. 
---
6. Then last is PvP'ing even though balance is so bad. 
---
I hope once this whole "prestige system" comes along that will give the game some longevity but what im really hopeful for is a "wasteland" that is all scaled to end-game levels. I hope the "Nuclear Winter" thats suppose to come out is a challenging end-game playground where everything is level 100 and you get more interesting mechanics. Like wandering squads of enemies, heat/cold mechanics and just overall a more hardcore experience to keep you on your toes.
---
I run a cafe, in the location where Murgles the Cat can be found, called Coffee Time.

Ok, I‚Äôm jelly. I have a nearly standard railway rifle and it‚Äôs become my recent fave. I have so much fun with mine that I couldn‚Äôt imagine how much you‚Äôve had with this guy...that is until I watched your clips. Thanks for this throughly enjoyable post!

For anti armor you can make yourself a little more tanky
---
Is there a way to earn through events? I dont have the time to start a new character and find a way to transfer. Even if it takes longer id rather earn them through events
---
Wooaah. I'm Xbox. I'll be on tomorrow morning . Jeez .
---
I'm stuck for words !!!
---
You're correct.
---
I tend to fast travel to people of the relevant level then message them to tell them I‚Äôm dropping. Takes a little longer but at least I know people are getting decent stuff
---
PC, it may be platform specific.
---
You missed the part where they only determined I duped because I accumulated 100k ammo in 30 days. That‚Äôs 3,333 ammo crafted it bought per day. THATS EASY.
---
In addition to the barrel and recoil stock you can also unlock glow sights. I've built and scrapped dozens of them, so if there's another mod out there I'd be shocked.
---
Nice roll there bud,I have the bloodied one and had the quad a few days ago from a sheepsquatch event and I'll be taking the bloodied one to the vendee token thing.
---
I envy you in a sense that you have to make sure how much ammo and junk you got, im constantly selling bulked junk so i can get rid of excess scraps and plastic especially which weigh a ton. What i mean is id want this game to be a little more challenging.
---
In fact I'm on now üòÄ
---
Not that I know of. Only the first 2 or 3 missions after discovering Flatwoods. I'm always available to help anyone transfer on ps4. I have high karma.
---
**PSN xSlack_Jaws_420x**
---
Can you earn the regular and/or the rarer ones through events in the forest?
---
Pc sorry
---
If that one works for whatever OP wants it the regular policeman uniform often can be found in the various police stations.
---
I have seen it in the abandoned bog town police station in the bog and in the one that you visit in one of the taxidermy side quests.
---
Make a third character but they need to add more daily quest in all honesty.
---
Yes - many people who are proven duper‚Äôs make these ‚ÄúI‚Äôm innocent‚Äù posts every single day.
---
I‚Äôm sorry if you‚Äôre really not a super but it says in the text that it‚Äôs final and no appeals will be considered- time to make a new account and move on.
---
That's why its a clear exploit.
---
We still didn't get the foundation patch and this floating building has zero foundations. NOT working as intended.
---
I do have a ton of scrap I have to sell, but the problem is to bulk it requires plastic, and my hungry hungry shotgun needs that. And the problem with not having awesome weapons is it takes more shells, which means more time farming plastic. Which is SO boring.
---
It‚Äôs easy to accumulate 3,333 ammo per day. Whether it be by crafting or buying.
---
Great for you.
---
May i ask why are you commenting on this subreddit then?
---
Lol you really came back 15 hours after I didn't respond to make one finally argument for your boo oxhorn.
---
It's cool if your fav hates gay people.
---
Also try awol armaments in the cranberry bog, not as many mercenaries as uranium fever, but they are max level. Your up against multiple gutsies, so also a bit harder than uranium fever.
---
As a pvper I'm scared of train stations. They get a free 10 seconds that they can rush my position and I can't do shit to stop them besides run. Don't play with the folks in sky bases and eventually they'll get bored and come out to play.
---
lol there was a level 30 there with a power fist im level 50 i shoot this guy in the head as a sneak attack and it does no damage he speeds towards me and slaps my cunt with his power fist and 1 shots me
---
Hootakiller strikes again...
---
Yes they need and more rewarding and same time much more challenging quests/events which can be done even alone
---
There's one in the nukashine frat house, there's one in the trailer/mobile home south of Berkeley Springs and there can be one in the Brotherhood asylum.
---
Send me an invite, my gt is s3shb0t I‚Äôm appearing offline and don‚Äôt have a mic lol but I‚Äôll join and give it you
---
Yeah farming for specific scraps can be tedious
---
I‚Äôve already made 3 more accounts since then and none have been banned except my first. I‚Äôve DEFINITELY accumulated more than 100k 5.56 in less than a month on my other accounts but they don‚Äôt get banned, hence why I made this post.

Good job!  My friend has one.  It looks really good.

You mean the Hail to the Chief music?

I had a 3 star sheepsquatch this morning. He dropped me a 1 star bloodied tesla rifle.
---
Yes! Had the name on the tip of my tongue but it was slipping my mind.

Where is asylum ?

The glass canonical builds are the most op build I made one to show how op they are I'm lvl 142 and dealing upwards of 400 damage

If so, I took a photo of you for the "take pictures of players" challenge.  Thanks for your participation!

This is essentially happening with the vendor. We're rerolling legendaries.

15 mules is three accounts (junk is heavy). Why would I take the time to log on every single character to take a picture of its inventory to satisfy someone who can't piece together a reasonable argument about anything? This was never about my mules. It was about workshops. You simply keep trying to make it about...everything else, including one specific piece of junk I mentioned. 
---
Yet when I ask you to back a claim central to the discussion, you refuse to unless I reschedule my evening to show you that each of my mules -- which is carrying junk, not anything spectacular -- is legitimate. Had I said I had 15 mules full of BSE, TSE, AAE, and various high-end armors, THAT would be worthy of demanding verification. I only have one weapon and one armor mule and neither of them is too impressive because I keep giving stuff away to people I meet. Junk? Yeah, I have that -- and you can see it when you buy it from my characters in a few days ;)

Workshops and teams are fully exploiable forced pvp for greifers. 
---
You cant accept team invites from potential new friends because they can spark off pvp with their buddy and boom, you're engaged. I always accept rando invites and get burned frequently. Most of the time it's just guys that wanna fast travel for free, use the xp card or flip charachters. But every now and then, greifers. 90% of people will decline a rando team invite because of that. Also camp smashers. It eould be cool if there was no downside to potentially making new friends and allies in the game.
---
Lvl 107 here still never got my reach lvl 100 achievement.
---
Got it, you can't back up your claims. Cool
---
Not the regular ones as far as I know, yes the rare ones.
---
Said that I think the chance to drop for the rare ones is 0.065%
---
I must have done no less than 340 events and 170 dailies in the forest Region and I have not had one drop for me.
---
possibly pitures of him pleasuring himself for your enjoyment on your bed.. i change mattresses..
---
Best place (for me) is wandering around the hills &amp; forests of the southern divide between Huntersville/Westek &amp; Johnson's acre &amp; the asylum. Ran into him twice out there this week while scrounging wood for the weekly weapon challenges. Can't be more specific than that but the further from civilization the better.
---
I can't decide if i like it or hate it.
---
Well, the "explosive bug" where it "does more damage than displayed" is getting fixed.. so no clue how much less damage it means, but I imagine it's significant.
---
Looking at you Mr. Bloodied Super Sledge at the wendigo event at the Sons of Dane compound
---
Fort defiance. Just west of Watoga.
---
You missed the part where they never said that. 
---
The reason for the ban was exploiting a system issue.
---
The 100k+ items are given as a proof. Think of this as you committing a crime, everything is recorded on a CCTV camera then the cops say that the proof is on the tape and they show you the physical tape/hdd/whatever.
---
You also missed the part where they NEVER SAID IT"S 100k AMMO. It's 100k rare items.
---
You're the only one saying it was 100k ammo. Please show me where do you see the word "ammo" being used.
---
Most people aren't gonna blindly pre order a game, that mind you, did release as a steaming pile of fresh Scorchbeast shit. Stop questioning a phrase like an annoying as whole. Not everyone has the time, money, or dumbfuck ignorance to preorder a game like you.
---
They NEVER said it's because of ammo. Stop lying.
---
Needs to be bigger content with bigger varied prizes of clothes, camp plans and legendary weapons and more often. I mean, there was a lot of people never getting masks for the Fausnacht event. I play daily after work for a couple of hours and half of that is sat "paused" on the map.
---
They need to do fun things to. Sheepsquatch isn't even fun or worth it. It's not that it's difficult or slightly time consuming. It just isn't fun. 9 times out of 10 when the Event pops up for it, I never see anyone going there.
---
I have it trigger just about any time I go the mire. I don't think it's one that just shows up on the map; it's a regionally triggered event.
---
God. So sorry I can't even do that !! I'm r0ckerfella.
---
I made my second character which is vanguard stealth pistol build just on self nerfing purpose but i found myself craving that bloodied dmg and extra special stats with Unyielding armor.
---
And trading is really the only thing i do atm in game and thats what has kept me intrested.
---
When it comes to pvp i just dont like for some reason even though i play a lot of FPS games, i just find it "stressing" which i dont want from a fallout game. Maybe im too used to just roam on my own and not worry about other players.

T-51b is better than Ultracite and T-60 has skins and is cheaper to repair.

I‚Äôd settle for ‚Äúvault wall‚Äù types like with the vault 88 questline
---
Yeah that's the one. What's the name of that big town up there? Can't remember
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be a stinker but you can‚Äôt have AA and Two Shot on one weapon.
---
Ah, that would explain a bit!
---
Jet makes you jittery.
---
You should try rifle gaming he loves this game and I‚Äôve been watching him since borderlands 2 was new
---
Nah I'm on ps4
---
Double XP weekends are good for leveling.
---
I suggest you start to do more trading (if you havent yet) as its easier to make a specific build and just improve your character.
---
I just got my first (2\* level 40 TSE pipe pistol) at around 140 from a 62 ghoul in WS (non-nuked).
---
Underwhelming but at least I got one?
---
They‚Äôre random spawns at Fort Defiance. The weathered ones are pretty much guaranteed there; specific various colors can be a nightmare to acquire. Asylum hats in various colors are much easier to find there.
---
Damn. Don‚Äôt know if I wanna sacrifice that Charisma point for reduced fast travel cost. I‚Äôll try it though. Thank you for your help!
---
welcome to the elite
---
I'm here..  I think. üòÄ
---
Lol, dupers to the rescue. I love it. We as a community we so hard on them back when it was prevalent, but now that duping is stomped out, its coming to light how bad drop rates are. 
---
I don't mind all the trash in the loot pool, i stongly dislike how rare it is to even find an enemy that can potentially give you something from that loot pool. Playing for hours and running accross one or two 3 star enemies who drop 1 star gear is kind of infuriating
---
Maybe male this a game mode. Do not want to see this in adventure in day to day wandering. Maybe a game mode with NPCs and Faction Wars.
---
So the different colored ones are just random spawns in fort defiance
---
Never could find out where that was coming from.
---
Thanks, will craft some more and scrap tonight :)
---
I don't see the point in even building one. It takes up a sizeable chunk of your budget and uses a lot of flux that could be used for other things. Plus, radaway is easy as shit to craft.
---
I get what you're trying to do, but it doesn't work when you make unreasonable time demands over something meaningless -- especially while you're using it in an attempt to avoid the actual issue. But hey -- you be you. I know no one else wants to ;)
---
I am on PC, and that's the outfit but I can't say for sure. I usually interact with the vendor from the front but I could have been there at some point during that challenge.
---
If it is me, you're welcome for the photo. :-)
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
This game will eventually become community driven. Unfortunately it's not ready yet. Once all this roadmapped dlc hits the game will be amazing. Too bad that's like 6 months away. 
---
Drip fed content isn't fun. We need things in the game to let us build communities.
---
It's stuck unfortunately. Only the mistress weapons can be up leveled. 
---
Handmade is the best weapons but a legendary combat will beat a vanilla handmade. Of course a legendary 3* tse or bloodied will be best. Essentially roll with what you got until you get something better.
---
I agree. I think though that they are starting to move in that direction. I'm looking forward to the patch on Tuesday.
---
I do have other games but mainly FPS such as Cod and Battlefield. Ive been trying to play them more but i have lost my intrest in FPS games for some reason.
---
Wish i could play my ps2 games on ps4, i have so many great games
---
Yeah. They do appear in very specific places that you‚Äôll find in just a few runthroughs. I‚Äôd suggest not picking up an outfit whose color you don‚Äôt need - instead, server hop an check that same location, it could spawn with a different color (though there‚Äôs no guarantee it will appear again at all). Good luck!
---
They spawn at fort defiance, the colored ones are rare tho
---
Yeah, I pvp on the other character, this is more about stomping PVE and feeling like a tank.
---
Is it for all levels of Trapper armor or just for the level 15 pieces?
---
Kk, can you recommend any weapons to find the plan for now or shut I just stick with the all rise
---
Yeah me too
---
You should need to be within the contested area to be killed simple as that. If the person defending the workshop is not contesting they are simply not red. The people trying to take the workshop also will not be red until the person who owns it enters their own workshop area which flags them as contesting. 
---
Whats the point in welcome mats and creating your own mini base inside a workshop to have someone just "say when" and have their friend kill you once they contest. Its just cheese and not immersive. 
---
Which is why owning a workshop is lame. Especially after they made it so you can contest from anywhere. I want to see awesome 4v4 battles erupt at a workshop, not watch the poor souls who claim workshops be ganked over and over due to terrible thought out game mechanics.
---
So much this.
---
Bloodied mess is a extra 15% damage
---
I don't know I guess I must be lucky. On PC also and never have a problem with this.
---
I‚Äôd try reinstalling then. If that doesn‚Äôt work then I have no idea. I put a SSD in my PS4 as well. It was completely worth it to me. At least installing doesn‚Äôt take as long as the download anymore.
---
Thank you soo much.

Hahaha, the only thing to prevent this would be a tin foil hat
---
Many people are running "Bloodied Builds" with stacked bonuses for sitting at 20% or less health, the end result can be taking a 100 DMG weapon to 4,000+
---
Anything really. Specifically weapons, armor, and aid
---
I was on my level 30 tring to level. Doing a workshop defense event. A level 240 shows up wielding a mole miner gauntlet.  Looks at me. Then in the middle of me doing the event contest it while 1 foot from me and 1 hit kills me. He then follows me to the next workshop I own and does the same thing. I only wanted the defense events he could have the work shops but all he wanted was to kill someone 200 levels under him
---
Same here level 124, only found i had ts 2 times and for rng god were low level while i was already over lvl50+... The worst its the day i found a 10mm handgun Explosive + vats, modified it was so excited then realise it was lvl5 and i was like lvl80 and wondered what kind of joke legendary lvl45+ mob drop a lvl5 gun...
---
Still now i have ok weapons but baffle me when i do sbq and see dude with tse got 2 shots while i need at least 10 ammo to kill one lvl68 scorched.
---
Same as today i was killing a sb lvl80 began to melt it's life then a lvl300+ dude came and one shot that shit with a super sledge...Wondering what kind of build he had.
---
I get that and i agree. But the video is about the launch. 90% of the video is reviewing all the bugs that do not exist today so how is that helpful? Im not saying the game doesnt need improvement.
---
DayZ, Rust, The Forest.
---
?   
---
Been on and off all day, not seen a single instance of thing.
---
Thank you so much!
---
You'll always get those people until the mechanics of workshops are changed. I'll i can suggest if your going to claim workshops for the events or claim rewards, server hop once your done or this will happen.
---
I thought we‚Äôre going to make camps a safe place? Free from damage to griefers??
---
 camps are gonna be protected as long as you are passive after this patch
---
I‚Äôm not concerned about grinders, because Bethesda said that when player vending comes out they are making CAMPs immune to damage unless you become hostile to a player.
---
I admit watching intelligent douchebags at work is sometimes interesting. Not if you are their target though. It'll all be nice when BSG finally gets around to eliminating PVP in PVE. There is an entire PVP server to murder and steal on and they have to do this crap in PVE?! Indestructible CAMPS will fix a lot, but workshops will be death machines going forward.
---
You know why randoms are sending group requests, right? To alert people about events.
---
Better off just playing Apex.
---
I have five 'fully developed' accounts - with this I mean that each account has a geared and functional main, not just lvl15 'mules', this is a bit extreme but I know that having at least two active accounts is not a rarity.
---
I could exploit any rewards all day long.
---
It already takes a fair bit of restraint not to exploit hunter/hunted by playing it 'with myself'.
---
Either way, limit the engament - at least the initial 'contest' one - to the workshop area? This should have been implemented the very latest when they changed the 'rules' to allow contesting the workshop from anywhere withing the 'caption area' of the workshop itself. Is long overdue.
---
Rewards? None outside the engagement itself.
---
Chance to 'decline' the engagement and forfeit the workshop if one finds oneself away from it while contested sounds good to me.
---
Ironic... I saw my second one in 700ish hours... YESTERDAY :(
---
Morgantown?
---
Thanks for the input.
---
Oh, sure, you knew exactly 100% what I was talking about, yet you, for some reason, can‚Äôt take Todd Howard‚Äôs dick out of your mouth for 1 second to realize that FO 76 is an unmitigated disaster, not to include massive PR debacles.
---
1200 atoms per square foot
---
That's what bothered me a bit. I understand in "online" games there comes to a point where you do everything. But I thought 76 would be a bit different by now. I basically like it like a new single player game for about 80 hours. Now I'm done with it. Which is a shame because I would have liked to keep playing. But it's too boring now.
---
Hmm...
---
I did uranium fever one time and some guy with a melee build showed up there. He ine shotted all the legendaries that spawn before I could get a hit.
---
I'm not a duper,  what the hell?  I grind for items,  and when I have items I don't want,  I trade with others. Legit,  what's that all about?
---
The Grey Talon
---
This is just a introduction tutorial quest. Can't you remember the Sturges Missions where he wants you to build stupid beds, plants and some water source? But you already figured that out early how you build stuff, but you still need todo that because those pre quests are necessary for some storylines?
---
When has spawn camping ever been "like it's supposed to be played." in any game?  People like that have been the pathetic ones since Halo 1, and probably before,  rofl. Just shows you're just a weak ass player that can't handle actual combat by doing that.
---
Now that you mention it... I'll try some of the more exotic foods that I have no patience making.
---
When I saw "take a picture of an alien while wearing a tinfoil hat" I actually chuckled.  First, fast travel to Berkeley Springs for a stupid hat.  Second, spend the rest of your day looking like a fucking idiot while trying to spawn a Flatwoods Monster, who's rare enough to be the first cousin of a unicorn......this is all assuming the Flatwoods Monster *actually* counted as an alien.  I've been playing since the first BETA Thursday and have maybe seen a handful.
---
I wasnt calling you a duper. I meant that trading is the best way to get explosive weapons because dupers flooded the market with them. All out TSEs are dupes
---
I only play to complete the challenges and that's it. My only real issue is the PvP balancing. Its not fun getting 1 shotted, and spawning in the same spot over and over again to 1 shot the other guy and immediately get 1 shot by someone else. Only times I had fun with the PvP was vs other players pre lvl 50 with no legendaries, basic weapons and armors, and no marsupial hopping. At least those fights lasted longer than 2 seconds. So long as the PvP damage remains this ridiculous, no amount of exp bonus is going to keep me in 1 shot mode.
---
I expected this response.
---
Cool! And thanks, I played on and off since 2007 but got back into it full force in 2017
---
Oh sorry, I play on Xbox
---
Seems like Bloodied is much more beneficial as your never gonna be at full health between the radiation and shot trying to kill you. I already have 3* Bloodied super sledge, bloodied explosive combat shotgun and bloodied explosive handmade. I‚Äôve got an 3* AA Grognaks Axe and AAE combat rifle. Perhaps I should migrate them to bloodied as well.
---
How could you be 3 pilons at once?
---
And while you are at it just use the same mechanic for all loot
---
I just dont see the fun in running around one hit killing low levels. I got 800something hours in and have never once thought "you know what would be fun? Killing people much lower leveled then I"
---
How do you get that many caps?  I‚Äôm level 56, very rarely spend (except for fast travel) and have about 1500.
---
No problem, ever need repairs to 200% or any other weapons mods feel free to message me.
---
I have to take a picture of you with an alien while in a nuke zone for it to count.
---
Sorry I am Xbox and haven't been on in a few days, life been getting in the way. Thanks for the offer though.
---
If you're over by whitesprings anyways for some reason, there's a few over at the disposal site just up the road.
---
If you made it past level 10 on beta and used that character once the game released you missed that trophy. Only way around it is to make a new character and play up to level 10.
---
I wish I was. Because the person following me around waiting for a bounty to kick wasn‚Äôt able to do anything to me until buttercup. I make this junk run all the time.
---
Adrenal reaction can boost weapon damage at the cost of low health. It stacks with bloodied too, but it affects all weapons and is sort of a bloodied lite edition
---
I will have to try that next time I get on, I have a TSE 50 cal machine gun but been trying to stock up on bullets for another run. Currently trying to get enough acid for Gunpowder. I haven't been on for a few days, and when I am online again I will have to try that.
---
Further, to clarify, it wasn‚Äôt a player lock. It was a lock on a trailer.
---
I believe they're the way they are because of the nuclear blasts. They sort of melded with their minor suits due to the blast effects.
---
I was a little lost about this too as a rifleman. That is until my buddy told me that the secret to knocking these guys off is using your crits.
---
 I bought the knife skin so I could tell em' apart. ;)
---
Why the hell do you report ? Thats part of the game
---
Lmfao starting? Been*
---
I got it the exact same way I did last time
---
Someone came and killed the vendor
---
No I got out and looked at it and thought I needed to wait until it is recalled but I didn‚Äôt
---
I already know there was nothing else on my account over 5k. I used 10mm so maybe there was 3k ammo from that but I used 5.56 regularly every day so that‚Äôs why I accumulated so much
---
Mine played ...
---
Unsupported behaviour .. go play survival if you will to kill other players
---
That sucks to be sure. I had a great team of three the other night, no mic coordination at all. The only problem with that event is all the loot I pull is underleveled 1* nonsense. Thanks for the lvl 35 Nocturnal Pole Hook Mr. Moleman.
---
A non-explosive will climb walls. The explosive one can't. The spikes explode.
---
They didn‚Äôt say ammo, but I know what was on my account. That‚Äôs the only thing that I accumulated that was over 5k. Everything else was just ammo or hoarding materials
---
Shit. I'm in lol PC as well. Besides just the power plant stuff it would be nice to have more friendly faces in the wastes. Bethesda.  Name same as is on here
---
Literally all over the map. I hit up every location around me. Usually prioritizing ones with a guaranteed crown enemy.
---
You get a yaoi goi head mount plan from doing Death and Taxidermy which is located in Monongah.
---
Wait they're nerfing shotguns?
---
I‚Äôll give you that one. Multiple Cazadores are pretty bad no matter your level
---
how rude!
---
Similar thing happened to me except they then proceeded to just destroy my entire base.
---
See, that I understand -- I was in BETA and experienced the same bugs. But he said he was level 10 but never made it out of the vault. That's the part I don't get it. Vault 76 isn't *that big.*
---
I would just wait till the update goes through see what it's all about and then decide.
---
I fought it for the first time today and this happened. Everybody just waited around until it turned into a scrap pile and showed up on the ground.
---
A lot of enemies in this game are bullet sponges. In addition to that a lot of weapons are under performing even with a decent build. This is why you not only need a great build but also a phenomenal weapon.
---
From watching Captain Noob on YouTube it seems as if stealth commando is out performing gunslinger, heavy gunner and rifleman build.
---
The bloodied prefix and two shot explosive legendaries currently also appear to out damage instigating, furious and executioners.
---
Honestly, /u/glue_zombie isn't wrong. The PVP balance in this game is... well... there isn't much of any PVP balance at all. It'd simply come down to whoever has the most meta build and godlike armor and weapons; no actual strategy or skill involved.
---
its called sleep tf?
---
I like everything except the Raider faction requiring PvP.  I fucking hate PvP, but would love to convert ammo almost nobody uses, like 38, 44, 10mm, missiles, mini nukes, etc into various scrap and gunpowder.
---
A couple times is fine, but following around non stop trying to engage when in adventure mode is reportable as harassment. Survival/workshop is different, but to follow around tryin to force something is frowned upon
---
Same issue here..
---
for my gun it does 200 damage without demo expert. i cut demo expert from my normal build for gunsmith. 5 perks for 25 damage didnt feel worth it.
---
That‚Äôs not the point of this post. I‚Äôm not talking about the negatives. I‚Äôm talking about adding some positives to an already progressively positive game.
---
I think the logic is she leaves it behind so it can be a starting ‚Äòoutpost‚Äô for the people who JUST left the Vault, so that they can focus on using their own CAMPs to build a new home for themselves rather than having to immediately set up shop (since I‚Äôm assuming that, in-universe, you can‚Äôt just literally teleport your CAMP whenever you wanna move)
---
*teleportation*
---
I cripple yiao giau like that also. Those fucking stun attacks can be brutal. And gulpers. Pretty much anything that by crippling their legs they flop around like a dying fish. I like seeing them flop around while I whack them with giant deathclaw claws strapped to my wrist.
---
There needs to be a daily quest terminal to pick up daily quests randomly. Most the time I log in throughout the week I can't even get a single daily quest to trigger.
---
yeah there is a lack of end game content.
---
I still am having fun, each day I always go to Camden park and do that daily, then go and do Bivs quest. Id then clear out either the burrows or west tek. 
---
If I need ammo il go and farm steel and lead and acid if needed. 
---
Il do some events, and do free range when I can. Also the Atom challenges.
---
But I dunno. I keep thinking of a game where I loved the endgame content. That being the original Destiny. I know this is nothing like that game, but if it had a "raid" that refreshes once a week, and minor dungeons that refreshed each day wish some kind of interesting reward we could grind towards.
---
Well she says that whenever you move it everything is stored so I think it does.
---
Well good. I'm glad you appreciate the gun this much. It's nice to read this. Really glad I had a small part in it
---
Since January there is a severe penalty for exceeding the strictly enforced fun per hour limit.
---
If you find yourself having too much fun quickly switch to something un-fun until the fun allowance resets.
---
Usually trying to do a silo run in an unstable server or taking over a workshop in a server where you can see a couple of wanted players on the map is enough to cause a reset. Failing that abstain from having fun until you have successfully purchased a jetpack and calibrated shocks from MODUS.
---
I haven't had a single crash or disconnect all weekend.  Are you sure it's the servers crashing and not you disconnecting from a working server?
---
I hate floating camps so much.
---
You're a god.
---
Mutant's is applied in the general-damage chunk, so it's additive with Bloody Mess, Adrenal Reaction etc.
---
Just A guess but I suspect legendary nerfs have something to do with the new legendary vendor. Like food spoils really fast now and they are putting refrigerators into the store. Weapon durability dropped and they come out with repair kits. Bethesda thinks we don't notice.
---
Like maybe also if this game had another set of daily challenges, or bounties. Which would reward caps or other such stuff. Simple daily stuff like kill a certain amount of one type of enemy etc.
---
Nothing craftable. You just have to play the rng legendary game. You might want to level up. It doesn't guarantee you'll get a level 50 but makes it better if one drops.
---
To each their own. Some people kill lower levels as their way to farm materials. It is what it is. This game has a lot of room for griefing and harassing others.
---
I found a white one
---
The best way to handle the imposter sheepsquatch event is to have one person take all three pylons, then just run around healing themselves. Get a few shots into the 'squatch, but otherwise, just keep running and moving.
---
The imposter will be visible as long as possible and everybody else can wear it down at the same time. You don't take extra damage holding all three pylons, and if you're grouping with people, have them donate a few stimpacks your way. It makes the event go super smooth with minimal deaths.
---
Thanks man!
---
I thought the same thing earlier. Glad I‚Äôm not the only one afraid of spam selling
---
Or a free ride across the map?  Or scoping out your campsite? Send me a message... 'Sheep!' 'Cryptid' if it's something rare. Otherwise I'm grinding out for supplies. Until such a point as the camps are invulnerable if I don't know you, sorry bud.
---
Yeah. If one person holds onto all the pylons and heals themselves while staying out of danger the event is ridiculously easy.
---
Hey I‚Äôm with you guys on everything else but leave the lolis out of this. That there is some good fap material
---
till you go to my C.A.M.P and my see my grow room HANNN
---
Oh no worries. I don't profit from it so no loss anyway lol. There is a sub of users for each console to help transfer stuff if you ever need it.
---
Hmm you‚Äôve got a point, there should be a way to get faction points without pvp I‚Äôll think of something, or maybe someone will comment their idea here
---
Explosive, specifically. As most people figured, explosive shotguns were dealing much more than +20% damage in practice. Apparently that was a bug, and it's getting fixed in the next patch.
---
That mind set will just discourage new players. The guy that followed me on my low level didn't get one junk item off me yet still followed me trying to kill me. New player would definitely get turned off by this and the game is already struggling enough
---
What changes would you like to see? It's still in beta so there is definitely going to be further balancing/improvements. As someone who has no interest in many of the adventure mode mechanics (slap system, map visibility, excessive fast travel...) This mode is a breath of fresh air and the only mode worth playing.
---
You must be on console. On PC there's no way to send someone a message. 
---
If it's for an event you don't have to actually accept the request. I always just check their location on the map and if it's an event I'm interested in, I go over. No reason to be hostile about it.
---
I never have much luck with the typical places like Whitespring. Normally I have better luck at Harpers Ferry, West Tec, and One Violent night and AWOL Armaments. But the group I normally play with we make sure to let everyone tag. But is is also a tool and mean we are using to recruit to our group.
---
So don't do it. Others find it an easy way to make Atoms.
---
I've heard the flatwoods monster doesnt even count as an alien...
---
I know that one. Challenge to find locations cannot be done because you already found every location. Don't think Bethesda really cares. They want new blood to suck money from.
---
They aren't scarce resources. That's a bullshit argument. There is no Ultracite workshop that I know of, no hardened mass workshop, no flux workshop.
---
Sure, make them first come first serve in Adventure Mode. 24 man server where most folk don't touch workshops, don't think that will create a supply side issue.
---
Id agree with adventure mode CAMPs but only because many want it. Except for keeping an arch up, there is nothing that uses scarce resources.
---
I'm sure you are right, and that sounds super awesome, but I'm a whiner baby and don't want to spend half a lifetime grinding out my ideal power armor.
---
Lode Barring is a good one to do if you have plenty of acid to smelt, and wearing excavator power armor.
---
Got it for PC, couldn't run it so I play on PS4 now.
---
lol of course they're all duped. I'm like 450 hours, my friend is over 500 and I've never seen a single one, he's gotten maybe one low level pistol and he farms legendaries plenty. It's the same with Assassin's Sentinel, there's probably one set in all of 76 it took an entire playerbase to discover and then dupe the shit out of. 
---
Allowing people to keep their duped weapons instead of deleting them was the most cowardly move of 76 period. They had a chance to wipe this shit off the map and chose not to punish the people most responsible for it, the jagoffs that paid for them in the first place. Horrible misstep that will always taint the game.
---
They were probably as frustrated as I currently am.
---
4 hours and I havnt even encountered it once!
---
I've heard that flatwoods monster doesn't even count as an alien ):
---
Quick question, where is spawn point for said plan?
---
I'm saying that introducing a BR type mode into the already poorly balanced survival/pvp mode will just result in a poorly balanced pvp event/challenge.
---
Is it a good idea? Absolutely yes and would bring some new gameplay into PVP. But with the current implementation of legendary effects, it would be too easy for someone to run, for example, an ass-sent type build and there not be any actual competition due to how broken that combination is. Further complications from that example is how massively duped such a desirable combination is.
---
I'm not purposely trying to crap on your post saying "that's a terrible idea", but in the current state of PVP balance I could see it becoming a quickly ignored event/challenge with how low population survival servers currently have.
---
Just lost my ex torso....
---
What‚Äôs this about holding onto pylons? Some type of way to get healed?
---
i played for 5 hours last night no problems... today every 20 minutes i'm crashing just did it again. i'll reboot my router and stuff could be at my end
---
If you fast travel, you need to go to the first building you spawn near which is a police station, and read the missing persons report on the desk
---
just dropping in 21 days later to say that you were right.
---
Just A guess but if you don't leave and come back into the game some items should respawn giving you points again.
---
I was looking for it with the camera, emoted "???" forgetting about the glitch and just got launched across the map, disconnected shortly after landing. Was pretty sad afterwards.
---
I agree with a lot of what you said.
---
I also feel legendaries need an overhaul and they need to add more effects. 
---
And Id definitely agree with adding more varied things to do. Id love fishing. There is loads of minigames they could add which I feel would add a lot to the variety. 
---
And yeah. They have sooo many food recipes and they are virtually all pointless. For no other reason then it will spoil really quickly anyway and gives you hardly any benefit then a basic corn soup.
---
Fallout 76 back to fallout 4 make them one shot people out of power armor. Make it a challenge.
---
Thanks for checking. That it's both good to know and a bummer. May all your flux be stable and your weapons never break.
---
Don‚Äôt see any microtransactions in those pics tho
---
Uranium Fever. Take all the mole miner weapons and use scrapper perk. You'll have tons.
---
They have said about a prestige type thing haven't they? I assume it may work something like this?
---
Thank you for your service!
---
ah i see. thanks for the info.
---
No no. This is a bad idea. I'll tell you why. There's the scorched earth event which gives you loot, plus the loot from the body. Fine. But the last time I was down there we didn't kill her in time. We failed the event. We finally did kill her though and got all the loot from the body. In those cases, if all the loot was tied to the event you would get nothing for all that time and expenditure. I say keep it separate.
---
Now, I've only done scorched earth three times. One, it took us almost the entire time to kill her. The second, we killed her in about 3 minutes (it was beautiful), and this last one we didn't do it in time.
---
I've heard recently that xbox only has like 1-2 servers up during off peaks hours. PC is by far the most populated.
---
Not everyone who puts time in plays "all day," I have a full time job, and many hobbies including video games. I have a lv 189 character fully specced into PvP and with BiS gear for everything. I haven't tried looking for the camera yet though.
---
I prefer it a lot more over photomode imo, but there are times I use photomode still.  For pictures like Deathclaws, Behemoths, and the other dangerous creatures, it is much easier to use the camera to snap a good picture without risking your character getting killed while you're hanging in photomode (it also helps with immersion if you like that sort of thing).  Things like scenery or c.a.m.p builds are good for photomode since you can apply filters and get yourself in the picture.  Hopefully new modifications get added to the camera in the future, like infrared, nightvision, and some blur adjustments (maybe even a selfie mode lol).
---
junk rounds lmg, junk rounds minigun, junk rounds .50, junk rounds pipe gun....Bethesda please
---
i like these ideas, and each camp would potentially be more unique with the upgrade options
---
Specs not up to snuff or game-based issues?
---
Thank you for the input. The second paragraph was good criticism. I see your point there.
---
You can use it to find the invisible body of the dead fake sheepsquatch/assaultron after she dies.
---
SPecs not up to snuff, I didn't check before I brought it.
---
So? That's what meta is, it doesnt matter what works best, there is always going to be something that does work best and then it becomes meta.
---
100% could see that happening and it probably does happen. Its a good thing there is this thread and maybe more trying to bring up this issue to make a positive change for the game.
---
I REALLY miss being able to spam Monster Mash
---
Definitely this one since it's something they HAVE to check
---
Not all two shot explosive weapons are dupes.  I land one every now and then.
---
I love look of the Sheepsquatch and find him fun to take on but I really get your point on the event. Its a shame.
---
What I tend to do is when I trigger the event Il wait there a while. It gives you ages to complete it and after some time 1 or 2 players will join me.
---
Thanks for the input.  I wish there were a definitive population graphic that we could peruse.
---
He isn't entirely wrong. If you don't like what he's doing, that's tough. You got 3 options. 
---
1. Spawn at another station
---
2. Server hop
---
3. Adventure mode
---
Don't want to use those options?
---
Don't complain
---
...that's exactly what it was meant to be. Who is saying otherwise??
---
It's hard for player numbers to dwindle to less than 0.
---
You appear to be the nicest raider
---
I wear a military cap (beret) with mine, looks great.
---
I love the camera and think its actually a fun and unique thing to add to the game.
---
There are 2 big issues though. First being that on console you can only store 50 pics is it? I already maxed that out taking pics of areas where you unlock photomode borders, among taking some pics of the fascnact event too.
---
The other being the challenges for them are awful at the moment.
---
I don‚Äôt think he counts. I think they have a separate mob that is considered the alien seeing as the flat woods monster and the alien are considered two different things in one of the combat challenges.
---
We might be looking at a copycat, chief.
---
They really did do a good job capturing the environment. There was a documentary on Netflix where they had people going on tours in Chernobyl and Fukushima. Abandoned buildings and schools buildings collapsed from lack of maintenance. It really was like real life fallout.
---
i love lode bearing, the messenger, and uranium fever. 
---
free range is getting up there too but it‚Äôs extremely difficult late at night when no one‚Äôs on
---
Camp building exploits are by far the least impactful exploits there are. I agree using exploits is shitty, but for camp building where it really doesn't offer any advantage whatsoever... I find it quite the stretch to call them exploits. The only kind of camp exploit I'd refer to as an exploit is if there was a way to get way more yield from plants than you're suppose to, or have water purifiers that don't require power, and etc. Those would have gameplay economy effects, being able to hide generators inside foundations, and etc, but general building bugs are hardly anything to be miffed about. The only thing to be miffed about would be the aesthetic.
---
&gt; It just looks like you logged into other accounts to down my oh so important karma
---
Also, this just makes you sound like a complete ass. "My opinion can't possible be wrong and people should agree with me, therefore the op clearly went out of their way to downvote me multiple times through multiple accounts" is exactly what you're saying. Guess what? More people than op disagree with you with exploits in the context of camp building.
---
Ha, Ive actually been considering starting the game again as I really wanna play through Nuka world and Far Harbour. Just not looking forward to those early missions. The amount of times ive done them now...
---
It really is the lack of NPCs that make the game feel lacklustre. Everything feels so empty. While the storyline and quests have good stories behind them, they really do feel lacklustre without NPCs to drive them.
---
I think players should be an event style marker, just a big general area where a player might be. It would still allow tracking to a degree, but wouldn't be exact. It would allow people to set up ambushes both for and against players.
---
Okay. Awesome. Thanks. A bit better than I had previously thought. Very good to know. Thanks again. :D
---
Like 500 hours in and I just found my first quad yesterday (besides the quad lever action and 3* quad Tesla I bought) it was a 2* quad Tesla rifle. It is amazing. My white whale would be a quad with 25% faster reload combat shotgun.
---
Heh, not hostile. Just learnt the hard way that not everyone is good. Answer a random team request, guy flicks in, un-teamed, then his mates all jump in, and destroy most of my camp before I could jump server. So, just very suspicious and cautious.
---
Sounds like someone has had their nipples twisted for too long. Calm. the. fuck. down. You've got issues. If something so minor triggers you so hard, I'd suggest seeking help.
---
Yeah, it doesn't care what you scrap. I've unlocked almost every marine chest mod on two characters by crafting and scrapping arms.
---
Owl be looking for you
---
It's a status symbol, plus it can be helpful to lower leveled characters if you like leaving a welcoming abode for others
---
There does seem to be some "shaping" going on with the drops. 3 or 4 weeks ago I got my first decent bloodied melee weapon at level 150ish. I started tweaking my build around it, and since then I've picked up over a dozen different bloodied weapons, including a tesla rifle I just found a couple hours ago.
---
You get guys using the workshop spawn-bug to repeatedly farm you for caps as well. I just avoid workshops..  They are the sketchy liquor stores on the bad side of town in FO76. You'll get murdered and robbed if you hang out there long enough.
---
Thatd be amazing to have. I enjoy building a fancy modern house to display, but having a busy camp would be a fantastic idea. Only downside I could see is having two free fast travel points, which is good for the game, but bad for PVP
---
Tyically Its better if one person becomes all the pylons, then heals while staying away from the imposter
---
Shows what I know. I didn‚Äôt realize I could be jumped if I wasn‚Äôt in the workshop zone. I‚Äôve been capturing one near my camp just to get the rewards.
---
I guess that explains why everyone actively avoids capping them these days in adventure mode.
---
I know what you mean about Boston. It looks so dull. And im not talking about the look of the world. I love the desolute barren look. Feels so apocalyptic and immersive. Im talking about the lack of variety in buildings etc.
---
If you look at Fallout 76, there is Golf courses, mines, theme parks, dirt tracks, a pumpkin house, a MASSIVE red rocket truck stop, a futuristic city of robots. All is sooo fascinating and varied.
---
I haven‚Äôt been there yet, definitely going to go check it out. Thank you!
---
Free range, collision course, horde events, leader of the pack
---
Well hell thats awesome
---
Fuck really? Maybe it‚Äôs just a Wisconsin thing I dunno. We are the trashiest part of the Midwest so I wouldn‚Äôt put that past us.
---
This started after patch 8. I get that too and it sucks. I also sometimes get stuck at workbenches (endless animation).
---
Didn't think of this, thanks for destroying my argument! Lol
---
I think what you're thinking of is something like they did with Skyrim, almost akin to a New Game+ where your character and gear doesn't change.  
---
While on the other hand I'm pretty sure OP is talking about a complete hard reset on everything kind of thing, I've seen that sentiment a few times. But it would be such an FU to anyone who has put a lot of time into the game already.
---
Yeah, or even give us the option to put up drywall and then paint THAT... Like people don't forget who they used to be before the bombs dropped.
---
I'm tired of the outside of my house looking fancy and the inside looking like a crack house.
---
What is the point in buying all the snazzy skins for workbenches and laminated floors if I'm still looking at walls full of dry rot?
---
I get that this is their attempt at keeping things within the fallout universe but it's pretty clear that none of us want this. And this game specifically should cater to people who bought it, and are willing to spend actual money to dressup their house.
---
And fix how much we can build. It's bullshit I can't add a corn plant because I built a 3 story home. What's the point in giving us the option of you restrict it?
---
Are you running the Grounded mutation? It halves the damage of the gauss rifle.
---
&gt;*laughs then cries in 2h melee*
---
AA or bloodied swing speed 2H weapons will put out stupid dps. My bloodied baseball bat does 1200+ when nerd rage kicks in, and my AA sledge does 600+ regardless of my hp or armor perks.
---
If you're on xbox I've probably got an AA or bloodied 2H you can have for cheap. Just let me know what you'd prefer and I can dig through my stash.
---
Awesome thanks.  Now anyone who can deliver me rubber lmk have bulk caps üòÇ
---
Nope I got out and waited a little while then went on to follow. Should have waited until it was recalled like I normally do
---
Oh, wow.  Ok.  I didn‚Äôt know that.  Somehow I missed that.  Thank you!
---
I just learned that.  Thank you!
---
I just learned about this.  I guess I missed that somehow.
---
Yeah maybe. I mean I wouldn't mind some kind of prestige type option all depending.
---
That‚Äôs just what I hear from reading on Reddit
---
Aw, sorry about that!
---
nah you must have some criteria active. I do forbidden knowledge everyday ,and obviously i need to go to camp venture,but i only played queen of the hunt once,the first time.
---
I tried to play ESO, but it wouldn't connect and then demanded a 50GB update so I gave up.
---
It shouldnt be that way tho. That's a whole game mechanic that you're saying to avoid and sadly you are right to say to avoid them. Its sad
---
I haven't nuked whitesprings in ages. 
---
Last few places I have nuked are Harpers Ferry, Morgantown (for the cobalt) and just for fun the imposter sheepsquatch area to guarantee people bothering to show up.
---
Really it was my own dumb fault, at least I managed to make my money back to get the ps4 version.
---
Try to get your hands on a death claw gauntlet, preferably with instigating effect. You‚Äôll kill most stuff in 1-2 hits in pve.
---
That's what I think I'm going to go with. I don't have a couple of those but it won't be too difficult to rank up and get the rest. I will also have to find someone selling grounded. I do have scaly skin. I'm definetly going to look into some better Armour. I was running around doing decent for awhile being faster than everything else but a mole rat snuck up on me and I realized just how squishy I am.
---
I bought it in March on sale for PC. Idk when or if it‚Äôll go on sale again. As far as consoles, I saw it for $30 on Xbox earlier. Idk about PS4.
---
Talon, The Silent Talon if she's doing a sneaky melee build.
---
Yeah I had the junk yard and was killed in watoga because someone on the guys team contested the junk yard
---
Where? I never saw it. It said I had double xp in my effects tab, but it wasn't mentioned in the news sheet.
---
I don‚Äôt think loot RNG needs to change. They need to either buff every other legendary effect or nerf the god tier ones.
---
If one effect is way better than the others, there is a huge problem.
---
really? I thought Scorched-killer was 20% less base damage, but 50% more scorched damage. Does that math still end up less than a hardened receiver?
---
I go through phases of playing every single night for a few weeks when I get off work to playing once or twice a week. This is intentional. The game doesn't get boring for me and allows me to focus on furthering other aspects of life like my career, enjoying other games or stuff like reading and writing, catching up on movies and TV, etc. I've loved 76 since release day and as far as I can tell, always will. But too much of any good thing can get boring.
---
I dunno.
---
Would you rather do something again and again no matter how repetitive because it has the best efficiency? I don't. That's boring.
---
No worries. During the double XP weekend last weekend, I was able to finish my heavy weapon build and it shows promise. If you haven't tried it, you may want to before walking away.
---
This. For real
---
I played Morrowind. I never saw it on the news screen, do you mean that little corner weekly message? I usually read that but must've missed it.
---
Hootenanny!
---
I've got one. IGN Tazier, I'll be on for a little bit today and more tomorrow afternoon (pacific time)
---
BE is better in PvE. The low health is easily offset by a combo of gameplay and the extra damage. 
---
AAE is better in PvP because you need the extra Armor pen to combat assasin sent/cav builds and having low health is suicidal in PvP.
---
Morgantown, Helvetia, Harper‚Äôs Ferry, and Charleston all match or beat Whitesprings in terms of XP, loot, and flux.
---
What other creatures count as aliens? Aren‚Äôt the flatwoods monsters the only aliens in the game?
---
I agree, workshop PVP should only be a thing within the actual Workshop.
---
Between this and teleportation I've come to realise its actual usefulness seems to outweigh its intended usefulness, interesting
---
Firebreather outfit counts as a Responder outfit for the challenges.
---
PS4 sadly. I've got a furious Mr. Handy buzz blade that puts on work
---
&gt;See I‚Äôd agree but then you get the Marsupial/Chameleon combo that‚Äôs ever so frustrating to deal with.
---
Chameleon here.  Chameleon only cloaks you if you're standing still and not attacking.  I think your attacker used a stealthboy.
---
It's not a bug, the damage is per shot.
---
Thanks, installing it now.
---
Would make sense lol
---
All that tech and all the Institute had to do was grab a camera and wave smh
---
makes a lot of sense, since i play adventure only. BE is the way to go. Where does FE stuff fit into the mix?
---
That's a great idea.
---
I needed it to make my bathroom look less empty.
---
With more charisma you can get it for 701!
---
If you play a bloodied build...  Never. 
---
Furious is an ok effect if you do a lot of queen runs.
---
I almost never wanted myself in photos, so photomode was a pain trying to get the shot I wanted while having to rotate around myself. camera is nice to be able to actually just point and shoot at what I want.
---
You're not wrong. Variety is the spice of life and all that. If one set of legendary modifiers is desired above all else, something needs a tweek.
---
PC user here. Same set up and same crash issue.
---
I still can't get Heart of the Beast to Trigger on any of my 5 characters!
---
That's how im feeling. Especially as my meagre 50 pics allocation is up and I cant bare to delete any of the pics ive taken.
---
It's odd that there's no poison resist perks similar to how Flame Proof reduces burning and explosive damage.
---
Wait till you bling out a drill.
---
Yeah, you just have a melee weapon and walk around them in circles while power swiping them because their ai is shit and they'll just be confused half the time. I killed a level 91 deathclaw at level 35. I'm not bragging, just saying they aren't very fear inducing
---
Wait, i never noticed this. Thats stupid AF.
---
Also whoever takes the pylons should wear power armor to use their stims even quicker
---
That's fair, being able to select it from the weapon wheel makes it a much faster process. I do think they'll probably add more features  through to at least the end of Wild Appalachia, most likely along the lines of what you said.
---
Easier way to nerf it and that includes all armor perks. Perks do not stack. Period. Full set of unyielding gives only +3. Not +15 for all 5 armor pieces.
---
I used to think if you're at an event you should use a tesla rifle (if there's other ppl). But then again, the TR has been broken since release...
---
if i go bloodied why never FE for bloodied. I have an FE Gatling and TSE Gatling and really only use them on the queens as you mentioned. would i be better off trying to trade for BE?
---
Dunno just seen people hyping over it and confused when essentially we've always had it
---
Can you explain please? Are you talking about the vending machines?
---
Sorry can you explain that? When I look at my other 2 shot weapons vs a standard variant the legendary has a higher damage value on the tooltip. Which I believe is the amount of damage added by the 2nd shot if it lands. There is no variation on the tesla.
---
Yeah really odd
---
Owltomic. 
---
it's Owl which is good, and atomic which is also good.
---
Nuke Vault 76
---
Stalk them to their camps, if you get inside jump on top of their stash box and drop the stuff directly on top of it
---
The two best events (other than newish specials like Encryptid and the constant Uranium Fever) are One Violent Night and AWOL Armaments. 
---
One Violent Night is one of the few that gives you a nice pop up notification (Sons of Dane radio signal pops up).   OVN is awesome for ghouls- you might even get some legendaries before the ‚Äònight stalker‚Äô enters, but really this mission is about xp and stocking up on a boatload of stimpacks/chems (and maybe a handful of treasure maps).  Do this mission slow- get that bar about half full and let it sit until there‚Äôs just a few minutes left. This way you get 20ish minutes of high end ghouls.
---
AWOL Armaments is great for steel, aluminum, etc, and some legendaries. Those gutsys tear me up worse than most, and I die on this one from time to time if a horde of gutsys gets you cornered.  Totally worth it though.
---
Honorable Mention for another good event for lower-level alts- Leader of the Pack. A handful of wolf packs, not that tough, and you get 3 low-level legendaries out of it. So if you‚Äôve got an alt levels 5-20, it can be worth checking out. :)
---
The two adjustments are multiplicative, so you get 0.8\*1.5 = 1.2, or less than the hardened receiver multiplier of 1.25.
---
what is your boomstick? I named my lv 35 bloodied explosive shotgun BOOMSTICK just recently
---
not on the brick side they aren't :(
---
 Also like doing defend events. Good way to meet other players and/or challenge for workshops after the defend event is done :)
---
Once player vending happens, that's guaranteeing over 2000 caps a day when you sell something after hitting npc vendor cap. If you clear grafton steel or blackwater mine once that's more caps than you'd probably spend traveling. 
---
For these reasons I think the travel perk shouldn't be on. Maybe unless you are doing technical data/plans hopping and don't mind the tedium.
---
How close did you have to get to him, did you have to use your zoom and did it help ?
---
short answer: because somebody on the internet told them it was.
---
ESAD
---
It seems optional upgrade no1 is the more viable choice especially the more you play. Aside from this absolutely love the idea and definitely deserves more upvotes
---
There's mods for drills?!?
---
Tip I learned here, get them to accidentally hit a faction NPC. Especially at White Springs. ;)
---
Can't. It's part of the protected zones.
---
That is a very mature response. I will take it and grow from it. Thank you. Youve answered all my questions in a very mature and helpful way.
---
I remember watching the stream of the French guy that launched the first nuke. Someone had said "So isn't FO76 a buggy mess?" and his response was essentially "Yep, but it's a fun buggy mess" and I agree.
---
having fun is more important that being 110% ready for whatever comes in the future patches, i enjoy exploring around, and when i find lore i go to the bottom of it, when i find ambiental stories i try to figure them and if i find weird places i like to explore them in every corner. beeing playing since beta and i still have half of the locations to fully explore. to me, that's fallout, and doing that in a party designed for pve with tank/healer and dps is even better
---
I still can‚Äôt complete overseer‚Äôs mission.
---
The venturi effect also occurs increasing wind velocity.
---
If your going to be running low health bloodied vs queen then your damage is already better than furious and you can use it during the whole fight rather than just the last 40%.
---
How is this getting downvoted??? The mentality in this fucking subreddit -.-
---
Find them by exploring the map.
---
I was insanely lucky enough to get mine for around 2.2k caps, after farming it for literal days I just said "fuuuck it" and went and bought one haha
---
i am willing to bet if anyone is gonna sell one, it may be upwards of 1K at minimum. 
---
i could be wrong though
---
Read the responses to all the other people that ask this damned question on a daily basis and judge for yourself
---
I volunteer as tribute.
---
Yeah don‚Äôt do this.
---
Think they go for around 2k ish usually. Genuinely good luck with your search.
---
Ive seen videos on it for 500 in whitesprings bunker, that's just a base price.
---
&gt; All out TSEs are dupes
---
It is literally impossible for you to prove this to be true. Save your breath. I‚Äôve had a couple nearly god roll items drop personally, and I don‚Äôt even go out of my way to legendary farm. Unfortunately they were both pvp items and I don‚Äôt pvp, so I gave them away.
---
To even get to the point of duping, these weapons had to drop in the first place...
---
If one person sacrifices themself as a pylon (or all three) it would be nice if others revived them instead of taking their bag.
---
It says level 14?
---
yes, but if someone is gonna buy it for you from the enclave, they are more then likely gonna want profit
---
FYI You can hide your character in the photo mode menu
---
Grats!!
---
Thanks ive been server hopping all day, hoping though
---
If you quit after 12 hrs of playtime saying not a lot on content, this isn't your type of game. Most won't run out of content unless they been playing for countless hours/days.
---
I am fairly certain I killed you, I was on around 10 and killed a guy on top of the little shack next to helipad lol
---
If its that much of  a persistent question it should be sticked or linked in the side bar. Im trying to get back into playing a game and i got "ESAD" and "Browse by new until you get the answers you want." Im looking for helpful information i dont understand why its a hard ask
---
or else?????
---
Oh, and the codes self destruct every week.  Monday evenings, IIRC.  
---
If you are online, you will see a notification in the top left of the screen.  When that happens, they will disappear from your inventory.
---
Thanks I might have to give that go, I see what you were getting at. Somehow I Thought we already had patch 9, so it hasn‚Äôt even hit yet....Bummer! So the other nerf is still to come...Okay well yeah I might be re-specking to a heavy build as well....
---
How can you accidentally damage the camp in pacifist mode? I thought you don't damage camps this way.  
---
People intentionally tried to kill the bounty guy probably and got juked from his pals.
---
This would be fantastic since a lack of flat ground makes it almost impossible to use the fencing to protect your crops. I‚Äôd much rather make a green house too.
---
This is a great list that I‚Äôve used a bunch:  https://m.imgur.com/r/fallout76settlements/3ZhkLJl
---
No, just beat them to the plastic and clipboards
---
I agree, I wont give those assholes the satisfaction. They are juvenile idiots and I wont play their stupid games....I just ignore them...
---
I dont think i "Ran out" by any means, the persistent performance issues and crashes compounded the issue. I have hundreds of hours in fo4.
---
Yeah I use a 3* ounce for one of my main weapons
---
He's gonna write Bethesda on his wall in blood...
---
I hope to see this.
---
where did you hear about xbox? on off peak for me there is at least a solid 10+ from myself server hoping...
---
yeah, I'm super scary and have a reputation to uphold .. I'm startin trends both in fashion and day to day social interactions, I call it .. the THREAT! haven't worked out the kinks yet, but I'm into kinky stuff so we shall see
---
Yea, the perk system is confusing at first.  
---
Not realizing how it worked is how managed to have 3 unused points in Strength.
---
Worked out to make a nice melee build though
---
Circle is your friend.  
---
Once you hit X, you are committed.  
---
Just go back and pick a useful intel perk.  One of the hackers is good early on.
---
Me in adventure mode while being try to pvp me.

---
I wanted to make junk cost in $ table so sadly i need all ingame items repair costs
---
*todd howard sweats nervously*
---
Thanks. Any idea where to get the decontamination shower?
---
if you move camp, for 40-160 caps everything gets fixed. did not know that for a long time. camp gets nuked? 40 caps if you move it an inch and the blueprint worked.
---
Hear hear. I am bothered by how few players I see here understand this and do it. If you‚Äôre bored, you don‚Äôt have to keep playing.
---
Obviously dude.
---
Same happens to me but on PC. Playing from Spain, everything worked fine until an hour ago.
---
I had the same idea.  Up to my eyeballs in Nukashine.
---
The legendary machine's plus camp vending then the legendary vender is last I hope
---
I once had a buddy of mine contest a workshop, and I killed a guy at his camp when he was sitting down at a cooking pot. It was glorious.
---
I'm sure must have been grand you're not part of the problem at all
---
You get 1400 from vendors daily. Do that every day. Try to find routes you can run rather than fast traveling long distances. Upgraded weapons sell well, so try to kill high level enemies that drop good stuff. You can also bulk any excess junk you collect along the way. Plastic for bulking can easily be farmed from low level super mutants, just equip the scrapper perk and scrap all their laser rifles. I use grafton steel. 
---
It‚Äôs not really hard to hit that 1400 limit each day. In fact, if you play a lot and know what you‚Äôre doing, you‚Äôll probably find yourself with too much stuff to sell. Hell, I sometimes have to take days off or play a different character just so I can sell my giant piles of bulk and crap legendaries to free up storage space.
---
Tried it last night. No joy.
---
Anything close enough to get to without fast traveling that I have a reasonable chance of doing solo.
---
I mentioned this awhile ago as well. Definitely adds some danger to the hunt.
---
Yes, obviously. You should have realized before you said all that dumb stuff.
---
Didnt use zoom, inwas close enough to its name pop on the screen of the camera.
---
Wierd thing is: it did not count as an alien for the other challenge (take a pic of 76 mobs).
---
Me too! (And wrap around goggles.)  
---
It's always kinda cool when I come across someone else dressed like me.
---
790 hours in. No tse drops , some explosive and lots of two shot. Best drops were a 3star Gatling laser, and a AA handmade. I received a tse handmade from a player (duper) at level 35. Had to wait 10 levels to use it. Still using it now at level 135.....even after the nerf it hits hard and fast.
---
Most players earn 1400 caps daily by selling junks/aids/weapons to vendor
---
Completing events give me a lot of super stimpak/chem I never use/purified water and I can sell if I have extra. 
---
If that isn't enough, Go to hunt some scotched/super mutant/mole miner and sell their assault rifle/shotgun/minigun. Top of the world is a good place because you get two vendors nearby.
---
If you get plans to craft something clothes to sell, go ahead to do it. Craft with super-duper.
---
Usually it takes me 10 minutes daily to get all 1400 caps per day.
---
\---------------
---
Farming super muntant/ghouls also give you lots of caps.
---
Write down all cap stash location if you want more.
---
Freak show is also a good place to get caps. They are on the tables.
---
Learn serum recipe and serum for people.
---
I don‚Äôt run mutations.... can never get any loot from the sbq and haven‚Äôt gotten around to any flux farming yet
---
I have neither the time nor the crayons to entertain idiots like this.
---
Lol, you sound personally offended. Take it easy big guy. 
---
Over 99% of TSEs in the game are dupes. That's what i meant, and that's what everyone that read it except you understood.
---
I think it only works 1-50, may be wrong, and may need to power level hard for the vendor update to spice up the old base.
---
Anyway if you build a camp at level 5 and max the budget then go and move at level 30 or something you'll notice you can now build more stuff. Easiest to see on low levels with maxed budget, and you probably move camps a few times doing the story.
---
Once I ran to a station to sell loot. Scouted out and was clear, sneak in and sell fast as I can. I hide in the bathroom with the door closed to check my pipboy deciding on what quest I was going to do. Then I hear it, footsteps. I cower in the corner waiting for the door to kick in and get shotguned in the mouth, .44 shaking in my hand. Then I hear the robot start to talk so I bust out the door pistol blazing like D‚Äôjango. Easily kill the person at the counter I grab the stuff and log out for the night. I get on the next day and had 300+ weight more then I had last night(this was before the aid drop nerf).
---
So is a 3star blooding laser rifle going to be better off for me?
---
interesting... good to know... never think of farming guns for materials
---
Lol. It's an accomplishment because if you're smart you'd respawn somewhere else.
---
Dude this thread is both awesome and hilarious.
---
Thanks! Now that I maxed super duper I‚Äôll work on that to keep as my standard luck card 
---
(I‚Äôve been using that rifle cripple card too)
---
Oh no, actually its a bloodied.  :). Even less of a reason to keep it.
---
The Night Owl
---
This is a bad idea as some people are on crowd control while everyone else is focusing the SBQ down.
---
I still blame on a lack of cast of characters to invest in , least whats keeping me from really wanting to be invested. ;c
---
Oh yes. Lucky whole for lead, West Tek for steel, toxic Larry's for acid, and a dash of cash from everywhere. Mix and make ammo.
---
Word
---
You must have been one of the guys that I've camped and farmed for caps eh?
---
