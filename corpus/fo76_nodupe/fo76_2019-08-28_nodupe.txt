Vampire weapons are great for this event.

Not necessarily. I think if there was a stickied megathread or something on the sidebar with all common complaints and highly requested features it would help the community and devs see things more clearly. There‚Äôs someone on this sub who consistently posts a huge detailed list of bugged weapons and missing mods after every update. If things like those were stickied everyone would know about.

First time I encountered a Scorchbeast I was around Lvl 20, this was right after launch/first week the game was out, had no idea who Graham was but he showed up at the fissure site and was pretty much the only reason I managed to take the thing down. Took forever but we killed the thing, and then I had the pleasure of shopping with him for the first time. ü§ô
---
Yah I run a rifle build with all rifleman cards maxed and tank killer.  So my perception is maxed, agility is maxed with action boy, adrenaline, thru hiker etc.  I have mutations there are points in luck to keep them among a few other things.  Endurance and strength I had to dumb down so my carry weight suffers even with the high capacity backpack.  I‚Äôm thinking about switching my build up, it‚Äôs a mess!
---
Vault 34 in NV will always stick with me. Working through a mammoth labyrinth battling radiation and drowning to get to the armoury was an intense experience. Then having to make my way out on the verge of death.
---
I did it a few days ago with two other people, we had him cornered and just blasted him.
---
Melee can 1-shot SBQ through her 70% damage reduction.  30k is child's play.
---
Cumbersome how?  Infinite ammo capacity, good damage?
---
Well the problem is getting people to shoot Earle, I think, with weapons that do good, consistent damage. This could be a bloodied handmade, but more people have high ammo capacity heavy weapons.
---

---
My point is that people who are overwhelmed by wendigo spawns may as well not be there. Fewer players present result in higher chances of individuals overwhelmed by spawns, and failing to dps Earle as a result.
---
In a team of 8, there's enough players that *no one* is getting overrun by spawns.
---
Graham should build his own town of friendly super mutants,  with a giant monument to Chally as the center of town. His store could be inside of it, and you could go in and it would have several floors.
---
Dark souls 3 didn‚Äôt have the best multiplayer but it allowed you to toggle whether you wanted to see people‚Äôs gamertags or their character names. It would be really simple for Bethesda to just add an option in the display settings.
---
Did you raid the ammo converters? Hehe...
---
I killed him solo after the 3 people who joined on me bailed , was difficult but still had like 4 minutes on the timer
---
So many quarter filled Ultracite Fusion Cores sat in my inv eating up space of weight
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be challenging, it‚Äôs end game content, though I‚Äôve been blessed with competence. 
---
Did take part in a failed spq today, guy who nuked only wanted to melee and wasn‚Äôt that good at it, level 130 but wasn‚Äôt built right, without dps things can fail, it happens
---
Yea when I set mine up didn‚Äôt really no much about what I was doing just knew I wanted to carry stuff cause this was before I had falllut 1st so I just dedicated all my points to strength then switched it up for a bloodied melee alittle bit now I got a fixer and handmade and it‚Äôs change the whole way I play so rn I‚Äôm only doing about 150 damage with em and 1200 with my power fist
---
I went today with my BE Pipe Revolver and it was as effective as ever (at least until the coming nerf, I guess), we were just 3 people and we completed the event. I died a lot of times, tho.
---
That man gave you a 20lb hunk of steel only worth 22 steel scrap.
---
Then me and most other Fo1st subs would cancel as all we really want is the box and tent, and the private server is meh at best I only use it for farming stuff, but can still do that on live servers, so Beth defo wont be doing that any time soon and lose that sweet revenue...
---
I have 2 of each gift size I saved that I use as decor on the Thanksgiving display case around the holidays. So not all are duped, just like 99.999% are duped
---
I got a notice you received the friend request, but nothing else. No name on my friends lists, am I missing a step? I feel like I am.
---
I know it's past time now, and well, it is what it is. But, I would still like to add you as a friend in case you do any other of these events/runs etc.
---
That's nothing. There's been pictures of hundreds at workshops. It's an exploit
---
What exactly are your Jimmy's ?
---
150 per shot damage?
---
Have you paid up on your Xbox gold subscription? I was never even given a notice that I was due I just found I couldn't connect.
---
Good question, I‚Äôll be waiting....
---
Lol. This from the person claiming a game literally made your console explode.
---
This is the best way to look at it.
---
Not sure if that‚Äôs what it is I just looked at the status damage effect on my pip boy it‚Äôs saying 153
---
üêÄ
---
That‚Äôs a real strange series of events, are you on pacifist? always keep in mind that junk should never be carried around. Too many shit can happen then it‚Äôs total loss.
---
Can you really tho?
---
If this happens to me I relaunch the game or worst reboot my console.
---
Not true
---
Did it the other day woth a lowby taking care of spawns and a stealth rifleman pulling what he could. I was the heavy and tank. 
---
I did use my gatling laser with bash, so that might hve helped or case to kill him with 7 minutes left.
---
Given their rate at doing anything, any rebalancing is years away. We finally get perk loadouts 2 years later.
---
You really don‚Äôt want to know
---
get a load of this guy. he doesn't know about the jimmies.
---
You just won't get a useless mask.  I've murdered them every time I've run though Wastelanders.  They deserve it.  So does everyone in Crater, but the game is lame.
---
my personal favourite is when you find the enemy has spawned far enough away that it triggers the "Leaving event no reward for you!" message when you go after it and its the last enemy.
---
Friend requests are wonky.  Sometimes they don't show till both people add each other.  Give it a few mins... I think the run is still gonna happen
---
No I don't, I must be from a different neck of the woods.
---
Done it in a duo and we smoked ol Earle.
---
Thank you for keeping us up to date with a post every five minutes üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Half of the 76 players are the same crowd based on what I hear in game chat.
---
[removed]
---
Same is happening to me and my friend on ps4. Weve both turn ed game and console all the way off and back again. Still no friends list.
---
800 would be plenty if [bulk packaging junk actually reduced the weight of the items](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9tzw41/with_all_the_talk_of_bulk_your_stuff_to_save/). Might be cool to be able to bulk aid items too with the caveat that they can't be used unless they're "unpacked". It'd also be cool to see weapon weights redone, as many of them are quite outrageous and the mods that should make weapons lighter make them heavier instead.
---
Heavy guns slower movement speed unless in power armor and since you've decided not to use it, you also won't benefit from armor penetration.
---
Hmmmm where is that located on the pip boy?  My explosive fixer base damage with all rifleman perks, bloody mess, tank killer, demolition expert only shows about 138 or something.  Really don‚Äôt know how to calculate the damage output with adrenaline etc..
---
Pretty sure they changed that
---
I do use pa.  Power armor is great.
---
Yeah
---
I am terribly sorry I was busy doing dishes in the kitchen hehe. I just logged on! accepting now
---
This community has gotten to be 20x more toxic since it came out on GamePass.
---
when people don't take caps it's because that gun is god roll or legacy and worth more than 30k so it's easier to trade for another weapon with similar value than switching to mule characters and shit.
---
also there is people that just want stable flux xd
---
If this doesn't deserve an F in chat I don't know what does.
---
Whats pacifist
---
Sorry it wasn't posting for some reason
---
Would you like a "magic" weapon? It isnt the greatest, but the health bar drains quickly when used right.
---
Would go great with my farm camp
---
Occasionally Microsoft servers do go down. I know there's a way to do a search to find out their status in your location I just can't remember how I did it.
---
Have you tried the legendary vendor?
---
Not to sound repetitive, but pacifist should always be on. People are scum sometimes. I've seen people using the rose's syringe from the quest to make the enemy stronger right after SBQ is dead on those leftover scorched boys she summons. Also, I've heard that if you die, and you don't click respawn, you don't drop the bag so you can wait till he gets tired of waiting and leaves. Maybe make yourself a cup of "wait here as long as you want cuz I ain't respawning till you get out of here". And when you do SBQ just in case she buggs out with the dmg she takes, it's good to be in team so it's counted as a total dmg. Hope it helps, but honestly the game just gets too toxic sometimes and it's best to take a break! Not worth the bad feels.
---
If you go on the first page of the pip boy STAT under the status tab which is the first one where you see all your damage resistance and stuff next to that is a little picture of a gun and it‚Äôll say a number which I‚Äôm assuming is the damage output of your gun
---
Oh, your post said that you didn't want to use it. If you are using it then put stablized perk from intelligence on . It gives more damage and better accuracy
---
Oh, believe me, I know.  Their inability to deliver such a simple feature is baffling.  They somehow combine the poor development and QA practices of a small, inexperienced team with the slothful pace of a giant corporation.  It's the worst of both worlds.
---
Under Settings/Game/Pacifist Mode, turn it on so you won‚Äôt shoot others by accident or become wanted, others can‚Äôt hurt you either
---
Its been like that for about a week, im not sure what to do, I have gamepass ultimate which includes gold
---
Meet me in the wild, I‚Äôll probably give you some free shit if you wind up on my public team. Fuck around with my workshop, you‚Äôre getting slaughtered. If you‚Äôre in my public team, and someone fucks with you while you‚Äôre in a workshop, you can expect me to fight on your behalf. I get a real kick out of killing people twice my level.
---
I use stabilized too, actually.  It's so great.
---
I think of it but it can be anything than a shotgun. Also thanks for relpying.
---
Do your other online games connect?
---
I moved my camp today, and Settler Wanderer seemed fine, same behavior, same riff played a bazillion times in 5 minutes.
---
"Thank you for participating in the PTS! Please redeem this code in the Xbox/Playstation/Steam  store for bonus content."
---
It's really not hard at all.
---
Oooh, ok. I only ever sgot someone once, i was using a shitty ass tesla rifle. Was accident, everyone understood. Thank you!
---
Ah ok good to know!  I‚Äôll definitely check that out later I‚Äôm curious...
---
I've got no problem slaughtering a fleeing enemy for their loot, especially while his friends are beating me with bladed gauntlets or trying to blow me up with missiles.
---
Ya try it out... kind of a troll move but it works.
---
Look, I'm giving tips based on what you said above and the link you've shown. I'm not sure what you use or don't use. If you're full health,  instead of nerd rage use first aid
---
Yea is tired the nukes but sold the fat man I had a lot of levels to climb and still today would not be able to use it
---
Ah, ok, thank you! I didnt get a no respawn option sadly. It auto respawned me üòî
---
I don‚Äôt remember people being this nice on release in fact I had a lot of common fights
---
I like it when ‚ÄúBethaniel, Man Eater‚Äù shows up when I‚Äôm capturing pylons, I wish it was much more widespread through the game than in some events
---
If I were to do something like that I would just do it on a private server.
---
You betcha! Keep your junks safe!
---
Amen.
---
I typically stay at 20% health and use a bloodied weapon, sometimes vampire at 20 if I need to be tanky, sometimes 100% health with vampire's to never die.  Mostly bloodied though.
---
The entire social is weird. There were times my boyfriend would disappear, or he all of a sudden click on me in his social and it says he sent a friend request even tho I'm already there, like what? It used to be so that if you clicked on your friend in the map, entire game would crash. I think it may be partially related to, the more friends you have, the more problems you will have with social, but that's just a wild guess, since the moment I have less people, or remove some randos, everything works quite nicely. ü§î
---
What about the buried vault at the top left corner of the map? Is that 51? I'm talking about the unmarked one.
---
Thiiiiiiicccccccccccc
---
Ofc! I am also a shotgun (and demolition build) it's a...blast. üòè
---
If you‚Äôre PS4 I can definitely craft you a combat shotgun. Not sure if I‚Äôm able to craft double barrels though.
---
Yeah! Ill try to find a place to stuff them... ü§î
---
I‚Äôve done it twice now , hard but doable
---
They care about caps for trading, so it makes sense they'd care about another currency.
---
You can use the BOS hood with the scout mask and it looks decent with the insurgent outfit
---
Go do events in the Forest, or go out gunning with a higher level player who will help you find some legendaries. Or, if you're just wanting a shotgun, you can buy the plan, get it from LVL 3 Safes, events, or player vendors.
---
What platform do you play on? That might help you find someone who can help you out.
---
That's good news for everyone dragging around chicken thighs.
---
It‚Äôd be badass to see more weight added to existing npcs
---
I don't think it should do that much damage, it is the secondary attack of a weapon.
---
We are going to switch over to texanmd's private world I ve tried talking to you ingame but it seems you have voice chat off
---
Yeah, but they were jsut 10mm and 308
---
Not even. You get so much purified water from Dailys ad Events.
---
Thinking about a Furious Chainsaw gives me a chubby.
---
What? So you guys go from being against duplicating to supporting people have several ammo generators in their base by using a glitch or hack?
---
I had 120 scraps i did 1 3 stars and 1 1 star. I got a revolver from 3 star and a combat shotgun from 1 star. I didnt used a combat shotgun and i dont have enough mods. Can it still be used?
---
Hehe you can sell them!!!
---
Yes
---
Thanks..I'll check this out
---
Except workshops are pvp areas. It overrides your pacifist setting.
---
Did he apply the skin for it from the legendary run? I've been hearing that skin is broken.
---
Actually it goes to 60 seconds after 6 deaths
---
Yeah, those I get.  I‚Äôm more or less talking about people only taking those kinds of trades for stuff like event plans etc.
---
And, I mean, I‚Äôm not trying to be the Better Business Bureau or anything, I overcharge on chems because I know people will pay it when they‚Äôre looking down the barrel of withdrawal.
---
Just wanted to raise a glass to those who still take currency.
---
I cANt shAKE ThEsE nIgHtMares, FloaTING iN SpaCe ForEVer... JuSt WhY?!
---
Do you mean the item is broken, or you can‚Äôt see his camp on the map? If you cant be seen on the map it‚Äôs the future tek skin on the camp module that causes that. If it‚Äôs the other I‚Äôve heard it can break and sink into foundations or camp objects.
---
Well, two things. Number one, sucks to hear that, there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. You‚Äôll just have to buy junk off people, or spend a day going on junk runs. If you have a private server then just take over all the workshops, but down extractors. And if you have the collectron, put him down as well. Visit locations around the map, and equip ‚Äúscrapper‚Äù under intelligence for scrapping weapons and armor. It‚Äôs unfortunate that you decided it would be a great idea to take out ALL your junk in a workshop, but nothing can be done about this now. This only happened to me once, however it was in survival mode. I didn‚Äôt lose all my junk but I did lose some mutation serums I had on me. 
---
Number 2. Unless you‚Äôre a level 20 and under that just got this game a month ago, you should‚Äôve known better. Not only if you visit this subreddit, but from experience itself. Workshops are the only place where you can get attacked and killed by another player regardless of pacifist. Workshops are meant to be this way. Don‚Äôt ever assume at any point that you‚Äôre safe in a workshop. No matter how many Turrents you put around you. Even if they don‚Äôt show up on the map, they can be crouching around with the Chinese stealth suit or just using a stealth boy. This will obviously help you realize that if you ever want to measure how much junk items you have in your stash box. You need to do that in your camp. Preferably in a locked room.  There‚Äôs always a chance of you dying and losing your junk in a workshop. 
---
That player saw you, realized how easy it would be to kill a player that‚Äôs not even paying attention because he‚Äôs checking his pip boy inventory. Then after killing you he got a really nice loot. He probably fast travelled to his camp or switched servers just to guarantee that he would keep the junk.
---
Sorry to hear that! Sadly junk is sensitive and it's best to find ways to keep it off inventory. Or get a few quick life saving pieces, auto-stimpack, there's a perk card that makes a stranger to come and stim you. Maybe if he decapitates you again, you get an animation to be revived and can quickly force-quit fallout and thus block him out from taking your life and junk. But that's a wild guess of an option, usually animations block off some actions and force quiting is often used for many things, so if you can use it against him, HA he will be quite out-smarted next time he tries pulling any nonsense.
---
I got a 1 star legendary combar shotgun from rusty pick. Thanks for your reply.
---
Correct.  Oh, I completely misread your comment.  I thought you said events.  Yeah, workshops suck, tbh.
---
I‚Äôm curious to know what yours is too cause it should be much higher then 138 cause the only rifle man perk I have is expert rifleman level 1 no tank killer but I do have bloody mess so lmk what it ends up being lol
---
Just an FYI, on top of Westek‚Äôs roof there is usually a perfectly preserved pie sitting next to a chair and an umbrella.
---
Naw, trading straightup with Pu$syPounderxX is more legit. Plus it also stops scammers
---
I'm surprised you don't know about this place.
---
You'd think that LVL 0 lock would just be a container you open, but in some alternate world a LVL 0 lock is actually locked. Makes zero GD jimmy-rustlin' sense.
---
The combat shotgun under with the shotgun build? Yes! I actually prefer them to the double barrel.
---
I tries the higher level player but we couldnt find any shotgun. But i get a 1 star legendary combat shotgun from rusty pick. Thanks for your reply.
---
Well, that's a bummer. Something must be corrupted somewhere. I've had to unplug my unit a couple of times with this Fallout 76. It apparently helped it might help you I don't know.
---
Yes! And thank you for being so straightforward with me! 
---
(Also, why are all high level people jumping 78 feet in the air?
---
Man, if you know about the 'neck of the woods' you should also know about the jimmies.
---
I assume this was a deliberate design choice so people couldn‚Äôt stockpile a valuable resource so they could instantly craft the next high-end item to come out. Of course F1st sidesteps this because üí∞
---
I tried unplugging it already, and reinstalling twice now
---
I thought it was pretty funny seeing them skeet the moment they see you, being melee, it was quite fun trying to play tag with them. ü§î
---
okay, cool. I was trying to get my headset to work, not sure mic will, i just got it today. Try and be right there.
---
Also does anyone know if this can affect the tamable pets showing up at your camp
---
Save some scrip for September 10th‚Äôs sale.
---
Have you thought about crafting one?
---
I swear Bethesda is so bad at giving support there like a dad saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôll have you unplugged it and plugged it back in?‚Äù
---
Everything on my vendors are free.  Any legendaries I have after script limit is free.  I also keep food and water for the famished dwellers.  Feel free to add me.  My GT: GenX4thewin
---
It is a political statement
---
Nah, he seems pretty random, although he might follow some kind of route I'm unaware of. Sometimes I'll go weeks without seeing him, sometimes I can see him twice a day. Not sure if there is any logic to his visits.
---
Honestly, just grind to about 35 and stick to the main quest, loot is soo much easier in your 30s, levels 20-30 are the hardest in the game (though I enjoyed the challenge!) it‚Äôs a mix of still figuring out the mechanics and having no resources
---
Yes but i dont have the plans for one.
---
Tell me more about this place
---
I half agree.    There‚Äôs a lot of stuff that could really use a weight adjustment, but knowing how Bethesda feels about doing, y‚Äôknow, their job, I think a more likely solution would be to add stashbox variants in the same flavor as backpack mods to buy with bullion or get from the legendary run or something.  A chemist‚Äôs stashbox as an example, that reduces weight of stored chems by a percentage.
---
That being said, even though I personally don‚Äôt need the stash space, 800lbs is far too small for anyone who plays the game even half as often as Bethesda would like.
---
You can substitute ‚Äúgauss shotgun‚Äù for x, and this logic would apply to all the weapons and their respective perks. Instead of trying to find new ways to kill these folks abusing the gauss (and before this, frog legs, followed by the Tesla rifle back when flatwoods was the only map) y‚Äôall go straight to bitchin. They‚Äôre still killable as is everybody else in the lobby lol
---
Pog
---
Crafting a level 25 *legendary* combat shotgun?
---
I have your dad's skin, sacs, and heads on display in my camp.
---
Will do, I‚Äôm just looking at the base damage off the gun when perks are equipped
---
The little projector thing was on top of his seedy shed and The shed got destroyed, and the camp never showed back up
---
Originally, you had to loot the chest.
---
Are you using the future tech skin for your CAMP module?
---
Having a robot piss people off when they come to my can pls a MUST
---
Yeah, that ship has sailed.
---
It may have glitched into the foundations. Not sure what you can do other then moving camp.
---
A good chunk of my discord is having the same issue.
---
Yup, they were bush wookies complaining because people actually had to fight w sticks and stones and suddenly they couldn‚Äôt hide lmao those small circles were fast paced and fun. Obviously not for everybody, but a welcome addition to those who actually play avidly.
---
Yes! Love that idea.
---
Glad to help. Also, it's marsupial serum. Once you get to higher levels and get the right cards in luck for mutations that make them non-curable and decrease the negative effects, you pretty much have a ton of them. You can buy serums, which you do at early game, later on you can make them. It's better to do research on them, as there are many of them and it can cost from 200-500 caps if the seller is reasonable. It could also be backpack mods, as there's a jetpack mod for a backpack. But yeah, definitely try mutations, just make sure to read /watch some videos about it as it can be tricky! üòâüòä
---
I don‚Äôt think he did know it was on top of the seedy shed And the shed got destroyed and the camp projector thing disappeared and did not reappear after he repaired it
---
It‚Äôs a DC 5 lock. Anyone can pick it if they spend enough time working on it. 
---
And if the legendary perk info I‚Äôve heard is accurate, eventually we‚Äôll be able to just ‚Äòauto-pick‚Äô them.
---
There hve been glitches in the past that let you place wallpapers you didn‚Äôt own. Are you sure you bought them?
---
Do you think deleting the seedy shed would help
---
I stopped looting the chest after I realized it only had some caps and ore in it. That was really disappointing.
---
Still, taking a rifle butt from someone who can casually carry 300lbs isn‚Äôt gonna be a lovetap.
---
They could at least give it a decent stagger chance based on str
---
Are you using the same Internet connection for Reddit as you are for your XBox?
---
I think about leveling up and just use random guns until level 30-50 but im a bit scared about wastelanders storyline. Does it needs a good build and good guns or not. Im a little confused. Some random guy told me it needs that stuff. Thanks for your reply.
---
I dont know how to do that.
---
for some reason, I can't hear you in chat. I set everything to default. I don't know, I can hear everything else.
---
I would also love these outfits if you're still willing to craft them!
---
BOOOOO THIS MAN
---
I played a stealth build melee/heavy guns build there were times where I didn‚Äôt have the ammo but could sneak past what I needed to (I also had the Chinese stealth armor by 35). Other builds require more ammo management which is why I went melee for the grind up to 50 before switching over
---
Do you have discord? it might work for you?
---
Bovine Behemoth, smdh.
---
No, a regular shotgun. He didn't flat out say he wanted a legendary shotgun.
---
Upvote just because I hate to see jimmies being rustled
---
Ooo, ok. Thank you so much!
---
A lot of folks like Morgantown. Flatwoods shows up here and there. Most of us got sick of it because it was the only map for a good while. Lol
---
What platform do you play on? If you're on XB, I might can craft you one.
---
Other games run fine like destiny for example
---
Positive. I heard about the using if not owning. But I know I had them owned in my inventory in the AtomShop. I can remember distinctly which colors were in which order when I owned them. That‚Äôs my issue with BETHESDA Support saying I didn‚Äôt own. I‚Äôve had other say they‚Äôve had items also ‚Äúanimal bushes‚Äù or something of that nature and they have one in their CAMP but can‚Äôt make anymore cause it‚Äôs gone.
---
You can‚Äôt. Which was my point to the other person. 
---
You seem to be looking for a legendary shotgun. The only shotgun that you can craft as legendary is the Gauss Shotgun. And I have a feeling you don‚Äôt have the plans for that yet.
---
Happened to me today too. Earl floated into the ceiling and sank into floor many times before just completely disappearing. Many bullets and time wasted for a failed event. Not to mention that I had to drop the nuke for this garbage. In the end most of the players hung out looted and took pictures. The community remains great in this game! :)
---
A lot of peeps are probably gonna gloss over this one as a "why bother" but that's just the thing, it's a combat action that still needs a place in the game. Imo keeping the damage non-lethal (if you're not a strength build) would be fine if it at least caused a good stun. That sort of thing will cause concussions IRL, anyway
---
A cool thing Fo4 had was you could use weapon bashing to finish off/auto kill a weakened enemy, though it seems like they got rid of that, along with most of the unique combat animations (i.e. deathclaws picking you up, humanoid enemies mantling over obstructions, etc.) For whatever reason
---
No im on ps4
---
Sounds like you have a case of the Fallout 4's, sir and or madam.
---
Symptoms usually include but are not limited to: 
---
-Settlers not spawning/appearing correctly
---
-Settlers appearing naked despite having clothing equipped
---
-Settlers huddled together in one area outside of the intricate building you have created specifically for their use and no other
---
-Interesting locations that only serve as shooting galleries
---
While it is hard to diagnose at times, this seems to be a definitive case of Fallout 4. 
---
I hereby declare this post under quarantine, by the power and protection of The Minutemen. It looks like this settlement needs our help...
---
(In all honesty the game is just broken, Beckett was standing at the edge of my camp in his chonies for a few days)
---
Man that happened to me today... dude 650 levels higher showed up and one shotted me.  Was thinking thanks a lot a-hole I was nearly done with the defense.  I hope enjoyed the 12 lead he looted from my corpse.
---
Cheers I‚Äôll save this post. Thank you for the insight.  By the by; is there like a directory of these things? A wiki type site of fo76 legendary‚Äôs? And could you. Elaborate or explain what you mean by ‚ÄúMAGIC‚Äù?
---
Starting to feel like 99.999% of players are.
---
And if you're on pc you can move the slider with the mouse. Its faster then just using buttons.
---
Drops the fabled Mookashine
---
I don't think so. We use weak bash attack to share the loot. If bash damage is high, legendary creature will be killed more easily and many player lose their loot.
---
Big kiss! If you need some supplies and are PC hit me up
---
No worries my dude, hope this negative experience doesn't repeat! Honestly I think it's pretty rare, almost as rare as wining lottery so you should be safe. But if taking a break makes you happy, then the heck with it! Happy gaming to youüòä
---
There is no cow level..
---
Nobody's saying it need to do a lot of damage, just enough to be \*somewhat\* useful.
---
I know, right? Just think of all the floater grenades they can craft now. Lucky bastard!
---
Im not looking especially for a legendary, but i got a 1 star combat shotgun from my last scraps. But i dont have any mods for it. Still usable?
---
That's a problem with the loot sharing system itself, if you're just near an enemy when it dies you should get to loot it, especially if it's part of an event. My opinion, at least
---
Last few years? It‚Äôs only been out a year and a half lol
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
Was this your drop? Where did you drop it, I got this today.
---
My two shot mirv Fatman somehow cannot even kill lv 20 radrats... With maxed explosives expert and that perception perk that boosts explosive radius.
---
Yeah hes making us look bad!
---
Would you like to switch over to discord?
---
There was only maybe 800 or so of each total. I guess I‚Äôll just toss them in the converter
---
I do.
---
Not in the OP, but all the replies have referenced legendary versions, including the one you replied to. 
---
If OP just wants a level 25 non-legendary combat shotgun, that should be simple enough for one of us to get for them.
---
Are switching builds easy at this level?
---
I believe I read somewhere that this was the actual intent of the event.  But the design became such a colossal problem that they renamed the event...
---
Ah ok cool thanks
---
Not sure.i didn't get to see that.you can see the vid on yt.his name is tyr.thats his channel.he is an aussie and swears like a sailor.lol
---
From my experience, whether you're sitting with your stash full or empty, whenever someone sees you in workshop, they immediately fast travel to you just for the sake, that you're a free snacc. Not worth taking these workshops in public servers alone. 7/10 times there's someone constantly waiting to take your junk. Especially if you're lower level. üòí
---
If I could hear you there, than yeah. Cause, I think that may help.
---
No, I'm on pc.
---
All my builds are strength based builds and if you want to maximize your build, then no, it will take more time, but I was content to be a little more jack of all trades till 100 or so
---
Radrats are a menace to the wasteland and definitely the tankiest creature.
---
Rodents of unusual size? I don't believe they exist
---
It is
---
It should display both at once, one larger than the other dependant on the viewers settings.
---
I'm randomxyn there as well.
---
Script is maxed, I know the kinky stuff is caps, I‚Äôll try to post description on them in 24 hours baby sitting tonight.
---
Wow I like not reloading, might have to play with that once I can run again lol
---
I do enjoy seeing what other people's camps look like.
---
Unfortunately, most that I see are the ugly (to me) single-foundation floating camps. Mine is a nice two-story house on the lake. I do see some similar builds, though.
---
Can you add Ragebreaker#1844?
---
Yes, but I‚Äôm sure one of us can help you with mods for a non-legendary version. I‚Äôll be glad to make whatever shotgun you need and put whatever mods on it you want. 
---
What platform?
---
Stagger would be nice
---
The main thing is that scream attack, if you wedge yourself right, you can keep running into the wall and not run into something deadly lol
---
Not on pc though.
---
Im on ps4
---
Udderly speechless at how awesome this sounds.
---
If you see Uranium Fever, Lode Bearing, or Breach and Clear, start up, try that. Those events are full of Mole Miners, and they usually have shotguns. Plus, try Welch in the Ash Heap, lots of Mole Miners there, one of them is bound to have a shotgun. Also, you might try looking around in the lot at Blackwater Mine for some laying around on the ground - they might not be your level, but you can grab them and scrap them for to maybe learn the mods.
---
What mystery? I‚Äôm confused. Nice camp though.
---
Fair point, I agree with you there.
---
Is the ts Tesla, better the the Assassins three starred Tesla?
---
Thanks i will look for those events.
---
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è check the terminal in the investigator cabin.
---
Dang. XBox and PC here. 
---
Hopefully someone on PS4 can help. 
---
Best of luck!
---
Stash weight is there for a reason
---
Flux mule. I have a weapons and ammo mule. I‚Äôm sure you could do the same.
---
Ueah i did notice the very low health and high rads.so yeah he must be.the plasma gatlin he was using was eating hp pretty quickly until the wendigo spawns came out.then his gun broke.lol.he had to get to cover and repair it.then was running for his life for a bit.but he did do it.died a few times too.
---
Did you drop it today at a workshop then shoot at me??? If so what shop?
---
PLEASEEE
---
Depends on your build, really.   Assassin‚Äôs isn‚Äôt good for anything outside of pvp, but someone will definitely want both
---
No problem, thanks for replies you guys really helped me!
---
Its been going on all day. Its affecting some people but not others.
---
Next they'll be saying they don't know about the gears that get grinded.
---
And bash damage durability loss. And durability loss in general. A minigun with a shredder breaks in just a minute or two, only after taking out a couple enemies.
---
Did you use a heavy gun?i am curently setup for shotties and non automatic rifles,but i can easily change my cards to fit any scenario.
---
Interesting I like it. üëå
---
Did first run last night with friend.  Strangely we only had group of 3 and then 4 fighting in there.  Failed.  Then got new chum level 400 plus to help.   Def good advice on ammo and stims.  Ran completely out and had to just Grognak axe it up.  Managed score plushie and really wanna get taxidermy heads !
---
No, I was mostly just kidding.  I dropped it under the purveyor shop
---
Ive always been a power armor user.... new exploit? Aw shit... great thats exactly what PA needs more nerfs... fucking glitchers
---
It damn well better not be by vertibird. They‚Äôre not supposed to have those for quite a while.
---
censorerikii posted 1 post today that lead me to believe we will.
---
Yea 800 storage is really limited (400 at launch lol), if you have lots of stuff on display, there‚Äôs not much room left for scraps
---
I have had a love and hate relationship with shotguns, I love using them but in xbox there is this naggy bug where aiming it can freeze it on that spot unless you reload or spam run, I also don't like reloading some of them, unless there is a workaround that?
---
Oh, man, I need that laugh today.  Thanks.
---
What‚Äôs scrip?
---
you are welcome to join now if you want, we still have spots
---
Of course everyone wants a legendary, but if you're a shotgun build without a shotgun, a non-legendary will do in a pinch, right?
---
I am the OP lol, not that guy
---
Oof I‚Äôm on pc
---
Haha, Gary!
---
I mean yeah, that‚Äôs possible, but it shouldn‚Äôt have to be like that, especially since we have no inter-character transfer mechanism. If something like that came to be then yeah, a flux mule would work just fine. But I don‚Äôt want to run the risk of losing stuff that I put in world containers to transfer between characters, and I don‚Äôt have any friends who play this game.
---
4 people, 2 with legacy flamers
---
An aesthetical character idea could be not wearing outfits, since in reality it's weird how any outfit can hide entire armor like it's just an extra t-shirt. Or it's also fun to choose that your character is insane bloodthirsty raider, and entire game he can only drink bloodpacks and eat flesh with cannibal perk, there's a perk for drinking bloodbags too, so you don't completely make yourself thirsty entire gameplay. You can literally just make it more challenging by choosing specific type of food your character may eat, going from dog food to getting mutations and only eating veggies or meat. ü§î
---
That's 51for sure
---
Ok ok, what‚Äôs a fair price?
---
Yes, no argument there.
---
Nice ty
---
Also to do away with OP builds, should be nice
---
Thanks for all the up votes! Most I've ever had is like 20! Didn't realize so many people felt this way lol
---
But if it's done as a Mischief Night prize, it has to be a earned prize, something you would have to collect items and turn in for..... Not on the random loot table. I would be ultra pissed getting a shit load of random shit spamming an event to just get shafted on loot rolls for the ONLY THING I WOULD WANT!!!!!!!   .... YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID @BETHESDA!!!!
---
There's a Fallout Tactics sub?
---
I gotta get on that. I can't believe people still play
---
Isnt it just the pa itself no longer breaks? Or does it get double stats?
---
At least 5
---
If you give me an option to click on a thing to a thing,
---
then let me click on the same option to undo a thing.
---
  I.e. let me simply click the Public Leader again and choose Leave Team.
---
You are right about the movement, it is what mostly gets me killed. I was thinking about using Assault Rifles, raising my Perception, however, I kind of need the Barbarian perk at its maximum potential else I am so fragile. You think it would worth to invest more on a bloodied handymade? I guess I would sacrifice cheap for expensive due to its ammo
---
Ouh hey speaking of which . Pc player here with 10,000 5 mill ammo to trade for certain junk items . Looking for copper aluminum and ballistic fibre . StonerNixon will be back on in a few hours
---
I took you for OP,  my bad
---
I was exploring the mire and came across some wendigos. I tried to just sneak around them but then I heard a battle cry from off the in the distance and in comes grahm with chally running behind him. He took the time to just bonk the shit out of the wendigos. Grahm is a true legend
---
There was a chest? What
---
Still good to know. I'm glad it was brought up, sux that you gotta buy multiple collectrons to get more options..
---
You can try. Worst case the camp module is stuck underground and you need to move. Best case it at least pops up broken on the ground.
---
This was TMI, too much immersion.
---
HIS NAME WAS *SHOTGUN BOB*
---
Oofff
---
17.6% of currently active players across all platforms have an active membership for Fallout First. 
---
Source: &gt;!What, you actually expected a source?  This was just a joke. Bethesda is *never* going to provide that kind of information to the public.!&lt;
---
There‚Äôs a spawn on top of west tek
---
Bring Fisto
---
I'm sorry - that sounds really horrible.  Do it once then let others who like pain to do future nuking.  That's what I do.
---
That can work too, a railgun would be better for more direct confrontations and handy for stealth.
---
Based on totally anecdotal evidence from the folks I run around with in game, it seems to be triggered by people using explosives (grenades, mines, fatman/nukes) on him.
---
Don't forget to move your camp once in awhile! Its how the added Camp Budget gets applied/updated. There was a slight budget increase with Wastelanders.
---
I'd be all over you, but I'm out of ammo.
---
Same. I launched one nuke to get the achievement/Pioneer Scout badge and haven't bothered with it again.
---
Agreed in general just trying to help.
---
Have you tried talking to the other lady? There's two, yanno?
---
I got a 2 star tenderizer after completing Colossal Problem. I was like "Well that's interesting".
---
*slow clap*
---
There's those that will sell you a rare plan for 5k caps, and those who will sell their bobbleheads for 500 caps. More 500 cap bobblehead sellers than the rare plan sellers. Sadly. Or I think the rare plan sellers are hiding in f76 trading websites. ü§î
---
I wasn‚Äôt planning on using it. I‚Äôve used workstations that already had them in it which was nice but I never made one. I still think Bethesda shoulda patched it by now
---
What this exploit I'm confused
---
Still is, its a red chest when you are close to the exit theres a room thatll be straight in front of you with the chest. Its right at the end before you make a left to exit the mine go straight. Nothing good in it.
---
At the very least you could give mirelurk queen meat to the raiders to blackeye. It‚Äôs slow but it‚Äôs better than nothing
---
There are also 2 raider dailies. Make sure you talk to both and aren‚Äôt sitting on the other quest. There is importance of communication and retirement plan
---
My favorite thing to do is still jump into an area I haven‚Äôt been in a while and explore, I still find stuff. I fast travel for the ‚Äúchores‚Äù before doing that though. 
---
I do make my camp feel like part of the world as a rule, only break the rule around the vending machines
---
Hey, there we go.  I was wondering when you would figure it out.
---
Yep. Had 5. Now basically play 1, sometimes a second but mostly they are scrip mules.
---
Radroachess, rad roach queen
---
Yup.
---
Truth.
---
TSE might be great again, tell them to try em out. Game needed a fix, its way too easy
---
I would also like Brahminotaur enemy type pls
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ 
---
I'm an idiot and I guess you were having your fun .
---
Yo son?!?!?! Lol
---
Me too
---
You are being prepared for the harsh reality that eventually there will be a time when they force combat with you and take all of your junk or nuke your entire camp. The balance of fallout that for all the good, there's one asswipe ready to ruin your experience. üòí
---
VTU has its own twisted story (available long before Wastelanders), for those who haven't explored it. And it's a full-fledged vault.
---
I've done it solo with 3 AFKers on the PTS with the damage nerf.
---
I was indeed.  I hope real op sees what I said.  To not wear pa with a heavy is silly.  Fusion cores are nothing to worry about.
---
As someone who spent weeks looking for a fixer plan and/or fixers to little avail I feel ya
---
I don't know man, I think it would be pretty sweet if they put actual bonuses on the in-game wedding rings and maybe give some bonus small buff for wearing it if it's matched with another player, or well an NPC. ü§î Then you can get an in-camp bonuses at least or find someone to play with.
---
You do get a verbal message once you get past the initial laser grid regarding having a key card.  The whole "Welcome general ... nuclear key card detected" bit
---
Apocalypse Cow.
---
Most of legendary perks on armor are to reduce my weight.
---
I have 20% weapon reductions on a few 
---
Ammo reduction etc..
---
Then increasing ap regen,  +1 strength and invisible when croucged
---
Scrip is legendary weapons and armor you get that is useless to you that you can turn in at train station via the legendary exchange machine. Then you can use the scrip to buy a variety of stuff from the purveyor at the rusty pick which is a location in the lower left hand side of the map
---
They need to fix stimpack spamming for Power armor, atleast make an interval delay
---
Aw come on, most of those plans are in White Springs or Watago now anyways if you know where to look. I'm just saying it'd be cool to see him with his own scavenged CAMP or something. As a character he's the most liveliest and the only npc I'm really interested in the entire game. Just my opinion.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Fuck no.
---
I‚Äôve only found one that I had a over a year and I accidentally ate it last night.  I was sad.
---
It‚Äôs been about a year since I decided that I need the stimpak diffuser recipe, can‚Äôt get the drop solo, can‚Äôt find someone to sell it to me, and have a hell of a time trying to assemble a competent group to grind the event with me.
---
This is gonna make ya mad, but I got the fixer plan by finding it on the ground at someone‚Äôs camp, and I don‚Äôt even use rifles.
---
it's cheese
---
No problem if you need a better explanation I‚Äôd suggest YouTube a tutorial
---
I feel you, but I mentioned in another post it'd be more like a camp. Most plans can be found in Watago or White Springs if you know where to look. I'd like to see his story evolve over Appalachia, maybe getting hold of a CAMP module even and dropping it down as he travels the wasteland.
---
Lmao you took the ‚Äúduped‚Äù ammo too- it‚Äôs not a dupe it‚Äôs legacy ü¶ï
---
I miss the secret Bunkers you would occasionaly stumble on in Fallout 4.
---
You could play for months exploring.And suddenly stumble on one
---
Replayabillty of that game was brilliant.
---
Bethesda gets a lot of stick.But i have had my money worth out of this game.
---
I would definitely pay for more content like the Fallout 4 DLC.
---
Personally i wish they would put more effort in to that than the Atom Shop.
---
If all vendors were terminals you would get a situation where someone is buying 20 purified waters and he gets 20 missiles. That's the very same bug that the terminal used for exchanging bullets to points has right now. Often people buy a large amount of certain bullets and instead they get a completely different type of bullets. Imagine buying 1k. 50cal bullets and you get 1k flares, that's what most often happens. ü§î
---
Ha! Doesn‚Äôt make me mad, luck is part of the game!
---
I also did find deals on all sorts of outfits during my hunt and ended up with a mediocre 3* fixer, wasnt a total loss
---
Downvotes inbound in 3.2.1
---
This right here. I do it because .308 ammo is rare as fuck and they locked the only other ammo factory behind max rep with Raiders
---
Stop witch hunting someone. Its rule fucking 9.
---
You mean you wont give me your B2525 fixer? You're such a bad person!
---
Same for me xb1. Hasn't been working for at least 6 hours. Cannot join my friends through xbox either. Get a message saying "could not join because your friends list could not be verified" 
---
Usually if my friends list isn't working, I restart my game and viola. This is frustrating.
---
You‚Äôre a better sport than I, my friend.   If someone found the diffuser recipe on the ground I‚Äôd probably want to twist my controller in half lol
---
It's been like that for me all day. Although, when I use my 2nd PSN account it works just fine. My main just doesn't want to work no matter what I do.
---
Rule 9 you incompetent dumbass. 
---
 **No witch-hunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game. Do not accuse players of cheating, use** [**Bethesda's official support pages**](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)**. Do not name and shame in general.** 
---
I don't give a fuck about who has what in their camps.
---
Idgaf let the downvotes come they're scared cause I'm right
---
&gt; So you guys go from being against duplicating to supporting people have several ammo generators in their base by using a glitch or hack?
---
Rule 9 idiot.
---
Battle cattle
---
Ha ha Gary!
---
How did you know I was sitting on a wooden bench?
---
How about a giant spider üï∑Ô∏èü§î if there's a giant ant, why doesn't the game has a giant spider and to make it creepier, it can be some jumpy hunter species that lives in caves hidden from threats like scortched. Imagine going to deal with ant problem to find the ants been eaten by killer spiders thats now are attacking you from tiny caves until you reach mama spider.
---
*magic*
---
I tested this a month ago, and the duplicated mods didn't work. It appears as equipped in the PA frame, and you can even see two different skins on the same piece simultaneously when the PA is on the ground, but when wearing the PA only one piece is equipped at a time.
---
Nope. Not sitting on either. No little marker shows up either. I dunno.
---
Yeah, i roleplay my character when i play.
---
One thing do is limit how many weapons i can use. I run a jack of all trades master of none type build. But i keep one rifle, a handgun and a small melee weapon, a knife or machete. Cus carrying around 4 rifles is super unrealistic i never allow myself to do that. It makes weapons feel more personal.
---
Wood is in Helvetia
---
Are the rewards still the exact same? Or is here any changes?  I did look around, but was not able to find it.
---
Does it say no nuclear keycard detected if you dont have one? I never went in without one, but now I want to hear it.
---
Power armor already is bad enough compared to normal armor, it doesn‚Äôt need any nerfs
---
Only if killing the Brahmin using a laser weapon allows you to loot pre-cooked ribeye steak.
---
Is that where you used the beef? It really doesnt work does it.
---
That would be awesome but insanely creepy
---
I‚Äôd venture to guess it used to be at peak 50% then the dupe ban wave happened and I‚Äôd say it probably dropped down to less then 15-20%
---
In other words, I've only seen this happen when explosives are used- and have never seen it happen when explosives aren't used. 
---
\[insert typical disclaimer- I'm on PS4, this is just my experience, etc.\]
---
It's not painful at all if you go in with a Vampire weapon and also the door glitch to bypass the reactor section.
---
Just clear out all robots turrets and I mean all of them, start the prep and then do nothing for a few minutes waiting.
---
Cool thing is once you have entered the code once for the week you don't have to do it again for that silo till reset. Just enter key card and done. 15 minutes max and no Stimpacks used.
---
I actually was doing the ash heap Prime Cuts event a few days ago and finally spawned the Sheepsquatch. Turned my back for a second and out of nowhere a Grafton Monster starts beating the heck out of him. I was shocked... I've never seen two "boss" legendary creatures fighting. I bet you can guess who won, though! :)
---
You're practically unkillable if you spam stimpacks and have full T65
---
just stay back from Earle and focus most of your fire on the wendigos, I went in at like level 45 and the only time I died was from dropping into the area haha
---
I've basically quit the game over this. I understand having a limit but I've had to essentially get rid of every great gun I've picked up &amp; keep only a few, gut my inventory &amp; the game for me has become not enjoying it but having to perpetually go back to camp to swap out items or drop items because I'm constantly over encumbered or right at the line.
---
It's just not fun doing this only.
---
Oh, it works.    You‚Äôll just wish that it didn‚Äôt.
---
 Wavy Willards is a good place to grind for weapons at your level. Scorched carry shotguns, combat rifles and the like.
---
This sounds like an issue you might have to take up with support.. in the meanwhile just try to do the blackeye daily and make sure to give her mirelurk queen meat, gives the most rep
---
Probably because in this game has always some dupe method, lol
---
r/unexpectedmeatloaf
---
They also seem to be planning something for vault 51 (not NW related, as its in adventure mode)
---
Lol my power armor almost never breaks.!I can repair it every other month
---
Unless you know, you get staggered by every fucking enemy in the game.
---
You literally get 15 legendary effects with normal armor, some combinations make you literally undetectable by enemies and you can take 75% less damage and get 30% more xp, tons of melee damage, tons of health and ap, etc. you‚Äôre telling me power armor needs a nerf now?
---
Right away your majesty! We will fix this immediately!
---
Well, that's enough internet for the day.
---
Earl is too hard. Everyone I get in with quits halfway through.
---
I didn't know about the blood pack perk and I am going full cannibal for the first time too so its funny you said that! I have done food choices for fun before though. My main drinks strictly nuka dark haha
---
That bit didn't register with me until I made it to the end. It all clicked into place after that.
---
Your idea has merit, but to get Bethesda on board you have to somehow work in the fact that it takes a nuclear weapon to trigger.  
---
Maybe the barn door is locked and only a nuke can open it.  Maybe one of the Brahmin heads is stuck in a bucket and the only way to remove it is a nuke.
---
I never said nerf PA itself, perhaps increase the resistances, but you're practically invincible if you spam stimpacks, use a stealthboy and fly around with a jetpack. It needs to be tweaked
---
I believe it says "not detected", and gives a spiel on it being required along with the code, but it's been a while since I've forgotten one in there
---
Nah
---
One word. Oxhorn. Check out this guy for FO lore on everything in the game.
---
Wanted to run into earl tonight, so now i have to find out. Damn curiosity kills me more than anythingelse.
---
Actually, many treasure maps drop good equipment for scraping, especially weapons that don't usually just lay around. US requisition holo tapes drop loot with rare and often unknown weapon mods that you can scrap as well, but for the best loot, use the radio station in highest level areas. So far the best one is near lucky hole mines. üòä
---
Well played with i could upvote twice
---
It's a lot. Maybe it's confirmation bias, but I feel like I see way more camps with scrapboxes than ones without.
---
What's wrong with 'AssBlaster'? He seems like a decent person...
---
although I would not turn my back to him...
---
Rachel. just saw her not half an hour ago. She was up the road from the rusty pick near where the lemonade vendor spawns
---
Sure thing, nocturnal, blocking plus endurence.
---
Same here man, it's been like that all day. Kinda weird considering my 2nd PSN account loads just fine.
---
Oh, is KILL for a poncho like his. Hot damn I‚Äôm onboard with this idea!
---
I really have to question how truthful some of these stories actually are.
---
You can't destroy other people's bases, unless the 'base' is actually a workshop and not a camp. Or they're using an exploit.
---
Fallout really spared us by not evolving the creepy animals that people have fears of. Imagine seeing a massive centipede or a massive leech worn that randomly starts swallowing and devouring you in certain water sources on muddy areas. ü§î
---
Somewhere on the map they place a heard of cattle that is spreading the scorched plague, you have to nuke them to eliminate it.
---
It's a lot more than you think. In a SQB fight it's not uncommon to see at least 4 or 5 survival tents.
---
And if you join NW you will see a boatload of bog masks and the ranger apparel.
---
I am happy to have fallout 1st, I enjoy the benefits I get and I use the survival tent like a second home for going AFK or events like meat week fast travel point. Scrap box is great.
---
This is by far the most buggy game I have played and restarting the game 4 times a session is a major pain in the ass but I still love playing it and I would buy over 1650 atoms a month anyway so might as well get the other stuff thrown in as well.
---
Well, any game that gets as bad as a rep as 76 on release of course will have the price drop like a rock. It was a complete mess with how many bugs there were. But they still at least didn't just drop the game, continued to work on it, and even released these updates free. Heck, I stopped playing a little after my first character got to level 40(now I have a 112, 171, and 71). 
---
I partially agree that the game isn't quite at the point where you can play however you like but not in the way you're seeing it. The problem I see is the balancing in various perks, gear, and such. The problem is that with how everything is, players are generally forced into specific builds if they want to be able to even compete in terms of damage. Two-shot, bloodied, and junkie are easily the most popular legendary effects as their damage potential far outranks others. Then there's other mods like nocturnal, assassin's, and mutant's that are generally placed alongside non-legendary weapons. 
---
Sure, being able to respec whenever you'd like would be great but there is also the consideration of replayability. If you were to have the option to just change everything up at will, then people would get tired of the game incredibly quickly. There would be no reason for anyone to make a new character aside from mules. The fact that there even is a respec system is nice. Compare it to other games, if you wanted to play another way, ended up putting a point or two somewhere else by accident, or wanted to fine-tune a build, you'd need to start a new character every single time. 
---
And then of course there's several reasons that can be named off on why there's a cap on special points. Just to name two, one- so you can't create an overpowered build that runs universally and can do anything and everything, and two- again, replayability. 
---
From my perspective, it simply sounds like you don't want to put in anymore effort into the game since you've already done so once and that you should be able to undo or change previous decisions you've made without cost.
---
Your insane. I love it.
---
Then so does normal armor. You can do the exact same thing in normal armor, it just requires legendary rolls instead of stimpacks
---
I wanna make a noob do that quest where you have to dig the grave and say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs two types of people in this world. Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig‚Äù dressed in that
---
What about the base dmg perk card?
---
Same.
---
I paid $60 for a pre-order to play Fallout, not an inventory simulator. I paid $60 for what I thought was a AAA console title, not a subscription service or grindy mobile game with micro-transactions. They taught me to never pre-order another game. I haven't played in months now. I just keep following this sub hoping something will change.
---
His base literally looked like a nuke hit it
---
High charisma, there's a bunch of perks that give benefits to your teammates when you stim, or let you heal them (friendly fire is great for this) 
---
Go for a flamer, and double check if the flamer attachments to the gatling plasma, and base plasma guns proc that effect as well. 
---
Also grab the perks that buff how effective stims are and how fast they heal, it should affect those aoe perks whenever you pop a stim
---
Running power armor you can equip the medics pump so you'll automatically be the heal spot. 
---
Personal experience, trying to build around the medic Weapon affix would take a gunslinger style build, high agility and luck, for grim reaper sprint, gun fu, and other repetitive vats cards. If the flamer attachment works for friendly fire you could run a medics plasma flamer pistol and maximize the synergy.
---
I mean it pulls from your stash. They‚Äôre just items tagged. I hope it wouldn‚Äôt be too much. 
---
Then selling ammo: we sell script. Seems like the same code just recycled.
---
I remember walking near the Asylum and seeing Grahm unleashing his mutant fury against someone's camp. There was a dead Mirelurk there, and the Brahmin was nowhere to be seen. 
---
Obviously, that camp was evil, cursed. Grahm could feel it. He has "the shine". 
---
I had to help him. We really taught that camp a lesson that day.
---
There's special perk card for bloodbags and there's one for eating dog food, which is so random and totally unexplained. Especially since there isn't one for all pre-world food. Just dog food. üê∂ü§î
---
I passed him over the weekend. Only 7 levels away from finishing the run. Then I can finally play the game
---
"Like a voltron of cows." I... Thank you for introducing this combination of words to us, OP.
---
I love Oxhorn, I used to watch his videos everyday until he started doing content on other games. Someone else mentioned he has a video on this already so ill have to watch it haha
---
We need more giant enemies in general lol but I wouldn't be mad at fighting a giant bramin üòÇ make it blue though since it would go along with the vault (Paul) Bunyon statue and boom! Babe the Giant Blue Brahmin! üôè
---
Man I find it easier to level up my lv 200 unyielding commando than it is to level my lv 8 mule.
---
I would love this!
---
Silo aint that hard for me. Shotguns and a flamethrower, your all set to solo üëç
---
If you have the forest it goes well with the raider Skinner hood and looks great with the outfit
---
Thanks
---
I think while the vendors can be quite uncomfortable and lacking more organizing, there's so much that needs to be added, that I'd leave them alone for now. Just recently there was a bug where people would abuse vendors and pull out items from your stash through vendor for low prices. At least that is gone.
---
You cannot spam stimpacks as fast as you can in Power armor, your damage resistances dont matter when any damage dealt to you is immediately mitigated by 10 stimpacks used in 2 seconds
---
Sure you can Quantum spam not in power armor, but atleast there's an animation delay for using stimpacks on foot, I think this causes an imbalance
---
Even Auto stim, born survivor and serendipity dont compare to a PA user with over 300 stims in their inventory spraying their JE gat plasma
---
I doubt there's anything we can do about it.  It's been unavailable all day for me, and sporadically for others.
---
Yes they do
---
It literally tells you in the group description. It's 100% extra XP (ie: double normal) if it's a group of 4 and you're bonded with the other 3 people. That percentage goes down as the group gets smaller.
---
Dude, thank you for even letting me know that Wasteland 3 was even a thing. I must've been living under a rock. Finished the run yesterday myself. Wasteland 2 was a bit too buggy for me, but I'm still a big fan. üëç
---
This. I sell them because I need the space, not the caps. And 1sters buy them within the hour.
---
This ‚Äúnew exploit‚Äù is just a waste of materials. It doesn‚Äôt actually benefit you at all. Terrible terrible you tubers suck at actually investigating. Fucking clickbaters
---
Bokeh has its uses, but can be distracting.
---
Love the game photography though! Please post if possible.
---
It says it in the game. 25% for each team member, including you.
---
lol. Anything else you want? Peace on earth? Goodwill to man?
---
Just happy they gave me the helmet for all those space onesies.
---
You can exploit explosive bait to destroy non-aggro players bases
---
Not necessarily I can't even play the game on my Xbox
---
PS4 here, same situation since today.
---
Then they need to nerf the screen shake and allow sprinting/revving in first person and everything would be perfect.
---
I don‚Äôt really bother trading in legendary weapon stuff I just sell them at my shop And Whatever known plans, weapons, armour, ammo and aid that I do not need, I sell for 1 cap. other than a bottle of toxic water thats like 30000 caps for no reason at all. People selling things for double the value would be surprised to see how difficult it is to get rid of when it only costs 1 cap.
---
She already is to me, she thinks it's naughty cosplay, little does she know it's the real thing!
---
You've heard about legendary chainsaw, but how about a legendary broom or a legendary pencil. Imagine a 40% faster swing speed bloody pencil. You can melt enemies fast and wrrite quick essays and fallout bug tickets. Now that's a talent.

I've never had a problem with her, but then I always do her quest and do the luck check! She's less whiny after that path.

Thanks, that is definitely noticeable.

I have a vagina so I'm not sure what your point is. üòÇüëç
---
You‚Äôre a absolute legend.
---
Nah the Nuke to stop the Scorched Plague has been done.  We need something new and compelling.  Maybe their milk needs to be pasteurized with NUCLEAR power.
---
I hope they don't fix the lightbulb bug.
---
Say silly shit, get silly answers .
---
I have done things like that many times. My favourite handicap is to avoid fast travel and to eat and drink pre-war items only. 
---
Also, you can wear a specific type of armor (no legendaries) and maybe sell all stimpacks, radaways and that. Let nature decide if you die or live.
---
If it appears on the map with hallow inside, means someone from a quest told you about that location or you found a pin in a map or a holo tape that describes that location. Once you get close enough, it will say discovered and the small icon will fill in. You cannot complete dungeons as all locations re-fresh so you can spam them endlessly. And if a location is a unique dungeon, chances are it's quest/ event related and will automatically close to up and won't be usable.
---
I'm annoyed that the ingame Communist Commander uses a basic set of T-60 Power Armor instead of this!
---
So I'm not crazy then. Lol. PC here but yeah.
---
Tbh, I wont use any of the shit that got unlocked. Even if I wanted them I save maybe like 600 gold right? Hope the same thing happens with foundation.
---
Well 3 looks good and it has 2 player co-op where your friends can help... or mess with your world freely.

I'm with you. I love the game, and the events are fun

Yooo I played with you today!! I bought some of your stuff, you bought some of mine!
---
Yes, think of the children./s
---
Hold on now as much as I agree with you, that‚Äôs pro consumer and Bethesda isn‚Äôt to fond on being pro consumer (let‚Äôs not forget all the shit they did)
---
Can't kill players doing that. This story is missing some details.
---
I don't think it's a bug, the helmet on the Jangles backpack lights up exactly the same way when you turn your pipboy light on.
---
Wow this sucks. I played this game at launch and quit because of crap just like this. Went and bought a new copy, set up online access again and started a new character  just to end up right back in the same place with a broken game and a company that‚Äôll fix it when ever.. what a bunch of bs
---
Yeah it's the big red one next to a medbox right before the exit/entrance of the mine. Like I said idk what the pool is like but it's usually a handful of items and like 100 caps.
---
I'd love to see an actual viable chainsaw build created.  Remove the lvl 20 cap for the chainsaw so that they can drop at max level, add legendary drops to the loot pool, and a set of new perk cards for chainsaws (rippers and buzzblades included!) specifically designed to create a build that would bring the DPS of those weapons up to par with other weapons.  Even if it wasn't 'top tier' damage, make it so it's playable at least.  It's sad that one of the coolest melee weapons (with cool mods) is basically just a joke.
---
If you really must know, the only hand I need is to hold my vibrator while u/Nekrosias rails me.
---
You can and I have
---
Also: Well obviously you've heard of me but I've never heard of you, so who has more viewers between us?
---
Oh lol I didn‚Äôt notice that üòÇ
---
If you're talking about the medics legendary effect you want to go for a vats shotgun build. The effect works per pellet so single shot weapons are garbage. Shotguns own that effect.
---
My current character (2300 hours in, done it all) doesn't carry food. I always eat on the spot, until I am satisfied. The same with water. Camps and purifiers have certainly saved my dehydrated ass many times, since Speed Demon is always on. 
---
It is great fun to make short trips into town, looking for food. Sometimes is Flatwoods, sometimes is Watoga, most of the time it is Morgantown and it's roofs.
---
Not your honey, princess. Guess one day maybe someone at a workshop will drop a thicker skin for you :)
---
Later, drink build.
---
and did you investigate the area?
---
I've played it twice and it works perfectly, so does that mean it was ready?
---
True, was a hell of a day.
---
Legendary drill while we‚Äôre at it too!
---
The ghillie hood works with it...I use the forest mask
---
I have my Day one chainsaw i found at the ranger station, scrapped everyone i found after to learn all the mods. Still use it for queen fights.
---
Totally this. A rifle, a pistol, a melee. And if you choose to carry realistic amounts of ammo, it gets better, because you really plan your fights.
---
Honestly babe, my knees ache.
---
'The people's' upvote
---
Should we doing that if this happens?
---
I believe if the base is close, you can use the artillery to explode it. You can also agro strong enemies to attack it if you stand on the roof. Otherwise, I had literally 4 people trying to start pvp by picking the locks in my doors. When I started opening them as they were trying to unlock them, they started throwing mini nukes on my camp, as I removed all locks, went on my roof, sat on the chair and went to make some tea irl. They couldn't do any dmg to camp itself, other than wasting those nukes and looking like a bunch of damp socks.
---
This issue still persists. (Win10)
---
Oh yeah, that place is HELLA haunted
---
Y'all were mad before I started spamming quantums, foodbuild.
---
it is an 8 player raid isnt it

i ran for my life

universe brain: all weapons are semi nerfed against this boss, the only way to take down Big Brahmin Jesus is to use this thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMasIHupafo
---
I got 3* stuff for caps ps4
---
With all this talk of the bloodied etc nerf, I'm more curious about certain weapon types that have historically been non-viable, and whether they're going to be tweaked at all.
---
Certain guns break a lot faster than they should, and have been stuck as un-usable for a long time - beam splitter lasers being the worst culprit I've seen, but I understand it's an issue with missile launchers too.
---
Is wasteland 3 available? I have been waaaaaaiting for it.
---
You do know what they put in the vaults right? 
---
Every single suggestion from this ~~vault~~ sub.
---
I decided not to play anymore with my 4 alts cause of legendary perks, no time anymore for alts :\\
---
Actually that's not true, I only use PA in sbq or new event but I'm constantly spamming stimpacks just as fast as if I was in PA
---
I have no idea on the code behind this but I think that change might be a lot of effort.
---
But my gut tells me they could just up the condition amount on those weapons to achieve the same effect right? 
---
Either way these weapons need to become at least somewhat viable. (Along with all other low usage weapons)
---
Hit Lewisburg and go left.
---
Indeed. That might be why as I understand there‚Äôs been some issues with it
---
I ran across someone using explosive bait to damage someone‚Äôs camp. I don‚Äôt know if they were aggro to each other, but the explosive bait ***did*** damage me as I was trying to use the vending machine. I wasn‚Äôt on a team, had Pacifist on, and literally was just in the explosion radius.
---
Tested a max lvl JE lmg against a max lvl J40 lmg last night. The bash damage adds a lot of damage to the actual ballistic damage off the gun. Only a couple damage diff between the two and the j40 did way more damage than the J10 we tested as well. Now I know you want the actual bash damage to do more but anything with bash is magic af
---
I‚Äôve done this event probably 24 times on multiple servers since it came out and I‚Äôve never had any of these problems idk

Other than to weigh you down and give you false hope I have no idea what good a missle launcher or fatman has to offer in any situation. Listed as Powerful ammo types. And allegidly packing a huge punch. I can hit a handful of lower level scorched with one or the other and not have a single one of them die. I can beat to death a scorched beast with an large amount of those ammo types, and get no where, but I can take my shotgun and kill the same scorched beast within 8 shots.. 
---
Makes no sense.
---
Ok.im going to try that 1st
---
Gratz... Now what?
---
hol' up, people want buzzblades? I got one a week or two ago and quickly binned it. scrips over rips.
---
Lol get ready to meet bitch when I trade you something from my mule account...
---
That's an overkill, plus eyebots as an allies to protect are the weakest things ever, you'd prob be repairing it more often than it was repairing your camp during molerat infestation. The best you gonna get, is that one eyebot that's a random encounter along with a guy that programed it to play custom music to avoid boring radio.
---
 Only if he can give me a handy
---
Seemed fine to me , besides the framedrop  which is always a problem on console but most of the time it goes smoothly except one time where i died and teleported to my last location so I had to fast travel to a teammate to get back in after we killed earl
---
It happens to me constantly. I missed so many of the grahms cook out events because of it. Some days and times during the day are way worse than others. Its super irritating.
---
HE DID IT!! GET 'EM OUT BOYS!!
---
It better be Cork Bullion. Just saying.
---
He said you could put different mods on each piece and the power armor is unbreakable. I'm not a PA user, so I'm not testing it.
---
there's a reason that is happening =0
---
Or..babe
---
I've been trying to play for a week now, i haven't been able to at all
---
I deleted my characters, reinstalled it, hard reset my xbox, everything that I can do.
---
Speaking about shotguns, I get very similar results. Give one to a mule.
---
Oh. Lol. That dude is clickbaity af.
---
For what it‚Äôs worth my first run was exactly the way you described it. I switched servers, and my second try was much smoother. Hopefully you have the same luck.
---
I like that idea!
---
I'm still 2 spots behind him. Crossing my fingers.
---
Sweet. I'm sold. Thanks again. üòä
---
Yes, apparently not even Bethesda knows what to do about this bug, I reached out to them weeks ago and they said they were going to get back to me, never did.
---
As soon as I got rid of the skin, my allies went back to normal.
---
I don't live on Reddit, sorry.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox, I‚Äôd be more than happy to help you move stuff around, level new characters etc. If you wind up in my public team and you happen to have a workshop, I‚Äôll be there lickety split to kick their asses for you. I do it regularly.
---
I have to kindly disagree with you there man, Even though:
---
Power armor is chunkier, slower, and high maintenance
---
But you're literally a brick wall with T65, especially if you use super stims, I was shooting someone in T65, they went down to around 20% and spamming stims; their HP instantly shot back up to 100, it's super OP
---
End Stimpack spamming, slow stimpack usage intervals, increase PA ballistic/energy resistance, make using a stimpack take a full second imo
---
Agree to disagree
---
It‚Äôs a permanent event mate
---
Yea last week was pretty bad. I finally had enough and i did the "scan and repair" thing through the bethesda launcher and it actually somewhat helped me but idk how to go about fixing it on xbox. Good luck!
---
You'll be fine, just grind a lot of xp
---
Same on xb1
---
There‚Äôs no way 35% of the player base was banned last wave
---
You didnt fail, QA did
---
ONLY if it is exclusive to and included with the return of the Wild Wasteland trait
---
I got plan second event I can build it for you at your camp if you would like
---
Lol....Ernie.....LOL
---
Thanks! I'll try to figure it out, bethesda's customer service is kinda crazy though
---
Whenever I see a Communist Collectron and it's locked I'm like

"AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH, HMM?"
---
I feel like I saw that exact same comment on this sub earlier
---
I think it depends on console but most players I see over level 100 have bought 1st, on Xbox since it‚Äôs on game pass there‚Äôs a lot more lower levels than on other platforms though.
---
That I did not know appreciate that ü§ûüèª
---
My girlfriend has 15 from the machine it getting to the point were I have to avoid them on the map
---
If you could I would gladly pay for it
---
Yup...investigate some more
---
And add a snake in the game too.... call it panfuckintra!
---
I detect a hint of saltiness? It's pretty fun being a glass cannon. You can say it's too easy, and a lot of times it is, but there are plenty times where you just die. Your well laid plans are crushed by an effing mole rat or scorpion.
---
No idea about unbreakable , it‚Äôs kind of meaningless on PA. 
---
you CAN mod each piece. But only one will actually be equipped at a time. You‚Äôre never actually wearing 2 at once, and it‚Äôs kind of random which one ‚Äúequips‚Äù when you get in your power armor.
---
Like I said, terrible clickbait youtuber.
---
I kept all the gold and it doesn‚Äôt go down much. I did all missions for both groups up until the point I had to choose. I did do the raider rep glitch with Roxys daily which I believe still works. So I got max rep with them with in a week or two. Settlers took forever, I would do the daily and do the photos and give to ward but it was a slow grind. Every now and then I would get a random encounter so that helped. But i don‚Äôt regret keep the gold.
---
I managed to get one out of the machine at pleasant valley. My other half tried for half an hour; handing in a claim ticket then runnning upstairs to activate the machine before going back down to hand in another ticket. Once he'd finished, I was doing my claim ticket runs and got the pie on the third activation. Anyone else managed to win one out of the machine?

Explosive bait will damage camps

If Earl decides to bail, you should win instantly because it should count as him forfeiting.

(lol, I kid... mostly)

It seems like Bethesda is balancing around bloody builds only so if you aren't that or junkie you either switch or enjoy pain. Mob HP and damage up, player damage down across the board.
---
Grahm ranks among the best Fallout NPC‚Äôs of all time!
---
I suggest sending them a one big letter as a reply about their legal rights as a service provider. They take everyone as a joke because they back off the moment Beth shrugs and says *opsy*. The moment you provide hard evidence and call them out on their legal rights, especially if those atoms you used were bought with actual money and use the world they love so much, which is everyone but them *exploiting* others. Honestly, Bethesda support is equivalent of the guy you ask to check for item in the back, and them just walking in and out without checking and saying there's no more of the item. üòí
---
That would be something I would be down for. I actually just unlocked the plushie last night. I believe I have all the plans now. Rug, meat pile, heads and plushie unless I‚Äôm missing one.

EXPLOSIVE BAIT HERE I COME. I'm joking btw. Xd

I‚Äôve had frame rate drops but not game breaking ones (I actually had it the worst i decided to stay back and kill and loot the spawns, that was stressful)

You want to look up and figure out which 5 chems you want to be addicted to. Here's a guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/fz7x5c/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I had this exact thought earlier while doing ACP. A cursed vampires chainsaw would be sensational
---
I'd like what your smoking.
---
It could be like the Hero of the Wasteland statue. I love it
---
Bethesda can manage anything if they can nerf the damage of all builds. I'm sure they can fix something that simple. Increasing durability would be decent, but not the best.
---
Just the weapon really. Junkie commando is strong running full health.
---
My only thought is go full health.
---
The duster isn‚Äôt too far off some of his looks
---
Accidentally ate mine
---
Wait, is this for real?
---
I thought all this time it was operating like Fallout 3 and New Vegas where it's degradation per shot, whether it misses or not.  It only makes sense for melee to degrade per successful hit.  That's all they had to copy and somehow they fucked it up, I'm impressed.
---
Halloween March? Wah?

DELETING THE SEEDY SHED WORKED
---
The chemist mod from the raiders' bullion shop is really good. 90% chem and med weight reduction. Also some of the Atomic Shop cosmetic mods are really nice. Still using the mothman baby backpack that was on sale in July
---
With a behemoth who is wearing human-skin flannel shirt and giant make-shift axe.
---
Or let us hug and barter with the passive Treasure Moles!
---
Drugs and a good junkies weapon. Build will be dependent on the weapon and how you want to play it but otherwise it's a straight forward build just like any other. Chem fiend isn't bad if you want to make the chems last longer.
---
Yes there is some there, but it is all over the map and the ground for that matter
---
Its definitely confusing. The shots get hit markers which cause durability loss. Firing randomly doesn't degrade.
---
Name is earl. But I have done it 6 times so far being I would do more but I work and have wife and kids so I can‚Äôt play until night time. But only once did I see earl walking above ground somewhat like he was on a platform and on the third event I got to escape mine and I got stuck on a black loading screen. But I closed game down on Xbox and restarted it and still got all rewards which was my first cursed weapon. I keep seeing ppl say about this stuff but so far I‚Äôve been lucky
---
High capacity is my favorite. An extra 120 carry weight isn't something I could pass up. Yes it takes away some damage resistance but with full secret service with buttressed mods im sitting at 464  and that's plenty for my build.
---
As interesting as it is that bonus bash damage does affect damage output in that way, I doubt it's intended and liable to be fixed in the future. That said, your testing and input is appreciated
---
Keep in mind there are people who get it occasionally to load up then cancel
---
Kills me full hp to 0 too in power armor if it hits the drill just right. 
---
I think the trick is to stand under one of the two locations that are covered from ceiling rock attacks. In those areas if you get feared, you will run into a wall, not a drill.
---
All enemies in the nuke zone can spawn high radiation fluid. A end to end run of the zone should get you 7-10 HRF
---
Research the drug family groups. Choose which 4 you would rather be addicted too for your build in terms of their detriments, and have your 5th addiction just be alcohol. 
---
For example if you want to go junkies melee I would avoid as many -STR stat drugs as you can etc.
---
Also DO NOT get addicted to X-Cell it is the absolute worst. 
---
Personally I am both junkies and bloodied, so with my UNY armor giving bonus special they mitigate plenty of the addiction special detriment so I would say UNY armor can still be viable.
---
Don't stand in front of the drill?
---
Also, you still have some steering control while feared, so you can use that to try to steer yourself away from hazards.
---
Low self esteem, the feeling that you don‚Äôt quite fit in, failure to live up to your own expectations and disposable income.
---
I kid, you‚Äôll want to have as many addictions as you can, there‚Äôs a list somewhere of the negative effects for various substances, pick the ones that affect your build the least.    You‚Äôll also want all the perks related to whatever kind of weapon you use, and the perk that doubles the duration of chems taken.    That‚Äôs all I know, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other stuff
---
Skins are different from mods. And you can apply them to the small backpack you can get from Morgantown Airport.

Fuck Ward. I went to give home pics of Crater and he said "just who I don't want to see".. Aite bruh, I know who I'm breaking in the vault with.
---
The camp items would need to provide way more items consistent with fallout and way fewer weird cosmetics for me to consider it. 
---
The prefabs are the only items that make any sense in the game world but I wanna build an immersive experience not place one.
---
Yeah, I try to stand in safe spots.  The other thing that annoys me is running under embers.  How is it fair to have a boss that makes you lose control of your character and have such deadly environmental hazards?
---
Furious Gatling plasma
---
Make those Perk Cards an ode to one of the best B movie chainsaw heroes the "Groovy" perks that adds plus 20%, 40% , and 60% damage to chainsaws, rippers and buzz blades.
---
ionized meat is also one of my go to foods.
---
I mostly agree except "Secret Service sets and Vault 94 armor outclass everything"
---
*You mean the post-game tier of armor sets is the strongest? How strange...*
---
Make it a slider with three options: show nothing, show gamertag, show character name. Everyone wins.
---
I'd want a Furious, Crippling (or Rapid), and Reduced Weight Chainsaw that would be level 50. Would toss on the dual bar and flamer on it.
---
We finally got challenging content and you want it easier?
---
Haha i find it gives me a reason to use my stimpacks like nothing else in the game does! On a newer character I actually ran out during the fight and had to go with water and cola

Edit: i don't mean during the running into drill, before or after (you can often see him "charge up") :p

Edit: maybe Expand on the Brahmin herding events (not the caravan) to have western drops
---
Yeah, it's a barrel. The joke is that Chally carries barrels and steamer trunks on her back, so if you dress in the full Chally costume and wear the Chally backpack, you're supposed to kinda look like her.
---
I thought that was a pretty funny and cool thing to add IMO ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah, really just, do something with them. It is by far one of the best quest lines in this game, as well as one of the most interesting interiors. Also, there is a whole "danger room" just sitting there partially built that could be so cool.
---
Getting one shot by A drill because of A fear rng pathing is not ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù.
---
I think Im blind, what's wrong?
---
I too discovered the drill today.
---
You can't though.  It doesn't let you do anything
---
I can't recall it's name. But it was essentially trick-or-treating in the cabins outside Whitesprings, and following an Eyebot around vandalizing and killing things. I'm sure it'll be back in a couple months
---
Glad I did Survival mode when it was still around. I Unstoppable Monster kicks major ass.
---
I powered through her questline during the last couple days (ran out of other grinds) and had to respec 2 point to Luck just to hit it, but this makes me extra glad I did.
---
PC, but thanks for the offer :)
---
Have you tried not having the drill to your back
---
Unyielding armor and a little self harm could have pushed you past the two points needed.
---
 Yes. 
---
You have to watch out for where you're standing verus all the hazards.
---
That has nothing to do with anything. by you posting this and telling people where to find info on said exploit you've probably added to the number of exploiters.
---
Never have I ever seen a Scorchbeast spawn any of the nuked flora ingredients. I've only fought the Wendigo and his spawns twice there but they've also never dropped any nuked flora ingredients for me and the same goes for ionized meat.
---
Had line in the sand glitch all all enemies spawned in a cluster in the center, fired a two shot missile launcher almost broke it off the rip, fired at the next wave when it spawned and got luck of the draw healed it all the way up
---
 A Chainsaw/Heavy gunner build. I would agree they would need their own perk cards. I know that none of the melee card effects apply to the chainsaw. Tenderizer, Adrenaline and Bloody Mess are the only cards that affect it. The flamer mod doesn't even count for Freindly Fire.....
---
I just want players to start firing missiles at the SBQ like it should be. I mean, there are missions where SAMs help you against regular Scorchbeasts.
---
And lessen the weight of explosive ordinance. Missiles weigh too much. Mini nukes definitely weigh too much. If they're gonna be six pounds, they should clear out an entire fucking area.
---
Interesting. The ones it happened in were grenade festivals
---
I have a Unarmed Melee toon, refrigerated backpack mod all day. High capacity on all others.
---
The Toxic Valley also has a lot of visible logs to scavenge, as well as the Bleached Dogwoods to collect for 3 wood a piece.
---
Just food for though. We tested in on the sbq that night and was less than a mag too regen her with the j40
---
The first time I did one I had the keycard but no code, so I got to the end and felt just like you do. Went back to my camp and was so bummed I quit playing for the day. Then later I found out that you could just look up the codes online
---
I can solo it on my bloodied HW dude, and I‚Äôd be able to fairly efficiently even IF my primary weapon wasn‚Äôt magic.
---
I actually wasn‚Äôt paying attention and didn‚Äôt realize this gun was magic until I was put in a situation where my option was solo it or give up. As it turns out, I was able to solo it a lot better than I expected due to it being a magic gun, but it‚Äôs not the most efficient magic gun. Damage is low enough and fire rate isn‚Äôt quite high enough that it doesn‚Äôt go magic all that often....
---
But I‚Äôve got a vampire 33% vats (the magic here) Gatling laser. With perks, I‚Äôve got 1000 rounds a core. Even without the magic damage, I do 5 damage (body) to 14 damage (headshots with full Adrenaline). I believe Earl has 30,000 health. At minimum 5000 damage a fusion core, it‚Äôd take me 6 cores to down him. At a maximum 14000 damage a core, it‚Äôd take slightly more than 2. Hell I could mod it to Ultracite cores and do even more damage with even more ammo per core.
---
And this is on a vampire laser. I can sit there and facetank Earl and burn down the spawns as they get close. My biggest concern is positioning so if I get feared I don‚Äôt get run into environmental hazards.
---
You know what‚Äôs even more disappointing? Getting the Grillmaster Hat last year and waiting for Meat Cook to come back so you can get the Grillmaster Outfit to go with it... just to find out the Grillmaster outfit is an atomic shop item.
---
This my take: you only need the Ultimate Set if you are going to PvP with the best players. For the rest of things, any set will do, as long as the rest of your build is tidy.
---
My main usually wears a full set of Marine Unyielding. Looks nice, feels special. I also keep a full set of heavy combat assassin's, a very complete set of heavy leather (a bit of everything and tons of reductions) and I tried a set of SS today. 3 Unyielding pieces, one chameleon, a "magic" piece, hard to detect, breathing under water, poison resistances. 
---
Buttressed, plus my leaded backpack, my rad resistance was high as fuck. Like 500. DR and ER were 350. One of my other characters has 550 with perks and just heavy combat. 
---
Truth is, I still like my Unyielding Marine set better. I did three Colossal Problems today, and can't say SS was superior, to be honest. It might be, but it will not affect your game. Third run was heavy leather, and I also did great. 
---
Just follow your sense of style.
---
Not for me, I was 10 seconds away from starting the event and which my whole house power turned off but
---
The good news is the Gauntlet is one of the first plans Foundation unlocks, so if it's all you want you should be fine no matter what. Personally I want to eventually max both of them out and ended up siding with Foundation and then splitting the gold between both factions. Was a good choice since I personally like the Raider characters a lot more and now one of the npc banters I get at Crater is them laughing about how Foundation got cheated out of half their cut. All around feel pretty good about my choices.
---
All good.  I don‚Äôt use this platform other than to lurk.  Loosing two weapons was enough for me to look for advice and to see if it‚Äôs something that I need to make a ticket for.
---
Hahaha the Buried With Honor quest!
---
BLONDIE!!!!!!!!!!!
---
You do, though. It's often just trying the same server over and over.
---
And about weapons, let me say this. I got a Bloodied Explosive fixer, tried it, didn't like how fast it fell apart, gave it to a very happy friend, he used it for a week and gave it back to me. 
---
Best doesn't mean best for you, or your playstyle.
---
$$$$$$$$$
---
Its like coming home to a nagging spouse... hahaha.. And its pretty scary if your spouse talks to herself in real life if you get what I mean. But most the quests with her, I get plenty of 3\* legendary for scrips. Yes, scrips, lead pipes, wrenches, or heavy guns without any contribution.
---
God I love you for this conversation of a timeless classic movie that I love of Clint Eastwood but also my favorite band (Debbie Harry). Kudos to you friend.
---
Scrap everything, read all terminals, go explore and see the world. If you don't want to pvp, put yourself into pacifist mode, but be aware, taking a public workshop opens you up to the opportunity for pvp (despite pacifist mode)
---
Play slow. Enjoy the story.
---
It can walk over players and spray milk.
---
Just searched it.ill pick that up once it's back in the atom shop.looks really good with the horns
---
It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs clickbait youtubers not investigating how a bug ACTUALLY works.
---
It amounts to ‚Äúyou can have multiple duplicate armor pieces on a frame!!1!1 And mod them!1!1!!!‚Äù
---
Without bothering to actually get in the armor and find out that you‚Äôre still only going to ‚Äúequip‚Äù 1 of each armor piece at a time. All you‚Äôve achieved with multiple pieces is randomizing which one gets equipped each time you get in.
---
That pain is real. I know it too well.
---
Oh lol is there fun Easter eggs there? I forget why I went in the first place but I bounced in there one time, mowed through a bunch of enemies, heard the scream and was like "ah, environmental story telling"
---
And then I left lmao
---
Also do photos of foundation and give them to kimito(sp) at crater
---
Omg I would die for that mothman baby backpack. Thank you for the raiders tip!
---
Haha, I was already 2 pieces of Unyielding and a iguana meat into it. And I had 70 levels, so if I have to move them back, so be it.
---
They do.  I've made thousands that way.
---
Just. Go have a look around. Zoinks.
---
There is no Secret Cow Level.
---
i swear i saw a thread about the exact same thing few days ago.
---
Regardless... I have 2 characters my main and a NW dedicated alt. But i never play adventure on my alt. 
---
Just leveled it to 64 through NW alone and storing all those level ups as well as card packs for the legendary perks.
---
Oh you mentioned gears? "What people don't realise about the gear wars" -Gearhead, Rick &amp; Morty.
---
Ohhhhh.... okay.. Gotcha. Now, that makes sense. I kind of had the thought in my head that I would have a lil cow on my back and was super excited about that. My bad, lol.
---
I watch youtubers
---
If they do that then I would like the option to change the character name. ‚ÄúLordBungusdeWiz‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt really fit my character.
---
When the mole pails come back you‚Äôll have a another chance at the crocolossus backpack. It‚Äôs a good one.
---
Haha I am so sorry. I got that hat a few times too.
---
First off I upvoted your post for putting thought into it.
---
Lots of the stuff you named off is nearly identical though. A ski sword is just a few damage higher than a cattle prod. 
---
An lmg is powerful but its an ammo hog, same with the gauss mini.  A .50 cal has good damage and much better ammo economy.
---
You almost have to have a top dog in a game like this. Whats the fun in legendary farming if everything is the same.
---
You are right on many counts though. Totally agree on lots of your points!
---
Bethesda's needs to spend a good deal of time reworking weapons, perks, and legendary effects to make other stuff useful and competitive.   
---
-Give an assault rifle a huge drum mag and make a 5mm auto receiver.
---
-give creature specific weapons a 45pct damage (+75pct total) boost to make them the preferred item for respective enemies. 
---
-Gauss and hunting rifles should reward accuracy and do huge damage! Give them an innate effect of 40pct damage while aiming to reward skill.
---
-Let people dual wield revolvers or something!
---
The real problem is weapon class. Commando and unarmed outclass everthing else so why use anything else?
---
-How about legendary perks that boost existing gear? The Cowboy perk that boosts damage with lever actions, bowie knives, and single action revolvers. 
---
-Legendary grenades that respawn a new one in your inventory 3 seconds after throwing one. Heck, why not a sticky grenade?
---
-A chef legendary perk that gives you levels in green thumb, good with salt, and boosts damage to rolling pins and meat cleavers by 30 pct. 
---
I would love to see some creativity in buffing other stuff and not nerfing meta gear we all  enjoy right now. Give us a reason to try new builds and ideas!!
---
It would be interesting to integrate them as settlers, vassals for Raiders, or keep them isolated/independent.  But I have the feeling Vault-Tec doesn't want Appalachia to succeed.  Vault 94's story kind of goes along with that.  If they wanted to build a civilization, the army of Watoga and Hornwright bots with the functioning power plants would seem like a better place to start.
---
Become like those fish that cling to sharks and find high level players who are fighting enemies you can get a hit in on so you can leech off their xp :~)
---
Best way to get your flux mats is to nuke the whitespring. Bring a friend with you, kill all the ghouls, have one of y'all relog (log out and back into the server) and that will respawn the ghouls. Rinse and repeat until your stash can hold no more. You also get ionized meat, high rads, but woth carnivore, super good for food and never spoils
---
Go to whatever platform you play on and make a post on the market saying your new and you‚Äôll get plenty of people who will shower you with Amazing items gear guns
---
I was able to do it with just another guy, two days ago. I used my bloodied lever to kill wendigos and repeatedly cripple Earl, he did maybe 80 percent of the damage.
---
It wasn't super fast, but we managed to do it.
---
Have you tried vats using the shotguns? 
---
Which one does better?
---
And once you have a supply, you can farm anywhere for the raw flux (don't forget to have green thumb on to double your raw flux farming efficacy) and craft to your heart's desire
---
Ammo is a major problem when starting out, so you'll usually have to fall back on melee damage for a while until you get fully spec'd into the class you're actually interested in.
---
Craft yourself a combat knife, and upgrade it (by crafting a new one) every 5 levels. You don't need a plan for it, you can craft it right out of the vault. That weapon got me through a good chunk of the early game.
---
Who went in and downvoted every comment lmao
---
Do not do that those players are so fucking annoying. Like the asshole low levels who hide in the corner during SBQ or ACP and wait for everyone else to kill the boss then go around looting everything.
---
Always good to see people still have tasteüëçüèº
---
Oh, Spore Carriers vs Scorched.  Or Scorched Spore Carriers!
---
TBH I miss the mad explosive brahmin random encounter. Would love to see it in 76.
---
Yes.    
---
Now we need bosses and named enemies with pun-names.
---
Sounds like *someone* hasn't had the experience of bringing low level players to white springs and drawing agro before punching a ghoul's head off for everyone's benefit
---
This is why my account is passcoded.  I'll happily share the Netflix or any other subscription service but not my gaming profile üòÉ.
---
Me posting once on Reddit today has nothing to do with anything either, so...ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I found a Marsupial recipe for 5k caps!  Some people sell the serums for nearly that much!  Rare to find them anymore under 500 caps.
---
Ps4
---
The only framerate drop I had is when some dude used a tesla! My GOD that made it painful, had to open the mic and tell him to chillllll, and of course he didn‚Äôt.
---
My room mate and I are both having the same issue but we're on PC
---
Well fuck
---
I just use what I want. Not gonna use gear I hate just because the stats are better.
---
I think the SS armor is kinda ugly so I‚Äôm sticking with my unyielding urban scout set with matching mask. 
---
Got a B2525 fixer I use for Boss Fights but any other time I use my B3325 Handmade dispute there being a big damage difference. The fixer is kinda ugly with that baby shite green skin. (At least until they make the dark matter skin available for fixers.) Handmade looks way better with the matte black skin and sounds way better than the fixer too.
---
Back in skyrim I used Ebony Armor instead of Daedric armor, liked the look of it way better. Never even touched any of the DLC Armor Sets. (Except for the unique ice looking set, got all those pieces together and the double swords and gave them to my follower Azula.)
---
Point is, just use what makes you happy and ignore the couple point difference in other ‚Äúgreater‚Äù items.
---
There's really that many!?  Dang, I probably haven't claimed half of them.
---
I see. Yeah, that's pretty clickbaity by him.
---
Ummm, against any NPC other than SBQ or Earle, both shotguns are one-shot kill with nearly everything- SB 6 shots w/vats and maybe double that if they're legendary, but once they land its gameover, SB never lift off in time. Out of VATS, bloodied does more damage, just from shooting. Now L2, PS4, aim, and shoot, they might have similar results, depending on if you hit center mass, head, or limb. VATS with shotguns is very powerful, but its hit or miss, no pun intended, whether it actually locks on and deals damage. Sometimes, maybe 5-25% of the time, it locks on with 95% accuracy yet deals 0 damage, from some glitch I've yet to narrow down, no matter how many times you pull the trigger. Obviously, this is a huge drawback currently to shotguns in general : (
---
I love when the last enemy runs 200m away from the workshop and I have to chase it down and kill it just to not get my reqards because I went too far from the event. Come on Todd, I didnt leave the event this fucking ghoul did what am I supposed to do. I want my file cabinets plan reward
---
I dont know if you still can, but at one point bobbleheads were stackable and if you had so many you could take as many as you want....
---
I think that's been patched though...
---
1) If a high level player approaches you and starts making weird gestures and stuff, they might be trying to get your attention to give you a gift. It‚Äôll appear as a bag on the ground (the default is a paper bag but it can also be a blue duffel bag, a bowling ball bag, etc). Lots of friendly people in this game. Just don‚Äôt beg for stuff in group chats!
---
2) On the map screen, you can join public groups. Join a Building group to get a bonus to your Intelligence- more INT means more XP! Don‚Äôt worry, generally nobody chats in these groups so you won‚Äôt be bothered, we just use it for the bonus.
---
3) Check the ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù list- completing these will get you rewards from the ‚Äúlegendary run‚Äù game board  (also on the map screen). It‚Äôll end soon but there are helpful things for new players there.
---
You can make ultracite lasers.  You just need the plans for the gun you're using.
---
I play a junk dealer who doesn‚Äôt fast travel. No particular build but leaning towards stealth and sniping.
---
Same same same, it just sits in my inventory looking *pretty*
---
It‚Äôs a weird one for sure you need 5 spoiled meat to build it.
---
I hate when someone leaves my team and then takes my workshop
---
It can do sick damage Bloodied when holding down on an enemy.  But is useless with power attack, though.
---
Imagine, if Bethesda actually highlighted this feature I may have bought more than the one when they were the daily sale series one week
---
How long did that take you? I'd imagine by the time you got toward the end you'd have defending events at the ones you took first.
---
There are ***21*** Workshops.  That‚Äôs not counting Spruce Knob/Foundation.
---
There's a couple streamers on twitch that farm exp?
---
Yea not alot of outfits that go with the mask only very few and getting a set of legendary scout armor isnt easy either
---
Pretty lucky with 4. With MW coming back for a second helping sell now.
---
That or learn it with alts and try for more chances at a legendary tendie
---
There actually 21.
---
I have really wanted something like this since I experienced it on a phone app I tried. Its perfect for it and making it optional means if people don't want the messages left, they just don't have to build it
---
So far i have been doing just that. I really enjoy the quests :)
---
Bonus head damage
---
This would be...breathtaking.
---
Yeah there are a bunch of stage hazards down there, sometimes you just have to back off if you cannot get in at a good angle that does not line you up with a hazard.
---
It‚Äôs pretty sought after. Perhaps a slightly higher drop chance on XB, as I‚Äôve seen quite a few end up on here. I‚Äôm willing to trade a Quad Fixer and Bloodied Minigun for it but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm heavy on Legendaries that don‚Äôt match my TH Melee build.
---
Thanks for the hint. Yes ammo has been an issue and i was usually using a machete. But i will grab myself a combat knife.
---
A time machine to go back to a time when nerfs to bloodied builds weren't imminent
---
Yea, I felt pretty bad for these guys, even as a raider. This guy, who was treated like shit pre-war, literally got melted into his suit, doesn‚Äôt even defend himself, is being hunted by XxCoolgamerxX for a crocodile backpack. At least make them somewhat difficult
---
Taking workshops is a great way to get CAMP plans early on. Take it crouched and bug right outta there once you have it.
---
I actually don't agree with this, all though I understand your point. You are saying people would get bored if they could just change the build. This is plain wrong to say, because you are saying it like if this applies to everyone. In fact, it applies to a few, which are the few who actually grind fallout 76 on multiple characters. But just because this applies to most of the players in fallout 76, doesnt mean it is the case for every gamer out there.
---
Most people, and I use myself as an example, get bored the moment you are forced into replayability. It's a bit double morale to say if you could swap build like that, people would get bored, and then at the same time saying that min maxing is just a very little part of the game. If it's a small part of the game, it shouldnt matter either.
---
For me, and for others, it's actually MORE gameplay and less boring if we could swap. The fact I cant swap from shotgun to rifle now, is why I'm bored and quit. This game is a failure when it comes to replayability, and I will not make a character just for this. I am playing currently and trying to chill and do the quests, but this is purely for 2 reasons: 1, I bought the game for 60 euro, I do have money issues atm hence why I am kind of forced to play what I have on my game list. And 2: I will just focus on doing and completing all the quests and dailies, and hope one day I can swap my build somehow in the future.
---
I don't understand why this is the ONLY reason you say people should create multiple characters. There are other designs out there to make more characters. ESO for example make you play exactly like you want on one character, yet people have 12 different characters without any issue. I personally played on only one character there for more than 12.000 hours, while others swapped characters daily.
---
There are so many suggestions and systems that would work better than this one. I mentioned earlier, I don't even mind if I have to chose agility and luck points again, as long as I don't "lose" the strenght points I invested and could go back to shotgun build again if I wanted. The most scary part of all this, is the community defending this. I have been playing non stop games since I was 4 years old, currently in my mid 30's. I literally have been living in front of a game all my life and I will confirm, that fallout 76 is not a clever design of replayability, it's simply a complete failure of a design that is being called " a feature" just to get away with it.
---
This game is not for casuals or pro. It's for casuals who want to think they are pro gamers. I shoot an enemy and it takes 1 second before it hits. It's disgusting. It's nothing for a casual player either, since the game actually can be too hard. Where I am, if it wasn't for the fact I had 60% shotgun damage plus the stagger one and a legendary shotgun, and was good using simpacks and psycho's, I would die so many times just on the main quest.
---
Since release of this game, I have been out of shotgun shells. I have been claiming factory, I buy every shell in every store, I gather every plastic I can find and have perk to craft more ammo. Yet, I am forced to go melee in between because I am out of shotgun shells.
---
Again, This rant doesnt mean shit. I dont care if I have to grind for ammo, or learn the game the hard way, or having 1 sec delay on my shots, I am fine with literally every negative aspect of this game, besidese the fact that it's so god damn hard to just let me equip the legendary rifle I want to use in vats without having to sit and play a game this poor designed for over a month with hardcore grind in a group and all xp buffs, just to LOSE all the strenght points I invested in forever. It's a failure. Talk to literally every single one that you know that actually playes a game competitive in some way, and they laugh about this game. I know a few, and I am not even allowed to mention this game in a conversation.
---
Thank you!
---
But in the interest of full disclosure, I also only participated in the event like twice and didn‚Äôt find it to be that fun so I‚Äôd rather buy the rewards than grind for them. But that‚Äôs just me.
---
Yeah i ran into a high level player and they were gesturing to me and i didnt know why. But then i seen that they gifted me a silenced shotgun and some shells. That was my first encounter and it was really nice.  
---
And as for the groups that is actually really useful ty.  
---
And the challenges also. The rewards are great!  
---
Thanks for your help. :)
---
What the fuck ever just play the fucking gameüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
---
Ikr, i feel it should be taken off space.
---
Limited displays so as people dont abuse it
---
That would be cool
---
Yikes thanks Todd! What a damn ripoff, I've always left all those sweet spawn bodies there because the quest told me GET OUT wtf! And then people saying there's some sweet loot box by the exit that doesn't exist, that I spend my last 45 seconds looking for üòÇ
---
Are you server hoping specifically for this item?
---
I know that item spawn rate per item are based off the X amount of items you pick up before it will be available for you. Then you'll need to join another server so they can spawn back.
---
The market?
---
Radicool
---
THE MARKET
---
That happened to me a couple of days ago during a Primal Cuts event yesterday.  Me, a level 85 in a Nuka Cola suit with three or four level 200+s with power armor.  Yeah, awkward
---
Oh also is there group chats? i have only found voice chat.
---
Heavy Guns are probably a very bad example, since almost all the weapons there are legit GOOD if you get a nice legendary version. Gatling gun, gatling laser, gatling plasma, LMG, .50 cal, gauss mini, flamer, cryolator, plasma caster, auto-grenade launcher. The only heavies that are really botched are missile launcher and fatman.
---
Thanks for the info, I actually had 5 gave one to friend learned one, just seemed rng was incredibly high on it so I thought Xbox might've gotten higher numbers possibly..
---
Those are the basics. Cards that lower damage are helpful, such as Blocker (one of the must-haves) and Dodgy (if you're not VATs heavy). The rest depends on what type of build you're running.
---
same thing happening here. no workaround has worked for me. assuming it‚Äôs serverside
---
Yup
---
How do i access "THE MARKET"?
---
So it‚Äôs not just me..
---
Oh I had a nice unyeilding set of scout but traded it for a bloodied fixer a while back...I really wanted that damn fixer.lol
---
Yea man. I‚Äôm with you. Fucking glitchers.
---
Ya me too. I got friends I'd like to play with. I sent an email and got a generic response. I send pics to prove I did everything they suggested. üòû
---
Yes! Low levels always reviving me too.
---
Thanks, That‚Äôs where I got the idea from... lol
---
I have also been overwhelmed by the kindness of players in this game. There are some seriously wonderful folks out there in Appalachia.
---
As far as I know, no. They haven‚Äôt the nerf has only been done on the private test servers. 
---
My deathclaw gauntlet, Gatling gun, and shotgun all do their usual damage with the corresponding perks.
---
Peepeepoopoo
---
Many players want to help new people to the game. There is a starting area and you'll likely see on average 3 camps mine included. We'll have stuff for super cheap or depending on what we have and can do, we'll give you some junk, aid items, a higher level weapon like 10 or 15, some plans, etc. Most don't use voice chat and I don't either. There is a "Follow Me" and a "Trade" emote.    
---
There is a pinned site on here called "Nukes and Dragons'. Before you get too many levels, look up various Fallout 76 builds. That site is really good for level by level Perk suggestions you should take. There is a clickable option near the bottom after you've made or followed a linked build. Try to save that somehow on your PC in a folder "Fallout 76 Builds" so you won't have to waste time looking things up.  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)    
---
The wiki is very helpful: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Fallout\_76](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Fallout_76)    
---
You can't save your Perks points until after level 50. I tried for 10 levels and only the level 2 Perks showed up until I started to spend them.    
---
You can pick a SPECIAL to upgrade but also choose a Perk Card in another SPECIAL if you want. The game doesn't outright walk you through it.    
---
All enemies have a ranged attack so going all Melee isn't a good option in my opinion until you're at least 50.    
---
You can't do everything and spreading out your perk points and cards will lead to failure.    
---
Keep your CAMP simple. You'll find a lot of CAMP plans over time.    
---
The gear durability bar is different based on level. A level 1-20's bar won't be nearly as long as a  level 50. It requires the same number of mats to repair it if it's broken or just 3/4 full.    
---
Early on, you'll be strapped for caps. Focus on weapons, armor, food, and water. You'll find a lot of gear out in the wild. Always have a strong melee weapon for weaker enemies and to save ammo.    
---
There is a level by level zone map for 76. Stick to it.    
---
Early on, dying isn't a big deal and not worth spamming healing items. Junk can always be picked back up for more can be found. Don't stress the game just enoy it. I'm on PC and PM if you have any more questions.
---
They don't
---
Just have robots deliver mail.  There is already a messenger bot.
---
I don‚Äôt do those much
---
I concur
---
WHAAAAAT is that?
---
Well, they had to sneak Dogmeat in somehow..
---
Yeah, I don't even have a build yet..just kinda popped on each hour for the event got my first legendaries during it...level 75...still learning :)
---
They‚Äôre around.  I kept seeing them, maybe once a week or so.  I knew I needed 10K with of caps for one, so once I made up my mind that it was the next thing I needed to buy, I walked around with a minimum of 11k in caps on me (to have a little walking around money after making my purchase) for about 3 days, and found one.  Now if I can only get Mumbles to start blessing me with 3* Fixers...
---
Stealth and non-PA characters really need the stealth armor for rad zones and sneak attacks, though.  Everything else is optional.
---
Heads are usually on top of a neck that comes out of the shoulders, that might help. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It will still be the most powerful.
---
Same here ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Shit is hilarious.
---
Yea the fixers pretty good had a b2525 and a be25 and a b3315 but got rid of them they got boring pretty fast will probably never use one again with how bland it looks , resorted with the hm instead
---
That is true, if you're willing to risk the pvp (which isn't overly common anyway), the xp and plans are helpful/useful
---
Rifle/Machine gun build isn't feasible (unless you want to constantly be swapping perks). You won't have enough perception points for the rifle and automatic perks. Choose one.
---
Nobody‚Äôs gonna agree to disagree when your ideas would be just flat out terrible if implemented. Power armor is already at the point where more DR/ER/RR wouldn‚Äôt even make a difference in how much damage you took, you could have 1k of each and barely show a difference in damage taken. Your ideas would just be a flat out nerf to power armor.
---
It's a bullet or two difference in damage, so like quarter of a second longer to kill a level 100 super mutant. I still one shot almost everything with a bloodied gatling gun.
---
Thanks for the detailed help i appreciate it. :)  
---
Right now i really am enjoying the game,  
---
And i have come across the camps near the spawn and they were really useful!  
---
I have also came across someone who gave me a free shotgun that does 60-ish damage with some shells which was really nice and helpful, Right now I'm just going to explore the world and get into the lore and quests. Thank you so much for the information :)
---
Since they intentionally included a drill that's been spinning for 25+ years in an area full of environmental hazards:
---
No
---
Thank you for the insight, Although i have found out the hard way of messing with someones C.A.M.P haha.
---
Thanks.  I‚Äôm going back to bloodied.  Appreciate the answers guys.
---
I actually didn't know that, Thanks!
---
Communism IRL.  Stalin had mansions while workers didn't even have a car or stable electricity.
---
Lol
---
That's your opinion, I think it's kind've broken, even in fallout 4 it was broken, just because you're in power armor, doesn't mean you should spam stimpacks and be unkillable, Even on foot you aren't unkillable due to limits, being in power armor is too easy, I think it's cheese but I'm not gonna bash your opinion for it. But go on saying its not broken, it's only adding on to the problems with PvP in this game
---
I may be willing. Aint got much to lose hahaha
---
I put nukashine in my punchbowl because it's a fun thing and I have plenty of it after all the ATLAS crates. Is that a shitty thing to do because of new players?
---
I sell ammo for a cap each (except for .38, which is free), plans for 25 caps, and legendaries for the trader list price, which is typically like 100-500 caps.  I sell a lot of ammo every day, but significantly less of anything else.  I‚Äôve gotten some 3* legendary weapons that I totally would use if they fit my build/play style (like a furious +25% VATS Plasma Mini-gun, for example) that have taken weeks to finally sell.

id always wait to see, what goes live on the adventure server. its a public test server, a place to test things.   
---
  
---
you can be pretty sure, that there will be a nerf. but what exactly? relax and wait for it.
---
I think you hit your shot.
---
This confirms my suspicions after seeing the posts typically popping up around changeover time.
---
Abbazabba..  u my only friend
---
I've done it 4 times. First went great. 2nd, disconnected. 3rd, game froze mid punch on a dingo. 4th, disconnected.
---
It's useless, I threw 3 levels at it cause I didn't like someone's prices and wanted to make a point. Even if you get an object to 1 health it'll just regenerate or not take the final hit
---
Remember all your critters will now hit harder as theyll be your level.
---
People are solo-ing him though.
---
Never.
---
if i get it right, season 1 will end and season 2 starts the next day. so, in fact, it will never be again like it used to be before the seasons.
---
If you attack grahm, chally turns into mecha-chally, moo moo destroyer.
---
For the most part, I thought they did a good job.  Better than most movies set in eastern Mass.
---
I'd give a super mutant a reach around for one..
---
The Fallout series overall is a long game. I play Fallout 3, New Vegas, 4, and 76 all on PC. You might be curious but learning through dying, making mistakes, and succeeding are how you learn about the game.  
---
Look at the bottom of the screen during menus and you'll see other options you might miss. Feel free to ask around if you get stuck.  
---
Keep an eye on your food/water, gear condition, and ammo count. Weapon mods vary in say defense and other effects. The wiki has a lot of info that's non-spoiler.
---
Only once? I'm slipping
---
I want to convert my legacy Gatling laser to ultracite to match my power armor:) no explosive lasers dropped as ultracite lasers
---
You don‚Äôt want that Assassins Tire Iron or Nocturnal Golf Club?
---
Bruh what his user I think that‚Äôs me
---
Yep is bullshit. We usually run full stacks in NW and now everyone has to solo queue.
---
They will be level-appropriate. They still won‚Äôt exceed their inherent maximums. 
---
You‚Äôre not going to be seeing level 200 Super Mutants if your level 200+. 
---
If you can handle the toughest versions of the enemies currently, you‚Äôll be fine.
---
Damn.thats insane.i traded for a 2525b fixer but I just recently changed it to fully automatic and it is insane. Like you say though I dont even get hype for rng or the purveyor anymore.i might let it go eventually also
---
Wish I could upvote you more than once.
---
Fuckin call it The Lobotomizer
---
Laser weapons are def lacking.
---
I have two mules named Sister Sarah. (In pastors vestments)
---
I'd roll with a buff to 20%, 4% per mutation, max 5.  Since everyone runs mutations, 50% like junkies would be too powerful.  But a 10% bump from 10 to 20 would be a good balance 
---
I just found a 3* Mutants Fixer today in a vendor for 2,800 caps. Mutant/50/25.  God rolls. I'd use it if mutants weapons were more viable but they're so weak at 10% buff, why even bother.  Instigating, junkies, and bloodied are king.  Even after the incoming nerf.
---
I got a lot of the mod plans 7 spicy 5 peppered 5 salty for it but only 1 meat tendy plan, also a couple of the tato salad plans. Was hoping for 1 extra for my other account. I think overall you were just plain old lucky. And to give you an idea I did it 77 times (had 231 meat cleavers and you get 3 per event) on my main account 36 times on my sons account and 20times on my alt account (can only have 2 accounts on gold at the same time for those that don't know)  
---
Everything else...I think I have like 20 full moomoo sets and like 15 backpacks and 12 grills.
---
Normally for me they are low levels.
---
I doubt that. Each season is ten weeks. Four seasons a year is the plan. That leaves 12 weeks, which suggests at least a two-three week gap between seasons.
---
He must of used an exploit then
---
Whoever told you they would is an idiot
---
Yes me and two of my other friends are having this problem. I even looked through their support they told me to delete all outstanding friend request I did this I also unplug the system and reset like they asked still same problem this is the first time I ever had this problem for over a couple minutes I'm getting very frustrated Bethesda needs to fix this issue fast
---
Are all the cursed pickaxes the same or do they have different effects?. I just did my first colossus run and got a cursed bloodied 40 power attack and 90 reduce weight. Is it possible to get a ss one or is that part of the cursed prefix?
---
I was under the impression legendary effects were supposed to be the real endgame progression.
---
That‚Äôs cool. But not everyone is geared and built to do that. Are players that get short changed by RNG supposed to just take it? Or git gud? Like I said people soloing him is nice and honestly expected all things considered. There will always be those players that can do that. But what about the players that don‚Äôt want to solo it. 
---
As players that want to join the event we shouldn‚Äôt be punished if not enough players join. There‚Äôs no screen notice that says how many are in your instance. There‚Äôs a map player count but clearly that‚Äôs not enough. Imo they should make the instance have safety net of 10 players but try and fill the 8 and IF an instance can‚Äôt get that required 8 dump them in to a 8 man event.
---
From someone to your south, I can confirm youse don't sound like that. Lou's accent is like an Aussie trying to sound like they belong in Allegheny County, and failing.
---
Bethesda will run out of creative ideas sooner or later..,..... give it 10 minutes.
---
If you are on Xbox I‚Äôll come kill em for you.
---
Oh my! Either I‚Äôm the super mutant and you must have some very long arms. Or you are the super mutant, in which case I would need to have to pop a lot of med-x and pray you are a super mutant with a very soft touch!  ü§£
---
Damn shocked you didn't crash. Though I load my workshops with 20 turrets I hit 8 to finish the weekly and 15 minutes later I had my first crash in months. However what is cool I came back and still had them since i joined on my public team so that was a first.
---
I took posieden and got some pvp. About 10 minutes ago. It was fun. Broke all my armor but it happens
---
Awesome help guys. Much appreciated.
---
There‚Äôs been a lot of great ideas thrown around tonight in this sub, but this is the best one.
---
If you have xbox gamepass it is free
---
Whats the fun in legendary farming if everything is the same.
---
Exactly, we have to use the same thing if we want to not actively nerf ourselves. Quite silly.
---
I think it's funny when I got killed by it i laughed at myself tip: If you kill earl dont stand under the mine shaft where you drop down from the debris Insta kills you and you get teleported outside
---
Thank you.
---
you get it for free if you have xbox gamepass
---
Welcome to fallout 76 you want to have a rampage but the people just give you 20 legendary guns instead and 100 fusion cores
---
i did tons of meat week on Xbox and never found one, so just lucky RNG on your side.
---
Regs doesn‚Äôt have a rifle plan for sale, you can buy the gauss rifle plan with caps in the military wing of the enclave bunker.  Gauss rifles are very strong but take some work to main, they can do huge numbers, bit they are very buggy in vats.  
---
Regs sells plans for the plasma caster and the gauss pistol, but no rifles came with wastelanders so you won‚Äôt find them anywhere for bullion.
---
We tried the same stuff. Didn't work.
---
I did her quest before and the reward was just random loot. I really liked the quest itself though, it was so weird. Just a Ms Handy out in the bog, literally on top of a fissure, doing research on chickens. Such a Fallout experience.
---
Four builds here, I enjoy the min, max role playing of different characters. Learned from my hundreds of hours in Fallout 4. Each leveling up got easier, and perk selection took less levels to achieve success. Transferring was helped with my son's account. Which made plans/recipes, weapons and armor to the proper character build. With multiple characters, I could choose different paths in Wastelanders and options. Even though I don't have one character high level like some other day one players. I have a range of 135-218 levels across all of them. My time with this outcome was enjoyable.
---
You're correct. I owned all 21. Back when I did this on a private server, I owned all of them including Spruce Knob.
---
I'd hope that for Vault 96 and 63 we'd see some other vault dwellers aside from ourselves. Maybe see what they dealt with and help them integrate with the post-nuclear war society. Even seeing the Vault 76 security at the Wayward and being able to buy Vault Security armor (or getting the plans for it, and something like FO3's style, not the cardboard style of FO4) and some other vault items would be nice.
---
It‚Äôs been out for a week, o don‚Äôt think there is a meta strat at this point, just go in and go in hard. 
---
And screw those guys for not rezzing, that‚Äôs just not polite.
---
MMORPG = Many Men Online Roleplaying Girls
---
Voicechat makes it easier to tell which characters are played by male or female gamers, but there are ways around it.
---
No matter who they are, it was nice of them to provide those plans.
---
I have B25 versions of every heavy gun, save for Gatling Gun. None of them can keep up with a B25 LMG or Gauss mini. There's just no comparison.
---
You're right and yeah, it took me close to 2 hours. I ignored the 'defend' events and just completed all of the 'retake' events until I owned them all and had no more defend/retake events left.
---
Actually communist here it is not funny please stop it we rather WW2 and AK-74 jokes all day and you know how much suffering we went through in ww2
---
I am 369 and I still love to help the newbies and give stuff away all the time....
---
I‚Äôm just glad that they didn‚Äôt mess up the 80 Atom challenge to claim 21 different workshops when they converted Spruce Knob. 
---
The one that I missed for the longest time was Wade Airport. It wasn‚Äôt until Wastelanders that I actually explored that area, I think.
---
All I was saying that its possible to spam stimpacks outside of PA
---
Aha I true communist I share my crops and purifiers I can barely store the water anyway
---
Wow a actual problem and people just giving trolly comments. I totally see your point btw. Especially if your sniping with the lever action from a higher point then they are. But at the same time there Fun and cute outfits not great for stealth there more for the ballsy players that get shot first or win the whole thing
---
Yeah same here with my friends and I ‚òπ
---
No they can‚Äôt. They get lucky and hit her before her legendary protections actually kick in.
---
I swear to god the fallout 76 community is just a bunch of fellow communists
---
It‚Äôs such a tease, that training room.  I loved the quest line too, but once I finished it, I‚Äôve never been back to the base.
---
Not much you can do about it other than level up and upgrade your weapons
---
Deaths are common at the start
---
All bloodied builds should be one with Atom and praise his glory for he is the reason they are so good.
---
Many of the workshops were already built up, at least partially, so that helped speed things up. I do like how, under the right circumstances, your workshops stick around for you to come back to.
---
oh, i misses the fact they said to have 4 seasons a year, thanks for that.  
---
and yeah, lets see what they gonna fill the gap with.
---
Ok...what kind of gun is the plastma caster then? Can I make the Gauss Pistol into a rifle? Probably not.  
---
I have just over 2000 gold. The only thing I got right away was the SS underarmor and the Shielded Lining. I managed to upgrade it fairly quickly. I doin't like random rolls regarding gear. The Puveyor only got me two pieces of awesome gear I still have. A Two Shot Combat Rifle 3 Star and an armor piece that makes me invisible and some other effects.  
---
All the gear but the chest I have is really good for me. I might just get the chest plans and hope for the best. I've relied on a lot of luck and player vendors who had gear that was somewhat expensive for me but 3500 at the most for one. I'm not rich by any means and don't plan on it.  
---
I've been selling a lot of stuff for super cheap to get rid of it or script the legendaries I can't use. Is the Gauss Rifle considered a Rifle or Heavy Weapon in-game?
---
Same mods on both? I had a terrible time with my explosive combat shotgun breaking really quickly until I changed the mods to include all the bash damage mods, lengthening the condition bar. I went from half a run of Vault 94 to two or more whole runs without repairing (until I got a QE double barrel in one raid - happy day!)
---
There's not damage perk for them only crafting.
---
Do you really though? you still have to go through the animation of using the stimpack and that takes about 0.5-1 second. In PA there's no animation or delay whatsoever
---
I'm not bashing your opinion, unlike the guy above tryna use crude words against me and speak as if he's everyone lol
---
Always loved stuff like that in Skyrim. Just happen to stumble upon something and you being like I already did all that stuff or no idea how I found this place but I‚Äôm here now
---
Y‚Äôknow what‚Äôs funny? I‚Äôve had the game since launch and this is my first character, school took over and I couldn‚Äôt play, and then people were angry that anyone played it when it was still bad, so here I am rejoining. Either way I found a marksman‚Äôs sniper rifle with a hardened receiver so  hell yeah, also a combat shotgun and short assault rifle, but I‚Äôm not lvl 30 yet so
---
I'm sorry for you, but that does make me feel a bit better. Misery loves company I suppose.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm a little over halfway through and she‚Äôs already a lot less annoying.  She‚Äôs at least happy to see me when I get back from radiating my ass off at AMS to get, like, a cassette tape for her or whatever.
---
Thanks for all the advice!
---
I agree the devs could go through and fix the code to be on shot instead of hit. 
---
But my opinion is management is holding back the devs from implementing more time consuming fixes under a misguided cost benefit analysis. That's why everything looks like a bandaid. It's unfortunate but seems to be the situation.
---
The only other time I did it was the day private servers came out. I didn't have Fallout 1st but I went into a friends private server (who was alone) and stole his workshop basically as a prank. He was cool about it.
---
In this case, I only did it because I didn't want to have to retake the other ~19 workshops another time, some other day. I wanted to get it done so I could cross it off my list of self-made challenges.
---
That's insane. The work they put into that is impressive. Hopefully a good chunk of it is automated. I kinda wanted to solve the puzzle for myself sometime, but that sounds like a total pain. Guess we'll see.
---
It's a raid boss at least.
---
Plasma caster is basically a semi auto powerful laser.it uses the heavy perk cards for damage.
---
Pray you don‚Äôt meet my low level
---
Gauss rifle is a rifle
---
Gaus pistol is a pistol (no rifle stock AFAIK)
---
Gauss minigun and plasma caster are heavy weapons.
---
If you are a rifles build, secret service armor is the best thing from wastelanders, it is a grind to make a set you want, but the armor is amazing.  You will need much more gold to buy all the plans and mods.
---
It is in PTS, we simply do not really know what it will end up being like.  As of now they have made everything even more bullet spongey, but they certainly might adjust things.  This is not a bloodied nerf, everything was nerfed.
---
Me to my ammo supplies were screwed by this glitch
---
And let us change them.
---
Love workshop pvp
---
Only have done it three times so far, and only two were successful. I'm a bloodied melee build with full unyeieding SS buttressed armor. I use a 2* bloodied power fist and a 1* instigating deathclaw gauntlet. On the first attempt I got a 3* Fixer and the carpet plan. Second attempt failed (don't know how it failed because the other guys playing with me were level 300's &amp; 400's). Third run got me a 3* Handmade and the plushie plan.
---
The only time I have the animation come up is when I'm not moving, other than that I never get the animation, maybe I have a werid rare bug happening.. no one is wrong here everyone experiences different things.
---
That workshop seems to invite a lot of PvP. I got super pissed once because some dude killed me there. IIRC, the workshop was unclaimed, I claimed it, and while claiming it I saw a cloaked player and approached them. They killed me and then again after I came back. But since then I've gotten over it.
---
Same camp spot. Can vouch for getting same server in a row. My superstition is to wait at the "try another world" screen for 30 seconds or so and then click it. I seem to get a different world more often than not then.
---
I believe it‚Äôs in crafting. Scroll over in the cooking section.
---
Don‚Äôt have friends but got the subscription for a private world. Nuked Whitesprings and was able to make passes by doing the log on and back in method.
---
Your best bet for a sniper rifle is the lever action. Good damage and a nice fire rate. Try to find a legendary version with instigating as the main effect and you will be able to 1 shot 90 pct of the mobs while in stealth.
---
The Secret service armor is really good. I'd suggest getting a full set.
---
Like a pack Brahmin üòÅ
---
Thanks I found it, Ik it‚Äôs a stupid question but it took me like 4 days to figure it out
---
That's really strange, If that bug was happening to everyone I dont think i would've posted my first comment tbh, üòÇ literally no stimpack delay? I have an animation every time i use one, moving or still
---
Welcome to fallout 76 be aware people will kill you for now reason anyway here is 200 legendary fat mans and 2 k nukes also my friend over there has a super AK-101 for you and 200000 ammo for you enjoy
---
It is in cooking section.
---
They can still do pylons?....  I have noticed a considerable drop in people doing any events besides Earle and maybe paradise. Kinda sucks.
---
Legendary Chainsaw, but only if they call it "Groovy".
---
I just want a forceful stock for the submachine gun
---
Drugs
---
You‚Äôve gotten it from Atlas crates? You lucky bitch
---
Yeah, its truly a strange blessing üòÇüòÇüòÖ
---
Good luck having all 13 in your camp without deleting anything.
---
They benefit from rifleman/commando/pistol perks depending on the receiver and stock you mod it with
---
Check out AngryTurtles youtube videos.  He has several really good ones that are explained very well.  It's easier to do that than trying to find detailed write ups.
---
If you don't want to do that you can search this subreddit and see what you find. Try bloodied, junkies, full health, etc.
---
Good luck! üëçüëç
---
Set up a vendor and throw stuff in it that you don't use or don't see a use for 8 usually mske my rounds too new players shops just with the sole purpose of giving them a little extra caps ( and because I usually find that low level people have pretty fair prices on stimpacks and stuff) because starting out caps can be hard to come by
---
did the event 2 times and never got loot from earle himself because i always died the on the way to him bc im a greedy sack who doesnt care about his bloodied glass cannon ass with a view on loot. so i spawned outside the mine both times, died from radiation (ups, still a nukezone) but at least got the rewards from the event itself.  
---
i think, this event will be a good school for self control....
---
Same problem on XB. I can sign in under a different GT and it works fine. Switch back to.my main, and it borks out.
---
Agreed, but 90% will not just because they like arrows that point down or disagree because you have a legitimate complaint...it has to be all unicorns and rainbows in this sub for these soyboys of 76
---
They are way more visible, so I would say it is balanced. Also, tactics. If they wear it to make headshots more difficult, then, bravo. 
---
I don't like unrealistic outfits because they break immersion, to be honest.
---
The comparison is supposed to be the ammo value but that's botched without any scarcity
---
Test it.
---
They shall be know as The MOObile Infantry
---
Any perks relevant to your weapon of choice. For simplicity, starched genes is good for mutations. Lone Wanderer if solo, strange in numbers if on a team.
---
Graham, why didn't you give me the tenderizer plan? Did I do something wrong?
---
This is beautiful and I need this in my life
---
So I have just gotten in the business of gifting low levels I plan on giving a dude a laser rifle with a sniper barrel and beam focuser mod made for his level and 200 ammo to enjoy it the thing is I though it would have been really funny to tell a low level player I have a ‚Äúflare‚Äù for a supply drop (they do not exist for supply drops only artillery and vertibots) now he did not get hurt by the army since he was in my team but it was still funny and a excuse to give him a super valuable gun and contribute to the community
---
It‚Äôs all good. I had a lot of trouble finding the planetarium lamp. Just need a little nudge sometimes.
---
I have two Lever Guns.  
---
The one I have on that char now(not in STASH) is an exploding one but can't remember the damage or other effects. It only holds 5 shots but it hits hard.  
---
The SS all require that Legendary thing and the end result is all over the place. Are the effect % better than that mole lady?
---
Could be. I'm on PC, had a top hat with a plague mask on. I was shooting a .50 cal.
---
It never stops as a level 50 I keep getting legendaries nukes materials and plans alongside power armour parts and I am about to launch a nuke myself thank you community
---
I might get the chest for now and focus on the ammo thing. I solo most of the time and I'm not looking for some 'kill everything by myself no matter how strong the enemy' kind of gameplay or damage.
---
Look at the timer in the game, my dude.
---
My solution: get rid of NW entirely. We didn't want it. We don't want to play it for score or cosmetics.
---
Getting rid of it solves that problem, and I won't have to suffer playing my absolute least favourite genre for cosmetics I want.
---
I hope you aren‚Äôt ruling over the wastes with a iron fist
---
Always make sure there's a crowd on the server.  If a colossal or a queen event just concluded, get in there.  Or, get a group together beforehand.
---
Someone just started it on my server. We crushed it.
---
I haven‚Äôt investigated personally but what the rumor I heard was that an Explosive effect on a shotgun will no longer trigger enforcer. So you can‚Äôt just aim at the ground and cripple an entire horde of ghouls. If you actually hit their limbs with pellets, it still works.
---
Unfortunately there was 2 full health power armor characters there but both of the players spent the whole event chasing the sheepsquatch imposter while it was invisible and invincible
---
Where at?
---
I've only just come back to it in the last few weeks after most of the bugs introduced with wastelanders were fixed
---
The effects are rng but you will always get SS which cuts down on the rng by a lot.  It has such high resistances that you can run a mixed set and still be tanky. 
---
The lever likely has higher dps than the gauss simply because the higher rate of fire. It was my go to rifleman/sniper weapon.
---
The dailies list
---
It‚Äôs the best way to get stimpacks and resources. It goes a lot quicker if you blueprint a sheltered fusion generater. Don‚Äôt forget to put down a sheltered collectron. You can put one down at each workshop
---
‚ÄúA bullet or two or difference‚Äù. 
---
It‚Äôs half the damage output. Now on a minmaxing bloodied build he‚Äôs still technically correct- when you were oneshotting things before, now it might be two or three. 
---
Where it really gets noticeable is on boss fights.
---
Heh, me too. Do you know how much a lvl 30 short assault rifle sells for, and a lvl 30 shotgun?
---
I rebuild from scratch. I try never to have the same style twice. Right now I am working out on paper how to do a Battle of the bunkers theme in the bog utilizing the trenches for aesthetics. With the new BoS bunker coming out I am hoping you can have 3 of each down but if it is just 3 total I kind of have a plan overall also that will utilize about 86 plushies.  
---
On my alt I will have a clothing store with built in kiddie area arcade I already have that mapped completely.   
---
Each camp gets 20-30 hours total play time before I destroy it. Rarely if I am in the groove playing it could hit 40 hours. My camps take a minimum of 3 hours to build with the majority in the 8 hour range. If there is a budget exploit I have taken 20 hours. In which I made a camp so large once using the height trick and door budget glitch that that account got banned as it was 2200% budget and crashed players that fast traveled to me.   
---
My last monstrosity was two weeks ago some may have see the 8 story 4 legged (2x1) shopping mall off of watoga just to see how high I could get it to go for a future shopping mall that may be permanent the floors stairs and walls alone took 89% budget.  
---
TL;DR it won't be a problem for my style.
---
I‚Äôm also a bloodied build and when I die I can‚Äôt even be rezzed. I use a bloodied puncturing power fist and was able to get some solid hits in on him but found it more useful to clear Wendigos. I‚Äôm not sure why they thought the increasing timer on death was a good idea.
---
Anyhow, got him down to a sliver of health and my game crashed. I‚Äôve yet to fight him again.
---
Why does the launcher even have a lock on if it has damage drop off?
---
Are you on PS4? That might have been me, I leave power armor in low levels camps all the time.
---
I agree with you on the cosmetic stuff, but I suspect a small number of people are buying 1st primarily for the atoms.
---
Still waiting for a god roll switchblade üôè
---
I dont see a timer?
---
I just completed it, looted Earle and the wendigo, then fast travelled out. I waited for the timer to end outside the mine, then it never gave me the reward, or said the event completed.
---
Far far as I'm aware, it's just explosive shotguns that it doesn't work like it used to. Other shotguns it still works just the same.
---
Similar to VE weapons, the explosive effect counts as an extra tick of damage, individually. So each explosion plus the shotgun pellets themselves would count towards triggering the crippling effect. Now that's no longer the case. Only the pellets themselves cause crippling, the explosions don't, and the splash damage doesn't either.
---
I get booze in almost every crate. I didn't realize BoS drink like Rotarians.
---
I thought I witnessed this until you said PC. I thought it was odd someone was nuking top of the world until I had seen someone's camp dead center. The camp disappeared a second later. 
---
For future reference Blackwater mine has a decontamination arch just inside of course the mole miners just outside might be a little more than a 14 can handle. P
---
In One Wasteland, the next patch coming in September, DPS will matter more as most enemies won‚Äôt die reliably in one shot.  I used to like semi auto because you could kill most enemies with a single headshot or torso shot sometimes.  Strongly recommend commando and a handmade over fixer for outside vats accuracy.  None of the gold bullion equipment is worth it after the next patch.
---
Hey can I get a heads up on this too? My brother has this. I hope it gets fixed.
---
I have tried. But I only have level 1 enforcer, so the chance for proc is low, so it's hard to tell if it's just happening or if enforcer did it. I need to level it up, then it will be easier to see a difference.
---
Nobody buys non-Legendary weapons and armour
---
Thanks for this. It's a starting point.
---
I think it's 1600 GMT currently. When you're on the challenge screen there's a 'Ends in X' at the top of the screen if you're hovering over daily or weekly challenges.    
---
    
---
Edit for clarifications:   
---
0300 local for daily quests    
---
1600 GMT for challenges
---
&gt; I have noticed a considerable drop in people doing any events besides Earle and maybe paradise. Kinda sucks.
---
I've noticed that too. Radiation Rumble is now a ghost town again. (I'm never getting that rad barrel plan, it seems)
---
Scammers would be stopped singlehandedly by just implementing a real trading system.
---
Definitely get the chest for the jet pack option, as far as the purveyor goes, crafting your own is definitely better odds, you may still get a nocturnal/better durability piece but at least it will be the item you want instead of some light raider piece or pipe gun.
---
Hover over or select either Daily Challenges or Weekly Challenges and there should be a 'Ends in X" timer near the top of the screen.
---
I'm running West Tek right now but I'll test after when I go farm Whitesprings.
---
I agree. To me it's not worth it if the bonus damage is only sbq
---
There was a guy with a .50 cal and the top hat but I never really got to see his face
---
I mean in game daily events like cop a squatter
---
I would probably try moving camp locations, delete blueprints and start from scratch.
---
You know, I was kinda hoping for a massive wave type event that ended when you die. (Would be a perfect BoS faction even) Call it "A Pile of Brass" and you're golden. Guess we kinda got that.
---
Ugh, no. She's so weird and creepy I banned her from my camp.
---
Perk cards that affect chainsaws, rippers, and buzz blades called "Groovy"
---
Awesome. I guess people just don't know? But that is a problem.
---
You could have fast traveled to one of your teammates if they were in the event.
---
There and the ammo factory have been my best battles. If they don't fight back when they come back I leave them alone. Some people still do take them for pvp fun
---
If you‚Äôre a heavy build like me use heavy energy weapons. They‚Äôre much more ammo-efficient. Bloodied Faster fire rate is best for damage btw
---
Yea, same mods on both pumps. My QE Double barrel seems to have good durability however. It seems to just be everything else that I have Quad.
---
Makes a lot of sense.
---
Same problem on pc
---
Wait it teleports your into the actual mine with your team mate? Well the more you know...
---
Oh, those reset around 0200 or 0300 local time I think. At least for me it seems like it. I would need to pay more direct attention when playing late.
---
If you are on Xbox you can use the looking for group to gab some people.
---
I wish she'd have one hell of a headache, and then she'd permanently be the Mistress of Mystery.
---
The bonus damage is to all scorched enemies, not that there are many difficult ones.  But with them releasing new bosses that aren't scorched it becomes useless when it's a pretty cool concept.
---
Taz thanks for the suggestion.with the ranger outfit and the gillie hat it pretty insane. Thanks again.i want to try and find the green hood maybe that would work also..not sure
---
Dailies reset 8pm est
---
That would be awesome! Could be that after feeding Chally some meat, she turns into the ‚ÄúBrahmin Cowlossus‚Äù mentioned by OP. Hence why Grahm is always talking about not giving her meat
---
You played FO76 on the hour every hour 11 times/day for meat week? That is dedication.
---
Does this mean VE gives double the health of the fire rate? Sorry, i know off target, but it mde me curious now thinking about it.
---
My chainsaw that I run around grinding up ghouls with is, in fact, named Groovy.
---
Events right
---
C'mon now, we may be freaky but we're not freaks.
---
Yes they said so during quake con
---
This happened at my first nuke launch (I am become death quest). Launched a nuke at Fissure Prime, fast travelled to SBQ event. Forgot my power armor.
---
Oops.
---
I died immediately, and it kept respawning me in the nuke zone. On one respawn, I tried hopping into my PA as fast as possible but still died. From then onwards, I was stuck. I couldn't move at all. No pip boy, no weapons, nothing. I could fast travel to different places, but my character was still frozen. It was such a bummer. I ended up just logging off to fix it.
---
Yeah, people are using ultracite ammo on Earle, and I don't really understand why. He's not a scorchbeast, so it does the same damage as ordinary ammo with powerful/hardened.
---
I thought Spruce Knob was the 21st, no? And that‚Äôs now Foundation.
---
Give this dude some awards and get the Bethesda CMsüòÇ I totally need this
---
Quests. But yeah like cop a squatter etc.
---
So from what I can tell, I can stagger them but I can't cripple them.
---
I have over 200.
---
Yw
---
I have tons of issues with encryptid. I die way too easily when grabbing pylons and cant shoot enough to keep my health up. I try joining, but last time i ended up with two pylons and spamming the stimpacks to stay alive, then it still failed....
---
Tryin jointing a public team that has helped me find bigger groups to do it with
---
As someone who recently installed a bunch of PC mods for FO76, perk loadouts are an absolute lifesaver.  And they‚Äôre obviously not difficult to incorporate, if some unpaid modder can do it relatively easily and have it work without a fuss.
---
I‚Äôve had it for a week. But yeah ‚Äúhopefully‚Äù they fix it soon
---
I feel you on that so why not just do extra damage over all instead of just a handful of enemies
---
Had a rader special encounter had to pass spech check in ash heap
---
Banned? No. Suspended for a couple of weeks? Without a doubt.
---
There isn't a cooldown... *however*, because there are potentially multiple instances of the Earle fight happening at the same time, it's possibly your instance finished early and there was another (or perhaps a couple of other) instances that were still going, hence why it didn't re-trigger on another nuke. Because the event technically hadn't fully concluded yet for everyone.
---
The furious prefix isn't really useful on a single shot weapon. It has to hit the same target a certain number of times before the damage begins to increase, the faster the fire rate the better so if your practically one shotting everything I would stick to your ts.
---
Not enough prime meat
---
It DID respawn. However, there is a bug where the Event won't show up at all unless you actually physically re-enter the Mine.
---
That‚Äôs all of ‚Äòem, you just need the three cursed weapons and the unique helmet and you‚Äôll have the whole spread!
---
yes i was too but for some reason it would't trigger for my friend till he did
---
Yep, with VE you get two procs of healing on each hit. People are using weapons like that to face-tank Earle and all of his minions at the moment.
---
Have you ever tried killing any enemies with a bash? It isnt. You disgust me, I'm reporting you to MODUS.
---
It explains why I didnt care for the wendigo spawns with my laser or 50. Sounds like I was getting health for two, lol.
---
Not all weapons have powerful or hardened receivers. Plus, you get way more ultracite ammo per craft and it‚Äôs not optimal to switch the mods out between different boss fights
---
Same I tried to email bethesda and they gave me a generic response.
---
It sounds like somebodies dead grandma came back to haunt you
---
It was boredom,it is nothing to log on hop on a spit go take a piss come back look at the rewards and log out.  literally 1 minute of my time every hour that was it. Brewing a cup of coffee takes longer and I drink at least two cups of coffee every hour I am awake.  I am drinking some out of my personal companies branded coffee cup right now as I type literally.
---
I do.  All the time.  Level 1 radroaches who I don't want to waste ammo on.
---
100% functional atom store content.
---
Tired of busted pre fabs with wierd silly glitches.
---
I have Gamepass... I still bought the game to own
---
I want a functioning fast travel system because I‚Äôm tired of tipping over 20 time over on location to fast travel
---
Dude Unequip the red skin for the CAMP module that you got from SCORE/Seasons. It's bugged.
---
He could do it. It just wouldn't be "optimized." To OP - your damage output wouldn't be the best, but you could do both if you wanted. You may find you don't do the damage you'd like to do with only half the perk cards though, so this person is correct if you want to maximize your damage output. Something to consider.
---
I personally am spec'd for shotgun, but I use a heavy for a variety of things even with no perk cards, and it works out. So there's that.
---
I've popped in just to see if they added anything, but that's it.
---
No, there used to be 22. 
---
Take a look at your Challenges &gt; Social. You‚Äôll see ‚ÄòClaim Different Workshops (X/21). Spruce Knob isn‚Äôt listed, and there are 21 still remaining in the list.
---
I finished a week ago.  That's 14 minutes less Fallout I've played for the week.
---
You probably already did this but make sure you don‚Äôt have one of them already and you just turned it off in the pip boy
---
For people who say Wasteland is not a Fallout game. Your right Wasteland is not a Fallout game, Fallout is a Wasteland game. Wasteland was made by the creators of the original Fallout. Waistland was actually released before Fallout, by Interplay, in 1988 and was the one of the games, along with Bards Tail, that allowed them to start to produce there own games not relying on EA to publish for them any more. It was not till 1997 that Interplay released Fallout as  a spiritual successor to Wasteland because I believe EA still owned the rights to the name. After Interplay closed Brian Fargo,  In 2002 formed inXile and hired some of his friends from Interplay. In 2012 they launched a Kickstarter for Waistland 2 with most of the crew from Interplay on board to make it. So Fallout is a Wasteland game and even makes references to it. Even in Fallout 3, New Vegas and Fallout 76
---
Server hop.  It's Fallout 76's #1 skill.
---
That would be utterly fantastic. And if it dropped and explosive milk mini gun.  Quest line name "Lactose Intolerant"
---
Events spawning immediately one after another and infinite storage space.
---
A commando gauss rifle wouldn‚Äôt make sense, but neither does the gauss minigun and they added that. But I do agree the old gauss rifle looked better. Maybe they should add it in as a skin and not a whole new weapon, like that one handmade skin that came out a little bit ago?
---
Fix. The. Bugs.
---
So barring any changes from current PTS all builds will be nerfed a bit. So it‚Äôs all relative?
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/FalloutTactics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FalloutTactics/)
---
Not a lot of activitly :(
---
Lots of drugs and no cares for personal responsibility.
---
Welcome to the gang
---
Pretty reasonable
---
The game desperately needs new types of weapons, acid/poison would be nice. Hopefully won't suck like fallout 4.
---
I think only Paradise (which I think is pretty funny event), in CP there's always a bunch of people because the 8 people cap, like 5 times I couldn't join and I saw there were levels 10-30 in the event. XD

Oh I don‚Äôt use mods. Thinkin bout it tho but idk

I just want the frames to be sturdy and more single player content. I went back to doing quests on my alt and I was having a great time, like Fallout 4.
---
A community message board on every server
---
Wait a little bit and it should come back. At least that‚Äôs what happened for me the other day.
---
Find a shishkebab with swing speed and use the flame healing perk card, I don‚Äôt remember it‚Äôs name but it‚Äôs in charisma (I think friendly fire). It works with the flamer too but supposedly only when bashing.
---
Maybe once they fix the extreme lag on consoles and add in **text chat,** just maybe I'll give them some credit.
---
I avoided Nuclear Winter like the plague until the Legendary Run began. When I started playing it, I could not believe that you could use nearly any cosmetic from the Atomic Store. It's crazy. I just picked a brown, skinny outfit, and a brown, narrow headwear, and I coasted hiding in bushes all the way to 100.
---
There really should be a thorough limitation on what you can wear in that mode.
---
Not true, it starts increasing from the 1st shot forwards. So as long as you‚Äôre not 1 shotting stuff you get better damage and you don‚Äôt lose a ton of accuracy from two shot
---
That has happened to me in my only 3 drops. Wait like 15 minutes, no sigh of vertibird or something. :(
---
I feel like a big thing I enjoyed on fo4 was the mods so if they added a single play or like co-op thing where you can mods it would be great (and also yeah steady frames would be good)
---
Sorry bro I disagree. I love this game and have been playing since beta and while it‚Äôs nice that they‚Äôre putting out new content, half of it is always broken and breaks twice as much stuff as it fixes. There are also bugs present since day 1 that have yet to be addressed, and instead silly things like a photo frame get fixed. This is unacceptable from a AAA developer and we‚Äôve let it slide for too long. Each patch promises new content, but I find myself getting disappointed more and more with everything that breaks. 1 step forward 2 steps back it seems.
---
Just do both. I have five different shotguns on my shotgunner. Their combined weight is only 6 pounds with the scattershot perk. They‚Äôre all kitted our exactly the same (as much as possible). The only exception is I put a suppressor on the combat shotgun for when I need to be sneaky.
---
Make sure you don‚Äôt have it turned off in the pip boy, and make sure you check in with rocksy and wren. If you‚Äôve already done that then idk, someone else posted about something similar so it could be a glitch
---
For my gauss shotgun, two shot only shoots one extra pellet, not double the pellets.
---
And I may be incorrect, but doesn't furious on a shotgun work per pellet?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for the weight, do both shotguns have the same mods? Weight reduction legendary only affects the base weight of the weapon.
---
I couldnt find any info about intelligence give more xp in fo76. It say it does in other fallout games, but not this one. Do you have any source on this?
---
A central player trading hub, so we don't have to travel to every player camp individually. Or let us see the actual vendor items for sale on the map, and not just the categories.
---
I‚Äôd never gotten a PPP in any Fallout game until this one, 3 or 4 weeks ago. I think it was at Camden Park.
---
I miss them too. I was thinking about that the other day and I thought what if the drill from the Motherload project had been up sized and turned into a moving Vault. Going around digging up resources and using them to keep the drill going. Could even be used to "invade" China... and then we get a Fallout game in someplace other than the USA
---
This is me IRL rn lol
---
Thank you man!
---
You can't save him from what I've seen. Someone decides to put a bullet in his head, whether or not it's you.
---
Fast Travel is pretty much worthless in this game anyways. Can't fast travel while over encumbered? What's the fucking point of using it then?
---
I teleported over there and it popped up finally. Probably wouldn‚Äôt have gone otherwise. Thanks!
---
It‚Äôs COVID era. What else do we have to do?
---
So you might go with the furious? How much does the damage increase per hit? With my TS it take likes 3-5 hits to a century bot in the head to take it down with my TS
---
This, pretty much exactly. It'd definitely be a situation of, "Okay, someone nuked the SBQ again, let me go back to my CAMP, swap out weapons and perks, get in the PA, and go get plants." The goal for the PA/heavy loadout would be "I just want to efficiently harvest plants and altered enemies and survive while I'm doing it."
---
Definitely got some good tips so far, though; looks like YouTube is going to be the best source for this type of info.
---
&gt; Did he talk or have any dialogue?
---
Boy is key.
---
That would make finding plans so much easier
---
I enjoyed the vault raids. They were dialed up to 11, and needed to calm down some but better than just shutting us out completely. I miss them
---
And make the power attack a swing instead of a bash.
---
It's possible(I'm hopeful) those are just place holders for the PTS, otherwise they are catering a bit too much to new players for my taste.
---
Yeah we tried everything bro. It ain't working. I even sent pics as proof. They literally sent me a generic response. I tried everything they suggested.
---
I would love if they made the game less of a time gated thing, to only get a maximum of 1200 caps, 200 bullion and x amount of scrip per day from dailies and scripping is kind of frustrating,  I want to put in time to make my rolls better but I can‚Äôt progress at the pace I want with this time gate in place. I can make like 5 weapons a day, if that..and to mention 3 of them will likely roll 2 star or lower..
---
Maybe make it so each vendor, and each gold machine have a different stock? So 400 gold and way more scrip to buy/craft with each day. I see many people expressing how it‚Äôs caused burnout not being able to grind the things they want. Which is understandable, outside of the daily grind there‚Äôs not much to do, I can only camp build for so long, I can only gather food materials for so long, I can only grind super mutants for exp for so long, and most importantly I can only wait for things to change for so long. 
---
Sorry for shitty format I‚Äôm on mobile
---
Thanks for the pointers and heads-up. Will definitely check that out soonest.
---
I did try searching the sub here but most of the stuff I found was in the vein of "here's how to build/spec for maximum effectiveness/damage/godlike output"--useful, but since I'm still fairly new(ish), I couldn't figure out what info would be relevant to my goal, which is basically "survive long enough to pick plants and kill altered enemies." A bar that is significantly lower. ;)
---
Someone that understands the true struggle
---
Tried waiting. Been playing but still get the same no sync nessage.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs something that really pulled me away is because I built my camp and finished all that and then by the end of the game I was just doing the daily quest and grinding bullion
---
Love these ideas. Chef perk ftw.
---
I got two from the rusty pick within 24 hours I never felt so lucky.
---
nice tip, thanks!
---
crimson comes from [cranberries](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Cranberries) so there should be enough if fissure site prime is nuked. to be sure, launch the nuke on sundew grove. it should trigger the sbq event on the right and there are a lot of cranberries to the left in the direction of sunrise field. to be absolute sure nuke mac farm or aaronhold homested.
---
Bout an hour ago I launched a nuke at the mine after finishing ACP but I waited about 5 minutes before launching it and it popped up as normal
---
You get a 1000 caps at level 11 on the legendary run, that's like 60 caps.
---
Sorry, I must‚Äôve missed out who was helping on PS4
---
I never actually got a chance to run through one. Never had a team to help and my build was trash anyway. Thankfully they're coming back at some point.
---
No doubt. I loot this like 5 times over, after I finish Radiation Rumble. I have no idea what they are thinking with this one.
---
That doesnt mean shit, I can kill a level one radroach by pissing on it. Try kill a glowing mole miner with it this time.
---
I am on PS4.  I am currently experiencing this.  I guess this is happening on all platforms?
---
It ain't 76 unless there's a crash. 
---
As for the event you have maybe a 5 minute window. You log on with a nuke zone it's more than likely too late. I was hanging out in a few lobbies and it seemed someone was nuking it every hour or so. 
---
Today was pretty good, yesterday not so much. I got a crash and the 76 respawn bug. Had to log out because of the bug but had a friend to get me back in. 
---
I'm nowhere doing the damage I need to, dying frequently, can't use PA because I depend on my gear to walk and in PA I get that bug. 
---
I'm still having fun.
---
I have like 500 after meat week lol its insane only putting 20 a day
---
Same today! yippee
---
When does season 1 end?
---
u/DogeSlothshepdog and u/LeAlphaReturs both said they could help under this comment tree
---
U gotta bump those numbers up those r rookie numbers
---
Why should I?  That's what my gun is for.  The business end that is.
---
Two shot adds a flat 25% damage and then cuts the total in half, that‚Äôs how much each bullet does. Idk how it works on shotguns, other than 25% extra damage. You also lose like 1/3-1/4 of your accuracy with two shot.
---
With furious, the first shot does normal, 2nd is 10% extra, 3rd is 20% extra, 4th is 30%, and it continues until you get +50% damage per shot, each shot after that is still 50%. This makes it better for enemies with higher health pools, as the average damage will be a lot higher than the 25% of two shot. I guess it‚Äôs up to preference at that point
---
It just plain boring I could get alot with this but noooo we have to wait 20 a day
---
I know one dude has 500 I was like damm
---
I was just pissed off because this was the first ever time trying the event. Why limit it to 8 people? Why can‚Äôt people just run in or whatever. I just don‚Äôt understand...

Yup. The pip boy is the key to the vault and the treasure.

Total guess: everyone is off harassing poor Earle Williams in his cave so nobody is out murdering scorchbeasts while waiting for SBQ fights. I haven‚Äôt seen a SBQ battle since ACP came out on Xbox :(

Not a bad idea actually

You get more ammo for the mats with ultracite, with some like .308 it is game changing.

True Communism would mean the crops would rot in the field, the power would go out intermittently, there wouldn‚Äôt be any Stimpacks available at any of the vendors, but there would be free Plans for everybody.

Wish I had reddit treasure to give you for that lmao
---
I wanna be able to transfer them to my alts
---
I agree completely. Not gonna add anything or pick apart any point . Just, yes.
---
Another point I forgot to add was I think the wendigo event was a great addition, an alternate farming option to the queen to switch it up, but with that being said  the rewards need to be adjusted, you need to get the same amount of flux and also need to get repair kits, plans are worth mentioning too - all those are reasons why Queen is farmed, and I was disappointed to not see repair kits rewarded..I worry that next month we will barely see nukes dropped on monogah mine because of this exact reason - and although the cursed affix is cool, it bothers me they are fixed rolls, I understand it‚Äôs for balance but i find it takes away the uniqueness when you see the exact same 3 drop every time.

September 10th

It was nice at first more intimate time with the wife, now it is video games and reading and slowly working on a coffee theory dealing in robusta that is honey processed and roasted to american (light roast normally 2-3 shades lighter than city roast when under a colorimeter)   
---
Basically I am trying to find a way to not have robusta taste like burnt ass or woody acid or way to much carbon, I want to find the perfect solution to a smooth cup every time from multiple farms It took me 2 years to get decaf to taste like normal coffee, both the activated carbon and the swiss water decaf talking to the farms I purchased from requesting the pulping process be done in a specific way before basically torturing the bean by swelling and releasing the caffeine over and over until only 0.1% or less caffeine is left in a bean.   
---
And I was so bored I just explained coffee to someone that probably does not care one bit. Eh it's late.
---
I have almost 3000 of them..

Because you don't clap your hands and now everyone has new jobs. Except for QAs people in the industry have years of college and work experience in a specific field. An economist won't fix your lag or a level designer won't produce code for your back-end tools. It's not possible and will never be unless you are producing a small studio game with polyvalent poeple working on a small scale production. I won't go into anymore details. Senior game designer here, not saying stuff just to get into a reddit battle.

I got it to on PC right now at 12:45 AM
---
You can fast travel to a teammate who is inside, that should get you back in. When the event drops, I will get it done ASAP and then check to see if others are still fighting Earle, if they are, I join their public group and get to go and do the Earle fight again.
---
I usually drink some booze for more strength then drop stuff if I'm overweight to travel
---
Honestly I would love for Coca Cola to just be named Nuka Cola for a month or two. Maybe with another Fallout release (like Fallout 5) it'll happen.
---
Thank you
---
right, am angry, edited post. its not fun without friends, at least for me
---
First, you just contradicted what you said there saying that "it applies to few" and then just after saying "this applies to most". So I'm not entirely sure where you're standing there. I'm not saying that it applies to everyone but it is a rather common thing that people get tired when there's nothing new(similar to how you'd rather not make a new character because you've already completed most things). 
---
I say that being able to respec your character in 76 at will with no cost would make creating additional characters pointless aside from mules because what else is there? If you have several characters that can all use the exact same skills, weapons, armor, builds, and so forth, what then? Change your character's face or body shape? Re-run old quests(you mentioned that you have no interest in completing things again so this is clearly out)? If 76 had classes like ESO, then there would be a definitive reason to making multiple characters. But with 76's current design, the only things you can really do with multiple characters is mules, re-run old quests, and have "load-outs". 
---
I'm not going to say that 76 is anywhere near perfect. If anything, it's still a mess but it has definitely improved a lot of things compared to how it was on release. I agree that there are easily different systems that would work better but I wouldn't hold my breath because very simply, the cost and trouble wouldn't be worth revamping the entire system. With this game's spaghetti code, everything would probably just break(like how there's usually a ton of new bugs with every update). It's more of a surprise that Bethesda even bothered to salvage what they could instead of just dumping it. 
---
For casuals or pros? Like I mentioned, the balancing is crap. Unless you clearly know what you're doing or have a build specifically set, you're more than likely going to have a hard time. I remember when I had started, I wanted to try to go as a sneaky sniper build but because I wasn't purely focused on damage, have a perfected build, or using metas, I had trouble killing anything that wasn't underleveled. The latency causes so many problems. For example, the delayed kills pretty severly reduces the usefulness of "gun-fu", enough that it would be easier to just manually use VATS. Then if you're going close-quarters, it's so easy to get killed even if enemies should've been dead the moment they got in range. 
---
Yeah, I would like a change in the respec system. I don't want to have to swap special points into Int. just because I want to craft a weapon or mod, even though I have every most every plan learned and the perks(I run 3 int but often need a level 4 weaponsmith). Being able to change builds would be great too. But let's be real, at this point, there is no way anyone can really expect a change like such. 
---
(on a side note, if you do decide to get back into playing, I would generally recommend just killing mole miners at "blackwater mine". They typically drop a lot of shotgun shells. As for making your own ammo, scrapping weapons with "scrapper" from the mole miners will give you lots of steel. Laser weapons from super mutants over at Wes Tek give tons of plastic. Mine ore from "Lucky Hole" while using an excavator PA will give loads of lead(and crystal) ore. Then you could get lots of acid for smelthing from cave crickets at "tanagra town" and "the deep". Of course at the end of it all, running "super duper" and "ammosmith" helps a ton.)
---
And you can cash them in at one sucks
---
It'll take you 150 days to cash that all in
---
Haha yep
---
But that is alot so good for you
---
How do you donate?  What's the donation event?
---
You only unlock them after finishing wastelanders, right? Because I have 0 and have done a lot of events, also just been playing since July 12th.
---
And they should increase everything, scrip limit, stash limit and vendor caps limit, I have like 30 legendary worth 15, 24 and 40 scripts but already have 1000 scripts and my stash is always between 750-799 pounds so I can't sell them nor spend to get good ones, I don't know what to do. :/
---
It's a scrip sale, not caps....
---
Do events and Dailies.  They now have a chance to drop a level appropriate legendary on top of the regular loot.
---
Perhaps putting css or pa on the favourites wheel would help. People could get changed on the run
---
Amazing info, thank you so much! Just got my Mask today.
---
There were about two months before wastelanders where I got to do them. It was a bit like Arktos Pharma (someone else referenced that too), but the mobs were ridiculous and I think the xp was nerfed so there was less reason to grind unless you wanted the rewards (which honestly I had no idea what they really were because I was pretty new). Most of that I've gotten with Wastelanders gold and actually appreciate it now. Radiation Rumble is closest comparison in mob insanity. And... similar to Encryptid you had to do things together in different rooms. Everyone complained (the same ones who wanted a single player game) but from a multiplayer perspective it was an extremely rewarding experience stressful, required coordination (mic was almost mandatory), like dungeons in diablo but first person, at least you can see they were really going for something unique but the Bethesda bugs and player base really created a perfect storm of hatred for vault 94. Speaking of Encryptid, vault raids got nothing on that shit show. Vault raids definitely needed polish and some deeper exploration options, add some npcs and a bit of content, stability, and potential for random generation (or radiant questing and random dungeon generation) and it would be really cool.
---
The quest could me called ‚ÄúImoovable Object‚Äù
---
My bad, didn't proofread my post. That's what I meant though.
---
Yeah this game really needs to increase everything id even go as far as infinite as for the treasury notes yes wastelanders needs to be completed
---
Yes, treasury notes are awarded after completing the final quest of Wastelanders. You also get them through the Crater and Foundation Daily quests after Wastelanders.
---
You go to atlas observatory, talk to the guy, and there's a box. It lets you donate whatever they're collecting in increments of 250. They want something like 200 million leather.  Today though, it's wood.
---
Pretty sure people loaded up after meatweek. I get that the 20 notes a day is to limit people from completing everything within a few days, kinda like the 150 scrip, but there definitely needs a change. One idea could be that you could still turn in more, but the value would go down as you turned in more above the daily limit, eventually reaching a 1:1 trade.
---
Ahh ok
---
100% agree with this post. The grind is already oppressive as it is to try and keep up with a main character. There is zero point to do so with any other character. 
---
There are some parts of the game I'd love to relive but it's just not worth it. 1 main character and 4 mules it is.
---
Nuke Morgantown and do Back on the Beat. Getting the raw flux or the ingredients is very doable in many situations.
---
But this actually wasn't my point as I know how to get the materials. I was trying to suggest that Scorchbeasts should drop the materials as well because regular scorched show up and I'm like yay, a Scorchbeast shows up and I'm like ugh. I should have put the tldr before the post.
---
I came here for this.
---
But people should complete the game when they want not what the game decides
---
Yeah I'm all for this, I think I could probably buy everything available if I could hand all mine in at once. [https://imgur.com/a/jKZSAEV](https://imgur.com/a/jKZSAEV)
---
Also, let us change our names, I would even accept having to re register at the DMV to prevent people from changing them incessantly to scam others.
---
Not when i tried. It spawned me outside. I had died and couldnt respawn had to close and came back. Couldnt get in the mine. In fact when i traveled to my teammate a second time while i was outside it sent me to silva homestead.
---
... that is alot of gold good sir
---
The only problem is Enclave ‚Äúfanboys‚Äù showing up and causing havoc (all in good fun).
---
The dude was in power armor. A blue one I believe.
---
I sell all recipes for 5 caps.  Flux for 30.  Serums for 175.  I just sold what I was told was a god-roll gun for 3k caps.  It was a Bloodied explosive LMG with 90% weight redux.  Forget what the other trait was.  I play to have fun and help out others to have fun too.  It's not Wall Street.
---
Oh nah that wasn‚Äôt me I was in blood eagle power armor
---
Could rationalize that they had to spread out into the world to reclaim their lost treasures and are taking them back by force.
---
Endgame is shit alone but story missions when i had them they were fun alone and with friends
---
Amount of people unaware of what fallout is &gt; people who want Nuka
---
It'd be suicide for Coke to do that 
---
More likely a craft company do it, which was already done (Jones made a quantum). 
---
Top it off the industry is stretched right now, mostly due to COVID.
---
I‚Äôd be happy if the added items that you could use them on. I have almost 500 and 3400 bullion and bought everything I wanted.
---
I hate when people come here to offer ideas on what should be in the game. It's like HERE WE GO AGAIN...
---
But this is not one of those times. Take my mother loving upvote.
---
Thankyou
---
There is also one that spawns behind the West-Tech building at the alter.
---
Uhhh... fairly certain a sheepsquatch staff with the best mod outclasses a super sledge. But I don't actually have the best mod. 
---
Gauss mini vs 50cal has a shorter combat range (120 vs 204) and spin-up time to deal with, plus much more annoying ammo crafting.
---
Definetly wins on sustained fire though- 5-600 rounds and fast reloading. 50cal is 250rds and SLOW reload (seriously, it's like 5 seconds without any boosts...)
---
LMG has crazy ammo requirements and a ton of kick; much harder to control. Also slightly shorter range, but not very huge (it's like 174 vs 204). I have a B25 that I basically never use because with the fire rate, it's vast overkill on most things, and it burns ammo soooo fast. Plus I'm a H/E build; 32% AoE damage from my BE 50cal on much more controllable fire beats out burning through my ammo 25% faster. Yeah, it doesn't do much vs the queen, but I do have a B25 gauss minigun for that if I really want to.... but I don't need to. B25 Ultracite gatling laser, B25 gatling gun are vastly more ammo efficient and I don't need to minmaxing damage at the cost of those crazy ammo usages.
---
What I'm saying is Heavy Weapons are fairly balanced if ammo is actually limited.
---
Rifles are a whole different story though. The only thing I can say is Fixer vs Handmade is fairly even, except Fixers are HELLA rare ('naturally', outside of dupers...). Fixer fires slower but does more damage; handmade has less recoil.
---
Trading is too much effort.
---
I just sell for caps no matter what I have.
---
Funnily enough the stuff I have listed for 10k caps that is legit god roll just sits in my vendor while ammo sells quickly.
---
I‚Äôve had a bloody FFR radium rifle and a furious FFR radium rifle AND a bloody FFR combat rifle all sitting in my vendor for weeks at 10k each.
---
Whereas a bloody 1 star Gatling gun sold for 7500...I meant to have it there for 750
---
The game is built around the irony of society. Nuka cola is if anything making fun of Coca Cola, consumer society, even how corporate mindset puts profit before lives. I don't see a common ground üòÇ
---
Serendipity is a big one.
---
Personally, I like the combo of the healing mutation and ghoulish. Pretty good natural heal rate.
---
But I think those are the cornerstones.
---
edit : after those it comes down to pa vs nonpa choices. Like ironclad.
---
Edit 2:also dont forget adrenaline..
---
Yeah I want people to see my characters name when I charge in on big enemies with no armour and either a berserkers shotgun or berserkers bear arm.
---
My characters name is kamikaze.
---
Near the Whitesprings station there is a train car that occasionally spawns two rare Nuka Cola Varieties ...
---
Ghoulish is the one that heals you up to your rads? Don‚Äôt you have to take Rad damage though? I‚Äôve also heard Radcool as well.
---
Dark
---
This. Wastelanders made alts a MASSIVE pain in the ass. And the Legendary Perk system looks to continue this trend.
---
I still don't understand how they give account wide Slot unlocks, but character specific (AND FREAKING PERK CARD TIED) leveling them up. Look at ESO. You got a max level 50(810) character? All your alts have access to those bonuses.
---
I would easily agree if 76 were a single-player game. I think one of the main reasons for time-locking and daily caps in mmo's is to more or less keep players from finishing and moving on because "there's nothing left". In a business sense, it's important to keep player count up, but some of the things related to dailies is crap. As a simple example, one I find to be complete crap is Mr. Fuzzy tokens. If you were running only 1 character, you'd have to do the camden park daily, every day, for more than a year, just to get the Mr. Fuzzy head and outfit.
---
This game just doesn't just have high levels. If a game only feeds the high levels and leaves scraps for new players. Well never have a stable player base and even playing field. Hints why we are getting one wasteland
---
Man I really took a liking to workshops while trying to fill the time between Meet Weeks events. Was gonna try and set this goal for myself someday soon, glad to know it‚Äôs feasible!
---
I think fallouts made a big enough ass out of itself when they started using vault boy as a marketing ploy, guess Etsy will do.
---
Jones Soda did a nuka quantum. It was sold at target in which nearly all employees like always hoarded it as a collectable because Target employees are fucking terrible humans.
---
That is true. Until you did everything and only the team events remain.
---
People working towards Legendary Run maybe? I dunno, all events seem dead. Last ones I saw was SBQ which triggered Earle &amp; both had a whopping 2 at each. Was busy doing "chores" myself &amp; can assume others maybe in the same boat &amp; just can't be asred to join.
---
Even the Meat Week events I was in were sparse compared to last year's or the Fasnacht months ago.
---
Im waiting that they make more grindy and fun stuff
---
Good lord, as a gamer for 20+ years I can safely say Witcher 3 is number 1 on my list of all time greats. Do yourself a favor and play it. Now.
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
Radcool boosts your str based on roads. Handy for melee.
---
Ghoulish says radiation regens your health. I'm trying to figure out if it means total rads or taking rads actively. Anyone know?
---
Your right I guess my issue is I just wanna get the secret service armor so I can do a non power armor heavy build and I hate waiting im very impatience in that sense and wanna be able to use it its like I have the stuff let me do it
---
I have three different characters and haven‚Äôt done any wastelanders stuff on any of them except Beckett‚Äôs quest and the wayward stuff on one of them.
---
No grinding for gold bullion or any of that stuff.  I will eventually but it‚Äôs not necessary for a complete build.
---
One character is a stealth sniper.
---
One is a bloody stealth commando.
---
One is a shotgun build (I play this one right now).
---
You don‚Äôt need the gauss weapons or the secret service armour to be a god like character.
---
Not everything needs to be great or awesome on the board you greedy tools. Also beats the basic ass repair kits that are trash and you can't vendor.
---
On a related note, here are the lyrics from the song Timothy by The Buoys 1972.
---
If you get a chance give it a listen @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjSmFq3j-8M
---
Trapped in a mine that had caved in
---
And everyone knows the only ones left
---
Were Joe and me and Tim
---
When they broke through to pull us free
---
The only ones left to tell the tale
---
Were Joe and me
---
Timothy, Timothy, where on earth did you go?
---
Timothy, Timothy, God why don't I know?
---
Hungry as hell no food to eat
---
And Joe said that he would sell his soul
---
For just a piece of meat
---
Water enough to drink for two
---
And Joe said to me, "I'll have a swig
---
And then there's some for you."
---
Timothy, Timothy, Joe was looking at you
---
Timothy, Timothy, God what did we do?
---
I must have blacked out just around then
---
'Cause the very next thing that I could see
---
Was the light of the day again
---
My stomach was full as it could be
---
And nobody ever got around
---
To finding Timothy
---
Timothy...
---
FT to a teammate works if there is room in the instance.
---
edit- or a friend
---
yep. this right here. \^
---
It‚Äôs based on rads you have according to the wiki.
---
Hope you enjoy your eventual carpal tunnel syndrome.
---
The Whitespring‚Äôs pretty good. The alley with all the dumpsters and skeletons has like a dozen brain fungus and then all the aster around the main driveway loop and scattered around. So if you have green thumb, that‚Äôs a pretty big chunk of crimson.
---
I hate when people empty my drink containers in one go out of spite or greed. They need a cooldown timer of some sort.
---
With the brotherhood coming from the west coast maybe they pick up some western culture on the way!? Am I thinking too far out the box?
---
They sell em dude, they're not coke tho
---
Jones is a way better partner for this, they just don't make enough of them.

Increase the limits (or better) eliminate them. At least 4000 of stash space, the triple of camp budget, script limit of 10000, 30000 of gold bullion and vendors with at least 3000 caps, 1000 gold and script per day. Increase the SPECIAL to 100 not 50, I hate having to change every time to pick a lock, hack or repair items and being overencumbered if I don't have the perks to reduce weight, so I deal decent damage or I run freely and fast travel, why can't we have both?
---
Nah man i‚Äôm talking the mexican bottles, so actual glass.. hmm that‚Äôs a lot of money heh
---
I just want to be able to adjust my load-out without a time limit. ~2 minutes never feels like long enough to figure out what options I have.
---
I got it back! Everything is still here!
---
Alcohol, Daddy-O, Daytripper, Mentats and Psycho are the addictions I run. Addictions are flat, meaning they don't get worse and worse. I don't even attempt to get my addiction symptoms sated. Find yourself a Junkies main weapon and always, no matter what build, a Melee weapon that supports your build to save ammo/take out trash mobs.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more!
---
What if it was a ploy to guilt u Into giving him cool loot for free?
---
Wonder what they‚Äôll do with 63 (if anything)
---
I feel like the raider bot already does that
---
You can do that ya know.
---
Maybe the second time was a laggy instance... I've seen lag cause the mob to be getting hit with sneak attacks even though it's fighting something else. But this is how sneak works in the game - the sneak attacks only happen if your target isn't aggroed by something or someone else (one of the reasons why it's faster to solo the queen for example when you have good gear - I've done it many many times).
---
Hate getting stunned and having to spin up the chainsaw again. Stopped using them because of that.
---
*yinz not youse
---
I get you there. If there wasn't a limit, I would have easily grabbed the SS armor already as well as everything else I wanted. I think that there should be a limiting factor but not a solid roadblock.
---
a huge amount of players are having this problem, its not just you. theyll fix it.. eventually
---
Really? Source?
---
Exleast make it to lile 40 or 50 a day that should be enough to make you feel like you made a leap in progress
---
My god you must've used a ton of ammo.
---
I would go as far as to say not just junk, but be able to tag anything so that it can't dropped, deleted, or sold. It would be great if we could "favorite" more than just what we have on the wheel.
---
Pretty sure when they took them out they said they would do some tweaking internally and reintroduce them down the road.
---
As a one of our mission's in PKOA. We strive to help any one in need. Be it game, advice, a friend or social/mental anxiety issues. Ever need more help or anyone reading this. We are here for you. Our family can also be yours.
---
Out of 8 attempt 4 kills and only got to loot him 3 times due to massive bugs with the event timers / group failing to fill up.
---
If you‚Äôre going full tank then I recommend Blocker, Action boy + dodgy + ap refresh armor, fireproof, richochet. DR has diminishing returns after a certain point too, focusing on % reduction perks and stats will help you out a lot.
---
Also, instead of using traveling pharmacy use the chemist backpack mod. It‚Äôll free up 3 points in strength.
---
Getting a hit reduces durability. The explosion reduces durability again. Two shot explosive, if all projectiles hit, reduces durability 3 times, more if the explosions hit unintended targets.
---
Yeah I logged in today and it said max rank so I‚Äôm freeeeeee! No dailieessss. Just scrip, gold dailies lol
---
But the axe needs to be big. Like, blade made out of a sharpened vault door. Call it the 'Can-Opener.' 
---
Call the behemoth the Progenitor and give him a backstory that he's from Huntersville and they took him into Vault 00 that was underneath Vault Tec U for key staff and company execs(remember the limos outside the school buildings?).
---
The Progenitor was there as a favor to the DoD to contain him and hide him when the FEV experiments were successful. But the war started with him still hidden there. After the vault was sealed, Pro-G was contained and sedated. They kept him that way for years but they ran out of chems and he woke up, broke loose in the vault and has killed everyone within. Now he has smashed out of the vault itself.
---
The vault Tec U was the perfect place for such an emergency vault. It would be a location where the execs would be, it would be hidden under the demo / test vault. It would piggy back on the same systems and no one would suspect it was there when built because it was camouflaged by the experimental vault. No one would think twice about Vault Tec supplies being sent and stored there, either.
---
Hrmm does it affect where people spawn into the canp?
---
That would be nice too. I never feel like I have the time to go through and actually look at the perks and buy the ones I need etc.
---
I'm kinda jealous of bloodied builds -- I would love to be able to do that damage, and save all that ammo. But I don't like dying.
---
That would be so cute
---
You only have 10 min to complete the event. The timer on the event title is wrong.
---
I mean the thing is ive played end game combat with base  gear. no legendary effects. its viable and possible.
---
So the whole this build is best this build is broken this build wont work blah blah is all bullshit. While some do way more damage then they should for the most part the game works, they just need to nerf some shit.
---
If you doubt me, play end game content with max level crafted gear no legendary effects. Its weirdly way more fun cus theres challenge and risk involved.
---
Ty... I'm nuking my own base with different Allies.
---
Taking radiation damage heals you. Active radiation damage.
---
I think a rare occurrence of this would fit the Fallout vibe quite nicely :)
---
Radical is based on your current Rad %. Ghoulish is based on active incoming rad damage.
---
Thats odd either i read wrong or it was a visual glitch probably just me thanks for the info.
---
Low levels don‚Äôt need 5 radaway and 5 rax-x though they get plenty of that through adventuring naturally (Hell, we all did why cant they?). If they really wanted to help lower level players they should put like a lunchbox, perk card pack, or something else. This is just useless.
---
I have this problem as well
---
Got a bug today where upon killing him it said we needed to drop down the mine shaft again. Couldn't progress after. Too many occurrences of dieing just as earl goes down and being booted out with no chance to loot or gain event loot.
---
Seems some idiot or another keeps trying to glitch to the boss before the timers allow botching everything.
---
Hell yeah my dude here rocking Ebony. Always thought it looked the most realistic of the heavy armors.
---
That doesn't really apply to QE vs BE.
---
Ah ok. Thanks for the info!
---
Back in my day you jad that whole 30 minutes to farm ghouls before you had to attract the night stalker. By that time it didn't matter because you had killed 6 legendary ghouls and farmed so many chems and scrap you had to limp your way to a stashbox. But that was too awesome so bethesda stepped in. Now you still have 30 minutes to complete the event, but there is an 8 minute timer below to summon the night stalker. If you take any longer than that you fail.
---
Still lots of valuable stuff for being in bloodied range as junkies to sort of double dip.
---
And suppressors, and sights...
---
BATTLE CATTLE
---
That‚Äôs been happening live on PS4 for awhile. Graham decimated my buddies base when his turrets turned on him.
---
There are two events where I‚Äôve had problems with enemies not being labeled as enemies. Sometimes in Free Range wolves will be friendly when they attack and Bots on Parade the enemies will be friendly for the entire event.
---
Now that I think of it those are both events where you have to protect something from waves. I wonder if there is a correlation.
---
Average, and by that I mean 'non Bloodied' will probably not notice too much difference with enemies. Possibly Furious users might take a fraction longer too, but as most have noted already, it's going to be the Bloodied builds that work on a sliver of health that will have issues when they can't one shot most of the higher grades of enemies. Perhaps there might be a minor shift in how low Bloody builds are happy to go health wise, but possibly not too great, and the fights last a few seconds longer. A case of wait and see, I guess.
---
I've got about the same time in, and could never bring myself to grind the same grind on more than one character.  I can feel my soul getting sucked out of my body just thinking about it...
---
My friends list is always empty now too, but that's because they stopped playing.
---
More camp budget!
---
My usual loadout for Skyrim was the Ebony Mail, Dawnbreaker, and the Nightingale Blade. 
---
Ah now I miss Skyrim...
---
That wouldn't be bad at all. I suggested "lower value as you turn in more" so that players who don't have all day could turn in an "ideal" amount, but not limit people who aren't bothered by grinding.
---
Remember back in New vegas and Fo3? Those vaults where awesome. Vault 22 was so scary
---
I recently started a twitch stream where I just explore the map, I nearly covered the forest area but my rules are no quests, no fast travel and damn the supplies that I got is insane, I have more on this alt than my main that I play a lot!
---
I, wonder if something broke re IFF tags in the last hotfix
---
The E is for explosive, right? That's what I'm referring to. Explosive prefix degrades a weapon twice as fast if the projectiles hit, even faster if the explosions hit other enemies. Try and read my post next time.
---
Apparently ESO is having similar issues
---
Confirmed. I maxed out the card and went to test it on someone's base. I planned on repairing whatever I damaged (noticed you can repair other people's stuff) I tossed some bait but none of it exploded and just sat there stinking up the place.
---
I then started shooting up the wall and while with the Perk card, it was doing a lot of damage, it would go down to just a sliver of health and then rubber band back to normal health.
---
Seriously, wtf is the point other than fooling you into wasting your own resources for nothing?
---
Would immediately buy a FO3/NV Gauss Rifle skin.
---
You could of left the silo to get a keycard and went back to launch as once it's prepped it stays prepped for about 15 to 20 mins with no robot respawns.
---
Not too late at all, I started mine around lvl 90 and I‚Äôm now around 250. What type of bloodied build are you looking to make
---
Heavy gunner, just got a be minigun, already have heavy gunner perks and one life giver looking to level up
---
If only I had duped the legendary modules for infinite rolls... but fuck me, right?  I feel like a damn clown for playing legit and grinding like a dumbass smh
---
Nice reference
---
Not everything needs to be great or awesome? You would make a fine Bethesda employee... :D
---
I've never been great on damage so I'm considering making my first run pretty soon but running in as a support. I'm probably going go in using an explosive shotgun with enforcer to shoot out the knees of every wendigo there is lol
---
If I could make diffusers, I'd probably make a ton and throw those down while I'm at it
---
The difference between bullion and the other currencies is that there is only a finite amount of plans available for bullion. Y'all have somehow stockpiled a ton of Treasury notes, (I honestly have to figure out how...) And if you could put them all through at the same time, there would bebnothong left to keep comong back for. I know that's a shitty reason to have a gate, but I get the logic.
---
Not true, some of us are gracious souls who will clean out a low level players vendor just to get rid of caps.  It varies what we do with what we buy afterwards, some people drop it some scrap it.  On a side note if you can't use them yet either scrap them for the chance to learn mod plans or sell them to a robot vendor in a train station.
---
Appreciate the input!
---
I said dark...
---
No the furious doesn‚Äôt have the 90% reduced weight but weighs less than the one that does! Very confusing. Thanks for the input bro!
---
Also a dedicated friend to heal as ull likely not have any allies with you in a colossal problem unless you regroup with those who are there.
---
Unyielding armor for all 5 slots. 15 points into all stats except Endurance is a massive boost. Serendipity rank 3 is essential. Dodgy 3 is essential but I don't use it, I need my action points. Radicool and Fireproof in Endurance are pretty rad. Blocker 3 in Strength is necessary. Other than that fill in what fits your preferred weapon for damage stats. Won't really need too many weight reduction stats on perks because of the huge buff to strength from Unyielding and Radicool. Weapon weight reduction legendary effects are always welcomed on any build. Experiment. Bloodied is crazy efficient, I haven't had to repair any armor piece in over two weeks.
---
Depends on where you are trying to allocate points. If you are heavy gunner and doing Heavy gunner bloodied you are fine but if you are trying to switch to commando or gun slingers it is a lot of points that need to be allocated. It's a lot of work if you want to grind to move them.
---
At level 50!
---
I love this idea.
---
I want them to fix the gauss weapons first.
---
I've made many characters. If I didn't go to other regions. I wouldn't find much.
---
Just trying to figure out what perks I need to survive and I appreciate all the current advice, should I get life giver
---
Any clue as to when that Big Wanderer outfit is coming back. That mask calls to me.
---
Ive never noticed a lot if crimson, as many times as I've run it. I'm sure it's there, but I always come out with a ton of yellowcake and florescent. Cranberry bog is where I go for violet and crimson. Cobalt is either by the University, (city name escapes me at the moment,) or by top of the world.
---
I‚Äôd buy *that* for an Atom!
---
I was well past 110 when I switched 2 characters too bloodied.  It just takes time, grind, and level ups.
---
The vats on the gauss weapons pisses me off like in reality its suppose to be extremely accurate
---
I just came here after spending the tokens and having nothing show in the inventory. What a rip.
---
I won't be contacting the useless (by the sounds of it) support though, as I can't be bothered with the aggravation they will cause.
---
I didn't get a failed event notice it just stopped.
---
Meat pile?
---
I‚Äôve gotten all three plans already. But I‚Äôve only gotten the cursed shovel and pickaxe, and no unique helmet. Can you clarify?
---
Still not working for me :(
---
No need to get life giver since it doesn't do magic  healing anymore. Serendipity and dodgy would be good if using unyielding armor. But if you are going bloodied with power armor then emergency protocol. I think damage resistance becomes almost 90% reduced, correct me if I'm wrong but yes it's something that ridiculous.
---
What is emergency protocol under, I‚Äôm a power armor user
---
Cushioned mods on leg armor for fall damage mitigation. Dodgy is great if you don't mind your AP draining from damage. Fireproof in Endurance or a Dense chest mod. Blocker 3 is necessary.
---
It's under torsos. I use XO1 for my heavy gunner build and I purchase the mods on the enclave bunker.
---
Scumbag weeklong event:
---
You can theoretically earn 11 treasury notes an hour, daily exchange limit stays at 20.
---
PS I scrip every bloodied weapon I get because of players like this, especially the good ones ü§ó umadbro?
---
Ok. So far I have Blocker, Fire Proof, and Nerd Rage  maxed. I got a full set of Unyielding/AGI heavy BOS combat armor (2*). I‚Äôm aiming for Radicool and maybe Evasive since I have nearly 400 ap.
---
Do you know where do can get it for my excavator, without it I can‚Äôt move so until my storage is good then I‚Äôm using excavator, I‚Äôll be using ultracite tomorrow hopefully
---
Question for you.....so I barely died throughout the fight but of course....he‚Äôs down to maybe 5 more shots....I‚Äôm at full health and something killed me.  I didn‚Äôt get to loot the big guy.  What kind of loot does he yield?  I‚Äôm 1 for 2 so far and didn‚Äôt even get to loot him .   The third time I tried, they for some reason put me in there alone even though I saw players there and it wasn‚Äôt full.  I bailed on that one lol
---
You ever mess with the Katana you get from the Daedra mission in Whiterun? Permanent, never loses charge healing sword. Gets better and better the more friends you kill with it.
---
That is how it works now. You must finish within 10mins or it goes poof.
---
Playing on gamepass on pc and this is still an issue. Bullshit
---
Edit: after trying multiple fixes on this thread, logging in to a ton of different worlds, trying things in different orders, even finding a world where the doors were closed and still having no success, i submitted a ticket to Bethesda. 
---
I decided to try one last time before bed and went in a new world, shot a scorched and entered the building, decided fuck it, went upstairs, started shooting scorched, and heard a voice. There were 2 other players in the building. Upon discovering this I ran thru the building, passed the other players, and dropped in the hole in the floor, made my way to the lab, inserted the T cell first, got on the terminal, and voila. Analyzed the blood sample. Probably fucked it for those guys but I have been trying for an hour to complete it. 
---
It's fucking ridiculous. And of course as soon as i submit a ticket I solve the issue. It really is ridiculous that this game is still such a shitshow after how long it's been out.
---
You‚Äôll need peeps, if you have amigos I‚Äôd make a date cuz he soaks up damage and I haven‚Äôt had enough help on my runs
---
It's counted as alcohol in the game files so I doubt it. Show damage numbers and use one. Then do it again with both. I'd like to know as well. Teslas with this if they stack would be nuts.
---
It sucks, but it makes sense.
---
[found this](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Excavator_emergency_protocols)
---
Floating in space forever...just, why?
---
Nice
---
Thanks a million for the advice dude, sorry if my armor choice is unusual, I just enjoy walking. Heh
---
You aren't wrong, but from a lore perspective it makes sense that some vaults  would stay closed to run their experiments for many more years.
---
Ooh forgot evasive. It's great. Barbarian is another good one. Doesn't even need to be maxed nor Evasive as you'll hit it's cap quickly with full Uny.
---
They gave us V.A.T.S Unknown before fixing things what would change?
---
I disagree, 800lbs is way TOO low for this kind of games where grinding and hoarding is more than normal (so is trading), almost necessary and I don't think people love to just every day go and find screws, aluminium or spring, etc. because you need at least 40-60 to repair all your weapons and armor.  Same with unneeded weapons, what would you do once you get the (very low too) 1000 scripts limit and also stash limit? Never pick up new weapons?
---
If there were chainsaw skins, Bethesda could have more of my american dollars.
---
I shall laugh the day bloodied builds get nerfed and drink their salty tears!
---
Ah I don‚Äôt think I ever finished that quest... I hated killing friendly named NPCs so once I got the sword I just never finished it.
---
(I think maybe eventually I might have found a nameless respawning NPC to do it with? Or I just killed someone and revived them in the console over and over, I‚Äôm not quite sure.)
---
All good mate. It's about having fun in the game. I select armor and gear for asthetics first then functionality after. lol
---
That sucks üôÅ
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Oh, apologies to you captain very correct online. I started playing the BETA in October 2018. So, you got me, it was really one year and 10 months. Way off the 2 year mark. Feel better?
---
The thing is that legendary big guns with the explosive legendary effects are extremely deadly (even ones that aren‚Äôt legacy). I have some and love them. But I also have a TS Fat man that is completely useless (even tho the Pip-Boy makes the damage look nearly 4k), especially in the face of them. It‚Äôs just upsetting honestly. Explosive heavy weapons were good if not great in previous fallout games, now they made non-explosive heavy weapons great and explosive heavies trash.
---
I mean, they didnt even finish adding most of the weapons. Anything not ported from 4 has like, 2 or 3 possible mods, if any.
---
¬ß0¬ß - woo
---
Still stuck on this
---
According to my experience the weight reduction only applies to the basic weapon weight, not to the mods.
---
So I suspect the furious ain't modded yet and the other one is. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah, I'm sorry,  I had a bad day and I didn't mean to take it out on random ppl on the internet. Hoping you and your wife have fun playing together.
---
Wasn‚Äôt that effect actually +10 damage points and not +10%? I might be thinking of something else...
---
(I remember there was some effect in the game that did that, says it adds a percentage but actually adds the number instead.)
---
On another note I‚Äôve always thought this effect needed a buff to like 20% or something, cause if you got it on a gun that‚Äôs primarily used in vats it was just useless. (Or removed altogether.)
---
*Insert annoyed bird meme here*
---
FIIIIINALLYYYY! SOMEONE WITH THE GUTS TO HELP!
---
üòÇ
---
Don't join the noob side!
---
I always  decorate her side of the room with the space kitten and untouchable stuff
---
Ok thanks
---
Ok food build
---
Usual random 3 stars so far. Got a 2 shot explosive pipe pistol today (forget 3rd affix) might play around with that later to see if it's a viable weapon. 
---
Not getting to loot the corpse isn't as bad as not getting to finish the event for that loot pool similar to SBQ. I got a cursed pickax, but forget of that's a body drop or an event completion drop when you escape. 
---
Actually now that I think about it I've only been able to loot that final chest once due to glitches or groups  being severely undermanned for the task and failing to complete. 
---
It's been a poor track record overall tho.
---
I should be capable of soloing him but need to find a better weapon to do so.
---
I also deeply recommend getting amount and stims sorted as soon as you log in to not be caught unprepared if a nuke drops.
---
Was on one map where they nuked him 3 times in a row almost without giving us enough time to even finish the previous fight.
---
They need to stagger those out better for the rest of the servers sake.
---
Oh yeah just remembered,  got a nocturnal lead pipe too. XD
---
But even then all the cursed weapons drop at their Max level.
---
This happened to me. For me, I had to stop doing the dialogue that says "No need to pay me" for both sides. Every day, pick a different dialogue choice on turn in. But not the one that says you do it for free. Turning in Queen Mirelurk meat was the same. Had to stop doing that all together. Photo Opportunity broke completely. Stopped doing that one as well. Also, wait for about 10 seconds before you talk to them to turn it in, to let them load. Also DO NOT SKIP ANY DIALOGUE ON TURN INS
---
A fair point.
---
Your best bet is doing the dailies for both factions. It's going to be a slow grind - prepare to hear about a stolen water cooled bone saw for dozens of times from a bloke called Ward if you want to increase Settler reputation. 
---
Raiders have two dailies "retirement plans" or "importance of communication" - talk to someone called Rocksy, or Wren, to activate them. They usually start when you travel to Crater. One is fetching radio parts and the other is tracking down former raiders.
---
Also, when you travel around a bit, you might stumble into some fights, raiders vs.environment, settlers vs.environment, or raiders vs. settlers. Helping a faction out in these fights and talking to the survivors gives you a little positive reputation for that faction. 
---
In ohio river adventures dock, there is also an unmarked raider daily where you can sell various mirelurk products to a raider called Blackeye. She gives you a tiny bit of raider rep. Hope any of this helps!
---
Same here
---
Lol not even, I can one hit most things as an instigator with full health. Way more versatile and I get an extra 20% damage than bloodied. Not one bit of food at my camp either unless you count my vendor.
---
Foundation, Craters, and Overseer‚Äôs Home.
---
Rocksy &amp; Wren @ Craters for Raiders
---
Ward @ Foundation
---
Davenport @ Overseer‚Äôs Home
---
Look at Data in pipboy; under Daily are the quests that will pop up for rep when you visit the areas
---
Run the daily quests for Ward in Foundation and Rocksy/Wren in Crater. Always choose to donate your efforts. Do Davenports daily picture quest and give the pictures to the opposing faction instead of Davenport. For example if you took pics of Crater, offer those pics to Ward gratis.   
---
There are 2 small raider faction quests at Ohio River Adventure (I may be a little off on the name, sorry) give them  mirelurk queen meat and defend the water purifier.
---
I could not figure out where he was supposed to be from
---
Maybe have a couple of high level helpers that spawn when you start attacking. The helpers attack and try to distract you while the treasure hunter runs away.
---
Thank you so much! It‚Äôs weird tho I go to the creator all the time to turn in gold and I never see any quest I can do! Who do I talk to st the creator brother?? Thanks so much!
---
I just do not understand why someone that level would behave in such a manner. Level 70 suggests they've been playing for a while, so why act the asshole?
---
I‚Äôm now a bloodied build. I‚Äôm surprised she let my probably glowing ass anywhere near her lol
---
Ahaha anti-bloodied movement in the making üòÖ
---
I played guild wars 2 for years, and every new content release came with it's own currency so that players would play the new map/content to acquire it.  Makes sense from a game design standpoint imo.  
---
Many people here are probably sitting on a healthy supply of bullion and could immediately buy any new gear without participating in new content on the map if bullion is used for future new gear.  A new currency would encourage participation in new content, and if that content was well designed group content, that would be great for the game.
---
I love everything except for the ‚ÄúSeason Rank‚Äù thing... Because that assumes you might have to complete the legendary run on each character to get the unlocks for each of them and that sounds like a horrible idea...
---
Legendary Run is fine as is with the rewards account wide. It was way too much work to finish the run even once, no way I‚Äôd be able to do it four more times for my other characters.
---
Thank you I‚Äôm going to overseers home now!! Thanks man! What settlement to I get points for if I go to the overseer‚Äôs home? Raiders or settlers?
---
Raiders only have two dailies on the first time, or after you've skipped a full day of dailies.
---
I've always wondered how they reproduce. Have they become hermaphrodites? Or are there bull ones that we haven't seen.
---
I'm down , I'm a little drunk but if you can get the nukes launched I'll join. I'm lvl 103 and run a shotty build if that matters.
---
Lol all good bro! I‚Äôm level 94! Idk how to launch a nuke bro /: but if you do let‚Äôs do it!
---
Its a loss of raw damages but not DPS, as your weapon is now automatic. Ammo management is worse though  even if you still allmost one shot everything if you have magic shotgun
---
This. It took me almost two weeks to get Fixer plan at a reasonable price. Still looking for an instigating/furious ffr lmg or .50 and still no luck.
---
Yes. Those children npc's in past fallout games make my ears bleed.
---
I would like some more "tactical" boss fights. At the moment they just have huge health pools (or damage reduction, not sure). ACP have the spawns that adds another factor to it at least. Would be cool if a boss needed different builds to perform different jobs. I know getting a team together would be problem, could have a public team with slots for the different roles say you need 8 out of 16 roles to be filled.
---
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/id66t3/why_do_i_feel_more_tanky_in_pa_with_bloodied_than/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) for the 90% reduction I was taking about.
---
Why you salty dude! The build is not the issue, people just don‚Äôt wanna do it regardless of their build!
---
I play bloodied and I always grab one or even two conduit AND get to shoot the sheepy, sure I spam stims for the next little bit after but yeah..people are different and build has nothing to do with it. (Maybe a little but not always) :)
---
My thoughts exactly, but then I still remember back when I was only level 20, some level 80 came to my camp and started destroying it for no reason, to what I couldn't do anything for.
---
Now Im level 400 and I like giving random players low levels random legendaries just because they remind me of myself when I was just a pup
---
Preach it, brother.
---
I'm not surprised. From everything I've heard, it's like SBQ but on steroids...but at least not flying around lol
---
I think I'd probably have to run some magic weapons for damage if anything
---
Choosing to donate my efforts caused me to receive no rep for over a week. These quests are very badly broken. Queen Mirelurk meat never worked for me. Photo Opportunity worked then outright broke.
---
**Bethesda:**  
---
"Raid bosses?  
---
Raid... BoSses?  
---
BoS?  
---
You want more BoS?  
---
We got you, fam!"
---
Awesome thanks so much! I‚Äôm going to overseers home rn do you think it will give me the picture quest?
---
I want a secret Brahmin level
---
No.  It only goes off when it wants too.
---
I have judged for voice acting auditions in the past, so I have experience with judging the quality of professional voice acting. Can confirm, his accent is WAY off and laughable, and I'm not even from Pittsburgh. Found it strange considering most of the other voice acting done in the game is great.
---
Nope
---
I don't know either lol but if we can get someone to I'm definitely up for a grind.
---
Dammit you guys are on to something
---
For sure if you wanna play regardless I‚Äôm on rn!
---
If you do not have the camera yet, you will get a quest to find one. As soon as you finish that you are good to go.
---
Nope that's pretty much it. Luck doesn't add any more chance of it boosting.
---
Remember, remember the 10th of September, the Purveyor‚Äôs sale will be hot‚Ä¶
---
Oh ok thanks man!!!
---
Who says they were being hostile and not just love tapping you?
---
That is really awful. I am sorry your quests were so buggy.
---
Plot twist: he 1 shot earle.  üòÆ
---
Thanks for the info man!!!
---
Sadly no. Some people think increased luck will buff the chances but I'm pretty sure it's just a myth. Sometimes you'll get lucky and it'll activate several times in a row. Others, you might not get anything 20 times in a row(I was crafting orbital strike missiles and not a single dupe lol).
---
True, I should have just returned the "love tap" with my gauss minigun
---
That one sticks to me till this day. Put a mask on and go knife everyone in a virtual sim. Crazy.
---
Ha.
---
I have a camera! Thanks again bro have a good one!
---
I would still prefer they fix the ai and pathing so it becomes defense. Hide and seek with molerats is so tedious.
---
They have a mixed bag. Some of their cast is all-star, but other choices have been super questionable. Skyrim is egreious with re-using the same 6 voice actors, and the children in that game are GOD awful. Their older games have some pretty damn bad voice acting too. For the most part though, the actors and actresses they have picked are talented and well respected voice work professionals.
---
Level 70? One shot Earle? Very doubtful, but that's probably what he told his boys. You know, to stop being the bitch in the group.
---
Bloodied build here, I wait until 3 people become conduits, then I sneak and shoot the imposter sheepsquatch 5-6 times and it dies. 
---
Event takes less than 5 minutes when people know what they are doing.
---
I laugh even harder when you realize that all damage was nerfed not just bloodied, and that bloodied is still the highest damage build there is. Bloodied will quite literally be the only build that can efficiently kill anything. You would know this if you would bother to go to PTS.
---
You're the one missing out on whatever you would get from trading it.  It's not like you have a monopoly on bloodied weapons.
---
Happened to me once before as well hate that crap
---
I wish there was a setting to switch Ally background chatter off.
---
Yeah true, I meant one of those two dailies will start.
---
Seriously I hate it
---
They are. I've gotten several copies of the Knight CPT paint. Just dont learn them when you get them. It removes them from your loot pool
---
 I have over 3,000 hours and know players with much more. Wish someone would nuke my CAMP, it's 350% of legal budget limit so a big fat target for you. Would take me 5 seconds to repair all though and I have enough resources to do it hundreds of times. Way past end game for me, def not up for another legendary run.
---
I have games with 1,500 and 4,000 hours played and they still entertain albeit not every day and not for more than half an hour at a time.
---
Bethesda would like to claim the game has endless content but nah.
---
Honestly been trying to figure out how to get rid of becket for like 3 months
---
Fucking cry more... Jesus...
---
Life giver is useless now.
---
I know this but the bloodied guys seem to cry about this the hardest. Wait till it gets nerfed more later or they nerf unyielding. 
---
I actually like the dmg nerf. The damage ranges between builds is tighter, should make balancing easier.
---
Bunch of pussies....
---
That's why when I'm waiting for the timer I scope the room and if I see most lower levels than me or at least 300, I bail, like you said, waste of ammo and aids, if I want to solo I go to my private server.
---
Unfortunately it is most likely healing factor causing this issue for you.  Until they fix it you might want to make sure you don't have that mutation.
---
No, not for heavy gunners, pa is better
---
darn thank you though
---
If they had a named legendary Drill, it should be Anti-Armor.
---
Ive grabbed all 3 pylons spammed the tons of stimpaks i have and pull out an explosive laser to melt the imposter. Ive tried to leave plenty of health on her for others but everyones to slow or getting killed left and right. I give it 2-3 minutes before i step in. This event can be such a cluster most of the time that its not worth an almost 5+ minute fight for a fedora.
---
I mean, what exactly were you thinking?
---
Make sure the stuff you had for sale is still in your vending machines. Happened to me the other night i got disconnected and when i got back into a server all my machines were empty.
---
with the luck I'm having just getting one I don't think that's going to be a problem. lol
---
Unless I‚Äôm mistaken, you‚Äôre asking if there‚Äôs a female version of the outfit?
---
All outfits in the game can be worn by both male and female characters. The outfits don‚Äôt change appearance. 
---
There‚Äôs no ‚Äúmale blood eagle jacket‚Äù and then a separate ‚Äúfemale blood eagle jacket‚Äù
---
Was it on pc scott723
---
nothing specific, I was just curious if I could get some synergy going with other cards.
---
After Meat Week ended and I got the last drop I needed from ACP, immediately I just felt a sense of boredom wash over me when playing 76 and I wanted to go play another game...
---
That‚Äôs why I think the special events should happen on the weekend. Fasnacht Friday, Meat Cook Saturday, Treasure Hunter Sunday. Gives players something to look forward to/do on the weekend.
---
That you can.  Namely ammosmith
---
I See the love for the drill here too! So how about we add to this suggestion: New Settler sub quest for a Named Legendaries. Have the Raiders quest yield a Named Legendary Chainsaw and the Settlers Yield a Name Legendary Drill.
---
Because the event is active in the PTS right now to test out the new changes and new rewards
---
Be nice if it can message you that your CAMP turrets were blown up and your camp is getting trashed by Super Mutants/Liberators/Scorched.
---
You can't have your perfectly preserved pie and eat it too.
---
I mean I've run it a few times with lower levels but I typically don't revive players that are under the recommended level for the event as I'd end up reviving them every couple of minutes (same with Scorched Earth) but I just couldn't believe that all 4 of them bailed on the event.
---
I went and gave them all good thumbs downing to after to make myself feel better.
---
Yea now the endgame is just grinding for resources and better guns
---
I've never failed the event, not all too hard.
---
Wait wat
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_can%27t_have_your_cake_and_eat_it
---
I've run it a few times and only failed once (because everyone else left the event) but I wouldn't say it's that difficult. He is a bit bullet spongy but it's definitely doable.
---
I died and i couldnt respawn i had to quit and despite still being on the team i couldnt get back into the mine. Ive seen players disappear from the event and its buggy so not all are quitters
---
My own fault for not realizing sooner. But yesterday finally got the ammo machine on my main. Working on getting the Hold for the Gauss Shotty.
---
Been happening on Xbox all day too
---
As I said, might be some bad luck. I do have a small sample size. I was at an encryptid the other day that failed also and that‚Äôs never happened before. I keep getting put in worlds with a lot of low lvl peeps
---
I could probably kill earle by myself but I haven't had the chance to try yet.  Vampire's miniguns for life
---
My biggest issue has been the psychotic damage done by everything, and that extends to most things outside of the event too. I'm not a bloodied build, so I'm at full health, yet somehow my level 103, full T-51 or T-60 clad self, gets one shot by **E V E R Y T H I N G**, it's fucking baffling. Yeah yeah wendigos have pointy claws and shit but nothing lower than a boss or a behemoth should even he able to dream about Piercing power armor, just outright, not pissy roided up crickets, not whiny anemic cannibals, Not extra crispy zombies, and especially not cocky Mr gusties fifty three levels below me, and none of them should come close to taking me down in his two or three shots. Just, like, what the fuck bethesda? I'm beginning to wonder if my games just fucked on my end because I've never seen anyone else experience this tier of damage intake from such common enemies.
---
Oh yeah true... I guess for now let‚Äôs just stick with the Bloodied shotgun build
---
I checked the statuses several times before and after of all participants. Idk how they were dead and still in it.
---
Aw, went from memory on the Sheepsquatch Staff on a character without all the mods. I remembered it being equal to a baseball bat of all things, but yeah you got it right. Now I need to go figure out why my high Agility melee character is getting identical damage with sledgehammers and super sledges but others aren't. I swear this game sometimes actually make sense. Not now tho.
---
You can't actually display it anyway.
---
Well shit. Hrm thanks.
---
*tips Fedora*
---
Hmm thanks didn‚Äôt know that was part of the Problem. Tried most stuff like not being in sneak, putting away my weapons etc
---
I haven't played PTS just yet, but I have it downloaded if you still need them?
---
Bruh the fucking established lore has been decimated. Also the way we are constantly nuking and mining all of Appalachia, it absolutely makes sense that some vaults would pop open under the pressure.
---
There's some "cheaty" mods but also some nice ones. Like TZ's Map.
---
[PC] I've got two if you want, DM me and we can sort out a trade?
---
If you do play the PTS I would love some Front, Back, and side pictures of them
---
If the Legendary Run is anything to go by then I wouldn't be surprised if this stays in the public release.
---
We shouldn't be getting crap like player icons after SCORE level 50, I get it's to mix up the rewards but some of the later rewards just feel crap!
---
I think they are just a folder variant with nothing more special.
---
A mailbox would definitely be awesome to have I myself love looking at people being very creative with their camps. I myself have a pretty neat camp that I put endless hours into constantly upgrading it with new things. I'm on Xbox sadly so you can't see it but I do have a video here if you wanna rate my camp. Keep in mind this was about 3 months ago so my camp is different now like my shop area is now the red Rocket garage plus my display room is bigger now and In the video it's empty as this was around the time an exploit was happening with them that Bethesda had to disable them. Here's a video of my camp I took 3 months ago üòÇ

---
Yeah that happens. You just lose your flux when you die after a queen
---
Tbf, my understanding is that fo76 was not made by the main Bethesda Team, it's mostly the B-team in Austin, but I could be mistaken.
---
Huh. Every time, and I mean every time, I haven‚Äôt taken it upon myself to KO the imposter as soon as I have a shot, the event has failed. You looting the body &lt; the event succeeding. 
---
Also, my bloodied ass does become a conduit, when needed, by spamming stims.
---
 It sounds like you‚Äôre unwilling to admit that bloodied builds have value and are bitter because you feel some sort of false superiority for picking the road less traveled. Maybe you could switch over to a better build and get that kill for your 1 star legendary drop oh wait you can‚Äôt because you always scrip the bloodied pieces you get. Grow up or shut up.
---
Both endgame bosses good gravy
---
I bought a fixer plan for something like 10k a month ago and have yet to see one drop from the purveyor. What are the odds for that weapon?
---
Upvote for Graham Chapman
---
A little bit. The rude reply was unnecessary though. I wasn't rude in my comment.
---
There was before when the raid was active, can't imagine they would remove it.
---
But you also sometimes get both, a player who doesn't know wtf he has so he sells bobbleheads for 500 caps and rare plans for 5000 lol.
---
Did you ever report back to davenport? Have never heard of anyone having issues with it before
---
I use Scorch beast Steaks to tank the pylons while being below 20% health. So keep your ill mannered ass in your pite hole, complaints are important and all but doesn't give the right to be a dick
---
Yea i did. I just had to fast travel there and it seems to be working. Guess will found out tomorrow.
---
Did you google it?
---
Yup.. when u die u lose ur flux.. that‚Äôs y run to ur stash box as fast as possible.. lol
---
Hate the colossus one cause sometimes they nuke it wrong and r stuck in the middle of the blast and die from radiation.. now I got to be carrying around a hazmat suit with me.
---
Yeah with all the rep dailys I had to fast travel and wlak a few steps for them to proc. They hardly ever showed on my map
---
What a waste... looting the wendigos that spawn make this event worth it.
---
It took me months to get all the paints. It's a brutal grind.
---
That's why I said first I wasn't aimed at every person that plays it, like im sure there is people that don't run bloodied that do the same but it's meant to be a group effort not just wait for someone to do all the work.
---
Same. Havent had it pop up since furst few weeks of wastelanders
---
Incorrect. You can prime them. You can not make the ultracite. Ultracite lasers and gating lasers have different stats and mods from standered laser Ed and gattling lasers.
---
Well it wasn't aimed at you then... I literally said that first to avoid people commenting this.
---
Because
---
Its
---
Garbage 
---
Has been since It came out, nothings changed since.
---
They stole our money.
---
Well if you contribute I wasn't pointing anything at you
---
I don't want to be a tank.  
---
I prefer being a Stealth Sniper who can kill things before they know I'm there.
---
That really isn't the point though.     The friends list  should work.  Period.  And right now it isn't.
---
*scans thread for any mention of shotguns* 
---
Welp, Guess me and my double barrel aren't considered high tier, even though I can solo the Wendingo Colossus with it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It doesn't need to be great, awesome or function as intended.
---
Ah right I forgot about charity purchases
---
Cigarillo would be a cool addition too.
---
Yes. One camp, it was on top of my roof and disappeared. I accidentally lost my camp trying to ‚Äúmove‚Äù it  (I thought my camp would stay as long as I was still in the building circle)
---
I didn‚Äôt realize what had happened to it (losing my whole camp kind of made me not care about where I had misplaced it) until recently I was certain I sat it on top of an extractor and it just fell through. I deleted the extractor and there it was. 
---
Tldr; try checking underneath stuff that it could have fall through (IE foundation, extractor, etc)
---
Whether you're an arsehole and how much you've played have little correlation. I've seen arseholes at all levels.
---
Graham, why can't anyone seem to get your name right?
---
*It's Grahm. Ffs.*
---
Man I've had it for well over a year now and still havnt tried it haha. Maybe I need to give it a go
---
The Davenport and faction dailies only pop up when you're close to each location, as in fast-travel there and take a few steps towards the location.
---
I agree 100 percent.   When I raise this issue, the most common answer I get is that  I should   constantly be remodeling/ rebuilding my camp.   I mean, that basically means  constantly grinding for camp items that I will eventually scrap (to make room for the new camp items).  So the whole point is grinding for new camp items that you will have to scrap?
---
&gt; Doubt most of you will be around after the nerf anyway 
---
Lol. That's adorable. A lot of these players have lived through the travesty that's been this game's existence and you think middling damage nerfs (in terms of gameplay effectiveness, not just numbers) is going to keep them away?
---
They'll cry but they'll do so whilst still grinding out the game.
---
If you take photos of crater and give them to foundation you can get settler rep.
---
If you want raider rep take foundation photos and give them to the raiders.
---
Hey I agree and I like you're the only person that hasn't taken offence when I clearly started it with "this isn't aimed at every bloodied player" upvote for you
---
It's never too late with any build. All it takes is levels so it could be a very long time depending on what changes you need to make to make the most of it but really the only prerequisite to start bloodied is gear and low health. The rest can come with time.
---
I kill it as soon as I see it because the vast majority of people that show up to that event cant do any damage. I‚Äôll grab all three pylons as soon as they‚Äôre active, then I‚Äôm looking for the sheep. If you can‚Äôt hit it before I kill it, fix your shitty ass build.
---
I sell all my plans for 10 caps regardless or rarity or value. They are taking up room in my stash and I just want to be rid of them.
---
Bender: *I found out what makes me happy. It's not friends- it's things.*
---
As long as you have a STASH full of things you don't need friends.
---
Mf is just mad his high health build hits 7s on Earle.
---
They've always been glitchy because the drone can get stuck on some piece of terrain or get aggroed by a random mob. But four in a row seems like worse-than-usual luck...
---
Just add mask mechanics I feel like it would work
---
A decent bloodied build can solo that event, dude‚Äôs just mad he can‚Äôt hit it hard enough to loot it before someone capable of killing it does just that.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt deal the biggest damage,I‚Äôm a sneaky rifleman
---
That's your problem right there. With all due respect to you, you're essentially dead weight.
---
ACP is very much a DPS event. If you don't have at least 1-2 decent DPS dealers, it's very tough to complete.
---
Your character can still do work though. However, once you get some damage into Earle to secure his loot, your focus should be on the spawns to keep them off the main damage dealers. It's far more helpful to keep the spawn away from the heavy hitters than you actually contributing any damage to Earle himself.
---
Anyhow, better luck with your group comp for future events.
---
Finally someone with the guts to help.
---
You might be able to get away with deploying a camp and then placing an ally. I'm not sure if that will work though.
---
Let it moo the way the Colossus plushie roars!
---
&gt;I assume they'll leave exterior camps untouched and add vault/bunker doors that lead to the instanced section.
---
This is what I am hoping too, but I am concerned because I have yet to hear Bethesda say that this is actually how it will work.
---
I'm learning that with Bethesda, ***what they don't say i***s far more telling than what they actually say.
---
Case in point was the colossal problem event.  They kept putting out articles about patch 21 and, in the same article, they said that Colossal problem was up and running in the test servers and they were putting the finishing touches on it.  This led many people to assume that the event would be live on the day the patch dropped, but ***Bethesda never actually said that.*** Sure enough, it wasn't available on the day the patch dropped.
---
The discussion about the instanced interiors  reminds me of how that situation unfolded.
---
Griefing events is the new meta
---
100% agree. Bethesda made heavy builds fun for the first time and for that I love them. Except explosive heavies lol
---
I can pat myself on the back for getting that challenge done when it was 22 workshops
---
I'd just be happy to have ED-E back...
---
Do you have a BE Gatling Plasma? That thing shreds like Hurricane Laura lmao
---
Yeah guy, don‚Äôt need your advice on my role, I get where my character fits into a hard event. As I said I don‚Äôt  deal the max dps but thanks I guess. My whole point was people weren‚Äôt showing up to the event. I can get him to a lil over half dead but the way I play obviously needs other people to do the major events like this one or sbq.
---
What would you suggest instead?
---
Shut up Meg!
---
Evil cultists play throughs work great in Fallout 4 Nuka-World more specifically the Disciples. Don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve played it but just thought I‚Äôd let you know
---
Having food at your camp doesn't make you a "food build" haha
---
And berkserker‚Äôs, pistols, rifleman, and mutant‚Äôs. But nope. They‚Äôre nerfing everything under the sun.
---
Even more brutal when you watch the youtube videos about it where they're getting 2 in a row and saying "It took me a whole 2 weeks to get them all".  lol
---
It's possible because not all the lady were killed so there are still 2 or 3 of Them.
---
People don't like the fact that She Always repeat the phrases on the Nightmare
---
Probably too hard to do, but being able to select photos from the games folder and rotate your gallery would be good.
---
I must have a few thousand pbotomode pics and screenshots combined...üòÑ
---
I'm sorry for the confusion, with my one braincell left from not being in school for half a year I did the most smartest thing that came to mind search it on YouTube. I found the video and then saw the word MOD so if anyones pissed off that's okay just like nuke my camp or something like that.
---
In my mind the two you mentioned and serendipity are the absolute bare minimum.
---
For me marsupial and speed demon are a must no matter the build.
---
Since bloodied is about dealing damage, bloodied mess is essential for me (but not everyone) and whatever relevant weapon damage perks. Less critical but still important are other damage buffs like adrenaline or tenderiser.
---
Radicool also synergises with high rads and melee (for damage).
---
Yes but there is an automatic training and she was in the army to be able to become an astronaut (as also happens in reality).
---
Alternatively it could be called : The Top Brahmin
---
Some of the most fun I've had in this game has been using my instigating pole hook... and I had no problem killing things in one hit of my power attack
---
Pretty sure there is a dialogue tree that allows him to be released
---
You‚Äôre mad that you didn‚Äôt get carried through someone else‚Äôs ACP because you didn‚Äôt click the event fast enough and got paired up with 3 other people who were also trying to get carried?  How sad.
---
Brahmunculous or a four headed super brahmin called Cerberus
---
It's easy not to die that much, unless you don't do stealth. If no stealth, I'd try running to the tunnel and let the wendigos chase you in there to pick them off. And observe Earle's behavior and mob count. If you just straight up go in attacking each time desperately, you miss opportunities from keeping distance and doing mob control. Spend more time plotting your attack instead of having the punishment timer waste it, I think is the reinforcement at play. I think it is a great consequence for dying too much.
---
This event is an awesome opportunity to learn what you‚Äôre doing wrong build wise, play with it and figure it out. You‚Äôre at the mercy of who you spawn in with, and my experience so far has been that most people aren‚Äôt much help. You really need one person who can take him out solo to go in with you if that person isn‚Äôt you.
---
Yeah..... I‚Äôm mad. You looking for 15 seconds of fame or something?  No I‚Äôm not mad. In fact polar opposite. I don‚Äôt need carrying. I didn‚Äôt get to where I am because I let someone do the work for me. I simply wanted to make an awareness about a feature that would benefit others should it be noticed. But yeah I‚Äôm mad. 
---
Believe what helps you sleep at night. 
---
So long and thanks for all the fish ‚úåÔ∏èü§£ü§£ü§£
---
If you're dying so much that you get a 60s respawn timer, I'm guessing you're a bloodied build?
---
As you said yourself, it's difficult to make up for damage output if you're dead, so wouldn't the idea to be not be dead? I don't mean git good but just bumping up your health so you have more to work with.
---
There's no point being at max damage range if you're not alive to use it so give a little there and do overall more damage because you're alive to do so.
---
Can you deploy different Allies in captured workshops?
---
I am sure you already know to hold onto the duplicate technical datas so you get the better loot table. If you want good farming locations go with Vault Tech University and Sugar Grove (Including the black site around the back). If you do silo runs be sure to check the desks and filing cabinets there as well. You will need to invest a lot of time into this, but with the seasons content it is just another thing to do while you get on each day. Keep with it, It is a rare paint to see and one of the rare few you can share. Also you will want to learn the plans as when you get up to Paladin and Elder the armor gets a more polished look with red accents.
---
Most of the fun i've had during my gameplay is not exactly focusing what "the best is", but rather anything that fits and i like, a good example is my armor, i run a bloodied build and i've got a full set of unyielding, but they are all different armor types, leather, combat armor, etc, even most of my weapons aren't bloodied. And honestly, i would pat my head as i'm thankful i went that way, because otherwise as you said, it would boring to just farm and get stressed out to pick just a certain set of armor or weapon because it's "stronger" than what you like.
---
Sadly, from what I understand, the head writer for Fallout 76 is adamant that there were no survivors from the original questlines, that they all died. They even told a story about how the junior writers would try to find ways to insinuate that someone may have survived and he'd go back and make sure that person died specifically.
---
Don't have a link to that though, pretty sure it was in one of the interviews.
---
That said, I'd love to see the Order of Mysteries revived somehow.
---
It wasn‚Äôt a jacket though. I‚Äôm asking if it‚Äôs possible to get the outfit i described
---
Don't fast travel out, it says removing you from instance as you do, bad idea :-)
---
There‚Äôs a cursed harpoon gun too and a unique mining gas mask/helmet that covers your whole head, it looks pretty cool.
---
That‚Äôs actually a good point.  I typically peel off to cripple the Wendy‚Äôs legs so others can have some hits on them.  I do run a stealth build but I‚Äôm toying with stealth archer at the moment.  Plotting is exactly what I prefer.  I usually team with my son since we can VC but when you have 6 others doing...whatever it is they are doing it‚Äôs a little more difficult to focus objective.
---
Not bloodied.  Stealth Archer.  Last run we just did was a 6 man from level 61 up to lvl 450.  At one point every single person was dead with a timer lol.
---
So far done it with me and 2 others. There was a 4th person there AFK crouched -_-
---
How about instead making a Legendary card called "Groovy" that boosts chainsaws and shotguns when used together?
---
&gt; -How about legendary perks that boost existing gear? The Cowboy perk that boosts damage with lever actions, bowie knives, and single action revolvers.
---
Yes, please. I dream of the idea that sometimes in the future, we may get a perk synthesizer, like the ammo converter, but with perk recipes. Throw in one 1* perk card of each: Rifleman, Gladiator, Demolition Expert, -&gt; convert -&gt; 1* Cowboy Perk card.    
---
Same could be for plenty of others: Ghouls(Cannibal&amp; Rad perks), Indians( focus on archery), Thief(Lockpick&amp;Stealth) etc. It would make the game much more RPG-like and allow us to use multiple weapons, and not just one category.
---
In that case, forget about what I said. If you're full health and dying that often, I dunno dude :)
---
That's pretty funny that the whole party was on timers. Probably not at the time though.
---
Maybe don't click so fast? Idk, I question why they do this as well but I have never accidentally bought a plan I already had because I take my time. Same thing with the people who buy atom shop items on accident, stop rushing.
---
As a bloodied stealth commando, I can kill the adds faster than they can spawn in. Even though I'm not a conduit myself, I'm still providing a service to the event by keeping the enemy hoard under control and stopping everyone from being overwhelmed.
---
But if you just want to be nasty about it, then whatev's.
---
Bloody Mess is great but (maybe the nerf will change this) only necessary when facing Queen or Wendigo C because you already do soooo much damage. I prefer to run Ricochet in it‚Äôs stead for some added survivability.
---
This and other related problems have been happening for over a month now. In my experience it's a daily thing. Wait until tomorrow and it should be back to normal.
---
I think we've found the quest title.
---
Damn I tapped out as soon as I could cheese the atoms I had saved up to bypass it. I wanted to do what you did, and it did open me up to the NW challenges after a while. Started doing those kinda late into the board. NW gets better with more perks to build from. I won a game pacifist mode since I never felt like doing fill-team on.... I did play a lot of games aggressively, but lacked the fine-motor skills and clutch to engage combat successfully. If there wasn't so much PvE stuff I already do daily, like max the caps, bullion, and script limits, I'd have more time to buff up at NW... I thank The LR for pushing me into that mode. Not gonna do the next board cuz I proved my point once this time around. Not to mention, the fear of missing out thing is fun once a decade, but I find it to be potentially dangerous conditioning to play the game more. From getting addicted to legendary run, it made me more addicted to the game as a whole in general.
---
Maybe this will cause Bethesda to finally fix the photomode wall glitch.
---
Please no. The grind was too constant.
---
Definitely would love to see 3, though I imagine that'll require a change to the engine.
---
I've had a lot of similar ideas but with one other being that since pistols are lightweight and less bulky than other weapons that you get a movement speed advantage (or other weapons have a slight movement speed disadvantage) to reflect how nimble they are.
---
Just play 3 4 and new Vegas shhh 76 isn't real
---
nice. love it when there are a few in the mix. Good times when there are 3 about and scorched on the ground.
---
Surface to air is a good event for 2 -3 scorchbeasts as well.
---
Launched on the SBQ last nite...whole server showed up. people were so thrilled to fight queen again, i counted more than 10 lunchboxes opened. LOL
---
Id rather have a Grahm plushie that sings the meat week song tbh. 
---
But wouldnt chally either!
---
Shotguns have their own perk cards, and None of the melee cards work for chainsaws. So it would need it's own perk card to gain any damage boost.
---
There should be pictures of them floating around from the last time the Event happened.
---
Or at the very least go Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea
---
This game has one of the best settings in the series and has come a long way since release.
---
Depending on the offer
---
Or leave him alone with your mule...
---
And what about Bloodied is noob? Doesn't matter. You're just mad we need to use one sixteenth of the ammo you use. Assmad that we repair our armor once every two weeks. Stay mad lol.
---
&gt; have the bugs been fixed? 
---
LOL! C'mon dude, it's a Bethesda game. No, it's still quite buggy but still playable. Most of the time.
---
So long as you're not a natural hoarder or collector, you might find something worthwhile in the game.
---
I'd never buy it at full price though. Try to pick it up on a sale if you can.
---
I guess. But every bot and companion at your camp starts to get grating after a while.
---
There are but I can‚Äôt find any with the angles I need
---
I have over 800 now and nothing else i want to buy so they just stack. Waiting until i can buy Lunchboxes with bullion. Now that's worth it.
---
Ah okay. Was it ever viewable map wide? I feel like it was early on.
---
Most annoying ally to me, as soon as I finished her quest I destroyed her station with joy and put my dear Beckett back. His phrases are also cycled, but they're less annoying and more.. idk happy? He's always happy, unless you put your camp in toxic valley then he won't stop complaining about "everything smells like unwashed feet" xD
---
Get all the ammo you can and pump it into the ammo converter. That helps but other than getting the Super Duper perk, farming mats for making your own shells really is the only way.
---
Otherwise, get an alt weapon and use the shotgun for the more demanding enemies.
---
I usually find a load of shells just killing random scorched. Personally I'd just find someone selling them and buy them there's always camps on the map selling shells for 1c.
---
Go into Crayer. Head straight, past the bear leaning on a bus is foxy Roxxy with cool sunglasses and a cool tattoo on her mouth and chin wearing a tan duster coat and cowboy hat. Following the same path leads to a section of the space station you enter (no load screen) inside is Wren. Clown smudges on both eyes.
---
It might not help but also might help - try to restart the game. I once had missing items like doors ands floors and couldn't build anything instead, when I relogged it came back where it was, just a visual glitch. Not sure it will help with camp missing but it might.
---
Whats technical data for ?, dropped or deleted around 40 other day, only lvl 88, im fairly new.
---
Hilariously Parker Quinn is voiced by Emil Pagliurulo; lead writer (now design director)  and Boston native.
---
Not skipping dialogue on turn in is critical, doing every step right and then skipping dialogue on turn in has fucked the quest for me every single time. Good luck. Maxing rep takes about a month.
---
Moley Moley molies used to be my got to in the Ash Heap. Use something else to kill them then grab the shells, the majority use a shotgun.
---
If you visit someone's camp and she's there... visitors, again?... interesting. 
---
Stop bitching woman.
---
Well I'm not here 24/7 but this is the first time I've seen it mentioned on here. My reply was mostly a joke but it WILL have got some people to try it.
---
If it‚Äôs at least one thing is a really enjoyable fallout campaign in a great world now that they have added npcs.
---
I am enjoying the end game but even if I didn‚Äôt I‚Äôd still feel it was worthwhile
---
It‚Äôs weird how many people still follow this reddit just to hate on the game. It‚Äôs been two years, aren‚Äôt you exhausted?
---
1.2k hours in a game that you can get for like 30 bucks. Nah probably not.... /s
---
Yeah man I and many others really enjoy it. Would recommend giving it a go
---
They can't even fix the fast travel bug. Or the infinite respawn bug. Stop asking for outlandish shit. Demand actually fixing this game first.
---
They were then selling it on ebay for $50 per bottle.... I was hoping to get a six pack of them when I first heard they were being released so that my friends and I can drink them next time we got together. But I am not willing to pay $50 per bottle.
---
I like to beat off wendigos in my spare time.
---
I set up the car bomb at Momma Dolce's and the Giant Teapot ...
---
A whole 98? Bless.
---
Well I followed it a couple months ago when wastelanders was released made a new character beat it all the way through to the end and still wasn't satisfied so no im not "tired"
---
yes, start  using legendary modules and your scrip will be gone in 2 days xD but jokes aside, if you plan on crafting gold bullion weapons or armor you're gonna need a lot of them.
---
Yup, that is how I have things set up. Learned that the hard way from getting spawned in the middle of the nuke zone when fighting SBQ
---
It says known. Did that not give you a hint?
---
That's what I'm saying: a completely new card that boosts both together, but only when they're both equipped/favorited.
---
I had seen in a comment on a subreddit that probably 2 or 3 "initiates" weren't killed by either Shannon Rivers' daughter or the raiders. Probably either they ran away and won't come back or they got hot.
---
I usually take my time. Only time I've ever made an accidental in game purchase with in game currency. I was distracted at the time though. Constantly in a party chat with a few friends.
---
same on pc, I've waited and server hopped a lot of times, none so I just went and launched a nuke myself xD surprisingly a lot of people showed up and went fast.
---
We don't need another plushie stop asking for plushies..
---
God yes. Camp building is *such* a pain on alts when you want to use that stuff.
---
This...   Maybe a Level 10 is a bit too low for my scenario, but scale up to level 15 to 20 and you can get decent weapons.  Even before that, Bloodied shotguns and melee weapons are quite powerful for the level.
---
Also, as per the post above, it all depends on how low the scaling is for health, DR, etc. for the boss fights.  It could very well be that a level 20 will end up being able to take a larger percentage chunk of health per shot than a level 50+ with a similar, but higher level, weapon.
---
Saying that this is incorrect is premature, at best, because until we see it in action we won't know.  But I'll be willing to bet that there will be a sweet spot where a lower level can do more damage as a percentage than a higher level character.  The difference might not be that dramatic, but it might be enough to re-think how to handle boss fights in a group.
---
Simply reducing the wendigo spawns and the AoE hazards the less players there are would help
---
 **Brahmin cowlossus** haha good name, love it.
---
Why not
---
When you say "duplicate technical datas" do you mean the ones that stay in your pack after you turn them in?
---
Crimson and violet, some yellowcake and a lot of fluorescent flux can be harvested in usual nuke zone for SBQ, with double harvest from flora perk you can farm a lot in a short time. Make sure to tag overgrown sundew grove too.
---
I‚Äôm going insane with this friends list unsynced shit; ANDIEJJWIDUWNKDUNEKLQSIHDHWISU!!!!!
---
Make sure to use super duper too so you get that chance to craft double.  I used to use a pump and had the same struggles.  If you don‚Äôt have the caps to buy bulk, the high school has lots of plastic pumpkins. I also liked running west tek.  A lot of the super mutants dropped laser rifles which scrapped for a decent amount of plastic if you have scrapper perk.
---
The more interactable gimmick items the better
---
Depends, how quickly are you shooting? If you're using a full auto rifle sounds pretty good, if you're using something slow like. A hinting rifle not so much
---
About a shot every ¬Ω a second
---
I get it. But they would code it so it wouldn't stack with the other shot gun damage perks
---
Run uranium fever when ever it‚Äôs on (I know most people usually do for the scrip anyways)
---
Run another weapon that uses a different ammo type. Save you good weapon for harder enemies.
---
I run two different rifles on my commando to use different ammo types. I use a 10mm pistol in the forest area, again to save the good ammo.
---
Most people have stocks of it in their vendors.
---
Use the ammo converter, I know it‚Äôs slow and low yield, but it will help.
---
Get the ammo crafting appliance from the raiders, bit of a slog to get to allied, but again, this will help.
---
Also, use this to help with farming matts.
---

---
Yes, I had a few friends who would just sell them and did not understand what they were. They count towards what you turn in, but never leave the inventory.
---
There is so much more to do in the game than that single quest line though. Of course you weren't happy with it at that point, you barely scratched the surface
---
On PS4 it drops the framerate to a level that makes it unplayable. I've done probably 30+ events and just encountered my first Tesla experience and it was ruined. The guy was level 622 and was basically there to ruin it by the looks of his gameplay.
---
Sounds respectable then
---
Aight, how much do yoy usually do?
---
Cowlossus Brawlmin
---
If there's a Nuka World expedition for 76 I really hope that, since it's only been 26 years, the Nuka Quantum river will be actual quantum instead of being extremely diluted like it is in 4.
---
Is it hard to place foundation here?
---
They seem pretty good at bringing back old weapons since Wastelanders (plasma caster and industrial fist etc) so i'd be down for a classic Gauss Rifle
---
Maybe even lowering their level by 10-20 would be nice. I like the amount overall. Really steps it up from the queen fights.
---
They should make the raid vault an explorable dungeon. I would really like to learn the lore and read all the stories.
---
I didn't know about that, I've just been dropping them after every few I turn in.  Thanks for the info, wish I'd known earlier cause now I'm just sick to my stomach thinking about it. lol
---
Fair, but I had actually thought that it'd replace those. That way it frees up slots for other things.
---
A lot of people have this problem lately - I get this message yesterday evening, then it "fixed" itself, I have the same problem today's morning, but I didn't have time to wait to fix. Hope it'll be gone by today's evening, since I have agreed important trade.
---
Yeah that would work too
---
Well I'm normally firing away with my explosive gat plasma so it's hard to see the numbers haha. I'll need to start trying out different weapons to see what hits hardest, I just like never worrying about dying with my Ve haha
---
I‚Äôve been playing it for two months now on Xbox games pass, totally worth it if you like Fallout games if only for the story and world. You can ignore 99% of the multiplayer stuff if you want, but it‚Äôs surprisingly friendly and worth joining in.
---
I'd love to have the eye bot instead of the scrap collectron picking up junk
---
there's people who do way more and there's people who do way less. 
---
simple as that tbh
---
So youre assuming I just went straight through wastelanders without doing anything else in the game to level up at all right? Because I did so much more than that and still wasn't happy idk man maybe ill just be forever mad they for some reason didn't decide to just make a drop in drop out coop fallout or elder scrolls
---
 I've had level 250 players nuke my camp simply because they could so yeah that's very true.
---
Yes please. I just want a vampires chainsaw. If it's 90%rw that would be awesome.
---
2 years?   The game was released in Nov 2018 so you are 3 months early....
---
There are still bugs, there is more content, sever stability is fine but we still get frozen screens and blue-screens, and the PS4 is laggy compared to the PC (i.e. crafting any amount of items takes a lot of time, things are really laggy in Nuke zones, etc.).  Hopefully the PS5 will fix some of the lag in the game that's cause by being CPU and graphics bound.
---
fissure prime
---
I know haha. No clue why you'd spend time looking at stuff to deal with a game you don't like. I feel like there's better uses of your time
---
Yes please! Need something to repair my camp and heal up stuff to full.
---
Yup, almost happy about that. Also I am saving on Fallout first, i was really considering getting it for the scrap box. That will have to wait.
---
Farm black water mine the mole miners have a lot of shotguns
---
Now you have piqued my interest.. 
---
What've you heard to suggest this?
---
Also Make it squirt toxic milk at people like the scorchbeast Queen sprays toxic urine at players!
---
Vampiric one. Let's name it Stimsaw
---
Lol, love tangent conversations. So what you are saying is  that If Bethesda was smart....... they would have a single, 5 cost legendary perk cards that would replace the three 3 cost perk cards for damage boost.
---
While you're mostly right, levels do not really matter; especially after Legendary Run when suddenly everyone is 150. Also the higher level, the more fun.
---
Instantly gone, yes. I actually never spend time in Workshops. I dont use them, exept for daylies.
---
 I was just over encrumved and decided to sort it out where I was
---
I did bots on parade for the first time yesterday, I assumed they‚Äôre friendly to you so they don‚Äôt just target you instead of the bots. But the scorched still attack the sonic generator in Line in the Sand so... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I play on Xbox and people use Tesla all the time never experienced it before personally but unlucky and understandable
---
on xbX
---
8 Earle runs. no issues yet.
---
Nice way to grind out an easy bit of extra caps
---
Considering all that haopened this year, i wasnt quite sure at first if this is ingame or IRL.
---
Like how we all got screwed with demolition expert......100% boost dropped to 60%.........
---
Depends on what kind of weapon it is ...
---
Hell Riflegaming nukes players camps for content so even being a Youtuber doesn't save you from being an arsehole.
---
I guess? I've only tangentially followed the Legendary Perks discussions here. I don't have enough time to really give the PTS my full attention, so my info is secondhand. My thought was similar to the old (NV) perk "cowboy", that boosted damage on several things because they were all Cowboy-related weapons.
---
I‚Äôve got my eye on you.
---
Wholeheartedly agree - we need explorable vaults.   
---
So far the only ones I know of in Adventure mode are Vault 76 (Well until you leave..), VTU's training Vault and Vault 79  as part of Wastelanders
---
And I suppose the Enclave bunker at The Whitespring could be added to the list even though its not part of the Vault-Tec program
---
If you liked FO4 and considering you can purchase it for $10 used, yes.
---
Who is Graham?
---
I only know a Grahm.
---
More ammo types outside of Ultracite (and more locations in the long term idk like The Pitt would be perfect)
---
Lever Action, not modded or legendary.
---
I mean tbf to Rifle, when I've seen him do that he's given them a chance to server hop and it's usually for ridiculous prices in vendors, which sometimes I do wish I could do.
---
Bruh I‚Äôm out here doing only 7-16 a shot
---
This has to be on their side. I sent my ticket in; but if this persists, ill have to cancel my fallout first. No point in paying a mmo subscription if you can‚Äôt even access your friend‚Äôs list. Thank god I didn‚Äôt buy a full year.
---
I quite by chance dressed her in the Garb of Mysteries and the Eye of Ra  
---
Then the next round of dialogue was about how she was a fan of the M of M..  
---
Unfortunately, it didn't trigger any special dialogue about her being dressed as such - which would've been kinda neat to hear
---
and what about giant spider that if you killed it will spawn two little spiders and go on..? until little ones like mirelurk hatchlings..
---
Obsidian pulled that off, this is Bethseda were talking about..... that asking a lot.
---
Moo
---
Yes, the more the better. I'd love a chally plushie and the grahm idea would be awesome too
---
Yea I realized how silly that sounded talking about a Bethesda game so I‚Äôm the next sentence I re-instated and said if the biggest ones were fixed or patched. Like I know there had been a lot of bugs that made the game borderline unplayable at launch
---
Here is a hint a team member gave me the other day.
---
Nuke Monongah mine to kick off the Colossal Problem event.
---
If Monongah mine is in a Nuke zone, you can drop the next two Nukes anywhere on the map and the Colossal Problem event will re-spawn as long as the previous Colossal Problem Event has completed (succeeded, failed, or timed out).
---
So, you can, for example, get 3x Colossal Problem events and 2x Queen events with 3x Nukes.
---
Needless to say, stock up on Fusion Cores, Nuke cards, Ammo, and Stims before doing this run....
---
My First expired yesterday but that's not new problem, it was like that at least two times from premiere. Even worse, since list didn't synchronized for few days AT ALL.
---
Erale's intuition kicking in.
---
Teslas/ Glitched/magic weapons in vicinity...he bails.
---
:)
---
I was going to do a bloodied build also until I found out they're making some major changes to damage output soon, so I decided to wait and see exactly how bad they nerf it.
---
Lol, maybe. I have faith that they'll get things right eventually, if corporate gives them the time. I'm sure World of Warcraft had a rocky first few years too.
---
I think they should have a buff for sure. They‚Äôre just not really viable. If they were affected by commando it‚Äôd help
---
Yep. On space 92 here, hope to finish this week...
---
Yeah, now it's borderline playable :)
---
Alright thanks. It‚Äôs $40 on the PlayStation store right now I‚Äôll probably get it when it goes on sale. Is it heavily focused on multiplayer though? Like are there times were you have to do missions with others or can you do it by yourself? Because I know it‚Äôs an always online game and that‚Äôs cool and all but I kinda wanna have my own time doing missions. Unless I‚Äôm with frienda
---
The more you die the longer the respond time. In short - don‚Äôt die. I don‚Äôt mind it personally, it feels like going into the penalty box in hockey if you will. A moderate built-in deterrent to not die
---
I have never seen a server/ SBQ event that didn't have at least 3 -4 people with FO1st.
---
and I have party to murdering so man SBQ's.
---
Am near to pulling the trigger on FO1st myself. Don't need another COD in my life.
---
Same for me, you hzve to FT to someone on your team who is in the mine
---
Give it to Maggie in Foundation. It's an item for her quest
---
I never store stable flux in the stash box. When i get it, I craft serums or ultracite ammo from it to get rid of the weight.
---
Im trying to get the communities focus on the right things. For example there are plenty of "plx add X to atom store" which is beyond stupid.
---
As I want to play fo76, I think it has great potential but people seem to just want low effort shit like atom store crap, for example.
---
Nope it in no way forces you to do multiplayer. You can do 98% of it solo. And the few boss fights where you'll be with other players arnt bad. There's 3 bosses and for 2 of them most of the server will show up, and the other one is limited to 8 players. But again its just who shows up.
---
Ever other aspect of the game is for single players
---
A chalky plushie and a little Graham doll
---
The Colossus plushie is so damn cute considering Earl is probably the ugliest motherfucker of the game
---
So I got the watch after talking to her and completing and there isn‚Äôt an option to give it, is it just junk now?
---
It's a punishment for dying so much. It's really not hard to position yourself so when feared you don't run into a hazard. There's multiple places you can go. Stand against a wall. Or a beam. or the thing in the middle.
---
it can get pretty high.
---
check your agility, and master the ways of the jetpack.
---
Really though? It's like a mafioso saying "damn, it'd be a shame if something bad happened to your house...".
---
Dude was being a bully. It was either you "take your punishment" (arrogant af position right there btw) or leave. 
---
It's like offering to dress someone's wounds after you beat the crap out of them. That's not kindness nor does that make you any less of a thug.
---
Sounds about right haha. Just like this run, the only thing I really wanted was the secret door so I ended up doing the whole thing haha
---
The first one's more workable. I'd focus on shotguns myself.
---
Barbarian and Scattershot for resists and speed. At least one star of concentrated fire. Headshots are glorious in VATs. Adrenaline and Enforcer in Agility. With bloodied, offence if often your best defence. Also, crippling leg shots with the shotgun, combined with concentrated fire, will not only keep you alive in some situations, but will keep Earle locked to the floor.

We can never have enough plushies. They the equilivent to prewar junk in our camp just like steins.
---
So many cow puns in here... I love it!
---
What do you use?
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and use the Tesla a lot, it never drops my frame rate. All the people running explosive commando weapons ruins it though
---
LMAO, that's so f\*cked up...
---
Furious fixer and furious Gatling plasma
---
I play ps4 and I haven‚Äôt experience and haven‚Äôt had any problems with it
---
I ended up going there a bit overleveled (about lvl 30) in PA thinking about joining them, everyone of them were acting wannabe badass's and their leader was clearly some pushover, can't even remember his name. Noticed it's .50cal o'clock and got to work.
---
Do you have a build?
---
which alter? is this the bivouac site which normally spawns ghouls?
---
Yeah Commando
---
Not the highest dps but , i do about 100 with a Junkies Fixer. Lever is kind of slow , but probably nice against the ads
---
Must have just been a laggy game CP is bound to have a few bugs here and there.
---
Some people complain he disappear into the ceiling for 10mins and they can‚Äôt even do anything
---
Wish there was a bug to tame/pacify Earl and had him as a pet in your camp.
---
It's meant to remove the watch from your inventory at quest end. I'm not sure. If you get to keep it and the quest icon goes away it would be a cool collection item.
---
It is still buggy as shit and I get disconnected more than when I played pre Wastelanders but I play it as its on Xbox Gamepass an it does have its entertaining moments, I wouldn't pay retail/digital price for it though.
---
that worked for me, so I don't know. Game crashed, joined the same server with my team, I was outside, I FT to someone in my team and I was in the event
---
Thanks. Have not done that mission yet
---
The only bug I‚Äôve had is by me and my friend causing it if you PA glitch down there before the rubble goes down there and do a certain amount of damage you won‚Äôt be able to complete the event and be stuck down there even if you killed Earle (unless you fast travel out)
---
I bet once the tv show is out there will be Nuka Cola tie in
---
Strange you should atleast push more damage than that
---
Hell I‚Äôd take npcs down there as canon fodder. Anything to ease the odds that much more in our favour
---
Oh wow I knew you could PA glitch down there but I never knew it caused a bug thanks for the heads up
---
What's vague about saying I lost my gun after a game crash????
---
You think my vendor has unfair prices? Talk it over with my sales rep Earle Williams
---
Complaining that end game, grind required armour and weapons are more powerful / can be more powerful than what you find 20 hours in.
---
Everything isn't the same....because PERKS, build
---
Have a downvote for another whine thread
---
Yea but you have to nuke it 1st and have the event pop up if you try without you‚Äôll just be under the world on a small piece of ground not much to do
---
'The Lumberjack' 25% faster 50% armor ignoring and 90% lighter
---
My Agility is 33.
---
&gt;Plan learning Account wide would take a bit away from the game for me (if i really want to have that noob progession). I would prefer to have plan weighless and the possibility to transfer plans easy between account (account bank). That way i can share the plan who are a chore to find if i want, and collect the rest on the fly.
---
Kinda similar, ran around all day grabbing the codes off of officers. Only to find out you can look up the weekly code online... smh.
---
i get plenty of purified water from events and daily quests, i rly dont like the look of the small purifiers, but thanks for your suggestion.
---
Hmmm
---
did you do it yesterday? I think I might saw you, when opened the map almost all of workshops were claimed by one player, I took two of them tho to finish my weeklies
---
I think they fixed something melee shows and Npc drops the weapon/weapons he was blasting my sorry behind. Can't wait for patch 22 and the lvl scaling to 100, need my mods from those sweet sweet top tier weapons üòù.
---
I had to talk to her twice to get the option to give her the watch. The first time it was just the holotape turn in.
---
Not neccessarily, Tesla is a very effective weapon against hordes of enemies, it can deal with spawns really well. Unfortunately since Bethesda fucked it up, you can't use it for long before the server becomes fucky.
---
What would you recommend I get it for 30$? 20? 10?
---
Diablo 3 alt and storage system and paragon levels was a good example of how alts should work
---
Yeah, like giving Veronica a nice dress, Sofia should have flipped when she got to wear the actual Garb. I had the Wanderer in it originally, but when Sofia brought it up the Clean spacesuit and helmet just didn't work.
---
I got it for ¬£8 prior to Wastelanders at my local game shop and I though that was worth it, with the Wastelanders additions a lot has been improved and we finally have real npcs, I's say $15-20 at most.
---
I'm sure a sale will be on soon enough.
---
Go to nuke crypt .com and get the weeks silo codes 10-20 mins job done.....
---
Same here just happened today. This is Fallout without Friends....
---
Crit builds with high luck will probably make a comeback after the damage formula nerf.
---
Instigating does not give AP regen, you probably have the perk card Grim Reapers Sprint equipped.
---
Stealth works fine for earl and SBQ but from what I've heard it's useless in the daily ops feature coming soon, enemies will see you regardless, like with Grahams primal cut events.
---
it 10000% will stay the same or at least no major chnges will be done to it
---
Is that one where you can just lie to ward?  Don‚Äôt the settlers have more than one daily or is that raiders?
---
Sorry old man syndrome meant lone wanderer!
---
Surely the explosive would instagib instagib you if something got too close? Even with the vampiric effect?
---
I freak the fuck out firing rapid explosive weapons because sometimes power armor players or a mob walks past you and it's gg
---
I had a problem returning side quest to that Npc when main quest was active and in progress. Had to make the side quest only one active.

---
For as long as there has been "There is bug X" posts, there have been "stop complaining about bug X!" posts. It is the way of the sub.
---
As long as there are complaints about the game, there will be those who complain about the complaints. It is the way of the sub.

Whenever Beth adds new monetization, and the community is not stoked, there will be those who tell them to quiet their voices. It is the way of the sub.

I just got the game for $15 on Amazon haha. Hopefully it‚Äôs worth it
---
I've been using one for a good 1k hours. I pretty well know how to not blow myself up haha. I even used it in the vault raids with no issues. And it's very cramped in there haha

But yes, it will kill you very easily

I think it's a fallout first item only

I'm on Xbox, not sure if that matters but still stuck!  Would love to progress this main quest. Been on it for weeks

At least for many people including myself it is. Right when Wastelanders dropped.
---
&gt;Whats the fun in legendary farming if everything is the same.
---
Getting gear to suite and optimise your playstyle. Example. At the moment pistols are barely viable compared to sneaky rifle and commando. If pistols are just as viable as commando for instance, you can still farm the best legendary gear for commando or pistol build and be the top dog in your chosen build.
---
That's okay. Lone Wanderer is good, but the meta has changed with public teams. There are many valuable mutations and perk cards (such as strange in numbers) that are too good to pass up. Most people build for groups, join a public team for the bonuses and just stuff they'd normally do.
---
Same here. Any work arounds?
---
I'm on xbox any idea if this will work?
---
However, if your PTS clone dies you die in real life.
---
You'll get your 15 dollars out of it at least. Going to a movie will cost you that, you should get more than 2 hours out of it haha
---
Maybe you don‚Äôt have friends...ü§îü§îü§îü§î
---
The reason they made Falout 76 is to keep the IP alive while BGS Maryland works on Starfield and then the Elder Scrolls VI. It's just like what they did with ESO after Skyrim. The continued investment won't extend the time. The years spent on making the game that launched in 2018 are already spent and lost.
---
Many people have the same problem, there was already few posts about it below yours.
---
Damn, I should start dying there too

If you can pass the speech check, you can lie to her about finding the watch and get to keep it.
---
I‚Äôve got it on display right now at my camp.
---
No, you're right. I hadn't thought about it like that. I don't really watch his content other the infrequent recommendation.
---
I must admit, I'm not sure why he thought nuking Radiation Rumble or interior events would do anything though.
---
Only do it if you want Bloodied weapons.  I got Bloodied weapons bu they don't help my build.
---
No, they didn't nerf Bloodied. There is a gkoval damage adjustment coming at some point in the future, which affects all builds. Bloodied will still be the best build based on the current preview in the PTS.
---
Nah man, its not like my real life. Had the list before.
---
How about 500 hundred atoms todd ask
---
The head doesn't actually move. In the nicest way possible, all you have to do is shoot just above the neck.
---
Fire Proof or Dense torso remove 100% damage from explosive to yourself
---
Just kidding, on PS4 the friend list is empty from time to time. Not a big deal here
---
Nice gaslight attempt. Your comment was clearly meant to mock. Have a good one.
---
Bots on Parade has always had this issue. Sometimes targeting one member of the wave will turn the rest hostile, sometimes not.
---
TSE mingun out of PA and hipfiring, tags the whole server :-)
---
I‚Äôm just as confused. I‚Äôm only getting 3-4 a hit, but I can literally watch his health bar as I‚Äôm firing and it‚Äôs dropping at a much quicker rate than it should if I‚Äôm only doing such a minuscule amount of damage.
---
I‚Äôm starting to believe Earle‚Äôs damage counter may be a lil bugged. I know damn well I‚Äôm doing more damage than that lol.
---
Put a blood eagle jacket on and hope he has a heart attack
---
No idea why this is relevant btw, just joined in :-)
---
Bought it a few months back. I don't really regret it, but I would never recommend this to someone. Even a Fallout fan. Very bad game...
---
Oh i wasn't aware. Gonna check em for solutions.
---
Good job guys, appreciate your commitment!
---
As for me, I completed LR without autocomplition bug. To be clear I was online in all time cases you stated and it didn't affect me. If it's helpful I'm on PC, game installed on NVMe ssd, my connection 100mbit/sec.
---
P.S I feel sorry for each and everyone that experienced that infuriating bug. Bethesda has done absolutely nothing to resolve this issue in timely manner and there's no excuses for them.
---
there is no solution, we have to wait for BGS to fix that shit.
---
Ooh yes please.
---
Really? Damn glad that one didn't hit me
---
to be honest it's always been playable, your in fan boy territory that are willing to look the other way.  The game has always been playable, problem is there isn't a whole lot of content once you finish the main story line.  There are 2 boss fight to do over and over and about 30-40 repeatable world quests + events.  The 1000th time you've done one of these you'll know your one of us.  The game was always worth it for the main story (or lack of story) if you liked the single player games.
---
&gt;. Bloodied, Junkie's, etc are being brought more in line with each other which might open up more builds for people. 
---
they are still the best :V nothing will change outside of making people who use them angry also forget about opening up anything XDD more people will join bloodied and junkies as enemies are getting buffed.
---
Yes, pre Wastelanders I repaired my Gauss shotgun about every 3 weeks, now its literally daily, no exaggeration.
---
Why is it considered irresponsible? Is it way op?
---
Even legacies?
---
Something about your statement there's not adding up haha. The gauss shotgun did not exist pre wasetlanders
---
Are you on xbox?
---
Thats also my place to go. There are like 50 wood piles which award you an average 500 wood per visit. So I just go there, get my wood, switch servers and do it again until I'm almost at my weight limit. I farmed there yesterday for like 40 minutes and got 10k wood from it.
---
Without the limit it would still take a month or two continous play to get the plans. Systems like this often achive the opposite effect and makes people not coming back at all, because you just can't get these stuff in reasonable amount of time.
---
same as for anything else its just rng for you :V
---
Thank you I was wondering why they were all wonky
---
Wish granted: "You now have an eyebot companion that repairs your camp and plays music, but we've added a new bug that causes the eyebot to scrap all weapons and armour in your stash to make the repairs."
---
thats a bit sour, i just started playing and there isnt exactly a tutorial for everything
---
TSE shotgun sorry, lol. Gauss is equally as bad, I use that daily now and they both break..
---
none of the weapons you listed are god rolls they are good rolls on 2 tier weapons
---
If you do the new event with Earle, the mobs drop whichever ammo type you use to down them. So if you stick to crowd control after tagging Earle, you‚Äôll walk away with heaps of ammo and screws to boot.
---
Tattered Mole Miner oufit + Flaming Chainsaw was a blast at Meetweek. A bunch of people got really into it ü•≥
---
Cool, that's what I do with my heavy characters but wondered if it was such a good fit for sneak snipers/commandos.  
---
Appreciate the insights
---
For each passing day goes by... Still no hot fix for the people effected by this bug. Either they don't cared enough or not people addressing the issue instead of finding another way or temp fix around it which I find ignorant; no offense. I did my part and I am just waiting for this hot fix to return things to normal before more people quit/or temp quit.
---
Yea I feel like 75% can‚Äôt see their friends list and I‚Äôm with you I feel lonely
---
that I don't know as I don't own one

This! üôè
---
Unfortunately, more logins means more times the Atom Shop features pop up to tempt you...
---
Same here, congratulations on finishing, I finished yesterday and timed it by completing the legendary run with hitting lvl 200 on my character. I can now concentrate on finishing my raider rep to ally so I can get my ammo generator
---
Ok I don't think it does tho I wish it did ;)
---
It can crash the game when killing earl
---
I know Your pain :( I have 5 different char with different type of playstyle but when Wastelanders appeared my blood commando is only one that I play ... I play other only when my main has to many legendaries to script it in one day.
---
Plans should be account wide the same like items from atom shop, should be shared stash box to transfer items between characters etc.
---
Lots of players sell it for 1 cap each...
---
It's the best answer we got from Bethesda. Mid-september.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
Something like this would be great. Too bad it could only work on PC though
---
Ah ok. I used a "magic shotgun" for crowd control at ACP, worked wonders.
---
I use a Blimb90 Gatgun and it hits 150 sneaking
---
"Mac farm"?
---
spaghetti code strikes again!
---
Frankly, I have no idea. :-D I started the Vault missions and the faction rep grind relatively late, so if things were different the first month or two, I would have missed that.
---
How do you guys get the HRF in that zone?   Every time I've tried, there have been zero enemies to kill.
---
No worriesüëå
---
I came by a Fixer yesterday, no legendary prefixes and they wanted 6000 caps for it?? Yet they also had a 3* Cursed Harpoon Gun, 90% reduced weight (can't remember the other two prefixes but they weren't anything to sniffed at, for 900 caps! Fair enough the Harpoon Gun is not exactly a sought after weapon but neither is a Fixer without legendary prefixes. Needless to say I bought the Harpoon Gun... never used one before and at 90% reduced weight it'll be worth carrying around in my inventory for a while.
---
Join a public team, does this for you.
---
Just noticed it right before a deal and panicked. At least i have one friend back in there now. Thx for the gatling gun u/projekcinis and for beeing my only friend right now xD
---
But do wall glitch to launch those nukes faster :-)
---
It's supposed to, sure.  But it's a real crap-shoot as to whether this actually works or not.  Today, it did not.
---
I believe on the PTS now pistols are affected by Tank Killer perk.
---
It really sucks you in: I wanted just the ammo converter...then the Firefly light...then the stars wallpaper...then the planets wallpaper...Now I'm at 92 and planning to grind for the Fireplace.
---
PS4 actually.
---
Yeah being that close you might as well just finish haha
---
I‚Äôve bought two plushies this week, I love them.
---
What also happens is the server constantly drops people in your place, or when people join friends for trading etc. 16 max servers doesn't help.
---
Do you have a link for the reward placements?
---
If you plan on using it... mod it with the flechettes mod and you will create ammo instead of needing to craft it :p the biggest downside is the hard limit of the fire rate.... one shot every 4 seconds (except with a quad harpoon gun) so the faster reload is pointless :p but it's a fun weapon to use in vats when you are shooting down trash mobs and like I said with the flechettes mod you will never run out of ammo xD
---
Nice!  I have a VE Fixer.. Love that thing.  Vamps is totally underrated.
---
It's great for any Build.
---
Would be cool for another reason aswell. First they were scared, now they are angry. Will this give rise to the mole man uprising. Mumbles has amassed an arsenal of legendary weapons and armour. To what end?
---
Any good shotgun, or any explosive commando weapon.  I have a VE SMG that does the job nicely, but I'm sure you have or can get a good JE something.
---
"I don't need another plushy. I would prefer it if people didn't ask for plushies when I have different ideas about where the game should be focused."
---
Fixed it for you.
---
After about 15 successful ACP events I encountered my first gesla rifle issue with it....a friend of mine over mic. I got him to stop using it by dropping him an alternative weapon, but even after there was no more tesla fire the frame rate drop persisted. Couldn't event loot wendigo bodies because I would overshoot. From stealth I'd get some heavy hits with my b2525 fixer only to be unable to move in time from Earl's range attacks in my general area. My friend raged quit and we failed. Guess it might not always happen, but its definitely possible on xbox.
---
Only my personal testing.  2% per point.
---
One thing is miss is the Metros in FO3...  Man I spent hours upon end scouring them lol.
---
Since the introduction of legendary modules, I tend to scrap most weapons, even 3* legendaries as I'd rather get the scrip to buy legendary modules. Armour sells surprisingly well regardless of they're respective prefixes. The point you make about the difficulty in selling things for 1 cap is one we can relate to... hell, I have difficulty selling ammo for 0 caps.
---
Garyyyyyyyy :D
---
How about a Grahm &amp; Chally radio that plays the meat week jingle?
---
So are you saying we need more Doms (or Switches)?
---
Lost my zealots 3 star fixer a week ago not sure if it was the same way you lost yours but i gave up and decided to move on
---
That sucks, guess it's time to find a game that won't steal my loot from me!
---
What level are you?
---
I was using an exploding mini gun and did diddly against him
---
Learned this the hard way today V_V
---
I'm getting two weird things. Peaceful enemies (usually robots in places where you can be friendly or hostile) are all suddenly dropping dead around me at the same time. The other thing is increased spawns in a lot of lower level places, particularly the agricultural centre area has approximately 8,000 Mr Farmhands.
---
130ish
---
I was so bummed out when I learnt this and mr jangles  can‚Äôt be displayed. I read a good tip to protect them at your camp at least- put them in your vendor for 30,000 caps so they‚Äôll have a safety net from being picked up and scrapped accidentally during a spring clean. This at least protects them until the day we can display them, if it ever comes...
---
Same here and when i said move on i ment keep playing  and forget about it lol
---
No I only bought the things I wanted. I don‚Äôt see the point in buying plans for things I‚Äôll never use and will only reduce the chances for drops I might use.
---
Someone shared r1 of lucky break, that was a nice little addition
---
I normally share Tenderiser r1 since it's the only card I can share haha
---
Squad Maneuvers. I appreciate the increased movement speed as my playstyle involves me running around with a BE pistol weakening everything and healing everyone I can.
---
Thanks for the tip... I do indeed intend to use it, though it'll only ever be a situational weapon rather than one I use routinely because off the fire rate. That said at 458 damage with all three Heavy Gunner perks maxed out, I'd imagine that it's pretty brutal when lurking in the shadows for a sneak attack?
---
i always share travel agent. its something useful for every build and any level. in fact, you can share nearly anything but please, dont share radsponge or sun kissed, they are build breaker for every bloody.
---
What's your point?
---
 I still use them all the time to get certain resources that are rarer than others while i farm the world.
---
Screw that, why waste my time playing a game that will literally remove my hard earned items with no recourse available to get my lost item back? That's just supporting shitty games and shitty devs
---
It can but its not a guaranteed drop like the SBQ and I'm not sure if I've ever gotten more than a single kit as a reward.
---
I share starches Gene's, so that other people can unequip theirs and run other perks to help them
---
Strange in numbers is always welcome for me
---
There is a computer in a tree nearby. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Would've been cool if it was actually haunted.
---
Can't miss what you never had...
---
I didn't even realize the peaceful enemy one was happening, I ran into that a few times but assumed they were destroyed by something else. I haven't been to too many low leveled places, but I'll check that out and see if it's happening for me as well. Thanks for the info :)
---
I think he takes more damage on certain heads after certain attacks too. I noticed doing VATS on the screaming head after recovering from fear causes a lot more damage for a short period
---
Accusing me of not having the gun? Classy move. 
---
Unless you're Bethesda support, I've nothing to prove to you, either; I was simply asking whether it was worth holding out hope on my ticket. My ticket that contains adequate proof of weapon ownership. 
---
Get fucked you clown.
---
It‚Äôs not just the Tesla it‚Äôs anything that can make ash or goo piles because of the amounts of wendigo spawns that are there at once if someone is using a Tesla to turn the to ash it will drastically change the frame rates
---
Hopefully it will get Bethesda aware of it. That was my actual intention, but putting in a ticket is a huge waste of time and I'm not going to recreate the issue just to send them video proof when TR3B already made one.
---
We're talking about the free in game improved repair kits that repair to 150% not the atom shop ones (or now from the season rewards).   They are given as a reward from scorched earth and sometimes Encryptid.
---
I've got around 450 of those in my stash so I'm fine with the new event not dropping them as well lol.
---
Mines a quad explosive 10mm pistol, with the automatic receiver. It amazing, until it breaks, which happens too damn often :-( .
---
I feel like squad maneuvers doesn't stack with speed demon? So if you're running the speed demon mutation, which most are, it wouldn't be helpful
---
It's only the automatic mod that is the problem. The semi auto is fine
---
With luck he'll hit a snake then - I need it.
---
Thats a good idea but i wouldnt take mine off coz i know i would forget to reequip them and then byebye mutations üòÜ
---
Nice, thanks. There was a program like this (not as a mod) but was sadly abandoned.
---
I'm bloodied so all good, I just struggle sometimes sharing a perk cause I like to do my best to please everyone on the team :-)
---
Its damage can ramp up with how many others players brahim you killed.
---
Nice one! Hope you enjoy. I'm playing it now tbh.
---
Mines a quad explosive 10mm pistol, with the automatic receiver. Lots of ammo and amazing for tagging, until it breaks, which happens too damn often :-( .
---
Share a qol card please. We all have the dmg cards that we want but qol cards are always just out of real. Through hiker, squad maneuvers, lucky break, etc. all are appreciated. DO NOT share anything that heals rads.
---
It would be nice but probably never.
---
I don't use speed demon, people said it was glitched when I first made this build and I just haven't bothered to get it, plus squad Maneuvers works just fine for me.
---
I'd recommend getting it. You'll always move at top speed, and it increase your reload time as well
---
Never had any issues with it or heard about it being glitched
---
I‚Äôm out here with 659 treasury notes and I can only put in 20 at a time and each day I gain more than I lose it‚Äôs a curse to have more treasury notes than I can actually cash in
---
Isn't the Fireplace one off the end? You get 500 atoms for that last one and it's 150 atoms to buy a level. If you get bored of the grind, you can get the last three levels and still make a profit.
---
Appalachia has a new corpse.
---
I'll check it out then, I won't turn away faster reload speed.
---
I'm getting 20 crits with full melee build, legendary ski sword, and psychobuff. So yeah, I'd say that's good.
---
True. I don't mind it, to be fair. Just commenting on my spiral down into FOMO madness...
---
Ahh, that explains why my Flamer has such terrible durability! Thanks for the explanation.
---
Sept 15th is my guess.
---
I didn't ask for proof, I simply read your posts and was like, ok, ok, maybe. So I checked out your feed and get the feeling you never had a B2525 Fixer, nor are you a level 130 "ish". Your defensiveness suggests that you are lying now to... No clown here, just have an ability to see when someone is bullshitting. Why not post adequate proof on here with you post to? I would if it was me... That way ppl like me won't call you out.
---
That medic one, the one that shares stimpacks
---
Lately I share magnetic personality which helps a little with a few points of charisma to everyone so slightly more xp and rewards
---
Hitting on PS4 too. Ive had it happen a handfull of times but most times fix its self in 15min after I signed in. This is the longest ive ever seen it happen. Still out.
---
But then I'd have to switch her out of the Rocket Girl outfit and thats not happening cause da booty.
---
If you don't learn them you won't get the higher tier ones though
---
Either they quietly made changes to this that I missed or my rifle is bugged out.  After over a year I finally had a better handmade drop for me. 2 star B25 to replace my Bloodied bash damage reduced weight piece of junk.  Comparing stats and mods on the 2, I noticed that my fully modded RW handmade that used to weigh like 16 lbs is now coming in at 8 something.
---
We call those glass buildings Greenhouses where I'm from.
---
Yup me too. Thats why the burrows is my favourite dungeon in 76. The atmosphere is like in fo3 metro üòÅ
---
I have the ss jetpack with marsupial, bird bones, and speed demon on most of my characters, you can fly up and melee the SBQ and land back down safely once you learn how to work it properly. 
---
It is awesome.
---
The mutations "Herd Mentality" and "Egg Head" plus the perk cards "Strange in numbers", "Class freak" and "Grim Reaper's Sprint" are definitely doing the job.
---
Strange in numbers will be affecting "Herd Mentality" and "Egg head giving you a buff of 3 intelligence and 8 intelligence for a total of 11 intelligence.
---
And Grim Reaper's Sprint is definitely enough ( if you also have the "Adrenaline" perk card ) to make the job. I mean..."Lone wanderer" becomes useless. Personally i only use it for it's -20% damage taken from enemies.
---
&gt; a liberator would also be nice 
---
As much as I hate the cash shop for various reasons - I'd buy skins like *that* if we could actually get the companion itself in-game.
---
Not yet. Come back in two years it might be on sale by then.
---
Int effects xp not chr
---
Haha mine to, well hopefully they expand on it sometime in the future, that alone is a big selling point to any fan of the franchise. Its a slow road but it's the possibilities of what can happen in this game that keep me here. üëç
---
Looking froward to the new update, and next year saying that.
---
Maybe some of the patient 0 types for the snally and grafton? Lore says they escaped shortly before or during the bombs so if they found a good spot they could have survived and grown over the 20 or so years
---
I'd just like to be able to build one for people that come to my camp and have first
---
I went in today for the first time at level 55 and even with a decent build and magic mini gun I figured I'd be most useful as the wendigo killer seeing as they were melting Earle. Was actually a super fun first go at it, and a couple of us made it out with only 1 or 2 seconds before the collapse. Have been playing solo mostly to enjoy the exploring and whatnot but that event makes me want to get into a team for events more often.
---
Furious/Vampire Limb damage Reduced Weight would be my choice
---
XP is based on intelligence not charisma. You'd be helping people get better prices at vendors!
---
Technically true, but you need to throw one at a time, otherwise the first one will fling the rest to god knows where.
---
And you need A LOT of them to do serious damage. I‚Äôd wager it would be easier to repair the damage than it was for the guy to get all that bait.
---
So far I used it once to get to a wanted player who was baiting people into his trap camp with his bounty, and it really was a hassle lol
---
Thank god i wasnt on ur server! 
---
The amount of salt would have been unheard of. :)
---
If I'm not mistaken he ignores explosive damage all together
---
It‚Äôs been back several times so it‚Äôll be back again I‚Äôm betting
---
Tesla in ACP make the game so laggy it's unplayable
---
Grats.
---
Personally, I took two the other day, one at a time - and was just oneshotted both times, by some random invisible douche hiding gods know where. Neither of them even went to capture the workshop afterwards, and at least half of them were unowned on the server at the time, anyway. (According to the map at least, which, yeah, is either correct or isn't. But still.)
---
Honestly, the scrap box is enough for me. It's such a relief to never have to worry about weight. The private world is just a bonus for when I transfer scrip between characters
---
I understand where you're coming from but if this was to happen, then giving us a bigger scrip limit would not be enough compensation for every month I've had 1st. I've had 1st since it started and I don't think it would be fair to just make it free for everyone. Maybe another stash or scrap box with a limited amount of space for people without it. I don't know, but as I said I've had first since it was released, I still buy atoms even getting them every month and I've paid for the raider/settler bundles which imo should of been free to people with first.
---
This argument/discussion has been going on for ages and I don't think there is away around it, what's the point in a premium surface if they give the best part of it away for free, it's bad business.
---
Good with salt
---
Now this is a great idea. ‚úä
---
Im with you man üëç. I often got lost in the metro and i miss the scary and lonely feeleing i had when i was searching the daylight üòÜ. A big morgan town underground or something in that direction would be really nice
---
It comes around pretty frequently.
---
hmmm
---
Also for PS4
---
it's amazing how many players don't have mutations

Onto it, the team is aware and investigating, thanks for the reports everyone

Bodyguards is a good one to share if you want to take care of your teammates. I usually equip that if somebody already has strange in numbers equipped

I agree, your plan ‚Äúit just works‚Äù, you should totally just delete your account and never return... that ought to show em....
---
Exactly, all they have to do is design them and add them in. I honestly think they'll come at some point.
---
For now we must wait, but the wait will be worth it. On that note I need to go purchase some patience, my kids stole the little I had left üòÇüòÇ
---
This I agree with only time I saw frame drop is when somebody use a explosive 50 cal
---
What is wrong with you
---
That‚Äôs the exact reason the drills and other environmental hazards are there, to damage you when you get the effect.

Dunno, sounds like fun on both sides. Better than grinding Colossus.

üòÇ i know what you mean. Dont have my own kids yet, but as teacher i know how it feels when your patience gets stolen by them üòÜ
---
Legendary 10mm with modded automatic are pretty viable end game, and it‚Äôs usually easy to find a lot of ammo, of course you don‚Äôt use it on anything too big without a proper build. Aim for the legs in VATs, and you can easily cripple them in my experience. Modded 10mm to automatic also have way less spread then the 10mm submachine gun.
---
That attitude of excusing shitty dev behaviour is why were stuck with broken, buggy games :) Keep licking these companies boots while I find a game that doesn't negate dozens of hours of work :) Yeah, it does just work. Clown.
---
This is the weirdest internet argument I've ever gotten into. Are you sure you're not just trolling and being deliberately ironic by being very anal about language?
---
Don‚Äôt forget the broadsider. That thing is bad comedy.

Because I'm asking a question regarding my ticket that's already been posted, again, with adequate proof. I've nothing to prove to sarcastic, overly inquisitive arseholes like you unless you're part of Bethesda's customer support team.

Reddit was a last resort to get an answer to my question, morons like you being the reason. If you really want proof, add up HuanJoo420 and check my clips üôÑ

So yeah, get fucked you clown.
---
Yeah, just read his posts also. As a non-bias third party here, typically people who ask ‚Äúwhere to farm 3* heavy combat armour‚Äù don‚Äôt carry around goods of that caliber. 
---
Just my opinion. Thought I‚Äôd read into the situation here.
---
Chems
---
usually share travel agent or one of the mysterious strangers.
---
Sofia can then be a recruit.
---
HuanJoo420, check clips and then rethink your strategy of searching Reddit history when it's not even remotely linked to Xbox...

All making incorrect assumptions based in your incredulity.

I just want the lunchboxes to get the XP to get the SCORE to get the lunchboxes.......

But there's only 12 more squares (-1 in a couple of hours) before Dr.zorbo reach the end of the season pass...so think about it.
---
Yep, blame everyone else‚Äôs ‚Äúshitty behavior‚Äù  and rage quit because you lost your favorite imaginary gun ... you‚Äôre correct I really am a clown huh?
---
True, it was good to have a friendly skirmish instead of killing earle for the 10th time and getting a suppressor multi purpose axe
---
Yup. I have been on both sides of this. PvP is a fun aspect of the game.
---
I got one of the atom shop prefabs specifically so my alt could have an easy-built CAMP.
---
I agree though, plans account-wide would be great.
---
So maybe the 8th is a better idea. I am pretty sure it would be on a Tuesday.

Yeah, I picked it up like in June I think.

---
Yesterday at Poseidon, I had a protection spawn underground, so I could not finish defending the workshop.
---
Workshop "defense" events should - not exist. At the very least, yeah, not the way they currently are. One of the most annoying mechanic in the game, clearing one out and paying to occupy it and not two minutes later having to "prepare defenses" because some enemy is coming to play hide&amp;seek with me. They really ain't worth that much.
---
On deaf ears.
---
Wait to see how it goes with One Wastelander, the damage nerf, and enemy buff.   Also maybe to see if they ever fix the fast travel bug and lag that is sometimes destroying the quality of the game in intense events.
---
Yeah I have cursed harpoon, just need the other too and the helmet. The helmet I‚Äôve been offered for my extra tenderizer plan.
---
NPCs could be kind of cool to have fill out the team. Maybe they could be ghouls who managed to hide from Earle this whole time, and want revenge for their friends who were eaten.
---
What do you mean "after legendary run everyone's suddenly 150"? You mean after the 3 month season? Cuz legendary runs give no xp whatsoever, only the xp bonus from lunchboxes that unless used to full potential, isn't that amazing either. ü§î
---
Forgot to mention that the flamer mod works with rifleman perks. So for commando i dont really have a clue for a good alternative üòÖ
---
It‚Äôs entirely possible it was a coincidence. One anecdote is not data.
---
next time try to open your friend list and respawn on your teammate, if still bugged and you have fast travel option instead of respawn, fast travel to v76 and back to your teammate, there's a good chance it will fix it.
---
Yeah sneak attacks can really hit hard... but the vats damage is insane and really useful since it doesn't rely as much on the travel speed of the shot.. if you aim manually at a distance the target can just walk out of the way... with vats they become target seeking bullets xD really funny when used on scorchbeasts with 95% hitchance xD
---
well thats pretty nice, just applied it to my magic shotgun.. I think I saw turtle or someone show this in a vid a while back but forgot about it:)
---
Pretty much any card that isn't counter productive to builds is fine.
---
For me, I wish more people would change cards if someone else is already sharing the same card.
---
The quest could be milking it for a 500 units of radiated milk?
---
Wrong sub pal
---
It's a bit of a waste. I sell my recipes for 5 caps, plans for 10-20 caps. Then things like power armor, weapon plans and just rare event plans for more. God bless you for being generous, but don't put the potential caps down for your own good so you can get items YOU like faster. Even a couple of thousand for the rare plans wouldn't hurt you cap wallet. ü§î
---
I just buy them. I make enough money selling all of the other ammo types that I just pay 2000 shells at a time from player vendors.
---
I have 30k and never bought any.....
---
Yeah I have 3 independent characters. Melee/heavy power armor, hunter bow thorn, and commando. They have all respeced multiple times. I'm super fucked lol
---
There is a perk for that called Gun Runner which increases your movement speed by 10% per perk card up to a total of 20% movement speed when you have a pistol equipped.
---
However, movement speed is capped at 20%, so you can achieve the same result with the speed demon mutation or two levels of Squad Maneuvers, without the weapon type restriction. Furthermore, as movement speed is capped at 20%, these buffs obviously don't stack, unless maybe if you got 10% from Gun Runners and another 10% from Squad Maneuvers.
---
When I died it physically wouldnt let me open anything up, not even the map.
---
If they could make money on it
---
They want the universe to be so big it may as well be infinite - so you'll never no it all
---
I wouldn't trade the plan for the helmet. Don't get me wrong, the helmet looks really cool. I got it a couple days ago, and it pairs really well with the ranger outfit. But, ACP is here to stay, and Meat Week isn't. Those helmets will get increasingly easy to find, and will likely end up just dropped like Ultracite plans.
---
Just my unsolicited 2 cents!  And if you're on PS4, and I get another helmet, I'll trade to you for something way less valuable or sell for a few caps.
---
Sure.
---
In dark souks you can do this alas 90% of names are just starred out unsurprisingly
---
I do not understand friend
---
I can see how it's a problem here üòê
---
By your formatting you seem to be trying to post on the market sub. This is not that sub. Trading is not allowed on this sub via rule 10
---
I feel like majority of the crowd in the game is people who know how it goes tho. Sometimes people just sell rare plans cheap cuz they don't care, and bobbleheads expensively cuz there's an actual monkeys buying them and increasing demand and price requirements for them. No offense for those who just buy it to make someone's day, but I mean... ü§îüòí

Well, I guess its a stretch, but they made it so you can't have a camp around vault 51 in the pts (or maybe it was a leak that said that. Can't recall.)
---
* Sips some Whiteclaw *
---
Dante, no frienlist on PC for the last 4h
---
5 toons.  1 with full reputation.  3 with full SS armor, 2 with full t65 armor.  
---
It‚Äôs a fucking chore.
---
Great job we‚Äôre all so happy for you
---
Where's him at in f76 tho? It's completely unrelated. Why couldn't they add something else, like sweet tooth trait or something. It's like they just added it cuz they were recycling content from other games and didn't bother to try and change it. ‚ôªÔ∏èü§î
---
You want a screenshot?
---
That might mean that the server instance crashed, meaning the team you were on all got kicked too, and the world went poof, so there was nothing to rejoin.
---
i got contemporary house build first time i seen it. it was cool, for a while. now, 8mths into 76 i feel like its nothing more than a pre-fab tract home. ive since replaced it (along with my log cabin) with a brick/wood build. looks way more wastelandish. shuttered windows are awesome and my hanging cage tree looks right at home now. raiders rule!
---
It seems widely accepted that the game still has some flaws, but especially since Wastelanders, it is very fun now. For the most part the community playing this game are friendly and cooperative, with only some minor toxic elements. Which is a far better ratio than I have seen with other online games
---
I met his soon after launch. He said something like he has wares for sale. But his inventory was empty. So I thought he was a gag or something. And I ignored him from then on.
---
Forward to middle last year when I saw on here that he has rare plans and people know his routes, his kinda a big deal.
---
Got 20k here... last thing I bought was the seedy shed
---
Nah this happens to me
---
/ it seems the marker appears every few days not daily - dont know why sometimes they alternate sometimes they appear together
---
Simultaneously / bugged and screwy , did t know about the photos and mirelurk
---
Queen meat ways though
---
I had this problem as well, had to restart the game
---
Agreed
---
I think I came across this [today](http://imgur.com/gallery/jwlp2Fy)
---
You are not that much faster against someone who knows what to do.
---
Just a few seconds at best.
---
Neither and none.
---
They should make it to a rare drop with random attributtes instead (alien blaster, chainsaw)
---
Dev it!
---
Of what? I just want to know what you did with your 500 atoms.
---
Never had problems with my two shot tesla since the beta, used to crash the game all the time
---
I really wish I payed more attention to dailys for the first 1k hours I put in haha. Never bothered with them untill a few months ago and have 6k saved up. The vast majority of my world ones are done already though haha
---
I'm on Xbox and it hella messes with the frames after awhile
---
I really enjoyed it! I even ended up getting a little better at nuclear winter. It was sort of a perfect event for a Covid summer. I am a little worried about season two though, since I go back to teaching next week, and will not have as much free time.
---
What are you looking for
---
Is it showing up in your display case? I put mine in the thanksgiving display and it didn‚Äôt show up.
---
Xbox
---
Turbo fert?
---
Sure but got some good rewards from her quests, two shot auto grenade launcher and quad guass
---
Yeah, last night.
---
Nope not even that
---
It's definitely worth trying to figure it out yourself atleast once. At one point you end up with an anagram though, and it can be really tough figuring out that one as well without something like a crossword puzzle helper, lol.
---
Yeah, I am usually pretty bad at first person shooter things, and follow is different because of vats. However, doing some of the challenges for nuclear winter definitely sharpen my skills a little bit.
---
This happened to me a long time ago and I got unreasonably pissed. Since then I've gotten over it and am considering making one of my characters PvP focused.
---
It is like a .8% drop from events in the mire
---
Seriously! I‚Äôve been playing pretty solid since March and haven‚Äôt seen one yet.
---
finished it yesterday and i feel like you. it was nice but in the end, the only really cool thing i will keep on using is the bloody handmade skin, just looks great. was hyped about the blood sprenkled gas mask but well, it looks ass. and not in a good way ass.  
---
overall, i just realise now, how the season affected my way of playing the game. as usually, i logged in and checked the dailies only to realise, i dont have to do them anymore. at first, i stood like 30 seconds without knowing what to do, the routine is broken, what the fuck will i do now?   
---
ended up following a low level in morgantown, he marked the enemies, i downed them and it was fun. now im thinking about building up my camp from scratch, change location perhaps. we'll see, im finally free to play the game as i want again.
---
Daily‚Äôs were a great source of atoms never understood why most people ignored them .. I really miss them now .. not that I ever see anything I want to buy!
---
My characters run around in the raggiest crap I can find.
---
Yes I understand, thank you, they told me too, but I thought it could be found there, to close the post how do I do it?  in sales I know but not here
---
Vampire's works really well against him, much less need to stop shooting to heal
---
They could let us use the personal terminal for messages.
---
You can't just find one. It is only a drop from events. So you've got 2 options, get it as a drop or buy it from another player
---
Feel free to add smithy_bmx
---
Sorry I miss understood
---
I don't know if you can close a post here. Only delete it
---
Yes I did the boomer event many times but it is true that it never falls, and nobody sells it, it is the bad thing but thanks
---
There is no slayer's prefix that boosts damage against creatures or cryptids. Also the Wendigo Spawns are not marked as glowing thus Glow Sight doesn't work either.
---
You can get a temp boost of +15% damage from the *Daily: Queen of the hunt* if the target turns out to be a Wendigo. Also the magazine *Tales from West Virginia hills #1* gives +15% damage vs Wendigos too.
---
With all due respect, Bethesda doesn't deserve any respect.  
---
They released thes game almost 2 years ago.  
---
And guess what?  
---
Still  a fuck ton of bugs, problems with balance, every update creates more bugs  
---
My favorite line, from one and only Todd Howard - It just works.  
---
Bethesda doesn't deserve shit. All this company does with the game, is fixing their own fuck ups and creating another ones.   
---
And this whole situation could be avoidable if they didn't promote it like that.   
---
Released it in alpha or beta, reduced price from the start to 40-30 dollars.   
---
AND only after the game became stable enough with more or less good ammount of content they pushed the price back.
---
ok thanks for everything friend
---
Yeah it's an extremely rare drop. And those who have it are going to want a high end trade item for one if they're looking to get rid of it. I'm talking legacys and such
---
Why would it not?  Fireproof and dense mod stack for immunity against explosive damage. Is explosive damage from a plasma gat not explosive damage?
---
Then what‚Äôs even the point?
---
He/she/it probably had a +700 friend with a exposive plasma lurking in the shadows waiting for you to respond
---
Huh?  Should melee damage be in the thousands?
---
yes i understand i have a harpoon explosive executioner's legacy i will try with that
---
Nothing, I have around 7k+ right now, but I can't find anything worth spending them on, so I'll wait.
---
I hope that the glass building set becomes something purchaseable through gold bullion if I dont end up making it
---
Are you starting the events?
---
i dont see why they are against it, it will only increase play time for most players
---
Unmute it, it's not to see but to hear.
---
Bandolier
---
Maybe $1 for 100000000000000 scrip?
---
Against normal enemies (everything but fucking Assaultrons who are built to ruin that character) I'm doing 170 to 230 damage a hit. One to five hit kills unless armoured as Incisor doesn't seem to work for me. That's 15 strength and no extra buffs.
---
Yeah, its essentially a larger version of what spawns if you dont loot an enemy
---
Harpoons arnt super sought after as legacys. Unless
---
We all want lunch, dude.
---
Today is a southern style air-fried chicken breast, topped with a Korean curry sauce for the last five minutes of cooking, wrapped in a sourdough baguette that has beeb smeared with cajun butter. I can't wait.
---
They told me that after wastelanders the harpoons no longer appear in the legendary vendor and they are almost not seen there
---
Have you counted shots to break with and without the perk? That would be the required information to back this claim.
---
You are straight in control room, launch prep in under 20 secs.
---
I think having the damage perks merged in to 1 would be great but i all so like option 1 as well. 
---
I am not sure but maybe do both as right now Pistols are kind of useless as other than gunrunner you can do every thing a pistol can with a rifle but better.
---
Explosive harpoons are legacy. That part is true.
---
I'm just saying that on the market sub they are not as highly valued as other legacy weapons since they are not as strong
---
It's junk.
---
oh it's a video?? lmao I didn't know that, I thought it was a image, thanks!
---
oh THAT glitch, yea no, cant race against that one... :D
---
I thought you mean the one through the first grid.
---
I agree. I think all weapons should have a single card with 5 ranks to it. That makes it an investment without completely hogging your card space for a stat.
---
I also think that each special stat should have a weapon in it. Str for melee, perception for rifles, agility for pistols, luck for explosives, endurance for heavy weapons, etc.
---
Thx for the info mate üëäüèº
---
if that's true, it's not as good as a plasma explosive machine gun, I'll see hehe
---
If on xbox I have 2 tattered jackets
---
No, I meant everything having the same damage numbers. Combat rifles, handmades, assault rifles, etc.
---
Does chainsaw benefit from two handed or one handed melee perk cards?
---
I've been playing ESO for quite a few years and most of the player names are in-character ones. You can see quite a few stupid ones, but I'd say most of them (around 80-90%) are allright. 
---
Much better than what we have now. 95% are immersion-breaking.
---
I joined a public team while doing some stuff at camp. Noticed one guy just kept going down so immediately fast travelled to help out with whatever he was doing, without checking where he was on the map. I have to live with that decision and how I found myself cracking up as we all ran screaming into drills for the rest of my life.
---
I like to see Strange in Numbers shared on a team, but I share rank 3 of White Knight. I figure everyone at every level can benefit from reduced armor degradation, and not as many people have the perk equipped as part of their main build.
---
It was the same with this run i only wanted the Thunderpipe weapon skin the rest was all meh.
---
I am not sure i even want anything out of the AA run my self i am not sure on the building set and everything else is meh.
---
That‚Äôs fascinating thanks for sharing. My COVID experience has been much more mundane. We moved into a new house in January right before things went to shit so most of my time is spent on home improvement projects. The house has a pool so I quickly learned how to maintain it myself. Then I got a smoker in May and I‚Äôve been having fun learning how to make perfect ribs and brisket. I‚Äôve also smoked simple syrup for Old Fashioneds. I‚Äôm running out of things to invest my time in and it‚Äôs wearing me down.
---
I think strange in numbers stacks. At least it used to be so. Dunno if something has changed there since the last updates
---
Ash vs Evil Dead
---
Ghoul slayers, extra limb damage, reduced weight
---
I usually share out strange in numbers by default, if already shared I switch to inspirational or tenderizer, depending on what else is being shared.
---
I would empty and erase the vendor's and restock them..just incase
---
If you tell me in the Fallout trade post, I'll buy it if you are willing to sell it, I have 120K at 5.56 and a legacy explosive executioner harpoon in case you are interested
---
Things could certainly go that way, and ideally it‚Äôs the situation I‚Äôd want too. Problem is Bethesda Austin has been so damned oblique, regarding anything other than broad-stroke plans, that it feels like community outrage is the only thing that provokes an immediate response. Far from ideal, obviously, but I suspect people would be unwilling to surrender that tool in favour of one that might yield better results if the devs are motivated and/or have the resources to pull their fingers out.
---
Hey just send me a message on here.click my name send me a text.
---
I usually share inspirational. Once you get so high in levels, every little bit helps to get more XP. My second choice has been Quick Hands. Not many people share it and it helpful not needing to reload as often. My only complaint is I wish it had just a bit higher percentage proc.
---
I always try to share either Aquaboy because it's just a nice utility and frees up a point for others or the extra damage resistance when in teams.
---
Honestly, I wouldn't mind stuff like the directional audio things to be shared when I'm adventuring. It'd stop me swapping between exploration and utility perks in my very low PER character.
---
My trunk
---
Personally if that thing's playing music i'd rather give it the ED-E treatment, get it a "Well-Traveled" look with the stickers and bumper plate, and have it follow me around.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
This suggestion, and the avalanche of puns therein, makes me fear for all of humanity.
---
This game could go for 50 years and people will still make these posts lol
---
I‚Äôm still helping if you want one
---
For real though
---
West tek with scrapper for steel and plastic
---
ACP event for screws and acid
---
Some lumber camp and helvita for wood
---
Sugar Grove for springs
---
Lucky hole for lead ore (to make lead)
---
Fort defiance and top of the world for aluminium
---
Those are the big ones off the top of my head
---
Yeah I do all those runs, was wondering if there were any magic little places I didn‚Äôt know about ü§£
---
Flatwoods is surprisingly full of useful junk for no ammo cost. Lead at the motel, robot farm, etc.
---
Yes this occurred to me as well, so sort of have to do "twice".
---
Me too. I'm unsure if I'm going to log in aside from checking Atomic Shop updates until the next run.
---
I mean, it's Fallout, I could just...enjoy...the game... but I need a break. Granted it was super satisfying to finish the run without paying for ranks, so there's that at least.
---
Hornwrite estate, I think, is well rounded for junk. I have specific places depending on what I need. Screws and springs, sugar Grove. Lead, lucky hole mine. Aluminum, pleasent Valley ski resort or Morgantown high school.
---
Do every Breach and Clear event you see. Very easy and you get tons of scrap metal ore. You just need the acid to smelt it.
---
I'm terrible at PvP.  I'm not really even good at PvE.  
---
I pretty much suck across the board, but I still love playing
---
How does one perform this glitch? I need to replicate it for scientific purposes
---
Or the totem with his heads, that says his name at the base. Lol
---
The head that has the bloating at the throat usually is higher and will show as a critical hit most of the time..
---
If you nuke the location in the savage divide where Free range would be, you arrive to the farm at the end and find the sheepsquash massacred and a trail of blood leading into a barn. The brahmin mutated and decided they didn't need our help any more.
---
Yeah that's on the post
---
Usually if I see someone in a silo I'll wait around on the server in case they are going to start scorched earth or something.  On multiple occasions I've seen someone in there and an hour later they still have not launched and I give up....but they are still in there.  
---
Really makes me wonder what in the hell is happening in there.
---
&gt;What would you do once you get the (very low too) 1000 scripts limit and also stash limit? Never pick up new weapons?
---
I switch characters and work on building them and their stash up.  Or I go play a different game or engage in a different activity.
---
I call bullshit!!!!!!!!! Lol
---
Few days ago in your camp?
---
Yeah, like I wish there were cameras so you can see what is going on, like FNAF
---
I think being overencumbered and having to decide between keeping your merchandise and walking faster is an intended game mechanic. Access to a vendor on top of a stash and infinite scrap box seems too much.
---
I always put on my hazmat suit before leaving the cave. If I‚Äôm in a hurry and leave the cave without it, I have about a 5 second window to put it on before taking rads. That‚Äôs why I keep my prototype hazmat suit on my weapon wheel.
---
I always share sun kissed or rad sponge, dunno why people hate me...
---
Nothing
---
There aren't really any technical limitations, Bethesda is just too lazy to change the code or implement an ip block if you want a different server..or just straight up some kind of lobby as I doubt they're all just "Fallout server" in their code but rather "Fallout server X" and could technically easily send you to a actually new one...but Beth is Beth..there's a reason for their current reputation.
---
No, I can only do the same dailys for the season.
---
But the reward is nothing.
---
Dont take nothing less than 2 b2525 fixers...the nerve of some people....
---
Yeah, I know I finished the season too. What I‚Äôm saying is they add back atom challenges if your finished with the whole season
---
My nocturnal ss rolling pin will go for alot more, I only take 16:1 legacy offers for it
---
O = You; P = Your Power Armor; | = Blockade;
---
O | P 
---
Try to enter your power armor. It won't work and you'll just stand still for a moment. After that, run to the wall you wanna go through and keep walking against it until you magically enter your power armor. Ta-Da! You have glitched through the walls
---
Great ideas, take my upvote please.
---
My Pistol Pete alt thanks you, he‚Äôs kinda lonely cause he doesn‚Äôt get to come out and play much anymore.   Crazy lady melee gets all the action as of late.
---
Technically, the challenge would have competed as soon as you claimed the 21st one. The 22nd one wouldn‚Äôt have counted as part of the challenge and would remain ‚Äòunchecked‚Äô in the challenge menu. 
---
I think mine shows that I didn‚Äôt claim Wade Airport (my 22nd one), and Spruce Knob isn‚Äôt listed anymore. So even though it says (21/21), I only show 20 individual completions.
---
Lmao a bloodied acid soaker or quad acid soaker suppressors lmao or any of those and explosive acid soaker ahhahahahahshhahahahahh
---
I bought First a feew days ago but I only could redeem the NV Ranger outfit
---
I‚Äôve stopped actively earning them. If I happen to get some from an event then fine but I‚Äôm not doing the 3 settler/raider dailies anymore.
---
Dick.....ok that was funny
---
People who use communism memes unironically should read this
---
Maybe for ppl who accidentially drop a plan and destroy it so that they can purchase it again
---
Broken how? I‚Äôm newer to the game and have been investing in White Knight. Should I stop before I fully upgrade it and go for something else?
---
The only problem with it is having to eat and drink a lot more often but it's totally worth it.  Class freak doesn't reduce this, which is probably the bug they heard about.
---
Are you sure you don't want to buy some light wood laminate?
---
I miss meat week if only for this...
---
nope, you still get score despite being at max total and it does nothing
---
Yes I gave them so much wood
---
I‚Äôm going to be finishing today, even though I took a 2 week break (holiday). Of late haven‚Äôt been bothering with the level up ones either, if it‚Äôs not been convenient.
---
Yes, I know that what I‚Äôm saying is that once we‚Äôre finished with it we get atom challenges back
---
I accept it. That's why I don't engage in it.
---
Do i have to catch him?  F, 7 levels back...
---
Yes it's how it works.
---
I have one already, pretty sure I have all floor laminates and most of wallpapers available. I play from the premiere and if I wouldn't spend points in the shop (all earned through challenges except 3xF1st for a month) I would have at least 20k points so far.
---
All I can imagine is somebody in there on their 30th attempt to repair all the pipes.  "Alright, I'm going to get them all this time!!  This is it, this is the one!"
---
&gt; I fucked up therefore the game is shit
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be a challenge. If it‚Äôs a guaranteed win that would be a problem.
---
A greater variety of weapons and ammo types. I would like to see:
---
Pipe shotguns
---
Plasma shotguns
---
Gamma shotguns and snipers
---
Slug pellet mods and ammo
---
The Junk Jet
---
Throwable spears
---
Burst rifles
---
The deliverer
---
Maybe if people keep asking, it will happen.
---
Has this been patched yet?
---
Think of the ching ching though
---
maybe, maybe not. they may just jump into season 2
---
So you‚Äôre only level 30 at the end game of pre-wastelanders you‚Äôve been to area where the mobs are 50+ you‚Äôre under prepared for what your fighting it‚Äôs obviously going to be a slog.You went with only a singular keycard? These are easy to get just shooting a cargo bot that doesn‚Äôt fight back? I don‚Äôt think you should be done with fallout more just disappointed in yourself for making a mistake and pushing yourself through an are you aren‚Äôt prepared for
---
You should have bought the 7500 one it's obviously better
---
I've actually already had carpal tunnel surgery 10 years back haha
---
Tesla‚Äôs and Explosive Gatling Plasmas (with the splitter installed) have tanked the frame rate at every A Colossal Problem I‚Äôve been to. 
---
Seems like the user of the weapon doesn‚Äôt get the frame drop everyone around them does. If they did why would they continue to use the weapons while everything is moving in slow motion?
---
Why does that turn me on?
---
So far mole miners constantly provide shotgun shells..
---
Or trying to find the blast door
---
The game clearly tells you that the keycards are a one-time use only item, but that you can find more of them as well. It even gives you the ability to track a cargobot. 
---
The story didn‚Äôt end there because of anything the game did. The story ended there because ***you gave up because you made a mistake***.
---
It‚Äôs almost like actions have consequences, and when entering codes and information into a nuclear missile launch command terminal, accuracy is important. 
---
That sounds pretty realistic to me.
---
Before my friends list disappeared it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to join anyone anyways. Kept giving me the ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt retrieve friends list error‚Äù.
---
Yep, it‚Äôs assy... trades are a huge problem for me right now haha.
---
Well that was annoying. Only took three reloads, but used up nearly all of what little ammo I had running there multiple times.
---
I had a comment above saying Explosive used more durability before you even said that.
---
Faction based public teams. It would be a great way to find like minded people on the servers. Give some faction related buffs for each.
---
Reworking legendary effects and perks to make things more viable and fun. Give us a reason to try more and new builds.

**Nuclear keycard destruction causes me to quit.**
---
First of all, let me state that the Fallout Series is one of my favourite in all of gaming. I have played the living shit out of Fallout 4 and Fallout New Vegas. This is a bit of a rant.
---
I knew that Fallout 76 was shit at release and therefore chose to purchase it when the game was better patched and updated with more content. I purchased it about a month ago and have been hooked on it ever since. The game has so many flaws (my USB hardware gets disconnected every 5 minutes with this game...?) but just the tiny moments of some Protectrons talking shit makes it worthwhile to play. There is a distinct lack of a storyline, unlike Fallout 4 but which was written by a 7-year old.
---
Fast forward to just now, as I started the mission 'I Am Become Death'. The story totally lacked the reason as to why to launch a nuke (I had to do some digging to figure out online), but it would seriously kick ass. I got the Nuclear Keycard and failed to clear out Silo Alpha, as I did not bring any power armor and I got killed by all the robots and radiation in the reactor room as I did not have any repaired weapons. I am a level 30 player which is not terribly high.
---
Therefore, I repaired everything after I scavenged for ammo and adhesive+aluminium which took me more than an hours worth of time. I cleared everything in the silo. The tension builds from reaching the launch room with the modified protectrons walking to their desks. I insert the Nuclear Keycard in the launch terminal. I put the Nuclear launch code into the launch terminal.
---
**I made a typo.**
---
**It destroyed my only keycard.**
---
I am not going through that mess again for the anticlimactic ending.
---
If you choose to make a game where a key item is destroyed/unusable after a typo that will END your storyline, actually let the player know beforehand to get more of them or to be careful. Obviously I found out after Googling what the issue was and what I COULD have done to prevent it, but just figuring out in-game would have been impossible as it doesn't warn you.
---
I am so disappointed in this game. From the sick tension build-up to another 'shucks' moment within 20 seconds. I have just deleted it, don't know if I want to try again though. I have now seen what it looks like and I really don't think I have missed anything.
---
Might get attacked by people still defending this buttjuice of a game on this forum. You can for sure have fun with this game but for what maybe a week? After the lengthy main stories they‚Äôre is what 8-9 side missions? Lmao this is a joke to be called a fallout game but I still had a blast with friends getting to rank 100
---
Well I have it and I think it was one of the limited time ones
---
LMFAO.  It is a pretty small door after all.
---
Yeah true
---
Just because you can‚Äôt one hit thing a doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not fun. Everyone plays fallout differently mate. As for you observation about damage multipliers. That‚Äôs basically the way this works I can be beaten by level 5 scorched for about 20 mins without feeling it but as soon as I get an on par level enemy they can give what you give so it‚Äôs always an exciting combat experience much better than the way fallout 4 scaling feels.
---
It‚Äôs not really empty every two seconds you‚Äôll be met with a random encounter with an interesting character. You can encounter groups of raiders and settlers fighting the dangers of Appalachia which makes it feel like a more alive world than the exact same encounters in fallout 4 that only change with your choices (institute checkpoints that require help. Minute men under attack or brotherhood soldiers patrolling then commonwealth once the bos zeppelin arrives)
---
Just get too repetitive imo especially when none of these encounters affect your standing with the factions or net you a reward for helping
---
This thread is about exploring vaults....
---
I just did The Burrows underground for the first time. It has potential. I think a nice move would be to remove the quest markers from the compass. That would make it less railroaded. Dungeons are too easy with quest markers. Everything is too easy with quest markers.
---
When you turn in a daily faction quest, refuse payment.
---
It's so sad that we have to limit so many player choices in this games because the engine cant fucking handle it.
---
In that my armour breaks just as fast with it equipped for not.
---
Same for me,like we didn't have to endure enough bugs already
---
I won‚Äôt attack you I‚Äôll just say I don‚Äôt agree with your opinion. I enjoy this more than 4 personally. without dlc fallout 4 is bland and unenjoyable the most fun I had personally was with Nuka world and the enjoyment of being a raider (that and Preston doesn‚Äôt mark my lap anymore)

I want that trunk also. I always get so jealous when I see it in someones camp. :(
---
2 days ago,someone was lounged 2 nukes on queen and nobody showed up ,I waited for 5 minutes each time then decided to take her down if nobody coming! I took her down in less then minute and after last queen someone showed up just after 10 minutes üòÇü§£üòÇ and was with question marks üòÇü§£üòÇ.Sorry dude I took down your queens,but you not showed up and I want to say thanks for nukes
---
Yet here you are....
---
True Khrushchevism would mean we only get one crop
---
You know which one
---
As far as I know, the answer is no, you can not. There is no male or female version available.
---
I only drink from punch bowls and the like for a nuka trip. Next time (if I have time) I want to take off all my gear and make my way back to my camp or train station without looking at the map. A proper nuka adventure.
---
Yeah, it's bad on XBox - I can't join any friends' worlds (or even accept invitations), yet they can join me.
---
Has anyone at Bethesda ever acknowledged the insanely low scrip/bullion limits? Has there ever even been a ‚ÄúI‚Äôll raise this with the team!‚Äù? I honestly can‚Äôt think of a time when they‚Äôve acknowledged it.
---
Laughs in pc
---
Yeah, it's really nice. I'm glad I was able to grind out the Xmas and Halloween rewards though didn't do those the first time around either. Now I'm at level 100 in nw, just living that Bush life
---
Judging by the posts in the last 24 hours, I would say a shitload.
---
I have no intention of turning them in at the box though. Also, what happens if you drop the rest?
---
Take my money
---
No we will all have a excess of crops food and power
---
Tesla's have historically been a problem - and its not just ACP. We had a guy at Encryptid last night &amp; every time he fired, the frame rate went into the toilet...by the end of the event, it was super laggy.
---
Yeah I have that but thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
It was showing up fine yesterday. I‚Äôll have to check later to confirm though.
---
Are you on console or PC? My fianc√© is on PS4 and hers doesn‚Äôt show up in the thanksgiving display either.
---
So what your saying is that you modded FO4 to have a bloodied build and it was fun. Huh.
---
How funny. Thats why I specifically mentioned the VT Uni rewards. Because I missed the holiday rewards first time around but got them a couple months ago due to that glitch. Only I couldnt get the VT Uni rewards and as the old saying goes " You always want the things you cant have"
---
Same for me.  Public team on PC prior to release for XB, I saw 1 members bar drop/reset/drop/reset a whole bunch.  Dropped my PA, grabbed my trusty 2 shot Gatling, and fast traveled to help.  Imagine my surprise...
---
You can get a micro version of this if you go to the Colonel Kelly Monument. There seems to always be at least two Yao Gui there and a dozen radstags. They will all absolutely mob you.
---
Interesting finding. I wonder if that aspect is broken? Or just really bad RNG luck for you...
---
feel the same.
---
it's a constant work in progress...that is entertaining. They have my support.
---
Imo the bloodies are the damagedealers and full health builds are the tanks. A mix of both is most effective i think. I run 2 junkies and appreciate it when some bloodies are in my team especially for bosses like sbq and earle. On the other hand my bloody friends appreciate my full health build when im pulling aggro and dont die often or collect ores in rad rumble
---
I don't know why, maybe because it's energy damage before it's converted to explosive, who knows.
---
And this game isn't? There are hardly any quests for both settlers and raiders which makes no fucking sense.
---
Disagree on the map being empty. There are lots of small stories told by the ingame world.
---
Completely agree, I strongly dislike bullet sponges. Would like more tactical enemies rather than a larger health pool.
---
Sounds like a bloodied build would be for you, turns you into a glass cannon. If you don't use all the damage mitigating perks you die very easily, but you can one shot most things.
---
No your reward for finishing the season early is finishing the season early.
---
Not when their business model its to reduce ‚Äúfree‚Äù atoms gained from challenges so they can either sell them via first subscriptions or directly from the atom shop.
---
Constantly sharing goat legs, my usual squad has grown  to love it so I just have it on.
---
Yessss those look so good
---
I'd be down if everytime you filled the bar back up after the end of the season you could earn lunchboxes, supply kits, and atoms on rotation.
---
They want players to take a long time getting these items, they want to artificially make the game longer since there isn't anything else to do once you get the items you want.
---
Just another aspect of this broken end game that needs fixing. If they had a lot of different effects for weapons and armor more than they do now, and they were all semi-balanced, then the itemization wouldn't need to be artificially gated.
---
You can‚Äôt sell ammo to robot vendors or the settlers but you can to other players. 
---
The robots at train stations wouldn‚Äôt need it as they‚Äôre robots and. Can you guarantee the raiders and settlers are gonna use whatever ammo type you sell them? Are they gonna use the excess 1000‚Äôs of 50. Cal balls your gonna sell? No because they have their own stockpiles and ammo production
---
i can't recall where i read it, but i think it's september 8th.
---
I so want John woo dual pistols
---
I mean the thing is you can get legendaries of any item, including the armors that are obviously a different tier from eachother. Item tiers in 76 are harder for me to discern since its overall better about things having ups and downs but like most people are probably going to consider wood armor to be plainly inferior to later armors, unless they have a extremely specific build maybe.
---
yeah. I watched the vid. Earl looses the vast majority of health before stealth is broke because you got way ahead of the rest of the party. No one doubts the efficiency of a bloodied melee chem/food build.
---
Yessss! I was thinking about something like this the other day shortly after meat week started. I think it'd be awesome to have a chally plushie or even a Grahm one.
---
oh yes. Both of those. Especially the Liberator.
---
Yep same here, posted a couple days ago about it along with a few other people 
---
Reaching out to them has just been a waste of time so far, their asking me unrelated questions and asking me to forward ports and all that nonsense like it has anything to do with that 
---
How bout you just check your game and community Bethesda ?
---
Your ideal combat experience is literally just a bloodied build. If you want to die easier just take serendipity off. You can one shot nearly every mob when you‚Äôre fully locked into that build.
---
My armour and guns break at same speed with or without white knight and gunsmith max rank perk cards since about 2 patches ago.
---
All those limitations belong to free to play mobile trash, never were a part of good online projects. It's time to get rid of those limits. At least for scrip. Now it just a thing that makes people play less because they can't carry or keep those legendary items, don't want to just throw it away and the daily limit of 150 scrip is just a joke. Jest let people play, Bethesda, that's why you make that game, right?
---
This. I would be more willing to play for much longer rather than just logging in, turning in treasury notes, exchanging scrip, then logging out if there were higher caps or even none at all
---
&gt; There is no slayer's prefix that boosts damage against creatures.
---
Hunter‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt think it works on Cryptids, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it works on creatures.
---
What exactly are the differences between the double and the combat? Ive exclusively used combat as my shotgun for a while and curious if there's better options.
---
I have indeed, played an institute Assassin for the full game, and then switched to join the raiders after the main quest
---
I bought the alien plushie yesterday which I'm very happy with. Chally or Grahm would be great additions to the line-up. I expect there will be a Deathclaw Plushie at some point (considering its pretty iconic within Fallout).
---
This is a live service game Zenimax want Bethesda to continually update the game like elder scrolls online. they‚Äôre gonna keep adding to each faction the longer it‚Äôs out so I don‚Äôt have an issue with the lack of quests when there‚Äôs so many side missions to do
---
I've heard the following suggestion from someone on here and I think it's great: make the budget of atom shop items miniscule or 0 for the first time you place it, then normal budget if you build more than one.
---
Yes. I'm on PS4 and me and a sizable number of Discord friends are having this issue.  Bethesda is aware.  https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/43927/kw/friends
---
I would love an Eyebot within the CAMP. 
---
I remember the ones from Fallout 3 which played the American Anthem.
---
Whatd he say?

Small farm down the cranberry bog next to the lost home is great for bags of fertiliser if you need acid

Is this on PC or console?

280ish non crits with single shot anti armour exp fixer. 500-600ish crits here. Instigating lever is maybe  250ish non crit and 500ish crits. Quad lever i have does much the same and can more or leas continually vats hit him with it due to 20 rounds and fast ap regen. Full health sneak/vats/luck build. I‚Äôd say your damage was on par.
---
If I had that outfit, she'd probably be in it.
---
That's not going to do nearly enough for viability, especially after the damage changes.
---
You are near a spot where you can buy 2 levels for the cost of 1.
---
There''s a spot around 75 on the board that awards 150 atoms.  Buy the level (-150 atoms), you are immediately awarded +150 atoms.  net gain/loss of atoms is zero.
---
Buy the next level (-150). +2 levels, cost 150 atoms.  
---
Buy the next level.  (-150)  +3 levels for the cost of 2. 
---
Couple of challenges later, and you are now +4 levels in a few minutes.
---
Depending on how you want to look at it, earlier levels have awarded you 150 atoms at least 2x ; you can use those to advance a couple more levels "free"
---
  Oh, and if/when you buy a level, you do not lose score - (if you have 1000 towards the next level when you buy a level, you advance to the next level and still have the 1000 score).
---
  At least, that's the way it worked for me.
---
You can buy the ammo machine from the raiders when you're allied with them too üòä
---
Sounds like I have about another week or so before I need to spend some Atoms. I just didn‚Äôt want to get caught unawares since we all know their shitty reset schedules
---
My friend brought the SS Chest piece plan twice, as he is dozy as hell! We still take rinse him about it now and it was months ago

There's a friendly eyebot always outside of House of Fears that at least talks in what sounds like radio snippets. But I haven't been able to figure out what else they do, other than have a TON of dialogue lines. Maybe that's a companion for a future update?
---
Add a stock mod to them like laser pistols it just shows you how OP laser pistols and other pistols like that
---
It should have said (known) in the vendor list.   
---
I;d guess you bought it, didn't immediately learn it, so bought it again?
---
To try to avoid that scenario, I tend to make a purchase, exit the trade screen, learn the plan, then reenter the trade screen.
---
I dream about white light for pip boy since the beginning, I hate that green one
---
This isn't true, they don't give you any extra rewards. They are 100% useless unfortunately.
---
Why have two heads when you can have five
---
I just checked all ranks of the Score Board and didn't find it. It's completely possible I just missed it, but it's weird for it to not be there, since all things Armor Ace are there.
---
The other possible explanation is that it's place on the board is bugged, since there's the Greenhouse set that currently takes two spots, and Valseek already said it's a mistake that they'll fix sooner or later, as the Greenhouse is meant to take exclusively the lv 99 spot.
---
They don't count towards what you turn in at all, they're useless unfortunately.
---
This game has so many visual glitches. I‚Äôm sure when u restart or relog back on it will clear up
---
The Power Armor wall glitch works on any platform.
---
No, you've never been able to keep backpacks on in PA
---
Yes. people who don't know better
---
I did it for the first time couple of days ago (xbox), I see Captainoob do it alot, he plays on pc.
---
They need other helmets than the mining helmet that come with a bright light. Those helmets are ugly as hell but they add a ton of light
---
Just switch out your perk cards. And no, backpacks never worked in PA.
---
You‚Äôre getting banned, I‚Äôm recording and sending this to bethesda.
---
Get in line with the other 3000 people that have said the same line.
---
There isn't one.
---
if its any consolation, RNG for paint doesn't like me either.
---
The first 3 turn-ins I did, I got paint each time.  That was summer 2019.  
---
A bit over a year and IDK how many tech data turn-ins later - haven not gotten another paint.  And I've never seen a bomber jacket.
---
There was a glitch where entering a PA wouldn't unequip your other armor/outfit and add those stats to the PA. But that got fixed last year.
---
It should be 3000 scrip and bullion wallets 500 gold from treasury notes per day. and create scrip notes which are given for scrapping legendaries and then a machine to convert them into scrip with a similar limit of 500 per day. that way you can turn in as many legendaries as you want so it doesn't clog up your stash. 
---
Also Legendary modules should apply to all armors and weapons but cost significantly more and require a bullion cost component from the BOS (100 gold)  
---
so the current one with BOS Component will give a random 1 - 2 star legendary, which is sellable. 
---
A guaranteed 3-star modules would cost 300 scrip  plus the BOS component however these weapons/armor would be scarpable only for srip and gold and junk components. so as not to flood the vendor market.
---
Strange in numbers for me, and if there is a place for my mule, she shares inspirational \*\*\*

Hunter's requires the keyword ActorTypeAnimal. It doesn't work on arbitrary creatures, such as Mole Miners for example.

It's youse or yall in the rest of PA. Yinz is Pitts exclusive. They're not quite right.
---
Can you change the skin of the red scare jetpack to, say captain cosmo jetpack/torso, and still keep it on the excavator torso? At the moment I'm using a T-60 torso for jetpack mod and it really impacts my carry weight so this mod will be a god send but I like to change skins on my excavator.
---
You are good!  It's a little confusing as the quests were added years apart.
---
There are some logical points in the Wastelanders storyline to go off and do your own thing for a while.  Consider doing the old follow the holotapes questline then.
---
Furious 50 cal will be better against the actual queen since zealots and explosive effect don't hurt the queen. However, the ZE 50 cal will be better against all the queens scorched add ons that spawn.
---
There was a Christmas one last year and a Responders one earlier this year, both of which are quite nice- but would like to see more variety. I‚Äôm hoping for a Halloween themed one as well as some more faction based ones. 
---
There‚Äôs also a raider and settler one but those were only available with the paid bundle from Wastelanders launch.
---
I just got the deep mining gas mask and I wish there was a bright light mod for it
---
I'm sure they have a folder just for the reports people send in on me. LOL
---
I think I have that issue!
---
Furious all the way
---
Maybe whenever bethesda gives us the reward for the community event? Wishful thinking though.
---
Damnnn I was so hoping there would be. That's so disappointing
---
Ahh ok thanks for letting my know
---
I'm level 544 &amp; I feel extremely powerful. No, I don't play bloodied or junkies...I'm a high health, tanky build &amp; sure, it takes shots to take down the enemies, but that's a hell of a lot more fun than just walking up to whatever and one-shoting it. 
---
I don't want or need an easy button.

You don't

Jesus thought was doing well with 1560 of them.
---
I've been sharing Team Medic for A Colossal Problem.
---
For general game play, if someone is already sharing my go-to Strange In Numbers, I'll go for Tenderizer or Supressor.
---
Lmao exactly. What is with all this crying about something being the best option. Should all weapons have same stats, is that like the ideal option here? Same with builds. Christ
---
Aw man this is really worrying me lmao. I sure hope it's in the season rewards
---
That wasn't necessarily my fault...when the prime besties failed to show up...well it is hard to collect if they aren't there. Oh well, maybe during the second helping
---
I guess not! Scrip all the shitty .50 Cals and and Handmade as well, they're not the best
---
Slowly and painfully,üòÜ
---
Explosive and zealots doesn‚Äôt work on SBQ.  I believe the furious is superior, it will make the damage boost quick on a auto and works on everything.
---
Who gave you this impression?
---
Wow, so glad to see this post. I was wondering what happened, didn't know if maybe I had offended you somehow.
---
Somebody from Bethesda mistakenly said the backpack was going to work in PA before the dlc was released... But it was quickly corrected, and it of course created some drama. The backpack, like all regular armor has never worked in PA.
---
I'm always wary about the potential self-harm that explosives can do during SBQ fights.
---
So when I picked up Final Word from doing Beckett's quests (AA, FFR, reduced weight too IIRC) I figured I'd give it a shot.
---
It melts things.
---
I have a Furious Gatling Gun (no other modifiers) as my main, because it has stupid good reach on it, but when something big gets close, Final Word really is the final word.
---
How does that one work? The one I use takes about 5 minutes but I'd obviously like to do it quicker
---
It finally worked for me after the most recent update.
---
if you or a friend have FO1st, try the ounce of prevention on the private server. I was able to finish it that way.
---
Yeh it's the vail that opens it mate. Not sure if it's tradeable either. Been a long time since I've been near that quest line. Ask around though, maybe it is. If it is a quest item only thought then maybe its in your stash... Good luck.
---
It is! But have you seen the rug lol
---
Furious gives +45% damage after the 9th shot vs the Zealot's +30%, therefore, it can be better against SBs as they generally take more hits to kill.
---
Example: [Furious is about 14% better.](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-50CalMachineGun_L-45_ModReceiver-Standard_ModBarrel-Standard_Prefix-Furious_PHP-100_EHP-99_Enemy-Scorchbeast_Hits-10_Addicts-0_Kills-6_Other-0_Mult&amp;right=R_W-50CalMachineGun_L-45_ModReceiver-Standard_ModBarrel-Standard_Prefix-Zealots_PHP-100_EHP-99_Enemy-Scorchbeast_Hits-0_Addicts-0_Kills-6_Other-0_Mult) Both are worth priming.
---
&gt;Don't share rad sponge, it's annoying for every bloodied build in your party
---
ill give you a stick of pre-chewed nuka cola flavored gum

Oh no not in the slightest. I was surprised that we actually almost managed to kill it! What was your name on PSN? I'll send you and FR so we can try again some time
---
It‚Äôs going to end on a Tuesday at noon ET, when the weekly challenges end.  September 8th. 
---
Each season is ten weeks long.
---
I have a complete "I hate robots" gear set. So I swap over to a full health troubleshooters build for the event. Full set of troubleshooters SS armor and a TE handmade.
---
[fo76]H:Rules W:them followed
---
Putting an ultracite reciever on a furious weapon will drastically improve your damage to the SBQ. Furious is one of the best prefixes for any weapon that has an automatic reciever.
---
Dense does not help against legacy energy weapons. As they were never intended to be roll with explosive, so the mod/perk would not design/codes that way ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That's exactly what He said! He went on and on about how Bethesda only allowed 'Account name' to be displayed instead of his current character name. His other names include Gram, Gramalam, and Theodore Llewellyn Manfreid III, Esquire. LOL.
---
(You are not wrong. I swear my brain saw Graham instead of Grahm.)
---
And yet, even robots count as ‚Äòcreatures‚Äô for some challenges.
---
If I understand correctly, the explosive effect does basically nothing to the SBQ. Im assuming that Zealots actually does work on her for the following. Based on pure, cumulative dmg output and ignoring the explosive effect, the Zealots outperforms the Furious for the first 14 consecutive shots on SBQ.  After that, the Furious gradually pulls away.  Take into account that Furious effect resets itself when you hit sonething else, and also the decreased durability of explosive weapons.
---
Yeah its infuriatingly low. 
---
We need an increased scrip limit per day / a way to trade in legendary weapons like treasury notes so we dont have 600/800 of our stash filled with legendary weapons waiting to be traded
---
We need an increase in cap limit (100,000?) As its just a constant battle keeping your money in just the right balance so no one can come to your vendor and spend 9000 caps and you lose 3000 due to the limit
---
Increase gold bullion cap to 10,000 and increase the amount you can earn daily. Also 6000 caps for 300 gold?!?! That also needs to be more. 
---
Hands down I would play this game more often and more willingly if things weren't so tight. If i could earn the T65 power armour plans by grinding 8 hours a day for a few days, I would! Right now I can barely be assed logging on to claim 200 gold and 150 scrip every day just so that I can buy a T65 leg piece at the end of the week.
---
Easy not to die without stealth also my mellee tank can sit in front of Earle all day with almost 700 dr and vamp power fist or power armor with vamp heavy weapons the bottom line is that if your dying alot you need to rework your character or pay attention to the environmental dmg
---
Makes sense
---
It's a shame tho
---
Chally is love, is life.

Some people struggle with PvP.  Others struggle  to write a clear description of the events they‚Äôre complaining about.

Fucs Me she just bugged out in the power armor room for me :(
---
Had to logout and quest restarted WTF great job    Bethesda
---
Combat has more ammo but less damage. Double barrel has significantly higher damage but only 2 shots. Pump is in the middle with mid damage and a decent magazine
---
grow a spine bud. make your own decicions
---
Depends on the item, for example the hunters long coat can be purchased for a few hundred caps from the responder bot that roams. Yet I was happy to pay 10k for it because finding the damn not is so hard.
---
Sorry I just see lots of posts with offers.  Will delete and try again
---
I would seriously wait until patch 22 before your make a huge build change. You could spend a bunch of lvls now only to find out that something is now different and you have to again spend a bunch of lvls.
---
It'd encourage me to play more since I'd have goals to work toward. They should also do away with the 1000 scrip cap, absolutely no reason for it
---
Probably not the answer you're looking for but for me the answer is durability. I can use my double barrel for a week without repairing it. My combat breaks down in a few encounters.
---
Hey Bert!
---
bullshit ive had 200 + running for eight hours with no problems on private server......maybe it's your shitty compputer....who knows?
---
That sounds amazing! Where at? Can I get a recipe?
---
I've accumulated over 1k.  I get way more notes than I can turn in every day.  It would be really nice to turn in more than 20 a day.  The gold cap at 5k needs adjusted as well.

Not him, he was decked out with legacies,  he knew what he was doing

This happened to me. I had to do it three times. It finally worked though. But yeah, I feel your pain man.

Ok
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
that makes me feel like a clown cause i ended up selling Final Word, i was so set on the Zealots that i didn't think twice about it, urgh talk about dumb move. i use my heavy weapons against her and Earle (only found him once thus far but i will stick with heavy's)
---
I had a problem today morning, around 8 hours earlier. Still at work, so hopefully it'll be gone by 8PM.
---
I know about the changes and I want to try it out anyway cause I‚Äôve been doing the same thing gain and again

I got stuck on this last night, she froze in the PA room. Following advice from a post last month I used the photo mode glitch to skip through the door and rescue the power armor helmet at least...
---
I‚Äôm Xbox :(
---
Furious would be my preference. Zealots has more limited use, and Explosive is fun but not as effective as it used to be. 
---
And against the Queen, Furious will be noticeably better. 
---
Consider Priming it as well, if you can maintain the flux upkeep for the ammo. It would make an excellent SBQ weapon.
---
Mole Miners literally have a voice line about wanting to tear "blue suits" (vault dwellers...us) apart. They aren't running cause they're scared, they're running cause they're greedy and have too much on them to charge in and attempt to maul us to death like they normally would. THEY ARE NOT YOUR FRIEND!!!!!!

i have been hearing that a lot lately. i also recently got a Furious Handmade which i am comparing to my Medics Explosive Handmade. i have yet to attach a prime receiver mainly cause of my lack of ultracite scrap

I like to buy things from player vendors, the rare occasion I see a plan I dont know I normally buy it. But some players are really greedy, dont know how they get any sales for selling so high.

We need 2 and 3 together, so I can launch my MIRV fatman, and before they even detonate, start charging in with dual tricentenial auto-10mm in my tricentenial PA.

The Veil of mysteries becomes tradable/sellable/scrapable once you finish the quest, so you certainly could have gotten rid of it by accident. Super bad system. Luckily a lot of people are probably willing to part with theirs, if not for cheap some may give you theirs for free- I'd maybe check out a tradlng sub?
---
I play with pretty much the same group every weekend.

None of us are bloodied, so rad sponge works well.

---
The raider and settler ones were free the day Wastelanders dropped. Not part of the bundles.
---
There are still bugs from launch that haven't been fixed.
---
Hell, there are bugs from Fallout 4 that haven't been fixed and weaseled their way into 76.

See, I look at that set and the first thing I get excited about is *skylights*.

Finally have some rooms with actual windows and natural light!

And it's been patched out.  The ammo machine at the converted munitions factory no longer seems to be able to be blueprinted.

I used to do that but with 0 perks it makes it very difficult and annoying also we shouldn't have to
---
People in this community, sheesh. Want to think they matter, but all that matters is your $.
---
Maybe daily Op reward?
---
The problem with endurance for heavy weapons, is that strength increases your carrying capacity, which without bear arms and decent strength, heavy weapons are incredibly oppressive to carrying any other equipment
---
Furious ads max. 45% more damage to one target (5% with each of 9 bullets hit on the same target), regardless if it's scorched, mutant or anything else. Zealots ads 30% more damage only to scorched and SB's. What do you think is better?
---
I got a Bloodied weapon since I'm a Bloodied build, sort of helps
---
Ah my mistake I thought they were included with the other bits like the planters and outfits in that bundle
---
Can you cite a source?  That was never my experience.
---
Bring on the battle cattle!
---
Right! 
---
Not being able to use windows because they are either broken or these tiny little things that are also covered in security caging is probably the thing I find most annoying about building
---
Just Raise the Roof üòÇ
---
I don't think this game would even be able to handle mounts, followers, or pets performance-wise.
---
Didn't work.
---
Oh it's all good. I really just didn't want the guy dropping that insane $20 a package and finding that they didn't include the tents
---
I'd like people to share lockpicking, hacking, goat legs, or strange in numbers because I don't have room to use those anymore. üòÑ
---
Was this about 8-10 hours ago on PS4 near that train wreck above whitesprings?  Thanks if so - I collected a lot of flux from that nuke.
---
I will never do bloodied but that's a good route we just need better options for melee characters
---
And with no fanfare or cool celebration of your achievement- just stark corporate dull finality
---
Ugh please don't remind me about it. Every damn time I exchanged my treasury notes, I always put angry emote and start attacking the gold dispenser. It actually help with the frustration for me, I guess.. üòî
---
More about nostalgia then Conan Exiles;)
---
i have no yet used the Furious one yet. i have been hearing much better reviews about Furious weapons as of late so i am very curious about them. i will be trying to Furious one at my next big event. i am also doing a comparison between my recently picked up Furious Handmade and my Medics Explosive Handmade (generally the gun i use when roaming around)
---
Had a similar situation with being part of a two man team. Except I think the other player was just there to farm screws, either that or they saw we couldn‚Äôt kill Earle before the timer ran out. Their mic symbol kept flashing up, so obviously they were trying to tell me, but area chat is incredibly quiet for me (yes, I turned up the chat volume.)
---
Sorry to hear
---
The degrade reduction effects on both WK and Gunsmith seem to be entirely busted since Wastelanders.
---
I remember back in Fallout 4 I made a mod that removed the junk components from certain junk items I liked and wanted to keep. Dog tags, Maccready‚Äôs toy soldier, souvenir stuff from lunchboxes, that kinda stuff.
---
Absolutely. Similar to Cargobot I think they need to have a Sentry Bot with a Keycard, being escorted by a couple Assaultrons.
---
At least FO4 had the basic Grognak outfit, so having it (or variants) in 76 has at least a sliver of logic to it.
---
The new bundle (name escapes me)...looks more middle ages/medieval-ish, which AFAIK, has not been in any previous games.
---
Yes exactly make it tough I don't care
---
If you won't change the target and allow the bonus 5%s of damage accumulate, Furious always will be better than any enemy-related affix.
---
I think the brick walls with the contemporary porch pieces looks fabu.
---
Still, I'd rather get more Fallout &amp; less FortNite.
---
Same issue on XBOX
---
Would a Troublshooters Rifle do the trick? I would think and Automatic TS rifle would bring it down. 
---
Or maybe a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù shotgun. Then you could swap a couple strength cards for shotgun cards just to bring it down?
---
I've been grinding CP
---
I think there‚Äôs a high likelihood of that. They know it‚Äôs going to be one of the most desirable sets, and ultimately has such a wide utility that everyone should have the chance to get it.
---
Go full anime. Rocket boost jump to hovering near the enemy in slashing distance.
---
Grahm usually helps me in Line in the sand? public event but yesterday was diferent. I don't know why, but my Beckett followed me to the event and started kill the scorched? The event fails and he left. I followed him all the way, I think he was trying to come back to my camp (near to Charleston train station). We pass trough Whitespring, we were close to a fissure and a two start Scorched Beast spawned there. I lost Beckett when he started shooting this flying beast. I'm feeling lonely, sad, but my savior appeared. Grahm was fighting with me, we three (Grahm, Chally and me) won this battle! Beckett just disappear, he left me alone with the most dangerous creature we fight in this trip :(
---
Of course I bought some stuff from Grahm, he helped me a lot, thanks to him the scorched beast was on the floor, not flyiging all the time
---
I haven't seen Beckett since there. I think he still walking to my camp, fighting creatures and telling stories to the people he meet in the way to home.
---
I and several friends are having the same issue on xbox
---
With how lackluster events are when they finish (just fade out of existence if you‚Äôre in the area) I don‚Äôt know what everyone expected you already got atoms/lunchboxes/repair and scrap kits exclusive skins and other rewards You were given plenty of rewards for playing you didn‚Äôt need to grind it out or play everyday to finish the pass it was your choice to finish early is the attitude Bethesda have
---
I sell all my plans at 1 cap each, along with ammo....I just want it gone, I really don't look to make much of a profit.
---
Yeah, it's the R&amp;G station where I got it from.
---
I am melee as well, but I carry a ranged weapon or two to take down vertibots, cargobots, and other things that fly but don't land (very often).
---
Skylights, modern houses. I can see it already. The warehouse set from Fallout 4 is very similar and worked a treat for settlement building.
---
you could start singing to your visitors, either to scare them off. or to make them think you are fun to be around.. depending on how well you can sing
---
I knew the moment I saw that grelok plushie in the shop that I wanted to make it ride that deathclaw statue.
---
Previously I had the deathclaw statue menacing the astro-cat plushie.
---
Lmao. Vaults: "yo WTF we're TRYING  to be hermits."
---
agreed. i had that goin on. looks great no doubt but im diggin the neglected look just as much. CAMP is my fav 76 feature
---
FYI, an item‚Äôs Base Value is *not* what you can buy or sell it for at a vendorbot. 
---
You can sell an item for up to 25% of its Base Value *(at effective Charisma of 20+)*, and you can purchase an item for as low as 175% of its Base Value *(at effective Charisma of 25+)*
---
For example, Mutation Serums have a Base Value of 2000. You can sell them to a vendorbot for 500 caps, or buy them from a vendorbot for 3500.
---
I list common items at about 20-25% of their Base Value.  There are some exceptions, of course. Serums I list for 299c, for example. 
---
Anyone selling common items for Base Value will not have much success.
---
Double barrer has SIGNIFICANTLY higher damage. A maxed out modded combat shotgun with fucking Double Shot legendary perk, still does less damage than a double barrel. Double barrel also fires and reloads faster. The "balancing drawback" is that it only holds two rounds. 
---
But if you get one with a Quad Legendary perk like I have. It is just  a fucking MELTER of enemies. It one shots any humoid style enemy, two shots most crypids and mirelurk kings. And melts in one clip scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens. And one clip takes about a second  and a half to fire because of the fast fire rate.
---
it does the same with all projectile based weapons.. if it is going to hit anyway
---
Ah ok thanks for letting me know!  I got a 3* ultracite gatling upon finishing.  Was also able to loot the chest at the end but nothing real spectacular inside.  I hear yah about stims, I dwindled mine down to about nothing, now I‚Äôve gotta go vendor hopping to replenish my stash!
---
When he hits the end, the race is over, so you need to by the end.
---
At least in Fallout the tatos are half tomato
---
you can buy them for about 500 caps.
---
Really? I guess you can just see the plasma arc better.
---
Sometimes you just got to dump caps quick before you max. Especially if your vendor is going crazy. So I have bought plans for list. I'm never  happy about doing it though.
---
My vendor stuff  is usually listed 10% of suggested value. I do this to move inventory and help people out.
---
Depends.  
---
Once I get above 20k caps, I may pay an inflated price for something I don't have, just to make sure I stay below limit.  Or if I am at a bot vendor, not bother with swapping out for hard bargain.
---
you can quite flexing anytime lmao
---
yep, hitscan weapons (weapons with bullets) just say you did damage, projectiles you will see curve to their target if it is gonna hit. a good test to show that is to use a missile launcher on a flying enemy (like a hostile cargobot)
---
Try getting inside one of the Pulowski Preservation Shetlers outside the Manor and closing the door behind you üòâ
---
I aggressively close any doors they leave open. Aside from that, I just go about my business.
---
I don‚Äôt mind but close the door god damned!!!
---
I hide on my roof when I'm afk at my camp too haha. I'm not uncomfortable, but I don't want other people visiting to feel like they're being scrutinized the whole time they're there.
---
This event even have a reward?  Did it my first time two days ago...
---
Nothing.  Blew like 1000 rounds of 50 cal and 30 rounds of explosive shotgun.
---
Seconding this? Not saying anyone's wrong... though I'm kinda hoping they are. XD That glass building set is one of the few things I *really* want, but after -finally- finishing the first season, I seriously need a break...
---
Bethesda replied to a reddit post about it and confirmed its a new bug that they are aware of and working in fixing
---
ffs how do they let stuff like that stay in for so long. nuke runs are like a frankenstein's monster of exploits at this point
---
Im pretty sure its the same as FO4. The glasshouse pieces were included with the warehouse set in that game. For some reason it was separated in this one
---
Squad maneuvers or revenant
---
That would be funny if it stayed just as cute with the adorable little noise it makes
---
FINALLY! 
---
Okay so I love doing this event as well as Radiation Rumble and SBQ. I'll join whenever there's event like this and try my best for medic support. 
---
The one that pisses me off when 2 level 20+ were AFK on top of the mine next to a bench doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! You wasted other players' opportunity to actually genuinely wanting to join. 
---
So low levels, please avoid joining ACP event until you actually can support yourself üòî
---
Nah, people are clearly complaining about bloodied fixers shitting on everything just because they're jealous. It has nothing to do with horrendous balance and obvious choices outperforming anything fun to a laughable degree
---
People call it magic dmg and it's triggered by few secondary effects like 40% bash, 33% VATS, 50% limb. Even junkies can trigger it.
---
When i first tried to launch a nuke i chased cargo bot for half an hour with a shotgun. Used like 500 rounds. Finally gave up and used a hunting rifle, the longest range weapon i had. Took another half hour.
---
Yeah I skipped the nuclear windier challenges that required me to do more then place a camp three time.
---
Yeah, I got rid of some but still like half my bar is rads
---
wow nice; I'm happy for you
---
I'll spread your story , thanks for the heads up
---
What? He didn't said them being allies (like Beckett). They could be just like scrap collectron, unkillable and untargetable. Even if eyebots were supposed to be actual allies, they could be buffed.
---
Them being able to repair our camp/workshop is too much I think. Them being a flying radio broadcaster and also informing us if our camp is being attacked is plenty already (at least for me).
---
Or, Bessie could go haywire and it could be a daily quest to subdue and reprogram her.
---
now i can't even do the trade due to this bug.... dam.
---
r/angryupvote
---
Yeah, I do find it a bit odd especially since the community has asked for so many other things.
---
FO76 Community: Hey, could we like get some inside walls and maybe some ceilings?
---
Bethesda: Super idea!! Look! It's Grelok Week, check out the wizard throne, wizard outfit, wizard wand, and he cackles! There's even a plushie, isn't it cute!!
---
i'm on xbox one unfortunately, but thank you anyway
---
You can find some ammo boxes in Camden Park. And some shells near the entrance, just explore and you'll find it. You can get some plastic too but I think Morgantown Highschool is a better place to get plastic
---
My problem is that I don't have the blood sample anymore. It took my sample.
---
Well thanks for the warning. I'll bring a jetpack from now on.
---
Usually ignore them...I only get annoyed when they try to initiate trades with me.
---
I wish ... sadly no . If you know anything about the gaming industry and what happens to Studios and IP once bought up . You will learn that anything that is made to incentivize spending money will be added and never changed back .
---
Backpacks never worked in PA.
---
Your reward is having a short break from the mental abuse that is being forced to log in every day to get free DLC.
---
They need to make a full auto gauss pistol and gauss rifle. There is a full auto equivalent for big guns already. Pistols are pretty useless and after the nerf goes live they will be completely useless. The alien blaster should be the top dog on pistols and should have a mod that it can be made a rifle and or full auto. I agree with the op on the rare weapons. They should be superior to the more common variant for all you  have to go through for them. Who ever is in charge of this has apparently never played a fallout game before this.
---
i really dont lol. theres nothing edgy about thinking words a dumb when they are.
---
No it's always been like that. You trigger them the first time you walk into Crater or Foundation, then they are viewable until you complete them. Then you have to go there everyday to trigger them. They reset at 8:00pm EST every day.
---
Spec a few cards into shotguns so that you can do a quick(ish) switch of your cards.
---
Don‚Äôt die
---
I'm waiting for the Mrs. Pebbles Backpack :(
---
I usually get messages from players through Xbox saying how amazing my camps are. I would love a mail box system in game though.
---
Didn't ask if Bethesda could make an imaginary game that has zero bugs in it. I asked for a C.A.M.P. ally that I hope to see someday. Move along with your complaint, cuz its getting rly old seeing people try to demand something that obviously cant be helped
---
Kinda hard to avoid when the debris insta kills you
---
The worst perk you could get 
---
Especially on freaking mellee weapons
---
I tried solo on my private server yesterday, full unyielding strength armour and a power attack DCG, all the meats and chems and level 5 adrenaline card stacking off the 3 wendigos before you drop down, hit him with a power attack sneak crit and he was left with about 5% health then he regened, if I'd not of forgotten to take my whiskey in there i think it'd of been a one shot kill, he died in 3 hits. Nukashine would definitely do it though. A new endgame boss shouldn't die that easy. The nerf should of came before the event imo.
---
I personally think that they are just scrip, but it depends on what your hunting, if you mean pvp, or smiles per round (:
---
So glad I got all 4 items in one day of farming the event by server hopping
---
Really everyone the point is that we shouldn't need a gun and shotguns are you joking
---
Ah alright thanks for the tip!
---
Ok, hear me out. Babylonian inspired faction a la Caesar's Legion, who worships the Brahmin Bull of Heaven.
---
I love visitors , meat week was amazing . Had my meat week inspired camp  Right next to the event .
---
Maby they could even add like workshops that are contested territory for factions that you have to work together t defend against other factions.
---
Oh
---
Fuck
---
You "cow"erd hiding behind the bramen pen during the "cow"lossus  "cows" you know he can't hit you there atleast unarmed melee guys "cow"ragious enough to face him... ok ill leave
---
Looks like I‚Äôm grinding out 15 lvls today
---
Gotta pay attention to it, end game shouldn‚Äôt be easy
---
Hi, my name is Mike, and I'm bad at PVP.... wrong meeting?
---
yeah, most of the time they ignore me so I ignore them too, doing my own stuff. Had to put a lock on certain door because apparently it's too hard for anyone to fucking close it! I had a free unlocked ammo machine (ArmCo or whatever it's called) and a  shower free for anyone to use, but nobody ever closed a fucking door so I just locked it. Everyone enjoys free stuff but nobody wants to show a little gratitude by performing a most simple action.. Sry, I wanted to just comment on awkwardness but it turned into a rant, lol.
---
I get Schwifty.
---
99?
---
Damn. I was hoping that I wouldn't have anything to push for
---
Not that I could tell - I tried it just the other week. On the other hand I didn't have the perks maxed out and with such a low base damage it might have just not shown.
---
All five of my characters are completely done with all the crap their is to do in the game. At 4200 hours I decided to take a break to let more content build up , so I'd have something to do when I come back. So far since I've been on break they added one new boss event.
---
I had to go into a private server to complete the quest. No matter what server I joined every single public server gave me an error. Are you having the issue where you put the blood sample in, followed by the fuse and then the terminal said there was no blood sample inserted? And then when you load into a new server the blood sample is already in but you still get the same error and have the fuse back in your inventory?
---
Try this. Load into a server. Go to AVR and before you do anything, go into the terminal and analyze the blood sample. Do not install the fuse until you try that. I can't remember exactly what order but you might have to mess around until it works. I know for a fact if you install the fuse first you'll continue to have the bug.
---
Evan Conan Exiles can't always handle all the features it has hence the /s, I do respect them for their ambition though.
---
Tent skins would be very cool!
---
I went to a persons camp and waved at them like 3 times but they just ignored me and ran past each time so I left a bag of spoiled veggies on their table. I just wanted to say hi =(
---
I'd be happy with a Gold Plan version from Foundation, but I'd also be happy with the flaming long bow version working with Friendly Fire Perk...
---
You're correct, if a person thinks certain words are dumb, thats just an opinion. 
---
But when a person tries to seem cool and belittle others by saying certain words are dumb, then it becomes edgy and cringy. 
---
That user didn't just post, "I think those words are dumb." They posted that they basically dislike that those words became common use and implied people are dumb for using them and look stupid when saying them. Thats what makes it edgy and being edgy like that is cringy. 
---
Also, I never stated anywhere that I like those words or that I'm offended. So now you're just foolishly assuming things about strangers. That's what I consider to truly be dumb lol
---
My bad i read too quickly and did not see the /s
---
don't play bloodied. don't have 20% health.
---
Haha, yeah. I always wave back, but I stopped doing it first, because I usually get ignored as well. Not that it bothers me much tho.
---
I mean you can move you mouse sideways in power armor
---
However you can without it
---
I guess it would depend on the build, if you are a stealth commando and use VATS, then it works great.  I made it from level 50-75 using a Stalker's Exp Sniper Rifle, ammo is common and just tried to sneak around and get everything in VATS, I would def take that over some of the other prefixes like Assassin's, Berserker's, Exterminator's, Ghoul Slayer's, Hunter's, Mutant's, Mutant Slayer's, Nocturnal, Troubleshooter's, or Zealot's
---
I carry on with whatever I was doing.
---
Sometimes I'll break and check their level, drop a gift or two if they are low.
---
yea it's broken for a tonne of people. seems to be tied ot if you were online at the magic time.  
---
i managed to send an new friend request to someone who i was already friends with, they were able to accept and join my private world, but after about 15 min, they disappeared from my list again.
---
yes, exactly. like, you are at my camp. my vending machines are right there. anything i would want to sell, i put in them. no, i dont wanna buy your assassin's hunting knife.
---
since it's called a "villain bundle" or whatever, i think he's grognak's enemy in the in-universe comics.
---
How do you get a flamer that shoots projectiles like that?
---
Do you want the communist camp bundle? The answer to this question is my answer to you.
---
We are getting a free bunker next season so there's that to consider
---
I just carry on as normal, if they want something they‚Äôll buy it with or without you there.
---
I'm seeing much higher levels than I used; playinng on European PC servers. Few weeks after Steam launch there were lvls 10-30 everywhere, now it's way up.
---
Alright i didnt know that. Badass
---
Yes if it also has the door from [the cast iron stove as a piece of chest armor a la back to the future 3](https://youtu.be/TmGUFNLkxxQ)
---
I want lore friendly outfits...getting tired of all this gimmick shit.
---
Farming plans and legendaries are really all we have in terms of endgame, no reason to rush it ü§£
---
Players who have crap to get rid of that feel guilty just dropping it, unite!
---
I mean is it really worth the 1000 Atoms? Does it have bugs?
---
Some people are such penises with their vendors. I wish you could leave feedback. I am not paying 30,000 for a ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been insulted‚Äù note.
---
I'm sure your wondering about damage calc for the bosses the damage resist doesnt get affected by players the life total is unreal i give him endangerol and use psyco  i notice the endangerol does almost nothing unless im hitting him for 1000 then i get like 100 more damage out of it i am using the cursed pickaxe honestly idc if its not god drop its fun
---
Thats so cool.
---
What bug on ounce of prevention (it's been a while since I was that close to the beginning)
---
If i'm not mistaken, every weapon slows you down except for weapons. Heavy weapons slow you down the most, obviously. Rifles slow you down as well, but pistols don't.
---
It's a small, almost unnoticable difference, but if you try it, it will become very obvious.
---
I wanna say dual wield, but with dual wield pistols you will need dual wield one hand melee weapons. I have some seriously OP one hand melee weapons. Just got rid of a bloodied guitar sword in my vendor the other night. When chems, food, and perks right that MFer was doing an easy 600-700 damage per strike to SBQ. I seen way over 900 per strike on most normal enemies. I just don't like to run bloodied.
---
Me too. Called it the meet market.
---
Yes but going into a private server should allow you to analyze the sample and continue the quest.
---
  You are absolutely right.  My Friend google says:
---
 *Grelok* is a fictional character created by Hubris Comics and a villain in the Grognak the Barbarian series
---
My first new visitor last night as I was finishing some redecorating seemed to be having trouble finding my vendor. So I threw the follow me emote and led him to my circus trailer filled with meat piles and the Earle decapitated head totem, then closed the door behind. It's good to make guests feel at home.
---
For sneak, scout armor outclasses both vault and secret service armor actually, due to it getting muffled and shadowed (which afaik secret service doesnt), and the sneaking legendary effect (afaik vault doesnt), and also outclasses other normal armors since all 4 limbs can take muffled instead of just the legs. Theres always going to be a best in slot, but it is a bit of a shame, yes.
---
Iean those ones are usually done as jokes.  I have that one up for 666 caps and a note called "asphyxiation and you" up for 69.  simply for the memes
---
I havent heard of any bugs with it, and the one time i saw someone who had it the fence and bunker looked nice and the bunker door functioned properly
---
For me it's the shovels.
---
I want a purple light...also I miss the Pip-Boy Light mod from Fallout 4 so much. So much more immersive than Bethesda's illuminate-all light.
---
The rug is uglier than Earle
---
Wait - so I‚Äôve been running around with 5 intelligence points in a perk that doesn‚Äôt help me at all outside a workbench?
---
omae wa mou shindeiru
---
Sounds to me like you're the salty one.
---
Awww, somebody else calls them yard sales too?  So this is what it feels like when doves cry.
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking might have happened. Unfortunately it‚Äôs under my log cabin. I did try to lift the cabin but didn‚Äôt see if. I might just have to break just that one down and try to find it. I guess that‚Äôs better than rebuilding my entire camp. Thanks for the help!
---
Aqua Girl
---
I wonder the same, to be honest. As I understand it if the person bought stuff like that they're most likely desperate of finding what they need cheaper or just want the caps gone quickly. I like shopping in game (and irl xD) but I like good deals. I don't expect people selling stuff for close to nothing, I understand some want profit, but I would never buy overpriced stuff or stuff as good as the suggested value with exception of some rare or needed items.
---
Strange in numbers
---
Awesome, TYVM!
---
One day I‚Äôm gonna buy one, and laugh as the person hits max caps
---
Lots of Shovels - finally got the pickaxe though, and a couple of Harpoon guns. I only got one Taxidermy Plan...would love to get another one.
---
They also need to fix the display glitch, so I can mount them on the wall.
---
I did try this. Unfortunately it‚Äôs gone missing for 3 days now. Thanks for the idea though!  I‚Äôm desperate to try anything
---
That would explain my Fixer breaking a minimum of once at the ACP event despite it being on 5. Good to know.
---
Pretty much until Bethesda fixes it. I out on demolition perk in intelligence for the extra 60% damage from explosive lever and fixer as break rate is currently the same. Gets tedious repairing after or even during every boss fight. Have loads if improved repair kits from SBQ and carry 10 on me at all times for on the move repairs.
---
Can confirm they are not, paid for Raiders and Settlers bundle because I love the raiders aesthetics and it did not include the survival tent skin much to my sadness as I would love it.
---
I'd also love to buy cages with corpses in them (beyond the tree which I've got), heads on spikes, and that throne from the raider tent in the atom shop.
---
That's too bad. Did you try submitting a ticket? If nothing else helps or you cannot find the solution on the internet it's your best shot.
---
Also weapons that create ash/goo piles can cause the boss‚Äô body to be lost making it unlootable.
---
I think you just described line in the sand
---
I am also on xbox.  My Tesla is fine in uranium fever, but if there is a second person with a Tesla, some areas get very laggy.  2 people with teslas at radiation rumble will drop the frame rate to unplayable.   It can even mess up one violent night, if I end up with a huge pile of bodies by the jukebox.
---
I'd been trying to regain ammo so I arrived with 6 shotgun shells and my trusty combat knife that I'd been farming low level events with. Things did not go well.
---
I called 3 local Target's the day it was announced to put in pre-orders and of course by the day it released they suddenly had none left. Fuck Target.
---
The bunker does have a bug. Anything you place it in floats an inch or so over the ground.
---
I run a couple of "funhouses" so interacting with visitors is part of my gig. I'll let them shop in peace while using some glitched creations I've put together (like a chair inside the deathclaw topiary or a mr fuzzy ride inside the car storage chest). If their interest is piqued, I'll signal for them to follow me while I show off everything else in the camps (underground shooting range, launch-able missiles, underground lake, etc.). I've gotten close to 100 messages telling me that I have the best camp they've seen in game, so those that explore really like the tours. Others just shop and FT out, missing everything.
---
I wanna know what prick at Bethesda thought it would be funny to put one of those invisible fire things right in front of the escape tunnel, it‚Äôs such BS. I‚Äôve died 9 times out of 10 trying to escape the mine because of that spot. Nothing falling from above, no visuals on the ground, you just walk towards the exit, burst into flames, and insta die. (If you‚Äôre a bloodied build.)
---
I‚Äôve taken to looting windigos for screws mid fight since I know I‚Äôm gonna die before getting out and making it to the chest anyways, may as well get something.
---
If you want just the bunker you can buy it separately for 700 atoms, it has some issues:
---
- 1. It has a very shallow foundation which makes it hard to place nicely on uneven surfaces
---
- 2. The door That comes with has the exact same audio as the garage doors that are already in the game but it does not match as it has a shorter animation
---
- 3. There is a slight issue with the navmesh on the inside so everything you place inside of it will float a few inches off the floor
---
I myself bought it cause I like the prefab and hopefully they will fix the issues in a future update, if you like the model, buy it, it will probably come back on the Atom Shop at some point In The future bit as mention in another comment, Season 2 will have a Prefab BoS Themed bunker
---
I just sit on my Grelok throne and laugh at their inferiority
---
Huh i didnt notice that when i visited said camp. I wasnt paying much attention to the benches though. Thats and odd bug
---
I spam crouch and dance around with my Protest sign "MY DAD NEEDS A JOB." 
---
They think I'm nuts.
---
I usually wave and then go about what I was doing. If they show up right when I was about to head out, then it gets a little awkward. Then I wave and go around harvesting stuff and picking off whatever enemies spawned in when they came to visit.
---
I would love to use a chainsaw again.
---
If they also did it for the drill - they could make mods for it based on drillbits!
---
IE. - Brad Point - extra armour pen, extra damage  - Spade bit - target bleeds, extra damage - hole saw - superior damage.
---
An "extra handle" mod - to make it two handed to use two handed perks? And of course some sort of flame mod.
---
They only drop from the SBQ
---
Almost feels like they did it on purpose to force repair kit sales
---
Baby steps,i just want one.....
---
Same
---
Jones is actual glass bottles. At least once a month pre covid I would go to big lots or walmart as they are the only local places that carry Jones and buy them out normally.   
---
Now if I could just get my blue bubblegum out here on the east coast that would be nice.
---
They are rare on normal SBs. More common on the queen
---
Try the Queen.  I haven't seen an ultracite mod on a reg scorchbeast in forever.  All of mine have come from the Queen
---
First of all this has nothing with your camp location to do. It's more the 'hitbox' of an item. 
---
 I don't know any way to break that shitty mechanic. And tbh I don't there is one. It's a thing since release and if I remember right I got that trouble also in Fallout 4. I have send several tickets to Bethesda because of it but it is not relevant for them to fix I guess
---
That's the robot that leads Mischief Night the Halloween event at The Whitesprings.
---
What did you expect to get from a mine if not pickaxes and shovels?
---
Your suggested change for rifles would really mess with vats rifles builds though, itd have to be a headshot damage boost imo.
---
Also as much as creature specific effects being buffed would be nice, if they were the new best in slot, itd just mean youd have to grind 4x as many weapons, and carry around 4x as many weapons. They should be maybe a 50% boost at absolute max imo, theyd be such a pain in the ass if they were very good.
---
Gamma guns can hit for a LOT of damage already, as can pipe revolvers (pipe i can hit about 5k per shot, gamma more like 3k or so, but theyre buggy, it should be doing a little more than the pipe according to the item card). Pistols could use something but not doubling their dps with dual wielding, maybe make their perks cost less points, so theyre less of an investment or something, it is a pistol, it really shouldnt outclass rifles or any other guns really.
---
The rest of the ideas i mostly like though :)
---
This is awesome, deserves more updoots
---
What platform you on? I wanne visit
---
Name it Big Earl
---
I would also take a plan, and being able to craft iy
---
Jesus, it will be just like in TESO. There are a lot of vendors already and most of them are in fixed locations. While I wouldn't mind a summoned vendor I'd rather not.. It was a nightmare in teso where people always forgot to unsummon them during fights and such and they always got in the way, imagine that but in Fallout, standing on the way, eating your ammo.
---
Yes, insultbot says my camp looks like a pile of garbage, so I'm a bit conscientious.

tells you the odds here
---
The most logical time to implement it IF they ever intend to use it is around the time of the actual US elections, which is probably what Shaking-N-Baking was talking about.
---
Didn't think of that XD that banker was op survived anything
---
I don't buy anything at or above retail price, and I don't think anybody else should. Only thing I buy above retail is legendaries, and I don't buy that many nowadays.
---
Guass rifle works well with no perks.
---
Will there be rewards tied to the vaults like before?
---
I'm on PS4 and use my tesla for lots of mob based events and have never had a frame drop. If it happens to others around me, it's definitely not intentional. Don't blame players for the developers fuck up ü§£
---
Does he not ever move from the bar so you can just scrap the bar?
---
Are you on console? I had a similar problem when doing the quest. I found a video where once you load back into a server go down to the room and DO NOT try and put the t-fuse in the circuit box again, just try and analyze the blood sample on the terminal.
---
Yeah, I really hated them xD
---
You can go out of map bounds through MODUS's core room, the left wall doesn't block you from going through.  
---
From there on you can jump and walk across the roof/walls of the bunker map and eventually drop down into the presidential suite. Not much to see there tbh, and you could just watch a YT video to see what's there. No notable loot either btw.
---
Yeah, i made a mule and called him booby, I regret that decision now.
---
But...why?
---
That's a no from me son.
---
It's 1k from the bot
---
Could really use a dusty god roll right about now. Nearly lvl 170, and the only way I can 1shot anything is if I sneak up on it and hit it with an axe or sledge.
---
#worstluckwithmurtagh
---
I'm down voting you just  to get another wee reaction......
---
I had not noticed that. I made countless visits to the frat house until it finally spawned the "Wild" variant to complete the Possum challenge. Still hardly the worst grind in the game.
---
It's a BoS bunker though, just in case you dont like that faction I mean
---
But, knowing that it causes problems &amp; you still choose to use it, it's on you.
---
If I‚Äôm really hunting something and tired of hopping I will.
---
Maybe there can be a vault like Fo3 Vault 108 Gary and his other brothers Gary but it can be filled with Todds?
---
I just did one a few minutes ago.  Killed Earle, grabed that loot, then a bunch were hanging back to kill spawns and loot real quick.  Figured I can do that, it doesn't take too long to get out and there is a buffer at the end so you cna keep running after the timer expires a little.  So I do that, get over encumbered, jump into PA (I run it without), and realized I have no fusion cores.  Now I have no time left and am stuck so I FT to the nearest point and lose out on completing the event.  Think I would have been better of dying.
---
I never stopped using a chainsaw, i still take mine to queen fights.
---
That most likely means the server crashed.
---
Why aren't we getting advanced repair kits....
---
It would be kinda funny if they let you dispatch an insult bot from your camp to another player's camp. 
---
"So-so's bot has insulted you!"
---
Wow sorry for the delayed reply haha.. i dunno but I'll give u whatever u want haha
---
That makes sense ;)
---
I got murder-gangbanged by a herd of Brahmin who decided they hated me for some unknown reason. It was up by Prickett's fort, and I've never seen a herd of Brahmin before, but the sheer number (15) leads me to believe it was a glitch of some sort. 
---
I was like "oooh! Brahmin milk, gonna make s'mores!" and after I milked the first one they turned on me. Stupid extreme bloody build, two hits and I was down.
---
But I respawned, dropped an orbital strike beacon danger close, respawned again, and then I ate Brahmin steaks for days.
---
If I'm home and afk, I'm on the bigass guitar or in bed
---
You sound like a chode, but I agree.
---
What's the fun in legendary farming if the only things usable are four or so different weapons? There shouldn't be a set "best" weapon. Why should I be forced into using a Fixer if I like the look of a pipe rifle better, for example(just first two weapons I thought of)? Obviously differences due to ammo type but everything should be viable, just with weaknesses that can be overcome.
---
Yes, and you already meet characters from the Pitt with the Wastelanders expansion. OTOH, the Pitt probably one of the less interesting expansions in the franchise to me.
---
Well what I want you might not have üòÇ looking for rare items. I‚Äôm a heavy build.
---
I like to just see what players are using as their weapons.
---
I didn't know, who has time to check this sub for every glitch in the game? I try to keep up with the bugs but it's like a full time job.
---
Obligatory: *Why not both?*
---
Or even a single item that's both of them.
---
Shovel, mounted head, plushie, harpoon gun so far in my 4 events.
---
Spoilery-ish vague answer:
---
I guess that's maybe the problem with the instanced part of the game, I don't believe Motherload is an option, unless you sided with the Raiders.  Each of my characters sided with the opposite faction, so that option is on the table only depending on each characters view.   
---
 Timey-wimey-wibbly-wobbly?
---
Totally agree with this, he takes alotta bullets
---
Not sure about unreasonable myself, but the second one definitely screwed my mood for the session. The whole thing is just so pointless.
---
Use the Xbox game list instead then invite them over
---
Do you wave and expect a reaction from everyone you see on the street, it may be a game but it's real people controlling that char and not everyone you meet is nice......
---
You want to see it hard? Or just shake it at you?
---
If they do decide to make a change, this would be a more of a ‚Äúin the meantime‚Äù type of suggestion. Since you probably have a lots of strength, you could easily swap specs to heavy gunner (and use the one gun army luck perk) and use the final word legendary .50 cal to get it down. I agree that melee should be able to have an easier time getting the cards, but this could be helpful for now.
---
Teslas have been a problem since the beginning of the game (and they were even problematic in Fallout 4). 
---
Sorry if this has come off as an attack or a net-negative, but just wanted to let you know.
---
Pick up a gun &gt; shoot the gun &gt; acquire keycard
---
Ohhhhhh, okay! Well, I loved all the lines they got and really wish I could still have them as a companion.
---
True. But if confirmed as being true, it can be datum.
---
And to everyones point nothing is going to change, so grab a gun and get to it. As a melee character, yes I know it is frustrating, but it is what it is. Just grab a free .50 cal in the toxic valley or buy a nuke card. You can't expect the wasteland to cater to you just because we are melee characters. You have to be creative.
---
Yeah, me too. I'm here to just enjoy the game and I couldn't care less about who's good/bad at something. Some people just like to play and not trying to git gud, not saying it's bad to master the game, just let others play in peace.
---
I believe Bethesda makes the event trigger after a nuke to reduce the up-time of the event. Players who are dedicated enough to launch a nuke are rewarded with being able to initiate the event. 
---
If players could just walk up to the mine with a bundle of grenades or a missle launcher, the event would be much easier to start, reducing the 'excitement' and 'reward-factor' otherwise necessary to start the event from nuking the area.
---
The Motherlode wouldn't be an option if you side with the settlers. I won't spoil what happens to it.
---
The double barrel is more suited to the cowboy 
---
But your current pump on the other character is better, so I would sell it if I were you.
---
Anyone else‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù name show up when you take a pylon at Encrypid?
---
I always feel awkward if they don't wanna buy anything.. Like. "WHAT AM I DOING WRONG"
---
When people are standing next to my vending machine I usually hide and spy on them... I think most of the time they caught me and thought I was a weirdo tho
---
He would be a great camp addition or companion.
---
Couldn't they get away with making a change to engine (or at least make it minimal) at the cost of making a compromise in some things.
---
Dual pistols could behave something like they are in Counter-strike:
---
Dual pistols could behave as one item, not two. Couldn't separate them so it would much easier to make model and animations as one. This would allow to use zoom with right click. Dual pistols could be modded to either have one or another firing mode (something like auto/single for weapons). One would be basically two-shot perk (one click would fire both pistols at the same time) while other one would make them firing one after another.
---
Each pistol in this tandem could have different model/skin as long as they share same  same damage/firerate/magazine size/reload magazine speed to not make things complicated.
---
makes sense.   I played it twice yesterday.  First time the frame rate went down to like 2 fps.  2nd time it was fine. We ended up failing on time the first one.
---
Im gunna be honest, I dunno what's rare haha. I may be lvl 205, but still a rookie. 
---
Is there something in particular? 
---
If you're on now, add me. Snazzzah :)
---
This is jsut too beautiful, I had to turn it into a [loading screen](https://i.imgur.com/0C17iol.png).
---
No the best thing to do is wait a bit
---
Well I've played hundreds of hours of Fallout 4 and almost 1000 hours of 76 and I just learned this today. There's always something with this game. üòî
---
Not sure what the cap is but I run at 31 when I‚Äôm using UNY armors, if taking some food such as sb brains I can have 39.
---
I think I got a plushie from the event itself
---
Oh man thats awesome, how did you do that?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub82Xb1C8os](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub82Xb1C8os)
---
of course it has bugs
---
The prices people have on their legendaries is straight up delusional.
---
Yeah I know kind of why they did that, but a nuke seems silly.
---
They could have had it like encrypted where you need  to buy some sore of special explosive charge from the vendors for 1500 caps. Then give it an hour cool down.
---
Always.....jeez!
---
Only when they have a mic
---
It's a legacy weapon, energy weapons that rolled with explosive shots
---
This is the way
---
That's the situation I'm myself in.
---
I have roughly 3500~ lbs of legendaries (most 2 or 3 star) to scrip, on a mule account.
---
I have about 350 treasury notes.  And finished the legendary run a week ago.  
---
Right now I'm logging in 30-60 minutes a day to do the reputation dailies, turn in gold, scrip.   Depending on if a Uranian Fever, Radiation Rumble, or Nightstalker event pop, will do that.  Possibly do a quick west-tek run, etc.
---
The thing that kills me - is in those 60 minutes, I typically still get enough legendaries to hit the daily scrip limit.  Some of this is likely due to playing on a private server, but still.... 
---
&gt;  can barely be assed logging on to claim 200 gold and 150 scrip every day just so that I can buy a T65 leg piece at the end of the week.
---
No kidding;  I finished my t-65 except for the chest piece.  I have an ultracite chest piece with a jet pack.  Replacing that is 2 full weeks of bullion.  So, will come back to that later I guess....
---
Generally if you smile and say hi to a person on the street they say hi back, yeah. If I said hi to someone on the street and they just stared at me and walked by I'd think they were rude, absolutely
---
I was just half joking when i posted that and the you came here raging, somehow it sounds like you're more mad than I am. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I stopped sharing cards because it's never the right card to share and people would kick you if they don't like it. So I can't share strange in numbers, I share something neutral for outside of tough events like ACP. something like travel agent or scrapper, during ACP I don't even know what would be useful, so I mostly play without the team.
---
Personal opinion? No, not worth it with all the current issues surrounding the bunker prefab and the fact we'll be getting a BoS one next month on the next LR board. I only picked up the fences from the bundle and even they are hit or miss.
---
I'm dumb so by legacy that basically means a weapon that's no longer possible to obtain?
---
Totally agree.   I only have two, but I can't bring myself to do the rep grind again.  And on destroying legendary end-game pieces because they're not what you want but would be great on another character?   Painful.  
---
You really put a lot of thought into your five.
---
Main shotgun build here, I agree, shot guns on the drone sounds like a joke. Shooting it down with a random pipe rifle I found on a super mutant was way more efficient even without Perks for rifles.
---
Have they announced when it is yet?
---
I have been curious if anyone has tried Ghoul slayer on Earle and seen any affects
---
Gotcha. I misunderstood what you were saying.
---
They already have an armor penetration perk
---
PS4
---
For all future reference, coming from someone who works in the F4 modding scene - Dual pistols will never happen. I'm really sorry, everyone keeps asking for them, but they just won't happen. There's a whole list of technical reasons why, I won't get into them here - But they're just not feasible.
---
Hah, like i have friends.
---
aye. happened a lot a few months ago. gave up inviting people.
---
same
---
In the silos you can glitch through two doors to run the silo in about 9 minutes. It can be done with photo mode. 
---
First shove your face in the corner of the door jam and the door. Open photo mode (the camera must appear behind you, if it doesn't just exit photo mode and enter again.) Then shove the camera in the same corner/door jam and exit photo mode while pushing forward. Boom other side.
---
Yeah pretty much, but after recent dupes there still is heaps around the market or on discord trades. Traded a couple plans for mine
---
People got a max level vats unknown??  Well this is BS, mine was level 20 and I did the quest at level 300+...
---
Furious is OK for boss fights provided you don't change your target. For normal enemies you are better of with The Final Word from Beckett's quest line.
---
Fireproof
---
Accept that it happens and move on with your life.
---
Yeah, it was either a level 20 or level 50 spawn.
---
ESO‚Äôs system literally encourages you to have alts, and does everything they can to support it (with the possible exception of outfit slots). 
---
F76 is a shitshow in that regard. 
---
1.) No character equipment transfer.  
---
2.) No shared perk progression after 50.  
---
3.) No account wide plan unlocks.  
---
Get it together, Bethesda.
---
I was one of the lucky ones and got a level 50.
---
I‚Äôve rolled a stalkers‚Äô gauss shotgun, it even outperforms my junkies and bloodied. Maybe it‚Äôs because the added Vats chance works better over longer distance to focus all pellets on target. Range is the biggest drawback of all shotguns and stalkers helps. Also isn‚Äôt stalkers among the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô effects too?
---
Mediocrity is the best!
---
So... you're OK with your tesla crashing you game since beta?
---
You're sentence seems to have contradictory parts.
---
I generally didn't have any issues till recently with teslas, causes massive lag from the arc, and more lag from the ash piles. I have a two shot tesla, and i've avoided using it whenever possible cause of all the issues with it.
---
&gt;Life Giver is prob one of my most important perks, when you are running nerd rage it triggers at 20% health, so for me that was about \~40 HP which is pretty low, by the time I got to nerd rage level, I was one hit away from dying...but with lifegiver it gives me more max health, which isn't useful in itself but now that 20% nerd rage threshold is like \~76 HP so I can get into nerd rage without being as low health, and im able to take more hits before dying.
---
I was hoping that'd be what the Chally backpack was, but alas, *Barrel*.
---
I think an interesting take is to either boost the specific mob types prefixes or give pistols a card that lets you boost the effectiveness of those type of legendary guns.  
---
I think it would be an interesting image to see a pistol wielder have like six different guns, one for each occasion.  To have it incentivised and rewarded through quick swap perk cards and reduced pistol weight cards.
---
My toons that can only share 1rank cards I use scrapper.   My toon that can share 2rank cards I share marathoner.
---
Actually things can change and several things have changed from player feedback so stupid paragraph and I'm looking out for all players not just myself but with bad attitudes like yours it is hard to get change
---
1 - The Quack Outfit is... Okay, but they continue to shoot themselves in the foot in terms of visual design by having a giant unsightly blood stain all over the back. ( As someone that does clothing mods, I feel like the designers really aren't holding up )   
---
2 - The Waster Underarmor is really old, it didn't release last week. It's about a year old. More than nine months at least.
---
Or with the upcoming expanded instanced camp, give you the option of building your own mini-vault, populate it with your own faction of former vault dwellers.
---
If you find a junkies any long range weapon, it would be worthwhile to keep it and pop an over abundance of chems to kill one. I don't like them either cause as stated in another comment, I'm shotgun and that's barely out if melee range.
---
When MW was happening I was about  to finish LR with the weekly SCORE  challenges and BAM! Autocomplete bug on Tuesday. I needed those 500 and of course adding  insult to injury, they switched everything  out right aver MW in the Atom shop. 
---
So the AC bug wiped out my chance of getting the Blue Brahmin Grill.  I am 2 levels away from completing LR and I‚Äôve done all my dailies including NW. Am still SO pissed!
---
Yeah man . I put 30 nukashine in my bowl for meat week and some ass hat drinks it . I think if you drink more then one you should just add blackout time . 1 minute for every additional nukashine .
---
So basically I‚Äôve missed out on my chance of getting a max level alien blaster?
---
...typical Bethesda.
---
Naw, I like it. I have a nice camp. Sometimes there's some fun moments. Recently me and 3 other players jumped on the musical instruments for a few minutes. It was fun. 
---
Sometimes someone wants to trade. But anything I'm looking to sell, it's on my donut bots. 
---
Sometimes I get a jerk that starts shooting me in the face, so I let them get it out. One time, the guy started calling me all kinds of names, and using racial insults. I have no idea why.
---
So I recorded him on my phone, then reported him. I got an form email asking if I had screen shots or video, so I sent them the video. I didn't hear anything after that from Bethesda.
---
But about a week later, on the PS4, I got a message from a stranger saying they got perma banned because of me, but that he's just going to make a new account and come fuck me. I don't know if it's the guy that I reported, but i hadn't reported anyone else. 
---
So far I haven't been fucked. So who knows.
---
Try to avoid explosive weapons on him in general. My game gets super laggy when someone is using one. I'm just a regular PS4 though
---
I do understand that pain and am guilty of the same.  Though I usually hate myself just a little more after doing so
---
Chances are theyre trying to get daily "buy or sell items at a player vendor" challenges and hoping you have one of the 3 plans they dont already know. Or ammo they can buy 3 whole bullets of.
---
Not really they are either there for the shop or they wander into it when the shop is closed. Most of the time they take food from my mega farm and leave.
---
Grelok was on the cover of Grognak the Barbarian #10 in Fallout 4.
---
Its not the gun per say, but the ash piles it leaves.   It will kill anyones FPS to a crawl if they are in the area.
---
Put objects on rugs then move the rug
---
You look and sound like an asshole, but at least you agree with better people.
---
You can report on the Bethesda support page or using the in game report function
---
I don't even think that 'kick' thing works. My mate and I were on a team, I was team leader and he asked me if I kicked someone off which I didn't, even though it showed on screen it happened, same happened with him as team leader too. Don't take it personally, I think it's a bug.
---
I shared blocker tonight cause I think it's something everyone can benefit from.
---
It's because everyone thinks they have a "godroll" legendary.  Sorry billybob but 90% less carry weight on knuckles isn't that great.
---
I see it pop up on Facebook Buy/Sell/Trade pages. You could probably get one for about 2-3caps
---
1 hit away from death?  With emergency protocols, dodgy, ricochet, 42% damage reduction from pa, empath boosted with strange in numbers and class freak, blocker, fireproof just to name a few?  It certainly takes more than one hit for me to die.  Not to mention my vampire's machine gun which essentially makes me invincible as long as I can hit my target with it.
---
Thank you soldier! Ad Victoriam brother!
---
I can‚Äôt join my private worlds. I also don‚Äôt have fallout 1st.
---
I thought there was more than 1 motherlode though? What about the one in the deep that can take you up to the northern part of the savage divide or into the mire? I actually always wondered if these were meant to be the same one or not, but going by the wiki there seems to be 4 of them?
---
I've been giving ATLAS my wood too.
---
Excellent! Fair warning though, I missed Uncanny Caverns
---
Get the perks fix it good and weapon artisan. Those at max rank will double your weapon/armor durability.
---
Psn?
---
I lost all respect I had for her after her *endless nightmares floating in space*. Miss me with that shit. Now that Athena doesn't even have additional caps I kicked her and I say good riddance.
---
It‚Äôs just an excuse to keep people launching nukes
---
Oh shit. Any idea if Makeshift Warrior is in the same boat?
---
not using PA, I was just saying lifegiver def isn't 'useless' it can be very helpful for blooded builds

Like the beast seen in this vid?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXR-bCF5dbM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXR-bCF5dbM)
---
I agree, and it‚Äôs no fix, but you could do the raiders glitch to get max rep at least for them. Do the daily for Rocksy, kill the guy that left, return to her, choose the second option, then immediately back out. You gain rep without having ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù the quest. Talk to her again, choose the second option, immediately back out. Continue this until rep is maxed out, then you can let the dialogue finish to get your reward. It‚Äôs a bit time consuming to do it this way, but MUCH better than the alternative ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
You‚Äôre literally complaining about not selling ammo post apocalypse. When the factions are independent of you. They don‚Äôt need you to be their ammo slave being ammo everyday for a price. They can gather supplies and ammo themselves that‚Äôs why the don‚Äôt buy it and sell their excess or ammo they don‚Äôt use. 
---
Sell to people that‚Äôs was the main focus of the game was people brining life to the world and being an online fallout game it ticks those criteria. 
---
Don‚Äôt bitch because you‚Äôre probably selling ammo at a jacked up price and no one is buying man
---
Yeah, all the PC versions play on the same servers, the game has its own social menu for adding friends.
---
You can get more XP with higher intelligence as well. I've gotten mine as high as 42 while on a building team, and with Carnivore+Broiled SB Brain and Berry Mentats. And that is without stat boosts from weapons or armor, since I run a power armor build.
---
with 42 INT, +5% XP from Lovers Embrace, +12.5% XP from canned stew+carnivore+Strangein#'s, + 15% from Inspirational, + 100% from lunchbox x4, I can get two levels out of the Radiation Rumble event just from killing things.
---
No worries. I‚Äôd also settle for my amateur inventor laser rifle skin to work on itüòÇ Gatling lasers need some love lol
---
If you want to argue that just the health from it is useful, that's fine.  I mostly meant the glitch isn't working anymore.
---
Not every bloodied goes down that much.  I‚Äôve brought my bloodied unarmed and commando and i might die once.

*2 star Hunter‚Äôs Aiming Pipe Pistol, level 40: 1000 caps*
---
Even the weapons that are good are delusional in pricing, though.
---
I like to sit on my outhouse and show people my molerat.
---
That's what door locks are for.  Just leave one door without a lock and it's not a problem.  Works perfectly for me.
---
Supposedly a cursed weapon sometimes, but those aren't even really that good tbh.  I'd rather keep killing wendigos for xp.
---
No. If someone‚Äôs going out their way to ruin someone‚Äôs experience report them. I did it to some douchebag wall breaching with PA to kill my Brahmin
---
Could be, but it happened a lot to me as soon as I shared something. I didn't even share perks that could mess with the builds. It's not a big deal, but I'm just careful now. If I don't share anything there's bigger chance I'll stay in the team in my experience xD
---
That‚Äôs a you type of decision.
---
You are going to have to uninstall and reinstall the game. Also clear the cache and delete your saved files. You will lose your photos. The server will keep your characters in progress. Also make sure you have a bethesda account linked to your email
---
Anyone know if ESO is using a new engine or not? Cause I would guess that injecting online features into FO4's engine is part of why 76 is busted in the specific ways that are unique to itself. Unless someone tells me ESO is also just the same Bethesda engine as always and isn't the same kinds of busted.
---
Thanks!
---
Shut up and take my atoms!
---
IIRC, you can occasionally find few of the plans from one of the bot vendors in WS.
---
Its been a good while, but I found plans for both motion assist servos and optimized bracers at said bot vendor.  
---
Asked about others here; was told calibrated shocks and targeting hud are SBQ drops only.
---
So you stay in there and just keep fighting huh?
---
Point taken lol
---
Hip fire is the least accurate in real life because the short barrel. But they should add a large caliber and not like the black powder because 1 too slow and 2 why the fick does it has so much dmg???!
---
Yes?
---
ATLAS said I didn‚Äôt have enough wood to give üòû
---
The damage nerf to me is what it is.since I been on 76 I've used 3 build leading up to my current  full health TSE then full health Junkies to low health junkies with unyielding to currently running unyielding bloodied like alot of players.
---
There is nothing stopping anybody from changing what build they use.if they buff everything to be good as even junkies then what's the point in running junkies same can be said for bloodied.
---
I agree that I would love more builds to be viable but nerfing unyielding or bloodied or any of the meta builds isnt the way to go.
---
We need to get rid of negative effects on stuff like nocturnal and berserker then those would be viable.but I'm just a casual that gets on here and there to have a good time
---
You should totally time it and see how long it takes for them to leave the server.
---
I love going around and buying expensive plans, weapons, and armor, which usually causes the camp owner to leave the server in a panic so they don't lose out on caps. I can buy something and count down from 10 and the camp is usually gone by then.
---
The cursed weapon was moved out of the chest and now goes straight to your inventory. The chest has some caps, stims, ore and other meh stuff
---
*laughs maniacally*
---
You really think they‚Äôll fix that?
---
How? I cannot find it in the atom shop, not even a bundle with it
---
Thing is, I want people to be able to use my resources, access their stash, the crafting stations, water and whatnot. I just wish people would close the damn doors.
---
Ad Victoriam to you as well...as a side note. How do you get the brotherhood next to your name?
---
I could see this being used on mountain side camps. So many suicides. üòÇ
---
You can't equip cards pass 15, even if a stat is 16 or more.
---
Next time launch a nuke, then go buy some plans and know the player is torn between staying and leaving. Anarchy in the wasteland
---
That would have worked too, but everyone wanted more places to nuke.
---
Ok thanks I'll try it any idea where I can find the rug plans
---
No sir, they‚Äôre both considered alcohols.
---
But with martial artist it weighs less than a paperclip /s.
---
Yeah, that was kinda dissapointing. I was hoping for something more like the safari croc backpack
---
I really wish 76 had any kind of market system like how other MMOs do. Like even if I couldnt buy things from long distance I'd really just like to see how people price items so I can figure out how the hell I should be pricing them. It's such a pain in the ass I almost feel like the community needs to make a master list on what shit is worth.
---
You click in the three dots and then click change user flair, super easy.
---
I said to equip cards up to 15 special points.
---
Meaning you wouldn't get any more cards than normal max by equipping armor special points, it will just max at 15.(unyielding doesn't has this effect)
---
Same shit happening to me all of the sudden
---
It‚Äôll just teleport you out of the mine if you stay down there, doesn‚Äôt kill you so that‚Äôs nice!
---
What 500 atoms?
---
There should be an option for a 5% xp gain specifically without a companion.  This is implying it's objectively better to have one than to not, which kind of annoys me.
---
Ignoring is probably the nicest reaction I‚Äôd have for some lunatic waving spoiled carrots at me.
---
Very interesting. I was at purveyor yesterday and that‚Äôs all I got except 1 nocturnal weapon. Total of 8 stalker 1 nocturnal. I ended up scraping until I couldn‚Äôt anymore.  I‚Äôll look into it more then. Thanks for info everyone. .
---
Fun fact: you can skip that whole quest just by going though the laser door (3rd floor of Fort Defiance) with the PA glitch and then using Tagerdy's terminal.
---
Video of each square of the Armor Ace board: https://youtu.be/xnF-wmAliXM
---
Where the last video was missing a lot of photos, here is a video of the Datamined pictures that match what was talked about in the prior video: https://youtu.be/56JhZBAAGrA
---
It does max at 15 though?
---
Yesterday a vendor had 21 foul slayer lever guns on one tab. I was curious so I bought one out of 21 and it cleared them all. So it just a glitch. First time I have seen it
---
It stopped stacking a long time ago
---
Usually throw a wave at them and carry on.  Every now and then, though, I will follow them around as close as I possibly can.
---
Maybe not mounts, but imagine this 
---
Scooters! 
---
Imagine a guy dressed in the sheepsquach mascot outfit zooming at you with a super sledge üòÇ 
---
I would love that sooooo much
---
What a cry baby ... ooh the game doesn't cater to my build so let's change it .. boo hoo smh it's so easy to take down a cargo bob ..
---
The thing is other than rewards from missions you find every for free and takes secs to make something, thats why most of my stuff is 10-50 caps.
---
Yes this ^ Or if ya gonna do that, go to yours or someone's private and do it! It straight ruins the event for everyone in a public server that wants to complete the event! Had 2 players the other day that did this right after I launched the nuke and the event timer would not start and made it so we couldn't complete it..... So from here on out, imma be seeing earl on my private!
---
Hey, that's not fair. You also get a copy of the game board that you can't hang up in your CAMP because it sinks into the wall.
---
Definitely. Especially with the way it pixelates the lighting effects. It‚Äôs dark AF down there and the pixelating happens BAD with the headlights on in PA.
---
My mrs would be upset knowing I've been giving wood to someone else.
---
It‚Äôs under SPECIALs within the Atom Store (they are offering different plushies everyday - I missed Grognak earlier in the week ‚òπÔ∏è). You‚Äôll want to be quick though as it changes to the Sheepsquash plushie at 5pm today (European time).
---
That one guy is a complete tool, hopefully soon to get banned by Sony as that is an insane way to act over an MMORPG...
---
Meh.  From my experience lvls mean nothing.  
---
Last night did with a couple high lvl players and they were shooting marshmallows.   
---
I burned down Earl faster with my unoptimized junkies commando.
---
Bet you could do even more if you add Either Leader or INT Bobblehead &amp; Live &amp; Love 8
---
I run about the same but with Herbivore with Brainbombs &amp; Cranberry Relish
---
Thanks! I'll look into it
---
Are they wrong?
---
Beat the wastelanders story (side with the raiders or settlers to get to the vault) after that you‚Äôll start getting dailies from BOTH sides
---
That explains the buyers buying three rounds of one cap ammo...duh lol!   
---
Cheers!
---
No worries üôÇ
---
My special stat armor idea allows you to let special points give you extra perk card slots up to a normal max of 15.
---
So if you have 12 intelligence and you had 2 pieces of armor that has 3 intelligence between them then you will be at 15(max) intelligence and be able to equip more cards to the normal max. If you stack any more intelligence you will just receive normal bonuses like 2% exp boost per 1 int.
---
Unyielding wouldn't work this way since it boosts all stats.
---
 It's balancing between all special boosts or more specific boosts to a specific build allowing you to equip extra perk cards.
---
Is it a side mission or a main?
---
There is. Lovers Embrace is just a buffed Rested/Well Rested sleeping bonus. It just lasts for 3 hours if you have a companion instead of like 1 or 2. (1 for sleeping in random bed, 2 for sleeping in your own). 
---
Also, I would say that getting laid rather than not IS objectively better.
---
Had us in the first half
---
Exactly, 
---
while 2000 may seem a lot of caps for a serum, it is technically 42% discount off the price of what you would get from buying it from a vendor. 
---
Even plans, while most people poo poo on the idea of buying a 100 cap plan for 100 caps, that is technically cheaper than what you would pay with the best price from a vendor.
---
If you dont have fo1st you dont have private worlds. You can only join somebody that does.
---
Couldn't you just find one of the mistress corpses and take the veil from them?
---
I don't know for sure as I haven't gotten around to doing it yet.
---
I mean, this one guy came to my camp and then told me he really liked how I designed it and that he used the same space and was impressed with what I'd done, so that was cool.
---
Main, you have to be at least level 20 to start the quests. Go to overseers home in Sutton
---
Don‚Äôt get discouraged.   I‚Äôm sure someone out there would be happy with what little wood you do have.
---
Thanks! Paint.net's "Ink Sketch" Effect did all the work, I simply added the frame and the speech bubble :P
---
You can actually "guide" your character during the scream phase. You can't slow them down and it's  a bit like steering a hover craft. But you can avoid the really bad obstacles this way.
---
You should have that looked at, btw
---
Hell yeah! They should be a little buffed. Like bringing back to 90% from gunslinger, adding new perk into perception for armor penetration, changing VATS crit modifier (first count all modifiers and at the end multuply it by VATS crit modifier), also making it cheaper in ap cost (or other guns ap cost slightly higher)... On the beginnig i felt like pistols are treated as a secondary weapon, but i dont like this idea (Playing on PS4, left arrow changes guns between last two picked). Ive noticed that auto pistols are treated as a 100% legit first weapon but non auto pistols not so much (perks like crack shot for example gives that feelenig, and other from agility). Mabye perk in perception like: in vats non auto pistols gain 15/30/45% dmg? That could change it. I feel like non auto pistols are made for VATS and i would look for DMG there. Cheers!
---
Once he's dead can't you just go full health? Or maybe when he's close to dying just go full health.
---
Oh, they aren't separate, of course.  I don't know, I just hate the allies, so.
---
Is it the one where you have to go to the camp to find there doctor or something and try to convince them about the scorched?
---
If it makes you feel any better reporting it to Bethesda won't do anything.  It's happening to a lot of people so no trouble-shooting step they could give you would possibly help and the CMs already replied to other threads that we are looking into it.  Can only sit and wait.
---
Oh I see what you mean.  There's something a little like that coming down the pipeline. ;)
---
Uses to make me feel weird before I got it looking how I wanted it. Now I like people visiting my camp. I'll. Almost complete ignore them except maybe a salute but I like it when they look around.
---
Don't like people visiting my workshops though. That puts me on edge be cause I'm nearly lvl150 but my character is still a bitch when it comes to pvp.
---
Grieving and glitching have been the meta since release.
---
It‚Äôs fun when someone visits.  If they have a mic I‚Äôll try and talk to them to see if I have an extra stuff they want.    I had a jam session on my party deck few times with strangers.  that was also fun.
---
Your ally doesn‚Äôt
---
After the second one I'd hop servers. It seems like every once in awhile you get a server where it has some certain legendary affect on the brain.  I've had that happen with Assassin's.
---
Theres more of that crapy attitude glad to have a-holes like you in the wastelands
---
Pickaxe, B4090 or an Exectuioners version, but..  But, I've had some pretty good random armor drops, a Bolstering AP Sent combat piece and a Bolstering Sent PR heavy leather piece.
---
I'll message you
---
Yes. Just go to your pipboy, scroll to ‚Äúdata‚Äù and go to ‚Äúmain quests‚Äù should be under the OG main quest
---
Doh!  Wish I knew that.
---
Its at 0 right now and I have a feeling if it doesn't get any movement it won't auto complete.
---
I had this happen to on PS4, I hid in a corner hoping it would end. I couldn't even look away from the wall. I soon realized everyone left except me and the a** with the Tesla so I bailed.
---
The bunker is currently bugged.
---
So i suggest you wait till Bethesda fixes it.
---
I don't have one of those, so all good!
---
(I haven't started the Wastelanders stuff yet.)
---
Just change out melee to heavy gunner cards and a good heavy weapon done deal. That's what I do with a furious explosive 50 call.
---
I‚Äôve gotten chest 3 times and only gotten caps and junk. So yeah I‚Äôm just going to keep killing wendigos and let me get fast traveled out. I have all plans. I just need mask and shovel and pickaxe. The ammo and screws is what I want more then caps from that chest
---
‚ÄúThe Mass‚Äù 
---
A large wall of flesh with limbs, eyes, and teeth sticking out of it. The mother of all snallygasters.
---
Will bethesda fix the bunker?  
---
Have they said anything about it?
---
What do you mean? Now you got me curious.
---
Do you mean legendary perks? That's what inspired this change to special boosts tbh. Felt like there was no balance between unyielding armor and everything else.
---
I have twice those hours and still learn something new everyday. It's a lot to take in.
---
Or just have no doors at you camp, at all.  I've found this to be the easiest solution for me. personally.  
---
I hate seeing doors open all the time at my camp too.  Keep in mind, it could be you ally that is always opening these unlocked doors.
---
I like the plushie a lot!
---
Nice! Not crazy about the duping but it is what it is. It's such a cool looking weapon though.
---
Yep. Either complete it on a private or keep server hopping. It's a known bug that they were supposed to fix but you know, it's Bethesda. It may take a few or several or 20 minutes but you can server hop. You're looking for a server where someone hasn't completed that Quest recently since the reset on the actual server
---
I just wave hello and go about my business.
---
Let's just say, you'll feel just a little more special  next update, if you want, because you're, well legendary.
---
Camera speeds you up when held, although not a weapon obvs.
---
Nocturnal would like a word.
---
Also doesn't help that my ally walks around room to room like some sort of shit ghost. There needs to be an autoclose setting. 
---
I stopped caring about my open doors about two weeks ago. I highly recommend it.
---
What?!?
---
I try to set my old legendaries to the price I would buy them for, because I have incredibly high standards on prices
---
Close the god dam doors you heathens
---
I‚Äôd love a boss Mothman or Flatwoods Monster Invasion event
---
The main quests that I have are Key to the past which is a terminal at black water mine, Strange Bedfellows which is repair AI program, The missing link, which is gain Rose‚Äôs trust which it doesn‚Äôt tell me how to do and then the new arrivals, I think it‚Äôs the bedfellows one
---
Okay. Yeah I thought I saw an angry Turtles video that the cursed weapon was in there. But now it seems like if they just drop it in you at the end. The video was on the pts though.
---
Yes exact same problem I've tried every combination of things.  I have not tried the private server trick.
---
Nocturnal maybe isn't the best but at least it has some use 50% of the time
---
I try and see how close I can stand to them before they run away. Is that what you are supposed to do?
---
The gamer and chaos lover in me says, please come.  The Responder loving side of me says, no one asked you to come here so just stay the fuck away
---
More like Legend....wait for it....ary.
---
It‚Äôs new arrivals
---
Could we get a ED-E skin and dialogue from him
---
I feel like I‚Äôm still the only one who does it legit.  I gather everything I come across so I don‚Äôt mind the whole grind plus for a stealth it‚Äôs pretty easy
---
Umm excuse me I'm trying to get railed off of Psychotats and Touch Myself! Do you mind?!!!
---
I think you'll have some stiff competition there.
---
Yeah it says I have to complete bedfellows for that one
---
Or mistakenly get out of ur PA in a nuke zone.  Lol.  Learned my lesson the first and only time.
---
Are you aware of legendary perks in the pts?
---
Ok then you have to do that one and the missing link
---
seems to have made a difference.
---
I take special education, does that mean I‚Äôm legendary? ^/s
---
You have to have fallout 1st to "have" private worlds. You can only join others that do have fallout 1st.
---
My instigating Dragon I snagged from that machine is fun. Plus it's good event for a lot of legendaries.
---
https://youtu.be/arf4Rbv5yvg
---
You likely get stuck in PA, swapping to 3rd person trying to get out and back to 1st a few times gets you out of your PA.
---
Until it ends I guess, but some advice is just glitch your way through silos. I know it‚Äôs ‚Äúexperience breaking‚Äù but you can do a silo in under 5 mins and you hardly use any resources. I think I‚Äôve done a silo run only using 1 stim and like 50 .45 rounds
---
Sure... legendarily hard on our social services program.
---
And a negative the other 50% of the time. I would rather have something that is a net neutral, then something that is terrible 50% of the time.
---
Honestly I just repair with the 200% repair and dont mind
---
Selling ammo in a post-apocalyptic wasteland makes sense. Even the Gun Runners in FNV will buy ammo from you. It's not my fault Bethesda doesn't understand basic economics or don't want to increase stash space.
---
I don't recall the amount I have received.
---
Yep, launchers need to be OP as hell but with super-rare ammo. They should make people run for cover when you pull one out.
---
Thanks for the tip. Me personally had 500 rounds to play with. I dont do this one mostly. I am on PC.
---
Yesteryear....
---
82nd all the way
---
I disagree with you on that one chief. Blocker is far from essential.
---
About every 30 reg sbs I kill I will see one have a plan. But it‚Äôs easier to get groom queen. Wait for the new event to die down and everyone will nuke queen again. Before wastelanders came out every night on Xbox there would be a nuke on every server. But when dlc came out it was rare because of new players. Then it came to Xbox game pass and same thing happened. Now with new event queen fights will be rare for a while. But it will go back to it soon. So just goto queen fight when it‚Äôs going on and you‚Äôll get your plans. What system you play on
---
I solo him so my damage goes from high to next to nothing.
---
I don't think you have to do the vault to get dailies from settlers or raiders.
---
I hvaen't even gone thru the Vault Tec training thing yet and I'm already doing faction dailies. Due to the Ward glitch(always have the required parts on me) I'm already maxed on settler rep.
---
The only weird thing is Rocksy wont give me a daily yet, can do Wren's but Rocksy just gives me generic lines.
---
Don't know if this is normal, but it is my experience with them.
---
I hate nw, it is just a crappy put together gamemode
---
I just want a M1911 pistol with the Maria skin from fallout new vegas. The Chinese pistol and Makarov pistol would be nice to have
---
Ok, so this maybe be an overkill of an idea, but we due an endgame event involving the Zetans. A player launches a nuke on farms containing brahmins. Those brahmins mutate into something that attracts the Zetan mothership. The idea is to protect the brahmins from being abducted by a shit-ton of Zetans, and by killing an almost absurd amount of them, 3-5 Flatwoods Aliens are beamed down to fight. After that, we have to shoot down the spacecraft thats hovering over the event area. When it falls, the event ends, and the ship itself is the lootchest. It holds whatever you think a space-themed event has, for instance, plans for the alien blaster, an alien rifle or melee, a new alienized set of PO, mods, and tons of computer scrap(circuitry, steel, lead, fiber optics). If you read all of this, plz tell me if this is a good idea, cuz i need more aliens in this game.
---
No, but you can turn partial fusion cores into fully charged Ultracite Fusion Cores.
---
He‚Äôll regret it when the heavy hitters are gone... Don‚Äôt worry about that...
---
I have those and they give you 200% repair as you say. Pain in the ass swapping perks out at a bench every fight though which is what I use SBQ kits and they give about 130% repair if I remember correctly. The wee white bar goes up about 1/3 with queen kits.
---
I must have dropped 10 or 15 terrible legendaries yesterday.  I felt so bad.
---
Argh!  Really?  This is a known bug? News to me.....
---
Party Boy should double/triple the effects of Vodka.
---
Can‚Äôt do it anyway, I need to repair something there and it‚Äôs guarded by level 73‚Äôs and I‚Äôm only 32 so it‚Äôs nearly impossible to kill them
---
"Q" is in this game?!?
---
I got 76 about a month ago, almost to end of the second part of the board, cool for newer guys as we are not through the quests or anything but when exactly in Sept does this season end?  
---
I really want some items off that third part of the board...
---
Oof
---
What are you playing on?
---
Anything but radsponge
---
I just wish rifles had different fire rates. They all have a fire rate of 75 with full auto receivers, which doesn't make sense. They should have slower firing, higher damage rifles, and faster firing, lower damage rifles. That's how most shooting games work in my experience.
---
Honestly? I wouldn't mind a Mr. Handy butler like Codsworth. 
---
Or a Sentry Bot that has been reprogrammed with the "Loyal as a puppy" OS. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l4IrCBLzTI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l4IrCBLzTI)
---
Definitely a score thing.
---
I got cursed harpoon from third event. First got rug, then meat pile, then harpoon, then heads and then plushie.
---
Put them in your vendor and they will help with your wallet.
---
No, that's what I put the work in for. When I go to someone's camp and they did a great job, it inspires me to try new things and new builds. Last week I saw a raider camp in the Ash Heap where the camp owner did such a fantastic job building a barrier around the camp, despite it being on an incline, I just had to try it myself. So that's what I'm working on now.
---
If my build can inspire someone to try something new or even just send a friendly message, I like that a lot.
---
I love how you are asking people to stop and they are all like "wait I can do that thanks!"
---
Just wow.
---
It was changed from the PTS version. Currently, the chest has random aid items, ore &amp; sometimes plans (I got x3 Nuke Mine plans last night from the chest)
---
Create a ‚ÄúLooking for group‚Äù post asking for help. Somebody will help you. I would but I‚Äôm at work rn
---
I bet Grahm's Wood would fill Asstlas in no time. Why mess around with wood scraps when you could have the whole log.
---
I just want to be alone.  *I'm a witcher.*
---
Skinwalker please
---
1 problem, I have a pvp tank build and removing my other perks would be detrimental, but if that's the only way, I guess I'd have too.
---
This is game changing. Thanks!
---
Did this take up 30% your camp budget?
---
/s
---
I agree. Motherlode, communist motherlode knockoff, Lucky Lou...there are a number of options that would‚Äôve worked depending on our Wastelanders choices. Big missed opportunity to let those things pay off.
---
Correct.
---
Bethesda was to lazy to include another endgame boss mechanic
---
Give grahm his own radio station so I can listen to the sweet croons of my favorite super mutant while I explore Appalachia
---
That‚Äôs fine, I wanna try so stuff for myself but I‚Äôm at the stage now where everywhere I go the creatures are just a stupid rating
---
You got problems man Lmao 
---
It just a game no need to feel awkward or anything..
---
/s In case it wasn't obvious
---
The Gun Runners will gladly buy fucking mini-nukes and so will their vendor robot in New Vegas.
---
 And there's a fucking robot vendor in Goodneighbor
---
Lol I'll just do it private..  Due to my intricate camp located at the cross roads north of the wayward. I consider myself to have better stuff to buy than wayward. At like level 20 I had made a jump to 1500 caps too 3000 caps from just my vending items. I know it's due to location. So I try not too move if at all, my last server I was on for almost a week and a half or more.
---
Is there a challenge to own them all at the same time? The one challenge I did was own them all, but they tick off and can be done overtime.
---
I just finished that one as I had never taken the time to get mount Blair apparently
---
Appreciate you guys though
---
The next Meat Week should be this September if we complete the atlas challenge and of course it will ;).
---
Appreciate you guys. Have a good day
---
I have no doors at my camp except one which is locked and goes to my private area and i had some lvl 75 that kept picklocking the door so i kept killing them and they got mad.
---
If you don't have Fallout 1st and okay on PC, I can get you into my private server later on but if you're on console you're gonna have to make a friend with access lol
---
I found a nice little place where you can stand and spray, spray, spray. Spray the chicken legged cunt with fury! I think I taught my level 282 accomplice something new after spending a dozen Stimpaks on him. You just need to be able to tank a direct hit from his ranged attack (Nuka Orange is amazing for this) because he can‚Äôt pathfind to you and melee you. He stands there like an idiot getting shot in his three heads, and honestly, ripping off the middle head and shitting 5.56 down its throat is so satisfying...
---
I have moved on, I just worry I'm gonna have nightmares of him floating in "space"üôÑ ... Therefore I want to report him üòâ
---
Yeah it‚Äôs trash, well good luck to you!
---
3 dots on the post?
---
I have one
---
 Is the bugged gunsmith perk and them needing guns some ploy to make us by repair kits??)
---
This is usually what I share. Even my low CHA characters can do it since its a one and done perk. 
---
With my high CHA characters, I sometimes share the bonus exp card...forgot the name.
---
Thank you for your help anyway
---
If you can find a dupe glitch, i can dupe you mine lol but nothing else
---
Fasnacht sausage
---
When legendary perks gets released, there's one that gives a chance to fully recharge a fusion core when hit by an enemy.
---
I bought it and enjoy it. Haven‚Äôt really used anything other then bunker. Stuff does float unless you put rugs down. I only have my throne in there from latest bundle and the heads from new event and a regular wendigo mounted head

With carnivore is plus 100

Something something milk of human kindness
---
Found it ...thanks
---
Oh sorry but the grinders are broke. They wear off after you die.
---
I find that sometimes the higher the level the worse the prices, I've seen common faschnat masks go for 2000 plus and they are level 300 like why?
---
That happened to me yesterday I join a public group of a near by person while the nuke was going off, he must of missed the 8 ppl limit and left me behind by myself
---
We still killed it just fine but I found it weird he missed the event
---
Quit the app and Reboot the console.
---
I did, but my friends didn't so we did public teams for a fix.
---

---
I see he was using a jetpack, you know if you need one or does the marsupial jump work good enough?
---
I'm interested to see what they change it to when Steel Dawn drops.
---
Really? Shit yeah I guess I'll switch.
---
Vamps new meta inc.
---
Nah I LOVE it. I spent a lot of time making my CAMP look just the way I wanted it to. I got 4 vending machines stocked full of shit just to attract more people. And yesterday I had a guy show up and start fighting me. We fought for half an hour. I must have killed him 20 times and he just kept right on coming. Shit was dopeeeeee. He destroyed my CAMP but I got at least 500 caps from just bagging him repeatedly. I fucking love this game bro. Come to my CAMP. Buy shit. Look around. Hang out. Fucking fight me. I'm into it.
---
What about people who no longer exist on other people‚Äôs friend list and cannot join their private servers because it tells me I am not friends with them when I clearly am? (Xbox) happened after Doom Eternal launch
---
It's a bad place for nuke. Really few enemy spawn points (unless zone include Monongah), not very often used yellowcake flux source... Prime zone is better, IMO.
---
Looting is going to be my goal. After he dies I‚Äôm putting on Chinese suit and just loot until timer takes me out. I‚Äôve gotten to chest twice and it‚Äôs just caps and junk for me
---
Brotherhood of Spruce
---
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
---
Would that be on tinkers work bench?
---
Need jetpack on PA
---
Yup.  Especially when u find it in the very next vendor for a fraction u paid.  Lol
---
Since I‚Äôm that friend of my group, if you‚Äôve been playing with teammates, maybe check around your camp for small letter graffiti.    I used up the last tiny bit of my buddy‚Äôs budget writing ‚Äòcowboys butts drive me nuts‚Äô on one of his outer walls
---
Non freaking stop harpoon guns. I have lost track I have so many
---
Just an FYI, combine dense chest mod with 3* fire proof and you will negate ALL health damage from explosions. You can stand on a car when it goes with no problem. Your armor will take a hit but not you.
---
Something you wouldn't expect everyone else to have because they dont stack.  I run strange in numbers, I run travel agent. Whoever shares like max rank strong back the other day is a legend.
---
Highest I got it was 60 with every bonus I could lay down. Did that on double XP weekend and nearly melted my console at Line in the Sand.
---
Why is this in r/fo76
---
I'm on console thanks though sir
---
uhh if it gets 200 upvotes I‚Äôll also give someone a je gat plaz
---
I only sell legendary weapon/armor at vendor value because I have too many and they taking up space, from time to time I get a sucker or 2 who will clear me up 
---
I sell Ammo between 1 - 10 cap  and plans at 10cap each
---
Nukes are a valid game mechanic. Get gud.
---
Do ghouls attack?
---
Yeah I have anxiety
---
He is really broken. Either stuck in the roof or in an endless fall animation
---
Oh ok. Never realized that. Thx for that info üòÖ
---
What about budget walls and double glitches?
---
This is exactly why NW is absolutely terrible. Oh and the fact that NW mode is nothing but frog leg spamming sweats.
---
I will have to have a look around üòÖ 
---
But since I've just been in public teams I'm curious if anything got pushed up the build limit with a colossal problem been hotfixed in...
---
Like a lot of folks, my goto is Strange in Numbers, but if someone else joins and is sharing that one I assume they aren't going to change theirs so I change mine to Travel Agent cause everyone can appreciate cheaper FT.
---
I've been done for 3 weeks. I'd love this to happen
---
I'm finding I have to really help them find my hidden vendors... I thought the secret fireplace was too obvious when I made it! Apparently not. They run all over like headless chickens.
---
I said I don't use glitch walls...
---
I have the ‚Äúyour the dumbass‚Äù note for sale at 30000, I don‚Äôt expect anyone to buy it. I just think someone might get a laugh out of it.
---
I really hope they add post-100 rewards soon. Or just like, give the mode some TLC.
---
I‚Äôm swimming in harpoon guns
---
But then have sbq drop them
---
I've got mine set up with a shopping area outside, a workshop on the bottom floor, a bunk-room/living space on the second floor and a locked private suite on the top floor.  Only two locked doors are that one and the generator room.
---
I set up just outside Grafton to provide a nice centralized location for early level players to safely access workbenches and beds.  
---
Kinda pointless now, what with the Crater, but I've been in the region for a couple years now so I'm not likely to move.
---
I wish more people would hang out at my little BnB.  I don't want them to *talk* to me mind you, I'm awkward and shy.  That's why I have a private area. But it feels great to see people at my camp, especially if they stay for a while and don't buy anything, as that means they're actually getting use out of it.
---
Which reminds me, I need to unlock my collectron again now that the glitch is dealt with. I like to keep my purifiers and collectron unlocked for visitors and have some corn and razorgrain for the herbivores out there. I only lock the acid extractor.
---
Buy it and then complain that the items float when placed inside and see if you can get a refund.
---
Darn thank you though
---
Yeah like a month ago I went to purveyor and had 260 scrip and only 40 worth to scrip until daily limit. Went and got a bloodied lever first roll second roll i got bloodied fixer, my first by the way then went scripped last 40 and walked back over and got bloodied Tesla. Best night I‚Äôve ever had from her. Since then I‚Äôve only gotten 1 bloodied weapon, mostly everything else is junk. Best thing In last week and about 3k scrip was a junkies handmade. Mostly pipe pistols. Ugh lol
---
Lol. I prefer the little subtle things that people may notice and chuckle. Kind of like the store sign jokes on Futurama or The Simpsons. Before I got the Grelok, this little scene used to be the deathclaw menacing the astro-cat plushie. 
---
For example: I've got toilet paper in a display case next to gold/silver bars and ultracite.
---
this plan severely failed
---
What some artist did prior to an unreleased game doesn't prove anything. Why would they put it in the game 1,5 year later. It's not like a hidden easter egg. The future will tell.
---
No, once you complete the quest you can't obtain the veil anymore. I accidentally sold mine and months ago. There is no fix for it and no way to get in without it.
---
I have a Hay Maze as most of my camp, so after they are done at the vendors, I just do the Follow Me emote and run them through the maze. 
---
Some people might think it's a trap, so I go ahead first at least to the first two dead ends so they see it's legit
---
Blueprint the item then place it. Or delete the roof then place the item then replace roof
---
Don't buy into the propaganda flyers.
---
I had to google who that was and now I'm mad at our culture
---
NICE!
---
I play bloodied but on this event I try and stay at 40% instead of 20% health. I keep need rage on but swap out serendipity for bloody mess.
---
Farm mole miners; they carry shells and missiles, the latter of which goes to the converter for a decent ROI. Max out rep with raiders and get that armco machine; I'm producing way more than I use with that thing.
---
I had some ride my mr fuzzy ride for 45 min straight and was still on as i left the server lol
---
Well, some just bought the rest of it, I get it that‚Äôs our fault for rushing it but hey, we don‚Äôt really have nothing to grind for and this week‚Äôs daily item is mostly plushies, and I‚Äôve been wanting those ever sense I first saw them so it would be fun if we finished the season we get atom challenges back
---
I watch them from the underground part of my camp
---
they do not know they are being watched
---
but it's for their own safety
---
photo mode glitch is nice too: push into door you want to pass through. Go into photo mode while still pushing. Push camera right in as far as you can too. Leave photo mode, still pushing. You'll be on the other side. Takes a a bit to learn.
---
Won't help, you'll still need the veil to get through the laser grid at that entrance as well. Loved that little quest line but, since Beth made it so you can only get the veil once, if you lose it, you are hosed. Kinda shitty game mechanic really.
---
I ignore them. They usually ignore me too :/
---
I will be on later if u still wanna do it
---
Into the fires of hell, the argonne, a hero to be
---
I gotta say, the responses to this give me hope for the future.
---
I can only say best of luck then. Just know that you can get around the bug. It all has to do with the order of analyzing the blood sample, installing the fuse and getting in the centrifuge.
---
Not sure  Shitface McGee and RoastBeef Rhonda will help with your immersion lol
---
Enter the war from over the sea
---
&gt; from time to time I get a sucker or 2 who will clear me up
---
Chances are that they arent a "sucker"
---
White Knight is great, but in my opinion it's great when you switch to it in order to repair, not to use in combat.
---
play the game
---
Is there something inherently different from Skyrim and F4,F76 that allows that game to have dual wielding?
---
You don't combine them, but you need regular ones to craft Ultracite versions. They are used as ammo for Gatling Lasers with prime receivers.
---
We should all get a month free of fallout first for this shit; it‚Äôs happening to a lot of players including me.
---
I like all the unstoppables stuff. It really is interesting to understand what pop culture was like prewar
---
MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
---
WHY!!!
---
Omg you die at a workshop doing stupid things and cry on reddit!!!
---
Take that shit to a private server!!!
---
It still happens but you can get around it. Search on youtube and you'll figure it out, it worked for me.
---
Bethesda avoids the auction house system from  mmorpg. I learn to appreciate the bargain system when I got into the eso economy. So I‚Äôm glad fo76 is the same way
---
I don't get this notion that Beth is "out of touch" with what Fallout players want. I think it's more a disconnect between what this game was meant to be and what traditional Fallout players WANT it to be. This is a Fallout game, yes, but it's a multiplayer game meant to encourage...multiplayer. People really want this to function just like a main entry and that's simply not the point. There will be a Fallout 5 one day but this isn't it. 
---
I personally wish the vault raids would come back and just clean them up so they function better AND keep the vaults open to be freely explored for lore purposes. I love Fallout just as much as the next person does but people want this to play seamlessly as a completely solo game AND as a multiplayer MMO-lite experience and it is very hard if not impossible to make that work. The game will get pulled in two separate directions and both sides end up weaker.   
---
I think they're doing a pretty fair job of balancing both as is; I did all the Wastelanders content completely solo and it felt fine and in line with a DLC-sized story from 3 or 4. But that was a HUGE update that required a ton of focus to develop. Would I love for there to be tons of hand crafted, awesome vaults and other locations with deep story and unique construction? Absofuckinglutely. Do I think they're able to add that in a meaningful way while also balancing and developing actual multiplayer content that is also engaging? Definitely not. I just don't think the manpower is there.
---
Do events with almost always 3* drops. AWOL Armaments, Riding Shotgun are two good ones. Monster Mash usually has a few max level legendaries running around. ACP has given me a few decent items so far and a lot to scrip. Scrip the garbage and turn that into more from the Purveyor.
---
Farm locations like Whitesprings, Wes Tek, and hit up the fissures, which are a good source of 1 and 2* SBs.
---
Ehhhhh, that‚Äôs like 500 times what I‚Äôm willing to Atom.
---
That's fucking brilliant. Always wondered why people were putting up junk items for max caps.
---
Either buy them from vendors selling them cheap (If you are looking for scrip) or farm areas with lots of mobs and hope to get lucky.
---
Same. Usually high level players are nice about it though
---
Just keep doing events with the exclamation and your dailies.  The last few days since finishing the run, I‚Äôve just been doing that.  I‚Äôve run across a lot more legendary enemies.  They aren‚Äôt the greatest legendary drops, but I now have a huge backlog of stuff to scrip...
---
Mmmmmmmmm
---
If I buy ammo from a vendor I usually try to initiate a trade with the person if they're around. I bought all your .308 yet still crave more, I'm desperate enough to want to buy the 16 .308 you happen to have in your inventory atm too.
---
I mean like events and stuff or spots to nuke
---
I camp hop cause i burn through 45 and 556 üò≠ I need the ammo maker from the raiders
---
I also ended up un-equipping the perk. If it works I see no difference.
---
I would just go afk on the drums, and check on it every hour and a half to eat and drink
---
If they wanna hold into the weapon til they can sell it for 100,000 cap that on them
---
Motherlode is woefully under used. Would have loved to see 10x more uses for that bad momma.
---
I don‚Äôt think that was ever a thing. It was advertised that way, but they changed it before backpacks came out iirc
---
Lol!! So true!
---
Again, I'm not entirely sure about it.
---
Even the best gear usually has some kind of downside. SS armor? Huge RNG grind to get a specific set and is not transferable.
---
Gauss Minigun? Wind up time, high ammo cost, explosive effect doesn't help with SBQ fight.
---
The .50 Cal is good overall but it comparatively has lower DPS than the LMG and the accuracy doesn't seem as good as the minigun. Also, for those that this matters, doesn't seem to meet the criteria for being a magic weapon.
---
Got an Instigating Power Attack Super Sledge? No armor piercing mods, is loud, slow swing speed, and good luck against very tanky enemies.
---
My current setup is an I40PA Super Sledge for farming, a Vampire's +40 Bash (magic) Minigun farming and health regen during combat, and a Junkie's Explosive minigun for taking out big targets fast (killed Earl in ~10 seconds). The sledge is and miniguns are cheap to fix and 5mm ammo is relatively cheap and easy to farm.
---
Farming high lvl super mutants and selling their assault rifles. Doing special events. Getting lucky at workshop spawn events. Nuke zones. Knowing the classic spots like west tek, and doing that run at least once a day in full unyielding armor to lvl up quick. Honestly just playing the game and having fun, and they pop up as you do other things. I discovered sheepsquatch legendary can spawn by top of the world ski slopes while looking for magazine spawns. The new special ops instance and mob scaling should be a boon too. Leader of the pack should scale up, lol
---
Motherlode still pops up and tries to take me to the deep, I sided with settlers. And launching a nuke has been glitched for a long time now. Ppl can launch In  5 min or less, its easier to launch a nuke than to track down the last mole rat in a defending event. 
---
If I can 1 hit a scorchbeast with my super sledge I'm sure I'd make short work the rubble in front of the cave.
---
I just sleep and go afk a bit so they can do what they like--shop, use benches, grab food and water, whatever.
---
I was came across a camp with insane prices for ammo and aid items. 2000 caps for 5.56?  500 for a Stimpak??  ***What???***
---
Then I thought to myself, perhaps this is a newer player that thinks they were listing them as *bundles*. 2000 caps for 3500 5.56 would be reasonable. Same for 500 caps for 50 Stimpaks. 
---
Perhaps one day we‚Äôll be able to make ‚Äòpackage deals‚Äô or even ‚Äòbulk ammo‚Äô or ‚Äòbulk aid‚Äô. That would definitely help stabilize the market for ammo prices, I think.
---
I've been away from the game for 7-ish months. I don't know what stuff's worth anymore so I try to price reasonably.
---
But, until I get a feel for the market value of *everything* I'm selling, I'd rather price too high and not sell, than price too low and lose money.
---
For me, that's why my prices might seem off to other people
---
Haha, jokes on them.
---
I won't ever buy ammo for more than 1c per. I buy every fusion cell I can find.
---
Wow, i didnt knew about this glitch thanks dude
---
I camp hope looking for .308 and 50cal when I'm doing events but really when you buy all 5mm and then go dump it in you vendor for 5cp each its more in my pocket
---
Thank you me and a bunch of my friends are all dealing with this.
---
Your help is appreciated.
---
Or beg you to open the door. I just ignore any and all comments
---
Yes!! Eyebots are life..
---
As much as I love a good conspiracy theory, I'm not sure Bethesda is competent enough to even implement bugs reliably.
---
Legendary run snakes and latters style
---
I donated 1,000 this morning.
---
I love watching 40mm curve in the air.
---
100+? Not sure. I would like to see some sort of prestige system. 
---
They will probably continue to do limited time things like they did with ghillie suit a few months ago
---
I do this to my husbands camp all the time. Every time he moves doors or builds a new camp, he wants me to put things in hidden spots for him to find.
---
I think I‚Äôll use your Cowboy butts drive me nuts next time. He‚Äôs been talking about doing a new camp.
---
Have you finished the Wastelanders questline and gotten inside the Vault?
---
I guess 21st Century is too much to ask for?
---
Haha same!  That 1\* broadsider?  Landfill.  Hated doing it, but hauling around 16 lbs of extra bulk to earn 5 scrip (24 hrs later) wasn't an option.  I really hope they lift the cap on scrip.  Don't care about the 1000 total limit but the 150 a day is brutal.
---
No, I‚Äôm only level 33 and only been playing like a month so still clueless when it comes to how things work
---
That‚Äôs incorrect. You can get all three dailies before you finish the Vault Raid. 
---
One of my alts is currently pre-Vault Raid (about to work the Settlers prep side) and I get Vital Equipment from Ward daily.
---
I figure they have not addressed it because they want people to drop nukes for public events. I am sure there is also a million other reasons as well.
---
I was in a triple nuke lobby, not a single one hit cp, all queen
---
Had a guy come to my camp and scream for 5 minutes like he was trying to fuck a goat. goat sounds and all.
---
Grind üòÇ.  Events are usually good for legendary.  Certain ones like radiation rumble, paradise, path of enlightenment
---
I‚Äôve gotten all three dailies; Ward, Wren and Rocksy on my pre-Vault RAID alt.
---
That's no problem, friend! Just keep working on the main quests and you'll open up your ability to trade with him eventually. :)
---
16?  More like 160
---
Also most mobs can open doors. Molerats and mutants can pop them open too. 
---
And dunno about other folks, but my CAMP always loads in with the doors all open. I'm pretty sure the engine just pops them open at times.
---
Selling for 1 cap makes more then 2 with the taxation nonsense
---
There is an option at the bottom of the log in page for private that says all friends or team only. If it‚Äôs team only it‚Äôll kick almost everyone out within a few minutes. Friends only is only what works for me.
---
I try not to fast travel to my camp if someone is there lol don‚Äôt want to scare them off
---
You still get like... In the 100s of caps, fluxes, a unique drop and a 3-star legendary just for completing the event.
---
Still sucks you didn't get the Earle drop, but honestly the actual event reward is the largest share
---
AWOL armaments the colossus and queen fights are how I get all of mine
---
Check the option at the bottom of your log in page, x to change it. team only is bad and kicks people out, friends only seems to be stable for me.
---
Strange, i bought a +50% limb damage, instigating mini, mod it with accelerated barrel mod to reach 200 rate of fire. But I do not see any magic effect with Earl...
---
yea. On ps4
---
That's some cold shit.  :D
---
I stick at 6.8k but camp budget says NO
---
where you analyze the blood sample. It won't analyze.
---
Bruh
---
I guess TSE is still broken with durablity? I dont use one but everyone says its bad. I however the other day launched a nuke, did SBQ, and 2x colosus and my AAE still has durability left after that which seems perfectly fine to me.
---
so this is a pvp build...and you need 700 hp? have you ever considered trying not to get shot?
---
I feel the same way. I both love and hate people coming by. I usually just heart emote a shit ton and then try to quickly do what I need to do and then leave so I don't have to feel awkward the whole time lol.
---
People wanting this to be a completely soloable, single player entry equivalent is really going to hold back any cool content. Already seen people upset that certain modifiers on Daily Ops make it hard for bloodied builds to solo. This isn't Fallout 5 no matter how badly people want it to be.  
---
Vault Raids were such a cool concept and it sucks the bugs fucked it up so bad because the few times I ran it and it worked well it was SO fun with a group of friends. Hopefully one day they make a return with better execution.
---
I have no idea where Q came from. But it would be fun if he did.
---
Imagine having the patience to do that!
---
I hop because flamer..Gotta chase that fuel
---
Yup, it's like I built it purposely to look good and yet when people come and look at it I get embarassed hahahaha
---
too bad every little character is like $5 a piece
---
Use a private world
---
I will buy gamma rounds for any price. But I use them to murder wanted players.
---
&gt; efficiently
---
You can't, there are so many cheater that have been reported, yes even with video proof, but nearly all of them are still active.
---
VTU was actually a really cool vault story!
---
Yes! Like, I'm really glad people visit and all but it makes me self-conscious. I've got everything out in the open and ready for visitors to use, but I always feel weird if I'm in camp at the same time. 
---
And people spend ages in my camp! Like they just sit around and take in the view or whatever. I'll wave a friendly hi, but I usually end up teleporting somewhere far away LOL.
---
Inspirational 2 - take all the XP fellow dwellers
---
There is.
---
Have your commando buddy teammate down it, then everyone can loot it.
---
That sounds pretty freaking awesome to be honest!!
---
I dont but I didnt really build a house I built a sorta methhead junkyard/trailer park
---
Are you using a small generator from the atomic shop?
---
Q the Interloper?
---
it is pretty easy in general.  
---
I don't use the wall glitch either, the whole run is 15 mins or less if you know what you are doing.
---
Just swing it around and put some *spin* on it!
---
I absolutely guarantee you, I will find a way to blow my stupid ass up. üòÅ
---
PSA: If someone comes to your camp and invites you to their team, do not join. They will grief your camp.
---
Uranium Fever has 3 guaranteed legendary enemies. You tag them and you'll get some kind of legendary gear.
---
Did you see him do the glitch? Did you send a video of it to CS?
---
If not, he'll just claim that he spawned there.
---
I don't mind. I like to show off my wall of death I use to kill the behemoth that spawns in the lake next to my camp all the time.
---
Yeah I've got the max amount of them to power my camp since they take up bugger all space and are in a side room with my armco ammo machine
---
Have they bugged out or gone up I take it..?
---
Im looking to trade my helmet for the wendigo heads plan
---
Recorded him placing the armour and phasing through the wall
---
I do not believe that endurance buffs add to hit points, so you can only rely on hp max buffs.  Do you have adrenal reaction?  That would be the only mutation to supress to increase your hp.
---
Fast traveling from wood pile to woodpile, with our best Plushie by our side, delivering  ...the Redwoods ...the larches, ...the firs,  the mighty Scots pines... Are we not all  ...LUMBERJACKS... (of Steel?) 
---
https://youtu.be/pfRdur8GLBM
---
...JUST LIKE OUR DEAR MAMMAS???
---
It's ridiculous.  I'd love to leave a scorchbeast turd in front of their vendors as a response.
---
They almost can't at this point. How many vets would have rewards for level 101-200 unlocked on day 1?
---
Unless they reset overseer levels, they can only add event stuff.
---
Quick, look busy!
---
What about a system where you can rate peoples vendors
---
The animation is faster at least.
---
I just bought the clean straight jacket for 1k and someones came a while ago and im sure they dont know thats its very rare.
---
They're in Taggerty's quarters in Fort Defiance
---
Let people do what they want!
---
Right! I always feel like I HAVE to go say Hi if I'm in my camp and I see the little cap notification pop up
---
My camp is a raider base near the Rusty Pick, I love when people stop by. I'm really proud of my base, feels nice when I get a thumbs up or a salute.
---
Here‚Äôs a small snippet of just the above ground stuff from over 3 months ago in the form of a music video LoL. It‚Äôs changed a lot since then, but this is a fun way to check it out: https://youtu.be/3adUzwI8Mv0
---
There‚Äôs another video on that channel showing of the camp as a walkthrough with the underground included, but it‚Äôs still a lot different now.
---
I hate going to a camp to browse their store and they HAVE to quick travel there to hover or say something. Bro, just let me look.
---
Instead of feeling like you're standing on your roof waving like an idiot, try happily jumping on your roof and waving because it's just fun to do. Then go about your day.
---
I be like OMG WHAT I DO NOW ?
---
AFAIK, you can only complete the challenge once. But claiming a workshop is frequently listed as a challenge. Mount Blair is pretty time consuming if you go through all the steps.
---
From what I hear, the glass turn in challenge on September 22nd's reward is another meat week event. So prepare to farm for plans again shortly!
---
I hate how you cannot lower the price of ammo less than 1 cap I mean 100 caps for 100 bullets just why
---
You propably know this already after all this time but just commenting on this as somebody may have the same question and find this post like i did..
---
Ultracite fusion core only takes 1 fusion core to craft, even if it says 2 on your workbench. But you need to have 2 cores in your inventory to be able to craft. Another bug (beneficial this time).
---
So 1 fusion core can be made into 3 ultracite fusion cores (or more with super duper procs)
---
Lucky you.  
---
Game freeze every couple minutes, game crash couple times a day
---
Yeah. It's only viable in this circumstance
---
This is exactly what I'm stressed about lol
---
Something niche I won't have equipped.
---
Most of the time my team are just pointlessly sharing cards that I have anyway like strange in numbers.
---
Do you know how pvp works? Tesla's aim bot wherever you are. And even with a jetpack you have to land, and being able to tank lots of hits without dying is very important, and don't get me started on ac 130 explosive Gatling Plasma builds. It's about beating the meta man. And "avoiding shots" is just something that doesn't exist in this meta, even with a stealth boy, because those are countered by berry mentats.
---
I‚Äôll also add that serums sell to vendors for 500 caps with high charisma. Personally I price them at the rate I would get from a vendor,
---
Toilet rat ftw.
---
Only good for melee or heavy weapons
---
Say hello to a level 100 and above

Its known but not acknowledged by bethesda.

Can you sell one to me?

You can find them laying around in one of the TNT domes. It‚Äôs a fun side quest to find the key to unlock it.
---
If I had to drag out PA everytime to run the reactor room, I'd never launch another nuke.
---
They should at least give an unlock code the the hallway/mainframe door once you complete your first nuke.
---
Yes for the past week I‚Äôve been having a ton of crashes to the desktop when I fast travel especially.
---
Even better the same person bought all my toxic goo for 1cp each and is selling it for 20. Its free at West Tech. I only use it to control my rad levels
---
I overcharge for chems, literally everything except med-x is above base value, and every single day someone will come and buy up most of my stock.    I assume it‚Äôs because nobody wants to go on ingredient runs, which are kind of a pain until you get a good route down.    Especially formula p, hunting down more than 20 ash rose is my least favorite activity.
---
So depending on what people are selling, they‚Äôre likely charging a convenience fee, people will definitely pay caps to save themselves some time.
---
Every 1 point Endurance adds +5 hp to your health pool, so having something that increases it is always good.
---
But there is no way to debate IF this player was even cheating. It is so obvious ü§£. Why wouldn't they ban his account? (the main one)
---
You want dual wield for pistols? Let's talk about how you only use one hand and one glove for the Boxing Gloves......
---
My wife also suffer from anxiety, my only advice to you is to try role playing mentally when you playing online..  leave the anxiety irl and be somebody else online
---
Wtf router have to do with my Xbox f list not synching ?!
---
Yeah that part sucks. My least favorite part about it for sure.  Ran one last night to show my friends Earle
---
I wouldn't be surprised but it does work. I live by explosive weapons and as a bloodied build it's easy to kill your self. This helps 100%, hell it even makes the queen screams not hurt.
---
Tried that several time and it was still broken.
---
I‚Äôve only done the event twice, but The only time I died was during my first try. Every single one of us yeeted down the mine without power armor and we killed ourselves lol. I haven‚Äôt gotten anything good, just the rug plans and a hunters auto launcher :/
---
Nuka-Cowla: We're on our own
---
Sugar Bomb: It's up to us
---
Daisy: Form feet and legs! Form arms and body! And, I'll form the head(s)!
---
I stopped using explosive weapons. The durability is garbage in this game.   
---
Somethings definitely broken cause my durability seems to vary day to day.
---
I know I was just messing lol
---
As for events, it depends on your level and if you're in a group of capable players.
---
Low level, farm Leader of the Pack. Mid-level, do events like Swarm of Suitors and especially Uranium Fever. High-level, do whatever you want but A Colossal Problem and Scorched Earth will be your best source of legendaries from nukes. Other than that, Project Paradise, Free Range, Radiation Rumble...events like those have guaranteed legendaries.
---
Nope, because they usually buy things from my camp, and that‚Äôs a good thing lol
---
Bethesda fixed it üòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
Yeah the they start buying all of my comics and I have to jump server cause it took me a bit to stockpile so many comics
---
That‚Äôs an experience
---
But no stinky piles.
---
This games canon, if it's even considered a canon game in future entries, is only going to account for a single nuke to kill the SBQ. It's just like any other MMO; in WoW the lore is not that Illidan was killed thousands of times by random adventurers. Other lore is not actually that butchered. I see a common one being referenced is the existence of super mutants in Appalachia but if you read the terminals at West Tek it's completely believable that they'd experiment locally with the FEV.
---
You'll have to relocate the entire Documents folder to the other drive. Photos are going to sit in My Games\\Fallout 76\\Photos and the My Games folder is always in your Documents folder. 
---
I wouldn't recommend locating that on an external drive, and redirecting it to a network location won't allow photos to be saved at all.
---
Lol I offten do that and I have a gun character I can use but it would just be nice to not have to do any of that
---
I've locked the doors into my main building everything else is open so I kinda just hide inside my house or I'm afk asleep on the bed
---
.....you mean the chello?
---
As a space and sci-fi obsessed nut, I absolutely love this idea.
---
Shouted this out when I saw the title. Beware of teat singes.
---
Right, there were so many interesting weapons in previous games I want them back.
---
I cant even do this on a private lol
---
For my router, I did all the configuration on their website. But tbh, i just googled everything on how to do this &amp; that basically
---
But to log into my router‚Äôs website, i had to find my router‚Äôs admin &amp; password which was on the back of my router.
---
Which platform? I can give you one
---
One of my runs I couldn't find his body.  As I ran out of the mine I found some of his appendages hanging from the ceiling just prior to the exit (outside of the chest room) and was able to loot him on the way out.
---
No problem. And for the record, I personally consider low level to be 2-20, mid level is 20-45 and high level to be 45+ 
---
Everyone probably has their own idea, just don't want you thinking that by high level I mean like 200+ lol
---
Sometimes I stand on stage at my strip club in my underwear doing the funky mothman while people check out the camp. I wish they could make it rain caps at my dance.
---
Yea I wish they focus more on gear with ‚Äúgearset bonus‚Äù and gear quality upgrade just like in eso
---
Do i know how to pvp? lol. I know enough to not get shot. Besides you are looking at a simple math problem. If 110 dam is the usual max dam in pvp, then 6 shots would be 660 hp and 7 shots would be 770 hp. So once again why do you need 700 hp when it would be far more productive to avoid just 1 shot?
---
The thing I always do when I fast travel to someone elses camp is, on the off chance they're there, I wave so they know someone is here so they **DON'T LOG OFF WHILE I'M ABOUT TO BUY ALL THE THINGS!**
---
What platform are you on?
---
15cp is what I sell them for
---
I gave 1000, only so much stash space.
---
Magic bullet
---
Step 1: join a server on the character with the missing friends list.
---
Step 2: join that server with 2 other people, one of them needs to remove that friend from there list after joining there server.
---
Step 3: all (3) characters go back to main menu, have the **person who removed** the player with the friends list bug send a friend invite ( do not invite on the character with the friends list bug, this will not work, the bugged character won't be able to accept it yet but send one anyway) 
---
Step 4: Create a team in main menu with the 3rd character that is still friends with everyone. The bugged character will need to use the "recent" menu to accept this team, it's why you joined the server.
---
Step 5: wait a few minutes go grab a drink, watch a YouTube video or something. After I'd say about 5 minutes the friends list will force a re-sync you can then accept the friend invite and use your list as normal.
---
Because a Raven‚Äôs mask sold on the marketplace yesterday for 30,000 caps. It‚Äôs wild.
---
i shall have a look next time i am on. ta
---
Like yeah basically you gotta get past the laser grids the normal way( getting the card erasing it...) then go strait to the door to the storage which requires a terminal. You got to go pretty close to it like about 1foot away and go [map/photomode/zoom past ur character/ exit photomode/ run forward] and if you do that quick enough you can glitch through the door, doo the same with the big door which requires the mainframe cores. Finally just finish the silo like you would normally so start the process and protect the lil robot dudes... done card in code in and launch
---
Damn I got hella scammed then.
---
True, lol
---
I have a BE gatling on a melee alt I use to down them. It seems to work well enough with just tenderizer and bloody mess for dmg+.
---
Nah, Everyone else will just be playing catch up ;)
---
Yeah this bug has been there since forever. Also happens on all gauss weapons.
---
I mean yeah, 76 at least is free of the absurdity that is players undercutting eachother until the economy crashes, I just really wish I knew what I was doing lmao.
---
Nobody seems to understand OPs question so far.
---
Their point is (if you weren't aware) that crafted gear which comes with a condition such as weapons and armor is crafted with a higher condition depending on your intelligence. It can go up to 200%
---
Honestly OP I think your answer is just experiment with it. Although I also wonder if different items require different levels of intelligence to reach maximum 200% condition?
---
I think he fucked himself.   Shoulda told him to go back to CoD/fortnite? Honestly though, I don't get why I see so many posts about racial slurs and triggered people. It's a game, your playing a game and not working...enjoy it . ALSO, WHY DO SOME PLAYERS LOCKUP THEIR DANG WORKBENCHES? fer chrissakes man, I am carrying a trailer load on my back!
---
I just bought them with rewards atoms. They were all on sale for 210-250 each when I got them the other day.
---
Okay so if i see a lvl 300+ heavy gunner pa keep dying i shouldnt feel bad, lol... I was farming the wendigos xp and screws and watching these two players drop in and die nonstop, like... It was only the three of us, and I had no stims only purified water smh. So i kept strafing around picking off wendigo mobs and these two dudes seemed to stay right by the shaft each time where the aoe shit built up heavy. Keep moving ppl! Dont stay in one spot! Didnt have a mic and my tv was muted, but... Eventually their respawn maxed and they both dropped, leaving me with practice to solo earle, and found I can melee him close to the tunnel and pull mobs inside and control the fear direction without fail. Needless to say I need 1st now so I can do a solo melee run
---
False. Extra carry weight is good for any build.
---
I‚Äôll buy 3 stars with hopefully 90% reduced weight for scrip. I usually look for about 200 caps a star for those purposes.
---
yes
---
Does ultracite fusion cores work for power armor or only ultracite weapons?
---
no
---
What is your accuracy on your gun?
---
I‚Äôve charged as much as 76 caps successfully.
---
Extra carry weight is nice, but it uses that oh so special perk point
---
I do enjoy players names sometimes.
---
I saw itouchbobies once.
---
Does he in fact touch bobies?
---
Did he mean bodies?  Is he a mortician?
---
How do the bobies feel about his touching them?
---
Did he mean boobies?
---
Was the name ironic, making fun of other such names?
---
Did he in fact mean that name seriously?  And if so how old is he or she?
---
So.  Many.  Questions.
---
I too stand there waving like Forest Gump.
---
Ill keep fed 76 up on my phone and hop camps lookkng for cheap trade fodder to use on the "other" sub. Have flipped MANY things.
---
That sounds really nice. Now the only problem is the single at-level shotgun with perks I've found in 70 levels since hitting level cap has been a stalker's haha. It's like the game is telling me it wants me to pick rifles or heavies for my secondary weapon type.
---
Retreat into "I was just joking" when called out. Pathetic. Juvenile.
---
What about giving them more crit damage and weak spot damage?
---
Haha, I feel exactly the same way! Except I crouch and hide or fast travel away. And then I feel embarrassed for being such a goofball! :)
---
I lucked into a junkies explosive and was able to mod it to auto recently.
---
I didn't respond to him in game, because that's what he wanted. I wasn't triggered. But there's no reason anyone has to endure a person like that. If he got perma banned. Good.
---
Brutal.  Well good to know.  I'll use those 5 points on something useful then.  Thanks!
---
Yeah it got to the point where I dont even team up and just leave every man for themselves, tbh. I dont need the stims for myself as much as I first thought, but I dont wanna waste em on ppl who will keep dying so
---
I mean, hopefully they will, they haven‚Äôt said anything bad far as I know but there has been a lot of reports about the issue
---
Messaged you :)
---
I like that the reaction from a majority of players was probably "Gre-who?"
---
Sure. Make excuses for an incompetent dev team. Shameful.
---
51 bloodied (no-concentrated fire). Accuracy doesn't seem to play a part as I can get 100% hit chance and still miss 10 times in a row unless I exit vats.
---
\*chef‚Äôs kiss* This is like Shakespeare.
---
Replied
---
Same I can‚Äôt wait for a sbq fight to last 22min
---
Anyone charging more than 1 cap per ammo shouldn't have a lot of business.  The only ammo i say would be an exception for caps to be more than 1 is ultracite ammo, but no one sells ultracite..
---
Things like this are why I miss solid single player games, with a decent multi-player that isn't based on "spend as much as possible".
---
I think you just inadvertently invented a new form of gambling or a new game. 
---

Incorrect.
---
What kind of shotgun is it? I never have problems hitting my hits but I focus accuracy and range not caring about the weight
---
Oh okay. Thanks for the info!
---
Thank you for your effort.
---
I beg to differ
---
Same here, got over 300 script and 5000 bullion just waiting for BoS to arrive and but something worthwhile.  Its nice to have bought just about everything and finished with the CPT Cosmos run.
---
&gt;kill a monster that was quite happy mining it‚Äôs own business.
---
First of all cap has no real value  you can only hold 30k at a time by designed 
---
they are just used as a way of trading for items.  You can trade ammo or other resource 
---
I have traded  ammo , resource ( screws or leads scrap) for 3 star legendary plenty of times  or Vice versa
---
Triple tap VATs. On, off then on again.
---
That is a really good idea. I've been dropped on my butt so many times!
---
If I had a nickel for every event that was gone by the time I finished fast traveling... I'd have some foldin' money by now.
---
Yep just came on here to find this. 
---
Higher end pc. Nothing even close to heat issues, lots of crashes on fast travels.
---
Cello*
---
or try to sell you 500 radroach meats....
---
But yes toxic goo for 20cp.... i literally went and got 200lb of it and dropped it at their camp. And they actually put it in the vendor
---
Set up a vendor and let them do there things, maybe wave or depending on their level give them some supplies, maybe some scrap and ammo
---
I get awkward. All my stuff is on the base level and if I'm there I'm usually running around crafting or changing the layout. 
---
Did give a newer player some waters and stimpacks one day for visiting and he wanted to team up and stayed at my camp for like half hour. I was only on for lunch and usually only team up with people I know so I felt super awkward
---
I don't mind it one bit had no issues either. I did have one guy message me on Xbox and gave me a tip on the window walls to get the wallpaper on them
---
Mine are made for people to visit.
---
One is at a rest stop,  well stocked with nuka.
---
One is at / under a graveyard.
---
One is a firec station .
---
One is a mistress of mystery theater across from the manor.
---
One is a roadside garage and checkpoint. 
---
Etc
---
He's definitely Grognak's arch-nemesis.  It's also his decapitated head on Grognak's throne.
---
But I would agree - the medieval sorcerer thing doesn't seem like a natural fit for Grognak.  I'm sure there are sorcerers in the Conan universe, but they probably stay within the rags-and-loincloths aesthetic.
---
I completely agree. I'm nosey and love looking around at everyone's camps.. just let me in dang it!
---
I once watched a lvl 328 pick my lvl 3 lock to my small room. They must've been overjoyed to walk in and see absolutely nothing of value. Best part is 3 of my teammates came over and  shot at him, while he screamed ( screeched) he would have his revenge. I have never regretted anything more, than the fact that I wasn't recording him. If he were to say he'll get me next time, I think I would've died.
---
I go to a different room and wait for them to leave
---
They had an incorrect budget value applied to them originally, costing less budget to build than the normal ones. They‚Äôve patched that recently so you‚Äôll see a budget increase because of those. It sucks, but you‚Äôll have to delete a bunch of stuff to free up budget again.
---
You should probably just dance for them ...
---
Maybe he was watching a PewDiePie video in the background?
---
‚ÄúWe are aware of an issue with...‚Äù means they probably will never get round to fixing it, along with all the other similar issues.
---
I would prefer obtainable levels of plans over new plans added.
---
Wow! I mean, its literally the coolest thing I have come across by far! Its incredibly impressive. I'm curious what it looks like now?! üî•üî•üî• hats off to you man!
---
Yup, same here, game freezes, audio chops for 1-2 seconds then crash to desktop, mainly after fast traveling / loading.
---
I feel more awkward visiting other peoples' camps. I always feel like I'm invading privacy or some shit. No idea why.
---
My issue is two doors: front door, no lock, come on in; back door faces a spawn point so a level 1 lock to keep the riff-raff out, Punk wanders around through both leaving them open. I get annoyed coming home and finding glowing snallys or somesuch inside trashing the place. Dude, you somehow unlocked it, close it behind you.
---
90% of why I play is building, I 2nd this
---
Have not played for a couple weeks then got back on and the gauss bug seems a lot worse than it was previously.
---
i think the same sometimes. i only got my vendors in a seperate room with a lock on the door in case i get near the caps limit. oh, and the ammu machine - take my water, take from my collectron but that 556 is mine.
---
I do only when I see stable flux or plastic. Other than that I sell all my stuff at 10% or less cost of the standard value price.
---
That's okay. You're being wrong doesn't really effect me and my 500 carry weight and 700 damage on my backup weapon I am unspec'd for.
---
That sounds pretty sick, what's your psn?
---
Veggie Week!  Strangler Hearts drop veggie hearts that you have to stuff.
---
or maybe a form of a mutation where for a long time everything just has a blue/green tint and no amount of cures will help, you just have to ride it out.
---
Dammit... üòï well I will try and see what I can make work but I didn't catch that on the patch notes.. üôÑ but one way or another I will find a way to fix it..
---
But thank you for the heads up ü§ò
---
I gave 3k wood so far. Planning on more soon
---
Mk buddy nice damage but it doesnt even come close to my build
---
I don't know it having it out is shitty by itself but there was a moment when FO youtubers were pranking new players and recording their reactions as things went black
---
Good idea, but won't that drain Vats? Really this bug really affects events where its critical to kill multiple targets quickly, such as Radiation Rumble or line in the sand. Line in the sand is especially troubling because some 12 enemies spawn on the sonic generator. If only a third of those I target hit this bug I am slowed considerably, and run out of AP. If AP is gone there is no one-shotting with a shotgun, unfortunately.
---
Hopfully he will take you to a nice dinner at the whitesprings resort first.
---
Why not both?
---
Yeah they probably removed the quest because they couldn't fix the exploit with it.
---
I could be wrong, but I've not seen this quest for weeks now.
---
You could buy repair kids. Look their are in sale. But don't get absurd their is no way that Bethesda would make enemies harder to kill only to sell repair kids...
---
No offense to the majority of PC players but I don't wanna cross play with that platform, hacking is rife.
---
Your part of the reason I keep my camp site locked down...I dont want you using my workbenches and not cleaning up after using them and not to mention I dont want you guys going through my stash to get my god roll gear!!!
---
  Btw I dont keep my doors locked or anything. Just a paranoid p.o.v we might hear
---
On the patch notes it‚Äôs listed as something like ‚Äúfixed a build budget glitch involving the small generators‚Äù. They keep it vague and never clarify that it‚Äôll ultimately screw people over that didn‚Äôt intentionally manipulate the generators for a glitch. But this happens every time after build budget glitches are patched. Happened with the asbestos roofs, dark cherry wood floors, circus trailers, and now these.
---
Lol, same thing happened to me. The meat event out in the mire. I was alone and when she appeared I didn‚Äôt see her. Instant acid death. She sat right beside the drum. Killed me 9 times. Once I finally reloaded and killed her, I died as well, then got the spawn bug and couldn‚Äôt respawn. I waited 10 minutes at the prompt and loaded back in to get my junk.
---
Now it's a party!
---
Same, I can tank almost anything,but if I take a workshop to do get my challenge done, I usually get one shotted from the jumping fortnite shotgun monkeys.
---
They changed it so only Ultracite weapons
---
I fixed it. Added UDP 3000-3010 to my port forwards, in 30-1hr it synced
---
I love when people visit, but it makes me sad I cannot chat with them.
---
It feels good when I get a Thumbs Up or Heart emote, but I want to know **why** they give me those!
---
I don‚Äôt want crossplay, too many hackers on PC.
---
On PC it's fine
---
Definatley trying this
---
I sometimes do feel weird when I'm in the middle of doing something around my camp but really I built my camp to kinda be a hangout for people. But I don't  get much traffic normally  anymore which makes me sad.. lol though I do get a few people when the event at the Monongah mine activates if the person launching the nuke spares my camp.
---
I hate these type of posts.
---
Look kid. Just think for yourself. Be a man maybe?I don't know.
---
It's 10$. If you don't like it,you'll get over it. Or not in your case.
---
Nah I love it. I wave to visitors and heart react if they buy from my shop. 
---
I also did a lot of decorating and turned my camp into a whole gun shop with attached firing range and a church, and sometimes people message me saying they like it : )
---
I sell them regularly for about 100-150 caps.
---
First of all, why are you on a 4 month old post
---
Second of all, that glitch still works
---
Lastly, your raider daily is chosen randomly between the two, you might have just been unlucky
---
They might be trying to get specific item or something so they tends to focus on getting that more than interacting with other players. No need to feel awkward, despite the game is as good as what people were hoping for, this game probably has the friendliest community EVER
---
....DON‚ÄôT DO IT!
---
https://youtu.be/8kNwvIEQsg0
---
....aaaaaah ....aaah....aaah!!
---
Whats a good way to make underground bases?
---
Haha thanks! If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can show you the camp later. The basic layout is the same but I‚Äôve learned how to merge items and make items float since then, so there‚Äôs a lot of that going on. Different floors and walls too
---
By nature. You're shooting more rounds per reload. Man I miss the Never Ending prefix from Fallout 4. Would love a Never Ending Pump Action, DOOM style. Only Quad shotgun I've ever seen was a level 5 from Leader of the Pack.
---
I do 2000+ with a B2525 rifle. Melee should be loads more
---
I share a level 3 glow sight because I figure most won‚Äôt have it and just about all enemies are glowing by the time you‚Äôre needing the damage boost.
---
Maybe they don't want to think about what you did in their bed.
---
I prefer my xbox game-play without MIRV miniguns, so I'm good.
---
I‚Äôll message you
---
Yes, I am sure you look at the SBQ and she dies. The OP wanted to know a good option for a single point card for a Bloodied build. Radicool meets the criteria. Tell me, what would you do with the extra point?
---
Well at least now i have a reason to kinda remodel my camp.. but it's a shame since I'd been using those for months... just helps save on space and zero noise.. üòÖ
---
I think mid September sometime. Idk if they've actually given an exact date yet.
---
Wood yard next to sons of Dane is good to.
---
The answer is to be more awkward. In my camp or others I like to sneak as close as I can behind people, stand perfectly still, and just turn on my pipboy light or pull out my flaming chainsaw. Once I turned on my light behind a lvl 10 and as he turned, he freaked out spraying bullets everywhere. He ran as fast as he could away refusing to listen to wave or heart emotes. Best waste of time hobby ever.  
---
 https://i.imgur.com/uENhqXW.jpg
---
I wonder if they do it to lock their ally inside or outside and/or they're OCD about doors being left open? Maybe they also don't care to show off their stuff which just forces me to Peepin' Tom my way around their house looking for a bed or chair by the window. üòã
---
Yes, a good place too.
---
I once shot 7 arrows at a scorched 20 feet away and missed all of them even though they were all at 95% in vats. I then walked up and stood right beside it, shot again at point blank range, 95% chance... and missed again. Finally I got pissed and just beat it to death with the bow.
---
Out of all the shite wrong with this game, they need to address the vats bug and stealth bugs before anything else... Having those bug out for a bloodied stealth commando is pretty detrimental to the whole build.
---
I have 1st. Damn that's a shame. Love the look of that mask.
---
How did you know! And he never specified that it is 1 point, to ME it is a waste of a point, you dont have to cry because i dont like your card choice
---
Only if they leave before looking at all the cool parts
---
Had one guy ask me why I didn't buy anything. Told him he had ammo set at 100 caps. He said that was cheap. Told him I usually don't sell 1 star gear for 10k, stims for 500, and ju nk for 900 caps. If you hit my camp, you usually see a bag containing 900 steel, fiberglass,screws and lead. My stash is usually capped.
---
I think the Armor Ace and the Power Patrol stuff they have planned for Season 2 is pretty neat because it takes something campy and seemingly innocuous, but when combined with the context of the Fallout universe, it becomes darkly cynical, if not disturbing.
---
It's basically a riff on the 1980s G.I. Joe cartoon, where you have Armor Ace and his Power Patrol, who are ostensibly American and super patriotic, versus the evil Red Vipers, who are ostensibly Communists.
---
This is exactly how the Pre-War Government would have legitimized and normalized its agenda.  When you get down to it, it's a grotesque perversion of something relatively innocent, a kiddie cartoon, to make the horrors of war sound like something cheerful.  Where everyday, good guys fight bad guys, and the good ways *always* win.  And that naivete is what makes G.I. Joe such perfect fodder in the Fallout universe.
---
This is also something that kind of feels like it's missing from the Unstoppables universe.  Captain Cosmos and Dr. Zorbo could have easily been a Space Race allegory, with Dr. Zorbo being a thinly-disguised Soviet caricature, and it probably would have felt a bit more connected to the Fallout universe, rather than a side plot.
---
Hopefully someone else will sort you out!
---
Because fuckers leave the doors open.
---
If you are playing solo, without Ricochet, and take on Super Mutants, Sheepsquatch, etc, and if you start firing and don't let up, the target's damage should drop scary fast.
---
If you start firing at an enemy not at full health, the effect probably won't trigger.
---
I have .38 and .44 set for free. It still counts as a challenge score.
---
This. Me and my teammates have a bad game going of hiding shit or placing stuff were u can‚Äôt select it to remove. Lol.
---
Yup, no friends list, had a fun time trading today ü•≥
---
I bought one from vendor bot chad, the best chad
---
I‚Äôd rather they deal with the huge number of bugs and glitches first! Even newly released colossal problem has some extremely annoying ‚Äòfeatures‚Äô.
---
Yes please! I want the Raiders one so much!
---
Yeah it‚Äôs literally getting worse with every update. Hopefully it gets fixed with the next one :)
---
On the flip side... I often roll up in someones camp... Take their water collectrons stuff junk etc... Sleep in their bed and leave. I don't even wave. I just pretend they're an NPC.
---
I've been hunting down canned coffee. Got a good stockpile of honey already. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I think there's also one at fort defiance on the top floor on the desk in that guys room.
---
Pretty sure he means console only crossplay, might be wrong in which case I agree with everyone else. Nope to pc and their shenanigans
---
I don‚Äôt care to have cross play with pc but ps4 and Xbox would be nice. As I have my main since beta account on Xbox but then bought game from Redbox when they stopped renting games for 3 dollars for PlayStation. I figured by the time I bought it and all the games that have cross play that fallout would have it by then. But I was wrong. And even tho I love the game it‚Äôs hard to start from scratch all over on a different system. And I don‚Äôt know about anyone else, but game looks and runs smoother on my Xbox then it does pa4
---
I have a camp built like a cryptid themed diner and with a hidden mothman shrine so if I have visitors I pop on my owl mask and pastors vestments and encourage them to have a look around.
---
EDIT: if you‚Äôre on PC come find me in the Ash Heap at the [Waffle Truth](https://imgur.com/a/9XgOKrk).
---
"Why"? I can only speculate to that...
---
Knot funny
---
I have anxiety too. It makes me nervous when I'm near other players at any point. They could be judging my camp or my weapon or my witch costume or..... all you can do is keep going. When someone is at my camp, I will wave at them and then  keep doing what I was doing, but with haste so I can ft away.
---
It doesn't matter how amazing your build and weapon are if you can't hit the target on time, lol. Missing = 0 dps
---
I locked a guy in my house last night, and chased him around with a shotgun.
---
It seems to drop plans in 3s.  I've seen Nuke Mine, Nuka-Cola grenade, and something else.
---
Because pc players don‚Äôt even want to play with other pc players.
---
I wonder what would be the most annoying thing to drop in someone's camp.
---
I mean I was asking if there were potential bugs that can happen with it but ok
---
I‚Äòd like to see crossplay between consoles as there shouldn‚Äôt be much difference.
---
Crossplay between consoles and PC is a big no from me at the current state - hacked items, nw cheating. Also to add since it‚Äôs possible to use Mods (no complain tbh - would use perk loadout etc. myself) it‚Äôs not the same game somehow.
---
PC player here.. none taken. We understand the plague that befalls our community and wouldn't want to cross contaminate.
---
There's the Gorilla Safari Backpack, Strongman outfit, and Strongman Super Sledge skin as well in the new Treasure Hunt loot.
---
It could just be a thematic grouping.
---
The Legendary Run didn't bring astronauts and aliens to Appalachia, and Armor Ace isn't bringing Store Brand G.I. Joe either.
---
It's refreshing to get new aesthetic themes. Think I'm getting sick of the Communist stuff, despite how great it looks.
---
If he's running bloodied, higher HP makes you less likely to get one shot because at 20% health you'll be above 110 hp. Thats kind of worst case scenario though because your assasins whatever armor should negate enough damage to not get one shot unless everything doesn't proc at once.
---
See that's unusual which I like. Don't have enough room to run that perk and it's a good one too.
---
Who's crying? Why can't you just a answer the question? What would you do with the single point, which is in Endurance, and that no matter what your build is you will always have 1 point in anyway, is more practically useful than Radicool for a Bloodied build?
---
Agree
---
After someone maliciously killed my pet deathclaw, (haven‚Äôt been able to find another one to tame) I‚Äôve been wary of visitors. I‚Äôm not in a high traffic spot but sometimes people come and tear my camp up too. The door is right there.
---
You're either a genius or I am just that drunk .
---
It's just a theme for the cosmetics of this one event 
---
I wouldn't read too much into it
---
I need both of these NOW
---
The more windigo the better, I like the xp
---
I would rather use lifegiver than radicool
---
Nope.
---
Only Endurance from your SPECIAL points does that. Consumables/armor that boost Endurance don't affect your health.
---
Been a bug since day one.
---
You might want to try the #1 PVP tactic and just chug dozens of Nuka Quantum. It stacks on itself ad infinitum.
---
Are there many games that have crossplay? That seems incorrect.
---
Already suffer in game from having an old console, and poor internet, yes Bethesda I'm ready for my next punishment!
---
Tagerty is a lady
---
Yeh, I honestly feel for you guys over there. Hopefully one day the developers get 1 step ahead, not just in fallout but on a whole.
---
The issue with all three of those is that they don't buff the overall damage of a generally weak and slow firing class of weapon. Most pistols fire at the speed of a single-shot rifle with less damage and no auto-options for the harder hitting ones. Not to mention revolver reload times. The only viable casual way to play is a VATS Crit build or an Instigating Silenced Gauss Pistol for a none-vats build.
---
However, all become basically useless the moment you take them into group content like the Queen or Earl. They simply can't do anything but tickle damage and you become a waste of space, especially given Earl is limited to 8 players per instance. Daily Ops? Better hope it's not Chameleon day or else your VATS build is utterly useless, and Sneak builds simply might as well not turn at all.
---
There is nothing really wrong with \*how\* pistols work. It's the massive damage drop off they suffer compared to more competent weapon classes.
---
All enemies can open doors. Pretty ridiculous.
---
I just power armor glitch myself right on in.
---
M daughter started playing recently so we logged onto the event as much as possible too for upgrades, loot etc lots of cow suits and the like although not one salad plan...ironic lol
---
I noticed the same thing last night.. thought it was just me
---
Wouldnt surprise me, half of the perks are broke imo, Ammosmith, Gunsmith, White Knight...
---
I just go to the window and hit craft on a station and get in anyways
---
Oh? Got some OCD do ya?!
---
*Game Engine opens doors*
---
Have a slightly terrible day
---
With Love
---
Todd
---
PS. Make sure to pick up a copy of Skyrim for your Toaster
---
It doesn't help much at all, sadly. I was excited too until I tried it.
---
True. But wouldn‚Äôt it be fun to have a circus themed update? What if it was a once a year event. A traveling Circus comes to Appalachia. With quests and events.
---
The devs have said they are interested in creating new things rather than just repeat what‚Äôs already been done. 
---
Like some asked about aliens being added, and they said there‚Äôs already been an update in previous games that explored that.
---
May favorite thing to shoot in VATs is a 2shot broadsider at Scorchbeasts. Watching both cannonballs track the target is hilarious.
---
Fortnite, rocket league, and call of duty modern warfare are the 3 biggest games off the top of my head with crossplay in them. There may be more but maybe not as big/popular as the 3 I mentioned
---
Cheating was low for awhile but has come back hard. We'll never be totally free of this nonsense. As always though report and block (blocking does nothing but why not).
---
Is it not a double bass?
---
scrap your broken razorgrain to get 1 razorgrain back. then just re-plant it
---
Do you guys *really* think that Bethesda could pull off dual wield without it being a clunky and broken weapon experience? Seriously, this is Bethesda.
---
Exactly
---
There are actually a bunch of ways I‚Äôve seen (standing bass, piano, cooking spit, mr fuzzy ride, etc), but my favorite is with the my personal terminal. Here‚Äôs what I do, it requires 4 items (a foundation, stairs, the small brown doormat, and the my personal terminal):
---
Place the foundation. Place the stairs on the foundation going upwards. Place down the doormat anywhere. Then place the terminal on the mat so that the front screen side is hanging off of the mat, but the back of the terminal is halfway on the mat. Place it to where you can still grab the mat and basically pick up both the mat and the terminal. Now place that combo on the stairs (usually the 5th or 6th step from the bottom depending on the terrain and type of stairs you‚Äôre using) with the screen facing towards the bottom of the stairs. Once the mat and terminal are on the stairs, look at the very top of the stairs (at the railing) and select them to move them. You want to now place them so they‚Äôre going downward into the ground instead of up. This can be annoying to get just right, but picking the stairs up from their highest point makes it pretty easy. If everything is lined up right, you can now access the terminal to go underground. Then just build down from there, placing more stairs and then a floor. 
---
If this explanation is confusing or you just wanna see it in action, just message me and I‚Äôll upload a video to YouTube of how it‚Äôs done and send you the link
---
I'm just happy with all the screws you can get. Me and my friends have been farming the wendigo spawns, and each time we leave with close to 500 screws each. That, the 8 notes, and the garunteed 3*** are the reason I do it.
---
Omg thank you
---
I agree completely...but...it is much cheaper to reuse/repurpose existing assets when making new content.  If they release, for unrelated reasons, enough assets of a compatible theme they might eventually notice and say "hey, we have the the stuff we would need for a circus, why not do one?"
---
So you're saying 15 extra HP is more beneficial than a massive buff to carry weight and melee damage?
---
There is no player made building that can't be accessed. Either by using a workbench through windows or power armor gimmich through door.
---
What? Ammosmith works
---
Geez, glad I'm on PC. That sucks dude.
---
Hi, can I have your PSN? I would love to visit your Camp üëå
---
Don't get me wrong. Could be cool for sure. 
---
I just don't see it happening
---
Awesome point.
---
Is fallout 76 the first Bethesda game you play? they‚Äôll deal with the huge number of bugs breaking the game whenever dinosaurs come back into existence
---
Add the Fletchette mod and use in VATS. Been one shotting almost all enemies.
---
Hey there, just curious if you are selling one of the jackets? I've never been able to earn one so I'm looking to buy if possible.
---
Yep üòÇ I hopped right through a window last night just to use a workbench and a stash box
---
So does gunsmith and White Knight. And Action Boy/Girl as well
---
Plushieeeeessssss
---
I actually meant full on crossplay with PC included but now that I got reminded of pc hackers I think it should be console crossplay like what everyone else is saying
---
Yup. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on with his perks if he thinks they aren‚Äôt working
---
I feel like they nerfed it, i stopped using it for a month and i swear i could craft x180 on some things but not the most i can do is x27. That doesnt feel like 80% to me but maybe im just crazy lol
---
I seem to find more wood in the Savage Divide than I can in the Forest region. Or maybe it's just easier to spot fallen tree trunks. Funnily enough, I actually can't see the trees because of the forest, rather than not being able to see the forest for the trees.
---
Sure thing!
---
Okay sir I'll keep a lookout for that üëç
---
Set it to auto,to team,then to auto,seems to fix it.
---
Did you just open them or did forward them?
---
or go to the forest region. that shit is literally everywhere.
---
I'm still on the fence about instanced content. Found myself quite often alone or with 1 / 2 players. Not that the server was empty, no I joined the big ! with 5 - 7 players attending. First come, first serve is a bit lame in my opinion.
---
I joined ACP for my first time last night and was following the lead of the only other player in the mine. They led me to the shaft and jumped down. As I jumped down I saw them just sitting on the edge in the shaft on one of the spots you can land, while I ended up going all the way down to face Earle alone. I never saw that player again. I was so bummed that my first ACP  started that way.
---
I jump on their beds
---
I want people in my camp. I often build camps so other people will have things to see. I like my camp builds and I want people to see them. On Tuesday night, when ACP released, my entire group (me and 3 others) all converged on my camp and just chilled out, danced, did some trading. My camp is not near the event either, it's at the Whitespring. Yeah, they were friends of mine, but still we all just went there.
---
I get a lot of people doing their "buy 3 things" daily challenge at my vendors as well. So many that I had stopped doing it for myself, as the purchase counts for both me and them.
---
Occasionally I get someone who wants to PvP show up. One guy thought he was a tough little lvl 25 showing up at my camp, shooting me and using the throw-up emote. I turned off Passive and blasted him a few times until he left the server. Thanks for the caps and enjoy your stay, bro.
---
Haha apparently!
---
Only with godmode glitch
---
I think you‚Äôre remembering wrong. I‚Äôm literally making ammo every day. I‚Äôve got 1500 lead to work through. I notice if I don‚Äôt put on ammosmith
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie. I keep switch back and forward for a bit to see if one was different somehow.
---
Good on you mate! I'm new to reddit, but had to say the way you dealt with the idiot is the right way, gonna have to remember to deal with any impolite people the same way myself (your right, not worth getting triggered, its what they want!). Would give you an award if I had the points lol :).
---
What is this Gorilla Safari Backpack?? Any pictures or data mines of that?
---
I see what you did there!
---
Are you all going to fix the fucking fast travel bug? It's been almost 2 years. Fucking shameful and disgraceful it hasn't even been addressed yet. Bethesda's silence is deafening.
---
It just works
---
I have gotten over 100+ for sure in my gameplay
---
Beat me to it...
---
I have 1.2billion junk on the Xbox - bulked, duplicated and level 500+ from glitches. The game is fucked on every platform, let‚Äôs not pretend here.
---
I think rebuilding is easier than submitting a ticket!  Lol. I‚Äôm going to break my house down and see if it clipped through. Hopefully it will show up.
---
it works with all camp crops
---
I run an ammo vendor, and when I max out on caps I often run around buying ammo from other players just to sink some caps and add to my stock. Caps are so easy to come by that I only really sell for RP purposes. If I don‚Äôt do this, I max out on caps in about half an hour then have my vendor closed for a week, lol.
---
I've found you can find out who had\has your spot and "block them for the session". I seem to find another server right away after that. Now if there's someone new on the other server you gotta start all over again blocking. YMMV
---
I'm really astonished that players dare to cheat in such blatant ways.. Maybe they do it because they know they will get away with it..
---
I've only done ACP once so far, and was alone most of the time. I had no idea there is a chest? Where is it?
---
People love them glitches. Its all fun and games till people stop bothering with Earl. I'm seeing it happen ALOT, dude will nuke Earl's spot and only 1 person shows up.
---
If only there was some sort of Power Armor or exo skeleton suit designed for the mines which could, bear with me, excavate deeply embedded, hard material from the ground, or maybe even lift really heavy material from one position to another? Or even harvest minerals and rocks?
---
Someday Appalachian mining technology will catch up.
---
I spent 1500 on a two-shot rifle because I needed an upgrade pretty desperately, but I just figure people pricing common items at value are 1sters who have the capacity and can afford to wait. Or they're looking for cap dumpers. Or both.
---
For me, with an 800 limit, I don't have the luxury of having stuff sit. All plans are 10, all recipes are 5, all ammo is 1. I need to move product to clear space, so I price to move.
---
Simple solution that benefits **ALL** handgun builds / playstyles
---
**Increase their weakspot multiplier by 1.5- 2x. So weak areas like  headshots deal 3.5-4x damage instead of 2x damage. Add this as a mechnic, not a perk card.**
---
Do agree on the AP cost reduction aswell.  Handguns should cost next to nothing in vats. With an emphasis on vats usage due to low ap cost and being rewarded for accurately targeting weakspots (aka using vats and concentrated fire) you make up for their short comings.
---
Also would like to see all weapon damage perks become a 5 card skill like demolition expert instead of 3x 3cards, ESPECIALY with the new damage model on the PTS. Id also like to see rifleman/commando combined aswell as gunslinger/geurilla.
---
I spend a ton of time on my CAMPS. My most recent one I always have people walk around an take pics. So I like providing a little lore or role-playing element to it while they do it.
---
They don't. And they wonder why their stash has no room when trying to sell level 5 trash legendaries for 700 caps.
---
This. I put a lot of work into my CAMP, take some time to enjoy it.
---
I was inside my camp when someone did that. Thats how I learned the brick set has windows a man can just walk through.
---
You hit the nail on the head with your first sentence, at least for me. I got tired of my ally opening every door in my camp, so I locked all but my front door. Ultimately, this only kept people from seeing my power room, so they weren't really missing much. I picked up the bunker recently though, and locked I my ally in that away from my main building. I tried to design the bunker in a way that would suggest my ally and I are cannibals, so I think it's fair to keep that one locked up. Since there isn't a karma system, you have to take that wanted level to learn my secret.
---
Could very well be wrong, ive been using fusion cores for the last 2 months so maybe i just forgot
---
One was in covert operative training for the CIA.
---
Aw I missed the opportunity haha!
---
No, he's much more likely to smash his face into a car windshield, and then take him out for a nice seafood dinner and never call him again.
---
Uhh... War Glaive isn‚Äôt available yet though, right?
---
Might not be such a terrible prefix TBH. Look up magic weapons in the subreddit I think limb damage is one of them.
---
Ha, that's the main reason I lock mine. That and I hate when someone goes through and turns all of the lights off. While there are still ways to get in, locked doors have minimized both for me.
---
Tesla user here, I had NO idea this was an issue üòî
---
Yup, had to do the quest 4 times.  She got stuck at the first door for me too and also had it crash fighting the final boss.
---
Had the final quest jam up because Gail got stuck in a spot and I had to "push" her out to get the quest to continue.  Had the same thing with Hornwright, in the Foundation version of the quest, getting stuck in the entry tunnel and had to "push" her off the wall to get her to keep going.
---
It really sucks. 50% of NW games end by an exploiter and the other 50% you sit there going "likely was a hacker". I was killed by a level 0 in adventure with a gun made of 10 other guns with bullets that lagged the server for a workshop. It's nonsense.
---
Just use the perk to repair to 200%. Don't have to wear it 24/7 an its only 3 points.
---
Is t that the bugged prefix on shotguns that can give crazy dmg and range?
---
I‚Äôm guilty of this if your vendors are inside. I enter, shop, then FT to next. Need to start closing when I enter. Sorry!
---
My camp: stims- 1 cap. .38,.44 ammo-0 caps. Ammo should never be at more than 1 cap.
---
Plans all 1 cap. 1 star is 10 caps. I have so much steel  leftover I usually leave 900 on the floor  everyday.
---
I'm not sure tbh.
---
Yep, another good idea. Wearing the mining suit could have even added an alternate faster route to escape the mine, but allowing you to clear a new path.
---
Like i said, it is useful to melee characters, and i dont need much carry weight, i would rather have more health than carry weight
---
It‚Äôs been out for a while. It was in the treasure hunters event a few months back.
---
I am always torn between hiding in my room and following them around.
---
Also the nuke for monograph mines. Plus any other nuke based events that come down the pipe.
---
I skin most of my weapons. But, my main currently has every bloodied heavy in FFR (and most in explosive as well) on him, as well as several shotguns and I can't skin them all. I usually pull out my Gauss minigun and that causes most people to try and see my weapons - too bad it's not visible at all to them.
---
Take my atoms now!!
---
I think I get it, but a video would be nice
---
Unpopular opinion, unless it is a legacy item, ultra rare like The Fixer Plan or a god-roll item there is no reason to ever sell an item for more than 2k. Most of my items I sell for 500ish each and I end up hitting the cap limit in a day and I have to shut my shop down until I spend the caps.

 &gt; I am always torn between hiding in my room and following them around.
---
i always lock all my doors and leave the workshops outside, I don't wanna come back to my camp and find all the doors wide open
---
I can run with u
---
I'd love to get abandoned in there so I could just solo it lol
---
This, plus I like my privacy and it also adds a little bit to the role play aspect, since leaving all your doors unlocked in a real life wasteland is just begging to get raided. Besides, if you need a bed or bathroom (again, roleplay), I have a downstairs bathroom and a pretty decent sleeper porch that also has a small seating area.
---
Yeah don't see the point have having scrip limit that low. Bump it to 1k at least.
---
Could you link me a picture?? I‚Äôve never seen this. Are you sure y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt thinking of the croc bp??
---
No problem with visitors, I encourage them with low prices. Free water, crops, junk and nuka-shine. I have no walls, doors. Just tents and canopies. Lots of items displayed from atomic shop.
---
I used to have one on my channel but have deleted it. I‚Äôll record it again tonight and send you the link
---
I was thinking a ling the lines.of having motherlode actually help during the event too.
---
Like you could lure the collossus to a certain area so that the big drill could emerge from under him and cause extra damage or cripple him for a few seconds.
---
I've found out you can't jump through windows with curtains though
---
I love it, whenever someone enters my camp i kinda just ghost near them as watch them look at every bit of my camp that I've spent so long working on. 
---
If I was any less shy I'd just turn on my mic and give them a whole damn tour.
---
And if they spam trades or team invites I pretend to go afk at a workbench.
---
Its gonna be a loonnnnnnng time away. It took them almost 2 years just to add a second end game boss.
---
672 hp at 20% is 134.5hp , 700 hp at 20% is 140 hp.

There are guarenteed spawns in 76 too

Your think of the right thing. I see he said gorilla above.

Or even a squad of some sort of automatic robotic miners.  I mean it sounds crazy but you never know.

we got mini-nukes ffs...

wish they would bring out the enclave music back, I loved the music.

Yeah.. I might dirty up the already dirty toilet too! Hahaha  jk.. maybe.

I can only imagine how it would *moove*. I would be *dairy* cool!

(I tried.)

Okay thanks, yeah thats the safari croc backpack. He mentioned a gorilla one which would be cool.

On FFR and high Fire rate heavy weapons, it‚Äôs awesome.

I would like to see Bethesda put together a Nuka shine bundle - welcome mat, nuka kegs, nuka sign, PA skin and a nuka spittoon.
---
Really just list the Nuka Kegs again because I missed the week they were listed.

We also need Jack o Lantern helmets for the Halloween üéÉ event
---
I had to add it on my router‚Äôs website which had a list of different ports but not UDP 3000-3010; after logging into the website w/ my admin &amp; password

Trust me I know the feeling. I only know two shot combat shotguns are weaker because I recently bought one from a player vendor for 2000 caps under the assumption it would be stronger üò©. This is the only quad Double barrell I have encountered and I swear for a month straight I received nothing but gamma guns from the Rusty Pick.
---
Thank heavens for that.  Considering how janky the actual boss fight is, can you imagine a) how long it would have taken to release it if it had its own mechanic and b) how buggy it would be? :(
---
Some players entered there a long time ago and the Vault had tunnels of Mole miners and some burned areas like the pile of ash, but since it has not been official, that may change
---
Thank you for the info! I had no idea!
---
Also if you fight someone at your camp they can destroy your camp once you start fighting so be careful I learned that the hard way
---
I mean there are the inert bombs from Boomer's daily. I got about 20 of them. Given they were planned to be used to level the Valley Galleria and that chemical plant with about 5 of them, i'd say only about 1 or 2 of them would be needed to clear the rubble.
---
Not just that, but ever since Wastelander dropped so many things are either flat out broke (vats) or not working as designed, the bugs are piling up. I don't have much hope at this point of any fixes, just learn to adapt if you wanna play
---
That sounds about how it would go down.
---
Having the instance to yourself is not the worst thing. You get a chance to study it
---
Duping has been a problem, sure....but hacked weapons are something else entirely.
---
This^.  Also on PS4 there's a group of YouTubers that nuke players that sell stuff for outrageous amounts. Can't agree 100% with them,since they ignore pricing memes. Like them getting mad at someone selling toilet paper for 2020 or 10k.
---
There's one for SCORE and one for ATX
---
Why do the Crater Raiders deserve death? They ain‚Äôt like the raiders in the other Fallout games.
---
Honestly, the over the top nature of starting the event makes me like it more.
---
"Oh can you see if my father is still in that closed in cave? It's just a few boulders I'm sure some tnt could work."
---
&gt;Uses an entire fucking nuke
---
"Alright I guess that works too."
---
Yeah I suggest the use of a fat man in the main body of the post.
---
But another way could be to create a special remote charge that would require parts from a few mininukes aswell as other components that could be purchased from robot vendors, similar to how encrypted requires the keycards.
---
People (I) have dev room ‚Äúhacked‚Äù items on the Xbox and PS4...
---
Yeah dude, it's done as a joke.
---
Shouldn't the Communist Camp Bundle be issued to us by the State rather than having to be bought at the Capitalist Atom Shop? :)
---
Whaaaaat! That's awesome. :D
---
I thought they took fusion cores? Gat Plasma uses plasma cores.
---
Better than some of the others like DR while aiming down sights.  
---
It‚Äôs a solid option if you are just hip firing with a rifle or using a heavy weapon (Bosses if you can‚Äôt hit their head)
---
Or, using a VATS build where you can focus on a limb.  I‚Äôll use a VATS/Limb/Furious with perks like Gun Fu and it works really well.
---
Wanted the vidia game
---
Yes you can, my INT is always at 68.
---
Most I've had is 78 with brain bombs instead of brain fungus.
---
+5% EXP well rested 
---
+25% EXP Cranberry Relish (Herbivore mutation)
---
But for some reason, Berry mentats gives me +4.5 INT instead of +5. 
---
I'm not sure why I lose some consumable points.
---
I'm not crafting things often so I can't comment about durability in terms of INT points.
---
That should  of been at the top of the list! I mean if I dirty it up its ok.its mine!
---
They aren‚Äôt .50 cal MGs with beam splitters that shoot mini nukes.
---
Gatling laser uses fusion cores, gatling plasma uses plasma cores.
---
I have a very similar experiences, usually when I'm in the thick of it with the wendingos and earl. I assume it's just lag mostly
---
Jesus, I should call you Dutch, that was some cold shit.
---
Would certainly make collecting them more viable, and since you can only do that once per day it would limit the event from being triggered too often.
---
Imagine going there kitted out with legacies and a refined commando build with Uny/sent heavy combat armor at level 178 lmfao
---
sure it's not just that server? that happens frequently.
---
You haven‚Äôt lived until you see a radroach open the door!
---
Same. I thought there was a note that said, "your the asshole" too, can't find it now.
---
If you‚Äôre that invested in a meta, you really need to get out more.
---
I just ran after them with that sign in a sack hood and explorer outfit
---
Other players have tons of junk. Just kill people at workshops and you'll have more junk than you'd know what to do with
---
Actually, I think it is, cello is sort of smaller but still bigger than a violin
---
Brilliant. Yes. That's exactly what they should be used for!
---
Watoga Train station has some. Also, scrapping weapons unlocks mods for that weapon.
---
Those aren‚Äôt even practical on the PC, it will literally crash your client after 20 seconds of use with a dual 2080ti system with 64gb of ram.
---
The weapons I use most on PC are unbreakable dev room type items. That‚Äôs what makes them so viable.
---
You‚Äôre literally arguing, ‚ÄúHe died, but x person died way harder than him so his death really doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù
---
Yeah, PC people don't get that.
---
I mean, unless somebody wants to hit me up on Twitter I guess, but that would involve going on Twitter. ‡≤†_‡≤†

AAE Handmade or fixer offers VE, FE, AAE 50cal or minigun offers, or legacys(low end ones)

I had Nuka Cola vending machine behind Beckett's bar and he kept opening the little vending machine door. It was close enough to his bar that he would get stuck if it was opened. I closed it every time I saw it open but it was all the time. I had to get rid of it.
---
Yeah makes sense to buy the weightless 3 star, especially at that price
---
You people leave the doors open. Locking then keeps them shut.
---
What? I believe that requires a bit of clarification.
---
Okay guy
---
No problem man
---
it's like you hold up a sign asking for double entendres
---
Finally, a supporter
---
That‚Äôs the one thing that makes me excited about one wasteland, no more low level shaming lol
---
Thanks bro
---
Awesome. I have yet to get any bloodied from it.
---
Once I learned it I went from nuking once a month to about twice a session because of how quick and simple this process is
---
Ammosmith works like a charm. Are you talking about Ammosmith + Super Duper, maybe? That's not broken, either, though. Super Duper just doubles the base ammo amount, not the Ammosmith increased amount. I make a lot of railway spikes because my railway rifle is a hungry gun. Base ammo you can produce is 3 per; with Ammosmith, 5. When Super Duper hits, I don't get 10 spikes, I get 6--double the base.
---
It‚Äôs,also why I am glad the weapons from the event are reduced weight. You can do the event multiple times, get 8 treasury notes, and a 3 star that weighs two pounds. It makes it good for farming notes and scrip.
---
Yeah, but nowhere near as many as 4
---
I never play around reset time, but the bug got me twice this season. Both times I crashed when first loading into a server.
---
It would be pretty rough that's for sure, we'd be easier pickings than a bunch of kids neighbouring a pedo üò±
---
I designed my camp specifically for their enjoyment. I welcome visitors. I just give a thumbs up and carry on.
---
What?
---
Will definitely do that next time.
---
You‚Äôre using strawman arguments to compare things that don‚Äôt even matter. At the end of the day the ecosystem for Xbox and PS4 are fucked due to glitches. Regardless of how badly a glitch or hacked item is judged, the game is still fucked across every platform due to glitches existing. 
---
You‚Äôre literally trying to argue, well it‚Äôs not so bad because the PC is worse. That‚Äôs not an argument, that‚Äôs a deflection to avoid losing an argument.
---
They are! With the daily ops update Vault 94 will be open to freely explore and PTS players have found data indication that Vault 51 will also be opening up to explore as well
---
some may even offer you free lead
---
Covid 19 ü§£
---
I don‚Äôt know but the pack is definitely worth it
---
They already had an option in the game with that lode bearing drill. You can use it to FT sure the vault raid
---
I typically don't have doors are any of my camps, I agree, silly to lock doors but all to their own, especially when they don't have the benches or beds or stash box outside. If they do, I don't care but silly none the less
---
That's because that challenge isn't checking for just the Animals keyword. It checks for a ton of keywords. It's a mislabeled challenge. "Kill anything" is more apt
---
For real. I think I said to myself, "Who the f**k is Grelok?"
---
For Gatling lasers I would suggest the severe beta wave tuner or whatever it‚Äôs called it adds buring damage and the beam focuser
---
Lag related either frame rate, latency, or both. Happened to me too when we couldn't kill the wendigo spawns quick enough and, ironically, I couldn't kill them because of the VATS glitch where you melee them a couple times and they're still full hp.
---
I highly recommend born survivor for this event just so you don't have to worry about it, maybe field surgeon and/or first aid perks. You can share team medic too if you're still having problems dying/not getting heals off fast enough.
---
If it's doing a 30 minute countdown, it's probably just that particular sever shutting down. Find a new one.
---
I think most people who get annoyed by her never do the quests.
---
Wrong. My point was, allowing cross play with PC would make things worse.
---
I‚Äôm not saying that consoles are wine and roses...there are certainly issues, but we don‚Äôt need to add to them by bringing in the PC problem too.
---
OMG I have to pay for membership to play private world's I'm screwed
---
I like my privacy lol I wouldn‚Äôt just let some random person into my house would I?
---
Nothing in my camp is really locked. Nothing but my bedroom.
---
Its not like there is anything rly interesting in there, but i use two accounts and am mostly online with 2 chars at a time. One idling somewhere, and playing with the other. Switching when done with the dailys and so on...
---
As we all know, item/stash management is a lot of work. Especially with 6 chars. And i always hated the dealing menu. I transfer all kind of items just by tossing them on the ground and picking them up with the other char. And if it ever happened to you that a random shithead outa fucking nowhere ran up to you and picked up your stuff then you do this in a room you can lock behind you. Thats all there is to it for me.
---
I like being able to lock my vendors down when I've got too many caps.  And it's fun watching people find the secret entrance to the rest of my castle lol
---
Damn the post was deleted. now I'll never know what I'm supposed to have heard of üò£
---
Yeah I think some of that is just gonna be handwaved as one nuke affecting enough surface area to clear both if it's ever even mentioned. "Vault dwellers from 76 had to take drastic measures and activate a dormant silo and launch a nuke over Appalachia to put an end to the Scorched threat. The nuking had a lasting ripple effect, the quaking from the explosion unearthing previously buried areas such as Monongah Mine and the horrors within." Something like that.
---
Sometimes when I'm bored I will equipped one of those protest signs and run circles around there collection.
---
Haha no i think you misunderstood, it didn‚Äôt happen again after the beta
---
Not even on the same level, on PC you can get PA with Sentinel Assassin and that's not even the tip. Yeh of course there are exploits etc on console but nothing like PC. Even with the dupes etc on console there is a fair playing field but on PC you can do literally as you like if you know what you're doing.

There's a huge pile in Helveita. You can click around on it.

Dev room or "hacked", so which is it? There is no such thing as hacking on console in 76. There was a time where a few items became available from the Dev room on console, but they are items that are stored, items that got cut or await release. Nothing "hacked" in there.
---
I love it when people visit my camp. But I do always feel a bit awkward when I'm visiting someone else's camp and checking out there vendors, only to turn around and see them staring at me. I always feel pressured into buying something when that happens lol.
---
Dude, even using my own second account, this took nearly 2 hours to finally get - it‚Äôs a broken wreck.
---
Not at all! I built my camp for people to come and enjoy, I get a buzz when people let me know they enjoy it.
---
Because its their camp and they choose to lock it, simple reason no need for them to explain why they made the choice, they can do what they want at their own base.
---
I'm on xbox but my husband is on ps4. He'd like to check it out later too! I'm also impressed by your video making skills so I'm sure if you decided to do a video then people would make time üòÇ

Bruh I don't give a fuck what level the other players are. I can solo run ACP. As long as you aren't hanging out above the fray taking  up an event slot from someone who would at least help by acting as wendigo bait, you are welcome to join.
---
Ooh, interesting solution
---
The game has been crashing like this a lot. Even after you reinstall. I‚Äôve done it twice and still does this blue screen crash. 
---
I just report it and move on now.
---
Only because it‚Äôs bugged in conjunction with that armor mod

this exactly +1

The items are literally unbreakable, they don‚Äôt degrade. They‚Äôre 5 stars with the bonuses on them in combinations never intended for game release. Do you even know what you‚Äôre talking about?

Currently it's a thatched rug and a pink bed.

So the wealth distribution will always be skewed, cause the opposite side of the spectrum leaves us Bezos and his Amazon workers. Although communism affect the whole country, while corporatism leaves more varied results, depending on the greediness of the ceo

But just like every one else, I've got a secondary gun just for these moments.

Don‚Äôt tempt them to break the game even more.
---
Since learning about people being able to steal from vending machines I am very cautious if someone is hanging out to long. Especially if they are just sitting on one of the machines or in a stash box.

I try to give them beans...  but typically they just run away.

Is the 1% considered a small group of upper class, or are they too big?

I don't skin mine for those very reasons, and I have yet to enjoy any of the new weapons.

Hmm, I‚Äôve had numerous encounters where after the fight, we both wave or thumbs up, then move on.  Sure, there are some clowns out there, but if I grow bored or have something more important come up, I move on.  What‚Äôs the problem?

You could try merging workbenches into the brahmin cook stations as they are so big, and see how it looks.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJwmP20hsMQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJwmP20hsMQ)

Thats what the Raider ammo co is for. Gives you so much ammo. 5.56 is the best overall for trading in for points.
---
It‚Äôs only weird when they stand there staring at you like we‚Äôre best friends now and somethings going to happen when you should just move on. Usually a low level lol
---
Yeah, but in the open or forward section. There is a big difference.
---
All the time, because my camp is a bunker(so you glitch yourself in) and I built a base around it to mask it so I don't get banned cause I'm not sure if you would. Then every time someones there to buy something I have to just run around until they are done so I can go on with my business.
---
You made a post saying ammo facroties are fine ingame overall. Shush, you troglodyte.
---
I don't understand why anyone would ruin their camp budget for chicken feeds worth of ammo.
---
Dude no...
---
I love when people visit my camp. I like and would like to actually have a Sales Job role play added to the game. However...one time:
---
Someone wall glitched into my locked building where I keep my ammo bot. And I was like hey I'll just give you the ammo dude. I have a note that says "Free stuff Just Ask" and have a drop off pile where I put free things in a Porto potty.
---
He glitched and then came out laughed and did the "tea bagging? Crouch move from 20 years ago. People still do this? Pathetic. 
---
He then took my veggies and jumped on my roof while shouting and shooting my camp, me and my buddy.
---
He was a level 390.

My camp is themed around nukashine so adding more nukashine stuff would be great, also idk if this has been added but jack o lanterns that glow would be a good addition
---
No 8 love people coming and having a look around!
---
Not everyone wants to play as a raider you dumbass
---
No one even mentioned the ecosystem. At the end of the day PC bad, Console gooood!
---
No one on xbox or PS is gonna roll up on me and start editing my character, or shoot me from a mile away with 10mm Pistol, through a wall etc, etc. A minority of PC players have ruined any chance of xplatform.
---
The argument has fuck all to do with the ecosystem, the argument is because I don't wanna be hit with a 2 headed chicken from a fucking power fist. PC can alter the game itself, console can manipulate it. That's not the same on any level, so shurrup.
---
Snitches get stitches, if it doesn't affect your own gameplay just block them and move on
---
I love it. I've made friends that way...and caps!
---
I once ruined a flamingos experience
---
Poor baby!
---
Yes, pistols have more bullet deviation in real life, but I still think it's easier to aim a pistol without sights. Its feels about as natural as pointing a finger at something.
---
Look at how fast and accurate competition shooters are at hip-firing.
---
If they actually can survive without using a stealth suit as a low level then I don‚Äôt have an issue with it.  Takes more multi-tasking to constantly heal yourself while being able to minimally negating damage.   
---
It‚Äôs people who AFK that I have an issue with.
---
When you have 15-20 of them, it adds up
---
Lol yup
---
But it does though. It affects the stability of the servers. Servers are what I play on. I'll stick with the stitches, I can remove them from my player character anyways.
---
Kind of my point, but good elaboration.
---
People seem to love my camp. I set up a nice little civilization for the sheepsquatch plushies and get a lot of comments on it. I love seeing people's reactions when my camp first loads and I especially love when they just stop and stare at something for a good 10-15 seconds.
---
Nah you're the only baby I see you brat
---
Mother Lode makes the most sense.
---
No clue. I leave my camp open for anyone to check out and use my workbenches and whatnot. I‚Äôm not far from where the SBQ spawns, and I know I‚Äôm usually loaded down after Scorched Earth, so I thought it would be nice for people not to have to run terribly far to break down. Plus, I‚Äôm kind of proud of my camp so I don‚Äôt mind if anyone takes a tour. üòä
---
Can't wait until they start selling them for gold at the faction camps. Saw it on PTS. I think it was 100 good for 3
---
One could argue that it could help make the QoL cards more useful? Idk i have short of 300 hours into the game and the one thing that is noticeable to me is just how useless some of them are. They really need a go over but that's just my humble opinion.
---
Yes it‚Äôs the grolaks staff
---
My camp is meant to seem as a part of the game. So I built it with a road going through it. It turned out really great. There‚Äôs a river near so I also have water.
---
Call Lebron maybe he cares
---
Yes, I'm the brat for reporting game glitches that affect performance for overall gameplay. Totally the brat! Big brain!
---
I don't blame you. After a while....there's nothing else you wanna spend it on. I really hope they continue to add to the bullion pool and not just past season's stuff.
---
I just ignore them I only get annoyed when some lower leveled player (I‚Äôm level 66  for reference) decides to melee me when I‚Äôm working at a crafting bench or kill my Brahmin . At which point I‚Äôll either kill them or chase them away from my camp
---
Did they ever suggest to you to unlink your account ? This was the next step they give me after the toubleshooting steps they give with the router and stuff (which I never did cause I know thats not the issue) 
---
They warned me doing this will delete all my save data and then to re-link which 'should' restore my save data
---
You can imagine my response
---

You can get allied with both Factions, not forced to pick a side.

The only thing you get locked out of is the few cosmetics you get during the actual vault break in, like the Slug Buster weapon and raider outfit.

I cancelled - stopped the auto-renew of Fallout 1st last night. I'm playing less 76 and coming less to this sub, looking for new games, watching live streamers on other games. It's time to bail once this nerf hits, the Karens shall take over lol. I was fortunate to be here from the beginning with no rebalancing and fighting my way for levels, gear, etc.
---
We're lucky if we get any NW updates. They haven't mentioned anything about NW in the roadmap and we've only seen one update in the last 7 months. If we do get an update, I'd rather see bug fixes than new content. People loading in 20 seconds faster than me is getting really old.
---
No they didn't. Atleast the last time i checked.
---
Well, these are helpful. I hadn‚Äôt thought of that.
---
I loved how with Smithing and Enchanting, any smithable equipment could be viable for end game. I love the look of studded/scaled light armor, orcish heavy, steel weapons and arrows.
---
In Fallout my main weapon is non-auto Combat Shotgun, since the first Fallout game. It's not so good in 76, but it gets the job done... eventually. :)
---
It's actually useful against the Colossus though. I can cripple every limb in just a few shots. I think of my character as more of a support class than DPS in that event. I target the legs first, which roots it so other player's autos don't expend as much ammo though missing shots. Crippling heads makes it use it's fear attack less... etc.
---
Gotcha...I was just curious what the exact date seasons ends. :)
---
What time are you on?
---
Little late but I just added you
---
Did i ask you ?
---
Me too.

Overseer is always hiding in the basement and she has that big camera in the living room to watch over the guests. Case closed! Ladydevann is Overseer!
---
The real problem is a community full of idiots who think it somehow doesn‚Äôt effect server stability , you gotta be real numb to believe that nonsense
---
Ah, right, my mistake. The bulk of my comment was mostly about how the game isn't just devolving into wacky nonsense just because things happened to get a little silly around a fest, though.
---
Lol, I do something similar when AFK.  I just sit in my rocking chair in front of my fireplace.
---
Uh I have no link here for a mele build but check out captainoob on YT and you‚Äôll get a build for eavery weapon in game, he is probably the best for build and weapon vids
---
Public forum asshat
---
Siding with the  raiders is so much fun imo. I think it‚Äôs one of the biggest role play opportunities in Fallout. Instead of helping a faction change the region where the game takes place, you ARE the leader of the faction and help shape the world around you (despite vanilla F4 not being very role playing at all).
---
Used a pipe revolver yesterday. Bloodied did about 220 damage with the rifle stock it's at 350 a shot.so still stacking
---
Eh, yes and no. I'd like there to be more super viable end-game build options of course but we're mostly talking minimal numbers here. Unless your goal is to super cheese the game by one-shotting everything that even looks in your direction then you aren't going to really be hindered in any way. Hell, I'm a full health PA heavy guns build and sometimes I run through places using a Shishkebab and no PA or 1h perks just cause I like how it looks. Takes me a few swings to kill some higher level stuff but again I play the game to have fun and it's a nice change of pace to not melt everything in 2 seconds or less.
---
The thing is, with games in general there usually there IS a de-facto best in slot item for gear. SS or T-65 being the best in slot for armor I'm fine with. What needs to change is certain legendary effects and builds just being outright better than others as well as the game implementing things like party-wide or event-wide legendary drops without requiring a tag. I have a friend who wants to play a healer build using a V Flamer or Shishkebab for sustain while running friendly fire. Problem is that she misses out on legendary drops for herself while playing like this unless she actively focuses on taking time to tag enemies before they die.

Couple this with insane damage from builds like bloodied killing things so quickly her playstyle is almost obsolete. She misses out on loot for herself and her healing is unnecessary because mobs die before they get a chance to do any meaningful damage that she can heal for. If she needs to fight, the perk investment for her to play a healer greatly nerf what damage she's actually able to do to high level mobs. In a lot of instances her playstyle is just completely useless.
---
I'm hopeful that One Wasteland and the new damage calc changes are the start of something wonderful but I won't exactly hold my breath either. The game is a TON of fun for me but I'm lucky enough that my preferred playstyle is being a walking tank with a big ass gun running down swathes of enemies...which is one of maybe 3 viable styles of play. Other people aren't as lucky and that's something Beth needs to seriously look at.
---
I got the helmet before the raid. It‚Äôs in the quest where you save ra ra I believe. You have to be nice to her
---
With stat distribution, can you run both these builds on 1 character?
---
50 76 100, 760 if good prefix anx 1 cap for ammo.
---
Example junkie sub 1 star= 50 bucks
---
Junkie ffr BD mini= 760.
---
Never more. I also am always filling up. (Vamp weapons rn i sell for no more than 760)
---
There's a deal I do in safe mode when that error flares up. 
---

---
Option 5
---
Yeah i know because you wouldn't say anything to somebody's face, keybaord warrior
---
Someone actually dropped it for me when I was new, and given my stash was full and holding onto 5 different power armors is probably not smart I figured I might as well pass it along again!
---
Heavy Weapons/Melee and Unarmed all utilize Strength cards. To be efficient you'd need to swap your cards when you switch weapons... Unless you wanted to find a balance that works for you, which is fine but you'll never reach full damage potential on your all your weapons with a split setup.
---
When the guy got done picklocking and he became wanted i one tapped him and that made him mad.
---
Even if it wouldn't affect stability (which it does), I'd still report it. It's obgiously not the intention of the base game. Reported as a bug but still gotta get that paper work done, gamma rounds and all.
---
For future reference, if you navigate to the actual sub, than click the title bar you can search the sub by keyword.
---
I used the keyword bunker. Title bar looks like "r/fo76 bunker"
---
Once you get used to the search, finding info is way easier.
---
The problem comes if you don't experience a frame rate drop then you don't know it happens. I've never had the issue, I always have problems with people with TSE miniguns...those destroy the frame rate on my Xbox to almost a slideshow. I've never seen an issue with the Tesla rifles so I wouldn't have had a clue.
---
Just got my first two besides the sheepsquatch. Got the silver shroud and vault boy 2000, can‚Äôt wait to get more haha
---
Same as you, twinkle toes
---
I get excited to see how they will respond. I love it when they visit and built mine across from the Rusty Pick to encourage visitors. Since then, I've made as many or more caps selling stuff than by shooting and looting.
---
I have no problem swapping cards. I made this character to take a break from my rifleman. Originally I had the intent of making a junkie build but after meat week, I got a bunch of bloodied melee weapons and all the mutations I stumbled upon were in favor of a melee build.
---
This is a pretty cooperative and supportive community compared to most. Welcome aboard!
---
Sorry, the quest to break into vault 79 is what I was calling the raid. I editted my post for clarity, thanks.
---
I only lock my private bedroom because I don't like others in my bed. Otherwise, mi casa, y su casa.
---
It's very viable since both are STR builds. Just swap incisor and iron fist when you want to use unarmed or the heavy weapons perks when you use those. I usually leave martial artist on all the time since it reduces melee weapon weight, but you could swap that out for something like bullet shield. You can also swap out stabilized and one gun army or just leave those on when running melee since they don't hurt anything. You'll want talons and twisted muscles mutations as well.
---
If you want a build where you use both without swapping, you can probably drop incisor and do one of each level heavy but you'll do less damage in both, so it's better to pick one for general usage and swap out when you want to change it up.
---
Grelok the Sorcerer plushie. He's supposed to be Grognak's arch enemy or something I guess.
---
Double bass or stand up bass, imho. (Stray Cats) I don't think you would strum or pick a cello.  I believe you would typically use a bow on a cello.
---
They probably want the game mode to die.
---
The circus comes to the freak show.
---
That‚Äôs very nice. Your mother would be proud. üëç
---
I've built a little amphitheatre and always run to the stage to play an instrument in the hope that visitors will join me.   I've got some nice photos of people playing under my house lights.
---
I am not the one name calling , next you will call me a racist
---
Same when i was lvl 22 on my shotgun build with encrypted. I held a pilon and ran around rezimg downed high levels. We completed the event. I dont mind low lvls in collosal problem. I can kill earl myself üòÜ helps them out and they can help me when they get the opprotunity.
---
the reason why TSE/ explosive Two-shot weapons degrade so fast is because of the way weapon durability works in this game.
---
in Fallout 3&amp;NV the weapon degraded based on how many rounds you fire, regardless if you hit anything. 
---
But in 76, someone decided to base it on how many hits the gun does or at least increases the amount of durability a weapon loses per hit. so a normal weapon would only do 1 point of durability per shot (PoDPS), a Two-shot would do 2 PoDPS and a TSE would do 4 PoDPS (1 for each bullet and 1 for each explosion). 
---
so for example, with a TS automatic grenade launcher, it takes maybe 6 shots into the cluster in the **line in the sand** event to break the gun from 150% durability with the durability increase perk. because 1 two-shot round hits like 20 enemies all at once with about 4 PoDPS to each enemy. Thus degrading the weapon super fast. While if I am just firing the TS AGL up into the air and not hit anything, I can burn through over 100 shots with little to no noticeable durability decrease.
---
I‚Äôm only missing a mr fuzzy, I think there was one in a bundle I didn‚Äôt care for.
---
They currently sit at a table having a meeting, plotting, scheming, planning...
---
Would love that link and PSN too, im intrigued.
---
I want people to visit my camp! This game scares the shit out of me so I like seeing a friendly face.
---
One wasteland is specifically in reference to the level scaling. There are other things coming in the next update though.
---
It would have made more sense to use the nuke on the vault, and also use motherlode on the mine!
---
Damn degenerates!!  Were you born in a barn!?  \*shakes fist at them\*
---
Turn in your 150 scrip daily then spend it on 2 or 3star weapons.if you need to buy cheap legendaries I dont spend more than 1k on a 3star if its reduced weight. But you can find scrip at times for 500 to 800 a 3star
---
Nobody has visited my camp. I‚Äôm only level 20 and my camp sucks
---
I report them, too, not that I expect Bethesda to do anything about it.     The servers are gimpy on a good day, without exploits messing with them, they don‚Äôt need the added stress.   Not to mention it affects the bottom line for people who make their caps selling ammo.
---
Don't carry your junk with you like that. You're asking for this. If it's not lost to a player, your loot bag can easily be lost to bad terrain clipping or server crash.
---
They're playing the game as intended, they are not fecal matter.
---
it is because durabilty decreases each time you hit an enemy. with a normal gun you hit an enemy once with a bullet. but with TSE, you hit them 4 times. twice with the bullets and twice again with each explosion.
---
Instead of having a valid dungeon before the end boss, Bethesda uses the silo nuke launching as a dungeon and you get the SBQ or Earl as your end boss.
---
It was ok for one boss, but using the same mechanic for 2 bosses is very lame and lazy, not to mention it makes no sense lore wise as you've mentioned.
---
Because we're not red blooded commies. No, seriously I got tired of asshats coming in my house meleeing me while I'm crafting, repairing, or managing my inventory. I do have a work bench and stash box located right next to my vending machine's. 
---
Also, I offer free nuka-shine samples in the punch bowl.
---
Imagine if it was an IMAX experience
---
Furious. Definitely.
---
I basically what I do in any situation like that. Pretend I don‚Äôt see them there. Or creep around where they can‚Äôt see me and watch them. üëÄ
---
That's perfect then.. The build for melee is basically the same as heavy gunner, you just want to swap the heavy Gunner cards for the ones that will apply to the weapon your using, and throw Incisor into the mix as well.
---
Huh, I never realized there was more than one.  TIL.
---
Are you on the Fallout Reddit discord server? You could look for someone there who can help you.
---
Entire mode needs a facelift.
---
Foremost XP should be given on final placement of your team. Not when you die.
---
Kills should give more XP and revives as well.
---
Special stats should be based on NW login and not how u are built in adventure mode.
---
Maps need to rotate even if that means bringing in areas not Virginia. Why not have maps from previous FO's.
---
My biggest gripe is the XP being given at death. There are perk cards for herds that buff players on your team. If that player does he rolls off the sever. This destroys the use of that set of perk cards.
---
That would be quite a popular emote, I like the idea.
---
True true.  You never told a lie
---
I just assumed the PC master race had something similar.
---
I used to camp up there by that lead node too. 
---
I miss that place
---
~~No alien stealing a cow joke, really?~~ It should be an event after launching the rocket on one of the farms during nighttime. Imagine you launches a nuke at midnight. And instead of landing the nuke accidentally hits zetans spaceship that tries to steal brahmin from one of the farms for its own experiments. The area of event should have crashed UFO and Brahmin Cowlossus powered by alien technology and FEV. Do want!
---
Big mistake, I'm not gonna lie I often look for workshops that have been built up, even if I can't see someone there I'll travel, 25% chance there is. 50% chance they have a ton of loot which I call a JayJay (Junk Jackpot). Honestly don't risk it, only way I'll give someone a pass is if there below level 50. Bethesda do warn of this when initiating, it's harsh but it is the wasteland after all.
---
Every aspect of an online application uses a different logical port.  For example regualr internet browser is port 80 secure internet browser is port 443.
---
XBox normally uses the following ports:
---
* Port 88 (UDP) 
---
* Port 3074 (UDP and TCP) 
---
* Port 53 (UDP and TCP) 
---
* Port 80 (TCP) 
---
* Port 500 (UDP) 
---
* Port 3544 (UDP) 
---
* Port 4500 (UDP)
---
I have not looked into this but if OP looked it up somewhere then there is a chance that Bethesda and Fallout 76 uses Port 3000-3010 (UDP) to sync the XBox Live Friends list to the in game Social menu
---

---
Thanks! I am having a blast so far. I just finished rdr2 and am so happy to play another game I love.
---
To start this questline do i have to be lucky to come across the key at certain spots? I've had no luck for days of server hoping and checking the spots so i am starting to wonder if there is something else i am supposed to do to get this questline going.
---
You just want to look up those dresses.... I see what is going on here...
---
Thanks for the idea. Bethesda will now take this idea and not implement it as a reward, but yet make a very cute plushie; the cutest you have ever seen, and add it to the atom shop for 1200 atoms.
---
If there's a bench or  something you can interact with near a window, use it and you're teleported into the building.
---
Yeah! I tend to farm the screws when I can, but make sure I still do pack a punch in Earle
---
I only lock up my fusion generator to make it harder for an enemy to damage it.    
---
Wish they had self closing doors for the rest of my camp
---
We call them pi√±atas
---
This is how I feel as well. I don't want them to feel pressured to having to get things done quickly and leave. Let them take their times looking through the vendors and doing any maintenance/crafting/repairs that they need to do.
---
At least the other plushies we have seen in the Atomic Shop have been 500 atoms or less. I personally wouldn‚Äôt mind spending it for a Chally plushie though.
---
Yeah so just follow either build and let‚Äôs say heavy gunner to mele, just swap out heavy gun and add mele dmg perks and add the sneak perks
---
I have my sheepsquatch going down the slide we got early in the legendary run üòÜ
---
The endurance public team and herd mentality.  You don't have to be with anyone,  you can make and exploration team and reap 3 more endurance
---
Edit: Just reading that you don't want to be in a team although I'm not entirely suggesting that . My bad
---
It does sometimes. I noticed doing encrypted when I‚Äôm the conduit for the generator on screen it says my characters name not my gamer tag. I have noticed this somewhere else as well but can‚Äôt remember where. So it‚Äôs built into the game already somehow. It could get confusing though looking for friends so it would need options.
---
Cool!! Where can I get those bulb letters??
---
I just saw in another thread that "White Knight" and the weapon version (can't remember the name off the top of my head) both haven't worked correctly since Wastelanders. Until that gets fixed, you might want to swap out that card for something else.
---
How can one, solo this? What perks weapons, I‚Äôm trying to up my game. I‚Äôm a melee build, but for this event I need to switch it up.
---
In Bethesda wisdom they do rotations. What they need to do is have a static shop with drop downs so when u want something you go and buy it. They are leaving money on the table by not having all shop items ready for purchase. There are a few weapon paints I want. It would be money in their pocket. But here I sit like hundreds of others waiting.
---
It's been awhile since I've had to use this solution, my camp spot isn't popular at all anymore, but my son definitely had to do this as of yesterday and it still seems to work
---
That was my reasoning, maybe I listen to to much rockabilly music.
---
&gt;innocent monster 
---
Considering that the Wendigos are going out into the world and bringing him food, yeah no.
---
True, but every little bit helps. Especially if your not getting hit for 110's every shot. I typically get hit for 40-60, so that would be 2 or even 3 shots depending on how generous the RNG gods are feeling at the time.
---
It‚Äôs not in the same area, but mine‚Äôs been just west of silo Charlie for a long while. Nice cliff side with a nice view, and 2 caps away of a railway vendor when i‚Äôm too lazy to walk to it.
---
I purposely turn off the lights, open doors, steal vegetables and raid collectors of people who overcharge on their vendor prices just to piss them off.
---
&gt;how would you distribute your stats?
---
If you're PC I'll come with steel/wood/concrete/weapons abound =)
---
No problem, I‚Äôll send it to you as well and post it in the comments here for anyone else interested
---
He isn't perfect on some builds, but this game doesn't allow competent respecs so you can't blame him.
---
it would help to know if there were more wendigo spawns than normal.
---
Mines just south of the bed and breakfast at the train stop thing and water tower
---
she is very proud of me  
---
i told her all about it and she is taking me to dinner tomorrow as a treat  
---
no im lying  
---
im 34 and my parents are dead
---
thought you said ‚Äúlooking for onions‚Äù
---
I can do this when I get off work in a few hours if you still need it
---
White Knight is fucking useless lol
---
I love when people visit and I like to show my camp off (i snatched one of the coolest spots :) )  
---
But, I always feel awkward when I'm just standing there, so I've built myself a little cooking station next to my vendors to make it \*look\* like i'm preoccupied and I just happen to stand up at the right time to greet them lol
---
Happened to me twice really bad. Game is almost done downloading again. I've had to delete it and redownload it twice now. Nothing short of completely removing it and downloading it again seems to work. Otherwise, the game ALWAYS crashes at log in.
---
I saw someone sharing this once and thought it was rather odd. I didn't even consider unequipping my own Starched Genes - I was too worried that the person would leave the team and I wouldn't notice, or I would just forget entirely to put it back on later.
---
When you enter the event the windigos spawn on the left side on a platform. If you can check there and try to get a headcount first.  When I did the event I made the mistake of running toward that area and ended up in an unwanted sexual experience.
---
The Slug Buster and the outfits are the only things you can be locked out of
---
my camp location is secure.. what are you talking about?
---
;D
---
Also, I was using my external HDD. Now I am keeping it on my system HDD. Hope that helps.
---
This. Blueprinting a single item will (for some stupid reason) allow them to be placed easier than the actual object and will keep them from "popping up" to another level.
---
Can anyone confirm that any of these mentioned fixes work on Xbox? I‚Äôve been stuck on this for a week and I‚Äôm starting a new character because at only level 11 I‚Äôm not losing much progress. I also don‚Äôt have access to a private server
---
Mmmm... With a Power Fist or a Deathclaw Gauntlet (bloodied of course) you only would need Blocker and Martial Artist perks for Strength (which need to be at max -15-), the other peeks must be Heavy Gunner, Expert Heavy Gunner and Master Heavy Gunner. Other than that, the normal: Radicool, Ghoulish, Solar Powered, Nerd Rage, Bloody Mess, Starched Genes,  Class Freak.
---
The remaining perks depend on what kind of buld you want: Power Armor or Secret Service Armor.
---
I hope this was helpful üòäüëçüèª
---
I had two lower levels in the triple I did last night and both on my team. They were great. They worked on the mob and revived me as needed. Because of this dynamic I changed my perks to have Revenant on. Instantly become a low hp Bloodied/Junkie tank. Run up to Earle and unload, if I got downed, revived, damage boost, and started attacking again. I also shared Born Survivor and I also use diffusers. Health on health on health.
---
Edit: Spelling.
---
Player vendors, usually really cheap.
---
It's hardly unique, almost every wastelander quest person is tethered to a tiny area at best.
---
Yeah. Like I said, it's not a condemnation, just a question. I'm not giving people flack for locking up their stuff, just wondering what their reasons are.
---
Yeah? Never pay attention to that, I‚Äôll check thanks!
---
Same.  :-)
---
Because Bees!
---
What is the cap max, by the way?
---
I usually got refresh my well rested or play an instrument lol
---
Waiting has not helped me. Game ALWAYS crashes when logging in.
---
I'm kinda embarrassed because I move often and i try to focus on making sells to get caps so I run a minimalist camp but my set up is either naked feeling or naked and shitty feeling. just buy some damn ammo, wave and keep it moving. i can *feel* your judgement from where I'm sitting.
---
Yeahhh, I feel that lol...
---
I love guests at my camp! I have a test too: If I wave at anyone under level 100 and they wave back, they‚Äôre getting 10 stimpacks dropped for them. 
---
I don‚Äôt like when I‚Äôm trying to log off but there‚Äôs a lingerer who‚Äôs just kinda hanging out left at my camp. It‚Äôs cliff side so I don‚Äôt want to log out and they fall to their deaths.
---
Yus
---
Actually,  this is the third boss. 2nd was imposter sheepsquatch
---
Exactly that! Is there some sort of wanker build Im not aware of?
---
The only door I have locked in my CAMP is the one that belongs to the building that houses the fusion generator. No one needs inside of it.
---
that's the fix, right there
---
Same thing happened when I tried it like a week ago we got him down to like 1/3 health and burned through all of our ammo for him to go underground and make us fail the event
---
Turn on Pacifist mode. Players can't kill you unless youtnot in pacifist mode and then attack back. Good luck.
---
They duplicated your character from a few days before the PTS first opened up, so they'll be behind compared to your character in the live game. And nothing you do carries over to the live game, move your camp, change your build, empty your stash and shave your head, it won't affect your character in the live game or carry over when the update officially comes out.
---
üòÇ‚úäThey always break on the first whack üòÇ
---
Thanks for the tip!!
---
I never saw that option on my router.
---
I saw source and destination. I put ‚Äúany‚Äù in source. Then udp- 3000-3010 in destination. And labeled it Fallout
---
I want this more than anything...should be so much simpler than a major update like Wastelanders. Some new hairstyles, more scars, face paint, let's get some body tattoos/paint, eye colors, etc. Character customization honestly feels so limited in this game and don't even get me started on body shapes...I'm not asking for CBBE levels of body customization but even maxed sliders barely makes a difference in vanilla 76. I want my characters to look truly unique.
---
Oh this is for PC sorry; i got it from
---
Bethesda support. Maybe they can give you your port numbers
---
The Chainsaw is the Best thing to use on the Strangler Heart during the Heart of the Swamp event.
---
I'm sorry but this made me laugh
---
Cool experience though!!
---
Unfortunately I wasn't that lucky... In my team were two level 30s and 40s that were a waste of stimpaks, not doing anything and constantly dying. I'm not discriminating here (level 305), but if you're a level lower than 50, please work as assistant aid, don't try to go Rambo against Earle... Just saying..... üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
Ah perfect that's exactly what I needed to know. Thanks so much for the info! I'll be getting on when I get home from work, I figured I could test the new damage system firsthand to see how it will be. Kind of want to try those daily ops too
---
Oh hey! Yes, I remember. :)
---
That's actually my name literally everywhere on the internet except here (I very briefly thought about switching to the Wasteland-Mama thing everywhere but changed my mind, which isn't allowed on Reddit ha). I've been BGK since 2006. So if you see me anywhere else, feel free to say howdy!
---
I am, yeah. Mainly because I feel like they're expecting something from me, when all I'm there for is to afk while waiting for my purifiers and crops to repopulate.
---
That‚Äôs lucky enough.  I‚Äôve yet to see a scout mask in-game at all LOL
---
My quarters won't inspire anyone and I have crafting stations outside as well.
---
I love visitors. I am quite proud of my camp
---
ya someone else mentioned The Final Word as well and i could kick myself for it cause i sold it shortly after i got it, talk about brain fart
---
Yeah, this.
---
I don't know where they are coming from but I've noticed an influx in low levels who will try to initiate a trade with me and then get all pissy because I ignore the request. One even followed me around the map, using the thumbs down emote the whole time.
---
He followed me all the way to FSP where I usually do some screeching cunt hunting for some SB lungs, livers and hearts. I watched him get yelled to death, collected his junk, left a "You're the dumbass" note in his bag and went on my way. :)
---
Pretty sure I still have a full outfit in my vendor...
---
Why use a scalpel when you can use a chainsaw?
---
Not related..kind of 
---
But when vending machines were disabled someone was selling a cranberry relish plan for i think 300 caps? So I asked the guy if I could just trade him for it and he just gave me it for free
---
Nice guy.
---
Never enough love for the great Brahmin!!
---
U on PC?
---
30k
---
LOL...didn‚Äôt ruin my day, just smh
---
One of the people that I play with uses Starched Genes, but has to equip that rather than damage stacking perks like Bloodied mess and DR perks like serendipity, which is why whenever I join him he unequips his starched Genes to put those perks on and do more damage against enemies.
---
My boy was in there level 17 whacking Earl with a level 5 machete it was awesome, he never even died lol
---
Oh shit! I've been close to that with 20k+ caps. I thought the limit wound be around 100k caps of something.
---
have been trying to get somebody to help for hours, so I can wait a few more. thanks a lot
---
So i just did this event for the first time. Do I need to loot his body to get anything when the event ends? I assume I missed out on a legendary? Maybe? Are there any plans I need to loot him to get?
---
if you find any, lemme know, will make glowing meat taste better XD
---
I deny all trades, especially while in my base for the same reason, but also because in the back of my head there's probably a bug where the dude who opens your inventory can steal it all and this is the one dude who knows it so I avoid trades like the plague.
---
If you want to run unarmed you'll have to make the sacrifice of switching into power armor if you want stabilized on the big guns. Otherwise you'll not reach dmg potential.  That can be a real pain.  You're better off optimizing for one or the other really. Maybe once we get perk loadouts you'll be able to swap a lot better. Honestly you'll hate scrolling through all the perk cards to swap them around all the time; which gets worse the higher your level and the more cards you have.
---
Sorry PS4 :(
---
:(
---
You could buy one from someone if you want on reddit
---
To add to this, with pacifist mode off, people still can't straight up kill you unless you accept pvp with them by shooting back at them.
---
However, you can be killed by other players regardless if you take a workshop and are in the workshop zone...and people *will* kill you if you take a workshop in adventure mode.
---
I red somewhere a while ago about some grave stones and a shovel, have you tried having one equipped and activating them
---
I thought that was only on the revolver...
---
No problem, I remember doing that challenge it was the worst lol. I'll just stand in the water and down myself with explosive splash damage, that should do the trick
---
Every double xp weekend has also worked for nw
---
I never know what to do and I'm still getting used to using the social menus, but although it doesn't bother me for people to come to my base I do get nervous when I'm at someone else's and they show up. Sometimes they will turn to me and just stare at me. Should I not be there then? Am I invading the privacy of their home? I have no idea but I'll usually send a thumbs up and be on my way.
---
It's like the equivalent of someone knocking on the bathroom door when you're in there. There really isn't a wrong or right way to respond XD
---
I had two guys come up to my camp the other day, both on mics complaining about not being able to access it.  
---
"How are we supposed to get to your shop of you have a giant fucking fence around it?"  
---
There's a fucking house on top of this bridge with stairs leading down into my private residence, maybe try the fucking house with all the signage? 
---
I shouldn't care, but I felt indignant. The signs that all say "go away" and the big fence wasn't an indication? Bah.
---
Yes, double xp applies to adventure and nw.
---
i just lock my water purifiers with lock rank 0 so people get wanted if they steal, its fair and i would give them water if asked lol  
---
also lock the generator/electrical "center" of my camp because i dont want anyone to turn shit off.
---
My camp is setup like a corner store so I watch them from behind the counter while they shop and thumbs up if they buy something.
---
It's normal to have an excessive number of wendigo spawns during an unwanted sexual experience during the event.
---
I let them in then Since my Camp is on a Mountain near WhiteSprings i then remove the Floor and let them fall to their death.
---
Eating food or drinking something works too.
---
Yeah true, I base myself on him then expand to my style
---
i second that, i'll raise a glass of whiskey to this unsung hero. i will welcome all levels, i don't care who you are. just contribute in whatever way you can!!
---
I learned the hard way by putting 2 good tse's in my vendor and they both sold immediately and I learned I should have traded lol I only got 400 caps for one because I was so close to max.
---
what about a wanted one?
---
Lmao why would you report someone for that. This is the apocalypse not Disney world
---
Me- like when people go to my vending machines I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh cool, hi‚Äù and then when they go look around inside my camp for no reason I‚Äôm like ‚Äúuhhhh hi???‚Äù
---
Depends on the character. I have 3 currently. My bloodied likes to not have my rads healed. My junkie doesn't care. My PA heavy guns likes perks that involve PA.
---
That‚Äôs a steal
---
Yes, super awkward. I wave high, hope they buy something and either wait till they leave or fast travel the fuck away even if I was doing something... Even virtual social interaction even gives me anxiety. Haha?
---
 regular events you pay for travel but public events are free.  You should be checking the timer on it. Regular events last I think 10 minutes and you have to activate the event or complete it like in leader of the pack. Public events time is 10   minutes to activate the event. So if the timer says it's been 9 minutes  and no one is currently there dont try to go to it.
---
Ps4. I got you. Add alphaboomer and join me
---
I thought it was only me. I seem to be getting a ton of these as well.
---
excellent. I'll have to keep an eye out then. Now that my legendary run is over with and im lvl 125 im mostly just doing NW.....nothing really to shoot for in the basic world.
---
It should work on the bolt action too if they didn't nerf them.
---
Dang, that should count as community service on their part
---
The big events I usually look to see how long it‚Äôs been running for before I go to it. Then I determine if it will be over before I get there
---
Beware of rad healing perks. They kill your damage out put and make unyielding armor useless.
---
Yes loot his body. Do not worry about exiting the cave. Loot Earle, then collect from the dead wendingos. If the timer ends, you will just teleport to the cave entrance
---
Both, please! Can't have enough plushies at my camp haha.
---
Yeah the majority of my trip to level 100 in nw was done over doubles, and the one triple we had. Spent a lot of time in a Bush watching TV haha
---
Big Facts!!
---
But I‚Äôm on pc :(
---
Here's my build for my junkies heavy/unarmed character. I have a bunch of convenience perks which could be exchanged for damage or defense if needed but this build lets me drop into bloodied for some things and jump between heavy and unarmed. With a few perk switches I can hop in power armor and hold my own against Earle. If I really wanted to max damage output in heavies I would add in the other four cards for heavy weapons but I find that just having five of them is plenty for most situationsworks well enough for me.

---
I leave teams that share those perks when playing my bloody character.
---
When I was still in the 30's a lvl 200+ came into my camp and said they liked my layout. Asked team with me and then built a fusion generator and windmill. I didn't even know you could build stuff in others camps. I still think of them often. Not too many others have stopped by so my experience so far has been great.
---
how's that a steal if I bought it, not my fault that was the price. besides I tried to reach out, not just bought and went silent.
---
I don't lock my stuff up, not even the purifiers, but if I did it would be simply because of privacy or as someone else commented, more immersion in a role-playing game.
---
I try to leave as much available to someone who needs it and as for selling things, I only recently got into selling items and trying to gage prices and see what I can sell for a good price to help this who need maybe an extra weapon or armor etc.
---
Always looking for some new tunes any lesser known bands I should look at,
---
Sometimes I just afk at a stash container so I have an excuse not to look them in the eye
---
Strange, my Camp isn't located anywhere near Monagah Mine.
---
I probably can‚Äôt help until tomorrow but I think I‚Äôve got a couple (PC- IGN Tazier)
---
Where do you get that drop?
---
Private server. Only work around until patch.
---
Holy crap lmao
---
Do you know if there's any way to update your character?
---
Awesome stuff man.  Great video editing too.
---
Are you on pc?
---
I can't wait to get out in the field and put it to the test... just as soon as I find anyone of the robot vendors with the fletcher mod
---
Never drew aggro, only pity.
---
I bet he had a hard time lugging all those screws out of the mine, being overencumbered by the balls it took.
---
The real key obviously is 15 STR and high INT and AGI with as much in luck as you can afford. If you don't do stealth and use power armor more often you could probably put more points in INT and less in AGI, but it's fun being able to punch the queen in the face in a stealth suit and stay in caution.
---
I did get that package to drop for me also.2 masks 3 jumpsuits..can you get it to drop again if your wearing any of that gear like the scout mask?
---
Nope - only cosmetic, has no actual effect
---
There are diminishing returns on AP refresh. If you have a lot of AP refresh boosts, then action boy may only slightly improve AP refresh. Try removing your other AP refresh effects and time how long it takes to restore your AP bar with and without action boy.
---
I have no idea if wearing it causes it to drop or not, but I would assume it still has a chance too.  It's pretty rare to begin with though.
---
Nope but will
---
Radiation rumble
---
Happened to me too. Sucks. I think we're camped in about the same spot. Not bothering to rebuild at the moment. So I live in a ruin.
---
I run this combo. I kill mobs with a BE 50, and switch to bloody DCG for bosses. 
---
Here's a build that works well for me:

---
I‚Äôm working on my lv11 alt - GT ClickedAgenda91
---
I only recently started selling stuff and ammo is going well but everything else I have no idea what to sell it at. I am having trouble figuring out weapons, plans, armor etc. I was thinking maybe I should sell some items based on a so many caps per item level system, but I don't think it works out well.
---
I want to be able to make a little bit so I can spend or purchase things at other vendors and such, but I want to make things reasonable for those who could benefit from that 1 star legendary or customized to peak performance sniper rifle.
---
I tried going to different vendors and though some are well priced, most are either one extreme or the other. A recipe might be 1 cap here and then over 100 caps at the next camp!
---
I know people are trying to avoid fixing prices and I definitely wouldn't want to do that, but any tips on armor and weapons?
---
No, it‚Äôs bugged and you get a free one next season
---
I‚Äôm on PC and it was working for me after wastelanders. I forgot to remove nerd rage and I had the well hydrated buff, but full rank action boy improved my AP refresh time by about 1 sec.
---
I'm on PS4 and always sell for cheap to fair prices. If I overcharge, I feel bad. Also, it's due to ignorance, not greed.
---
This event needs to be out in the open and any limit can join, like Scorchbeast Queen.
---
I‚Äôll let you know if I can‚Äôt find one till tomorrow. Thanks!
---
Yess
---
Update, equipped my handy cursed shovel .. no change.
---
I like to walk in to the inner most part of the building before it renders then find myself locked in a room as the floor roof and walls appear, and I‚Äôm behind a locked door, it‚Äôs great cause if I‚Äôm over encumbered, I literarily have to leave the server or pick a lock and get a bounty, good times, we‚Äôll planned.
---
I thought everything in the pts was coming in 22
---
I lock my cabin door because I don't want some smelly Wastelander stinking up my already bug infested bed. Plus, if I want to take a nap while I'm grabbing a drink or making a sandwich IRL, I don't want to find someone else snoozing away on my one mattress in my entire camp.
---
There's a bar across the way called "The Hoe Down" that you're welcome to grab a drink from Beckett and chill in a corner booth, though!
---
Do you want one?
---
I just kinda stand there thinking what do I do with my hands? So I do an emote and make it all worse somehow.
---
Someone came up to me in my camp and did the ‚Äúinitiate trade‚Äù thing and I just freaked.  Like they were looking into my soul.  I just quickly logged off immediately...
---
...which was awful because my camp is on a cliff side and I didn‚Äôt realize until afterwards that I probably caused them to fall and die.
---
I most definitely notice a difference when I don't use White Knight or Makeshift Warrior.
---
I had a 120% repaired explosive insigating gatling plasma and it was about 10% condition after fighting Earle in A colossal problem.
---
Never played Fallout 2, but saw a youtube video yesterday where a random encounter is with Brahmin that act sort of like hoards do in this game and attack you.
---
Niiiice okay thanks!
---
If you don't find it in a vendor, we will most likely have a second week of 'meat week' soon as a reward so you'll have a  chance to get another one.
---
PSN?
---
It's kind of like the waiting room in NW, what the hell are these people doing running around and whacking each other?  Maybe a little less sugar.
---
Ha yes
---
Yeah no problem, just have him add me, I can message you my psn. And thanks! I‚Äôve had lots of practice editing on PS4 with sharefactory. I‚Äôve made I think over 150 GTA videos with it (mainly BMX stunt montages)
---
The CSS was my friend, never seen. I took along my furious handmade and combat shotgun, apart from using a horrendous amount of ammo the only challenge was to dodge the spit and debris. Took about 15 mins and a few repair kits.
---
A huge part of the enjoyment I get out of the game is playing the market with the vendors and making caps. So leaving my base a ruined husk would sorta suck a lot of fun out of the game for me.
---
Plus, probably more importantly, what is poor Beckett going to do without a base? Guy is just pathetic
---
A lowbie spent half an hour today using my power armor station, ammo converter, and work benches. It was super awkward since I was bouncing back and forth from my camp while running all of the Daguerre quests, and he was STILL THERE.
---
Excellent - glad to hear my info was wrong!
---
I think I have like 146 of the improved repair kits on my big guns person.
---
Bloodied Commando
---
You like it butter?
---
That‚Äôs good to know. I like to stack outfits!
---
Well I‚Äôd like to...
---
Authoritarianism is the common thread.  If rich own everything, nobody can accumulate wealth, but if state owns everything, nobody can get wealth.  But if there is no law enforcement, then some thug can take what you have.
---
Yes, it gets added through the atom shop
---
Are you on PS4? Cos a couple days ago I visited a camp belonging to a person with a similar name to you! They had a tamed Yao guai (idk how to spell it sorry!)
---
I do it because I don‚Äôt want people wandering in my camp and touching my stuff :c
---
PSN ID? :)
---
People are complaining because they feel that they have to log every day in order to complete the board. Casual players mostly.
---
Can the drill damage Earle?
---
I legit TP out lmao. Once I hear the hi, or feet running in. I‚Äôm like socially shy and run as if they are bad guys.
---
Lol ... it‚Äôs just a saying.... like that was a good deal.  I was commending you!  I would have taken it too.  And props to you for buying other stuff.  I had upvoted you LOL
---
Well no idea then. Probably some unfinished quest that they have forgotten about
---
Your good. I was just trying help the other guy understand why his router settings were involved. I am a console slum so that is why I used XBox language.
---
They were about the only decent thing in the atom shop a year or so ago when I first started playing. I assume they rotate in and out like anything else.
---
Because it‚Äôs mine and I can do what I want with it.
---
Can it be repaired now?
---
It has nothing to do with opinions... it‚Äôs literally a yes or no question about whether it‚Äôs functioning
---
I think the weight is really the only downside to heavy weapons. They have great damage, craft more ammo than any other type, have good range. Without being the heaviest weapons, there would not be as much of a reason to run anything else. I like to think the additional 3 slots for their weight is their "downside" over other weapons.
---
There is a random event where a dude with a music playing Eyebot walks by and insults your pipboy for being basic. Then struts off like the badass he knows he is
---
What donation to the Church of Graham and Chally do you propose?
---
Get carnivore and strange in numbers, then eat every melee damage meat in the game
---
I'm still mad at this event for killing me the first time I did it üòÇ I wasn't even low level, just dumb and overencumbered and couldn't find the exit. Was crestfallen when I realized all my precious loot was trapped inside. Now that I'm over it and know better, I'll do it if I'm extremely bored but I always guard the bot nearest the exit and if he wanders off, he's on his own. üò§
---
I have no idea mate, I‚Äôve had this for awhile now and still haven‚Äôt used it
---
Is it on fire? Do you need some water? ;)
---
.... what?
---
Did you DC after you died or something? What does your pockets being empty have to do with anything?
---
That's awesome! Pretty much the exact same thing with me and Lieopluradon, had that name since like 2005 when I got a 360 hahah 
---
I'll add you on 76!!
---
I agree I enjoyed it, but I missed being able to wander around as I always felt on the clock to complete the tasks. I would prefer if the weeklies were enough to complete the season and the dailies allowed you to add score to complete it early. Then you could continue doing them until the season ended but you were awarded perk coins instead for completing them. 1 coin  for dailies and 2 or 3 for weeklies
---
If you make it back up to the original room, there will be a door to the right that had been marked "inaccessible". Its now open and the chest is inside.
---
That's port forwarding, thanks.
---
I keep my bedroom locked because A my ammo machine is in there and B I like having a locked off area to drop legendaries and gear to friendlies without having to worry about other players grabbing it. Yes, I could trade it but the trade system is so damn clunky.
---
Youre right i forgot. It just works
---
I‚Äôm 99% sure consumable endurance buffs work. It‚Äôs only equipment Endurance that doesn‚Äôt work
---
Don‚Äôt have much. What does Chally the Holy need??
---
I‚Äôm level 240 and in.  I have a few keycards too.  I don‚Äôt know how to do any glitches tho.
---
I've seen it happen multiple times as well.
---
Oh.. Cool... I'll wait for them then üòÅ
---
Yes I've been wanting to for days haha.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt work - that would let you fast travel without paying
---
Please don't tell anyone how I live.
---
I have a B2510 I‚Äôll hook up sorta cheap.  I have a b2525 as well.  I feel your pain.
---
She needs caps.  Now that the wonderful humans have stopped collecting greens for her, she buys them at Slocum Joe's, but they cost caps and she's running low
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
---
Remember when certain hats would make your hair disappear? Adding in more facial tattoos might make your entire character disappear from the material world
---
Yes i have time
---
I'd use a faster firing weapon if you're going against a group of enemies. Even an Explosive Weapon so they get splash damage from the rounds. Or equip Enforcer to cripple them, then finish them off with another weapon.
---
The main reason is that my buddy and I like to drop trade, since the actual trading menu is awkward. I'm a crafter at heart, so I do all the repairs, modding, and most of ammo production. He drops raw resources and whatever equip he wants fixed.
---
I also just like it. I may literally live in a barn, but that's no reason to leave all the doors open.
---
I think I remember that there was a side quest I did about 2 years ago, iirc it was a go&amp;fetch.
---
You wanna group up with this other guy too?
---
What build are you?
---
oh okay, thanks. That was a weird complement tho, sry I didn't understand it
---
I can use a stealth commando or heavy
---
I just ignore them and pretend they're not there.
---
I wish there was some better way to communicate with players in game and be able to specifically offer or ask something (I know there is voice chat but I really don't like voice chatting with strangers).
---
I sell most of all my ammo at 1 cap minus I think 5.56 rounds or something for 2. I would definitely love to give low level players a little care package or something. It would be cool to maybe have little gift bags you can fill with maybe one type of item each (like one weapon, piece of armor, some ammo, and meds, etc) and drop them to someone or trade them with people. It would ensure that others don't take what they don't need or if someone doesn't need what you gave them maybe they could pass it on. 
---
Yesterday I joined an event in the Northern part of the map and surprisingly there were a bunch of low levels (4,5 and 10)battling Anglers (lvl 46). My bro and I helped out (and I do believe there was another higher level player) and at the end I got a couple of legendaries for lvl 10. I tried dropping the loot and calling the low level players over but they just stood there weary of me I guess? Maybe they didn't need it I have no idea, but I wish there was a way to just give stuff away to those who need it.
---
I only have 1 key card so far, have you got any?
---
They just need lots of caps
---
I am a heavy bloodied build and went into the mine with two noobs who kept dying and eventually I didn't see them anymore.  I spent 5000 prime rounds to kill Earle myself and then died at the front of the escape tunnel with about a dozen wedigo's chewing on my heels.  For now on I will leave the event before we head down the shaft if there are not more than 4 other players.
---
Murmghr‚Äôs Mystery Pick
---
One time I found another CAMP on top of my spot. 
---
So I just sat in the corner of his room for half an hour while I ate Cheez It‚Äôs. It was awkward, and I could see he was confused
---
Ran away when he gave me a bunch of ammo
---
The bundle if for party leaders peasent, get back to picking potatoes before I beat you
---
Adding pictures
---
raiders all the way, i dont like the stuff the settlers offer
---
Get party boy for a 3x Booze bonus, Bufftats, x cell
---
Problem why this is horse shit.
---
I hate afkers.
---
If you're going to an event, fucking take part.
---
Defend robots for maximum reward.
---
Ez with a shotgun.
---
Afkers are scum
---
Just had it appear on stings n things
---
Oh Chally how I wanted to feed you. But the demonic lag monster kept me from serving you all week long. And the only time I did, you blessed me with your outfit. :( Bame your price girl, but be reasonable...
---
Elections would make sense . I‚Äôm kind of hoping that they do that now
---
It‚Äôs ok, yah it‚Äôs just a saying... or slang like saying, that was a great deal you found!
---
Just don‚Äôt play on pc
---
No that‚Äôs not how it works. It‚Äôs RNG
---
Yeah I have at least one as well. And a private world if you need one.
---
what good stuff you get with raiders ?
---
Chally benevolent cow goddess.  Chally accepts any offering
---
Would we be able to do it alone?
---
Are you asking if that challenge has ever existed? Yes
---
Are you asking if it‚Äôs possible? Yes. Doesn‚Äôt need to be in one match.
---
My camp is open, just like the NPC houses in Final Fantasy.
---
Where random strangers go into my house and rummage through everything, taking my valuables and whatnot.
---
They're "getting harder" as it gets closer to the end
---
yeah. but it's gonna take at least 40-45 minutes with waiting times. better off just farming xp if you really want the 250 points
---
and then u got a load of people who cannot read saying 'but omg it's easy lol' like. that wasn't the point.
---
Us vault dwellers need to stick together.
---
Damn. So why would you even run to the exit?
---
The gauss minigun, hands down the best weapon in the game
---
So that explains why I burst into flames while I was following a guy out.   I was in the T65 and had Fireproof equipped.  I'm glad I saw your post.  
---
Do you know what side of the enclosed area has the exit?  North, south, etc.?  I would have never made it out without him.
---
Rifle gaming tested it ages ago and you're correct, it does not protect you .
---
I‚Äôm not positive. I think that‚Äôs the plan. I‚Äôm just saying ‚Äúone wasteland‚Äù just means the level scaling afaik.
---
But brahmin milk
---
Been off and on.
---
Explosive is better
---
One wasteland is the name of the update, I think
---
&gt;If I didn't go to other regions. I wouldn't find much.
---
You're reaching. Anybody who has played Fallout for even just a month could tell you that this is just blatantly not true. You can survive very well without ever leaving the forest. There are tons of areas you can hit within the starting area that would yield you a decent start, and there are even more areas like Arktos Pharma where you probably would be able to get plenty of medical supplies to render this S.C.O.R.E. reward virtually useless.
---
Reeeee
---
Who? Bethesda?
---
for me it was the ammunition factory at your base, the rest just a bonus, wuth settlers u get a bomb that makes crop grow fast (wow ik)
---
Spoils fast tho.
---
I wish, I'm only level 80 so I definitely couldn't. But its definitely possible with less than 8. I've done it with like 3-4 before. Depends on how much they play or if they just sit around during the fight haha.
---
Yeah...lol...don‚Äôt and you‚Äôll be fine and get your junk
---
Well mission 099 is the BoS one right? But I don't recall having to visit here on any character
---
That's why I want it
---
More to the point, it's a pity there isn't an achievement for it.
---
If not doing anything doesn't affect whether or not the event succeeds, and all you get from defending the robots is a few tokens to redeem a small amount of junk, I'd say the only scumbags are the people giving others a hard time for afking.
---
I 100% agree with all of that haha. Especially for players that don't play nw. Its absurd.
---
Well this other guy that answered. If he answers then it could be possible
---
Whats your build and weapon against the colossus?
---
I don't know how far along you are, but an anti-armor gauss minigun takes them out very quickly.  
---
I agree you shouldn't have to, but I'd be willing to bet they will do nothing about it.
---
It doesn't really matter who you side with. You can still rank up both sides after the mission. The only quest reward you get that's different is each side has a unique weapon at the end, but plenty of people just sell theirs at the end in their vending machines.
---
I think the backstory on these is that they were bogus in their claim. Basically a scam.
---
I lock the bathroom and my bedroom for ‚Äúrole playing‚Äù I feel like you‚Äôd definitely want the ability to use the bathroom and not worry about people catching you with your pants down. 
---
And the bedroom as well, peace and quiet. 
---
The rest is always unlocked for everybody.
---
Max reputation is what gives you the good stuff for either side so if you want it, the side you choose shouldn't matter too much. You just need to grind grind grind that rep. Raiders offer the gauss minigun plan, chemists backpack mod, and ammocon maker. The setllers have the gauss shotgun plan, the dirt tiles plan, and the grocers backpack mod
---
I'm running one 15 perception and agility 8 luck but loads of mutations so class freak and starched genes. Covert op 1 point and sandman and adrenaline 3 with instigating lever action one shot everything in west tek 2/4 shot stuff in the mire don't have any problems. With the mutations I have 15 intl 19 agi as herd mentality works when you join a public team by your self. I don't think the nerf will affect me too much either when it comes
---
Craft a bed at your camp and use it until you get the well rested XP bonus you'll have to repeat it every 1 or 2 hours
---
Step 5.  Mark a clear path to your vendors.
---
No one kills my cow, but on occasion it spawns before the foundation and my foundations are free floating in between two mountain ranges, so it falls down. I don't think it takes fall damage but I'm sure something kills it at random after some time down there.
---
From what I've seen in the lore though, Motherlode wasn't the only one of her kind.
---
Nearish Morgantown/Flatwoods? Those are great little stretches.
---
yeah but you have to pay membership lmfao
---
The same effects from different foods don't stack.
---
Yeah I was asking if the challenge ever existed, I just have never seen one for so long.
---
Actually between the Wayward and Solcim‚ÄôsJoe
---
Yes. If it doesn't make them money, they're not going to waste time on it. If it dies, the few remaining people who play it will stop requesting updates and complaining.
---
It doesn't matter who you side with, as long as you side with both up to the decision quest. Failing to do so results in Reddit posts of people being upset about missed rewards.
---
I‚Äôm honestly fine with the adjustments there making even as a bloodied build ...But don‚Äôt make it harder for me to kill enemies making them essentially walking tanks aka bullets sponges for the same old lackluster rewards. If people double or triple the amount of bullets it already takes to kill the queen for a 1 or 2 star nocturnal pipe rifle or rolling pin events will not be participated in nearly at all I would imagine. Change the game ok but also reward us accordingly !
---
Gun fu to make people mad
---
I thought you said you just got it
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs accurate. The roadmap is a little confusing because it says ‚Äúone wasteland for all‚Äù at the top of the fall section. But there are likely multiple updates within that. The patch is called patch 22 and includes one wasteland, daily ops, presumably legendary perks
---
Read the ITV from this week. When they explain what one wasteland is, they just talk about balancing.
---
[Edit: you can see one wasteland is just part of patch 22](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.jpg)
---
Plenty of 1st members will help. I'm on PS4 and have let others finish it on my private server. Ask around on your platform. Don't be shy.
---
Ha! That‚Äôs where I am, but more in the woods
---
I need more plushies!
---
I usually go for a junkies stealth if someone else has crowd control cause I have x3 damage with it but I could also go in guns blazing with a junkies explosive for crowd control.
---
General are you asking so we can stealth it?
---
Humble, as always. Since we‚Äôll meet you again in the very near future Chally, I can bestow upon you a full 100 caps.
---
this one was in the first or second week
---
Well, if people visit my camp they are free to help themselves to my crops, water and amenities along with my vendors. They can also come up to my church and take a seat on the pews, to offer prayer to the Wise One.
---
When people visit my camp I feel like being awkward. 
---
Like if they're hanging out too long I'll switch to open mic and start pretending to have a private phone conversation.
---
"So you got rid of it when you were done, right? This isn't going to come back on us." "Yeah it'll be in the trash can on 5th and main. Small bills."
---
Just put bash damage sticks on for like 2X durability
---
How is it negative 50 percent of the time? Does the base damage decrease by 50 percent during the day?

Your sacrifice is greatly appreciated, do you require any other meat week garments?
---
Oh, yikes
---
I leave my garage doors open for the public to come into my base C.A.M.P. 90% of the time. But my actual living quarters is locked because I want the  4% of budget space just for myself. My Bunker outside has an armor bench, banjo, bed, and stash/scrip boxes along side my vendor so people have their own space, even if my doors are closed. Even keep the Nukas cold for them
---
I want to now if we are able to kill it.
---
They were a scam yeah. Everyone in them was either killed or ghoulified.
---
Keeps any attacking NPCs out, wild mongrels can open my front door if not locked. I keep the back open though as nothing spawns that side.
---
Idk, as long as they include the nerf and legendary cards at the same time I'm happy
---
We could go in stealth but the only problem is my be handmade may give away my location
---
You can even leave the area and do something else as long as you're back at the start before the event finishes, so technically not afk!  ;P
---
Same I‚Äôve gotten 3 shovels from the 3 times I did the event
---
I lock my favorite room/bedroom because its thematically appropriate. I have a space themed bar with a hidden communist loft behind a NukaCola door. I'm torn because I want people to see it but it seems appropriate that my secret vending machine door is locked.
---
Definitely true!
---
I found the Raiders quests and vault raid more fun. In terms of getting bullion rewards faster, Raiders all the way
---
I found someone's underground ammo factories in the mountains the other day by accident, and it was one of the funniest camp experiences ive had so far.
---
I wondered about that. I have them both equipped and to be honest I wondered if they were making any difference.
---
updooted
---
Gunsmith is still working for me
---
Thank you ma‚Äôam, I think I‚Äôm good with the rest.
---
Farm plastic, steel, lead and get super duper and ammo smith. Or make it Ultracite and do ACP to farm free ammo
---
Wanna make a group chat or something so it's easier?
---
Take them off. There's a difference.
---
No way to update?
---
She has a 70% damage reducion and normal damage resistance.
---
No I just try to recruit them into my cult
---
MOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooo..............
---
Really need to drop public teams and reform one with who's down there with you for just that situation.
---
Never changes, as below:
---
**Earle**: 32k HP, 400 DR, 400 ER, 500 RR, Ignores 80% of all incoming damage.
---
**SBQ**: 32k HP, 300 DR, 300 ER, 300 RR, Ignores 70% of all incoming damage.
---
Alright, my ign is yiphix, and your's?
---
Since I see some builders in here, can someone recommend a good resource for camp building techniques. I think I've pretty much milked all the valuable information I can from trial and error.
---
zeyneplimerve. see u there.
---
So you've counted shots/hits both with and without the perk?
---
We can do that.
---
Nah...just let the motherfucker burn.
---
While Queen has very high DR/ER she also has 70% damage reduction from all damage, which is the main reason you are not doing "9000+" damage.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scorchbeast](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scorchbeast)
---
You can also play around with this calculator and see the differences and the numbers regarding DR/ER

---
I sides with settlers for the Chinese stealth armour really good
---
My junkie alcoholic needs milk for White Russians you fool!
---
Wigs could be a fun way to go about it if they let you wear them in addition to masks, helmets and hats.
---
Go to your settings and turn on damage numbers for adventure mode if you haven't already.
---
The queen has a huge amount of armour which equates to approx 70% damage reduction I think. Also she has a heap of health too
---
Excuse me, the proper term is Albino Deathclaw.
---
I mean, you don‚Äôt have to complete it, it‚Äôs not going to help or hinder gameplay at all. It‚Äôs just free stuff, most of which won‚Äôt even be used. 
---
I DO, however, think the false fireplace is pretty cool and would like to make it to the end.
---
It's like some dude wanting to look at your sketchbook when you're on the bus üòÇ
---
But I'm someone who is scared of, like, phonecalls and the whole online game concept sooooo
---
Well said. hoping they announce fallout 5 at some point to help bolster the case for multiplayer interactions
---
I noticed the same as well, my armor and guns seem to break so often and I also always have these equipped.
---
Which outfits?
---
And this is why I haven't been in a single instance of losing to Earle yet! My main is level 70 heavy guns and I can hold my own (can't solo obviously but can do my share of damage) but my alt is melee + rifles level 42 and I don't even bother doing damage (I know when I'm safe to start going after Earle), I just revive whoever needs it and help when I see someone getting mobbed.
---
We all paid for the game and we all wany to play it, so I have zero issue with low levels in this event or any other.  I'm lvl 165 and there are events that I've never run.  Hell, I've never launched a nuke, so there are big pieces of this game that I've never experienced.  Everybody does it for the first time sometime.
---
Take a shot at Earle by all means... üòú
---
Back to Gilwell?  Happy land, I'm going to work my Chally if I can.
---
&gt; but nuking an old mine in order to get inside and kill a monster that was quite happy minding it's own business
---
Its worst than that! The in-game rationale is "Please could you see what happened to my probably dead Dad?" :)
---
I'm level 567, I don't want level 5 super mutants anymore because a low level ran by West Tek and didn't clean up their spawns.
---
I think what I'm looking at is meat week gave me around 500 treasury notes. If I use all them without playing events it will take me nearly a month. Lol meat week afk did me good and I'd recommend it next time for the extra week (or 6 days) we will inevitably get from BoS event
---
Any data miners help me out here?
---
best I can do is one cap
---
Around 20 caps doesn't sound too bad depending on the drink
---
I feel awkward too, usually I will hide in my crafting room or upstairs and pretend to be looking at my Pip-Boy unless I actually have something to do, then I will do that. It makes me uncomfortable when other people acknowledge me in their camps so I try to stay out of their way at mine. If they wave, I wave back though. I don't want to seem like those annoying shop assistants in stores who pounce on you asking if you need any help as soon as you go in and then follow you around as if they think you're about to steal something.
---
Only: 
---
1. When they are trying to buy from my vendors at the same time I‚Äôm trying to restock
---
2. When they are crafting or sleeping or buying something and I want to log off
---
If they‚Äôre low level I‚Äôll make them some underarmor or a set of BOS combat Armor - maybe a fixer leveled to their stats.  Otherwise they can see everything is open so I just go about my business.... 
---
I have a locked room that I use for when I‚Äôm AFK. It‚Äôs made up to look like a bathroom, and I‚Äôve had a couple of people pick the lock just to find me crouched over the toilet. Mostly they‚Äôre mad because they got a wanted flag for breaking into my bathroom and try to aggro me into a fight. If they‚Äôre annoying I just jump servers...
---
‚ÄúGood luck being wanted!‚Äù As I pop out and leave them in the wasteland
---
Some of these role players would probably have a panic attack and go into the fetal position if they had to use something outside their build.
---
Why would I want to play on just half of the map to get rhe most out of my game? I avoid areas that won't benefit me. So with the one wasteland upsate I have actual reasons to go visit areas in the forest that I haven't seen since launch.
---
I tried launching a nuke for the first time yesterday however I couldn't get to the mainframe after restarting the reactors. The only door I saw was closed and the only other path was through a laser grid that I could not figure out a way around for the life of me as I don't have hacking. I can't tell if I messed up or if someone launching a nuke while I was doing my silo run somehow interfered.
---
I might be down for some pvp later but I won't be on till about 7 pm est.   Gt.    NomadicCake4746 shoot me a message I'm always looking, I need to get into some kind of group or something
---
That would be a no based solely on how all you ever find in them are skeletons.
---
has it?
---
why am i being mean?
---
Raiders like to kill things with bullets and Settlers like to be shitty. It makes sense.
---
100% agree. Be prepared for everyone to tell you why you are wrong though.
---
Exactly. My upstairs is locked because that's where I sleep and also where my in game/imaginary kiddos sleep. Yeah, there's also a bathroom up there, but there's a bathroom downstairs as well. It's weird enough when people I know take advantage of party door unlocking powers to go sleep upstairs and they aren't my real life husband. I certainly don't want a complete stranger in my bed.
---
I‚Äôve sacrificed a bunch of my luck perks so I can have max Lucky Break and Luck of the Draw equipped to combat this issue. I really want weapons to last longer so I can have my good luck perks back
---
Chinese Stealth armor has like 1000 rad resist
---
It's up to when the server stops talking to the client... When this happen the game can continue client side for a few minutes, but you'll lose anything you've looted in that time because it didn't get saved to the server .
---
Another step is don't have your ammo over 1cap
---
You mentioned the warning it gives when loading into a nuke zone over your camp, so did you accept it? If so, then yeah it should get destroyed.
---
I'm kinda inclined to say this is just hearsay that gets spread around here without anyone actually testing it. I have not witnessed any difference in the way my weapons break.
---
I suggest you get a lowest durability weapon you can possibly find and take note how much ammo you got, then go fight with it until the weapon breaks, with and without the perk. And calculate the difference in the amount of ammo spent.
---
Lots of these posters that claim the perk is broken have recently started to using weapons with effects that break the weapon faster (like two shot, explosive, beam splitters..)
---
You wanna do Earle? I mean, I'm sure that's someone's thing.
---
But the wendigos drop so many screws, why aren't people doing it?
---
I mean, could use a reg/broken rad suit and a couple radaway. The second option would be siding with the settlers in the main quest to get the Chinese stealth armor cuz that 1000 rad resist
---
Okay, so this is where I don't know what you mean. I appreciate the reply, but I'm trying to find out how I actually work it out myself. I can read these stats and memorise them, but I don't understand the mechanic mathematically. What is 100 DR if you have 400HP for example? Does it mean that you take 100 less damage? Or does it mean every hit has to do over 100 and the rest comes off your HP for every damage point over 100 it is?
---
lols
---
I like it, cause my house has this awesome view on a mountin top near top of world in the center of the map, and its got a nice open floor plan with lots of view. Its really a nice place. Classy. 
---
when it team up, im right were you wanta go for reducing travel costs. im also 5 caps from two vendors and i find i get TONS of visitors of all levels
---
I possibly have 2other people so far . And yes we are gonna do Earle:)
---
Intervene, 1918, all the way from Tennessee
---
I genuinely can‚Äôt understand people who have locked rooms.
---
scout out the areas south of the mono rail elevator
---
I‚Äôd pay 15c for cola, 40c for nuka dark.
---
What platform are you on?   I could use a good bar to hang out at, and having someone there might increase your foot traffic.
---
Southeast of Top of the World. Even has a lead deposit.
---
Hill 223.
---
Use the interactive fallout 76 map, google it, and find a near resource to build around. The junk pile near west tek has a sweet cliff you can build off.
---
Mi shanty es su shanty. Come in and look around
---
I made it as lovely as I could for that very reason (:
---
My camp is fairly close to the pylon ambush site so I get a lot of foot traffic after Encryptid.
---
I also stylized the downstairs as a doctor's surgery (Gramps as the secretary) so if players are there while I'm there, I'll hang around in a lab coat on the chemistry bench (unless someone needs to use it.)
---
Great!  What type of build do ya run?
---
Sorry, what kind of glitch you say? Mine seems to be working ok. I'm on PC btw
---
There's a great spot right around the corner from Lucky Hole Mine. A pond with a huge cliff wall surrounding it. One of my favorite building spots. Put some chairs on your roof and enjoy the view as nukes land at Fissure Site Prime...which is rare now since everyone is nuking Monongah Mine. Still a perfect spot to me.
---
Thanks for replying, I was going to give you a medal, but I couldn't find your comment.
---
Same issue with my TSE Lever Action, I'm forever having to repair it... but having played since January 2019 I've noticed a steady decline in both weapons and armour durability, which I could live with were it not for the fact that I have White Knight and Gunsmith maxed out.
---
Good luck! Hope you get some good legendaries c:
---
I'm at that point now
---
They will already have the Chinese stealth armor if they are up to the "side with foundation" option.
---
Thanks. I got a VE25 handmade last time! Super lucky
---
Junkies heavy pa
---
what sides that ?
---
Damn, nice!
---
should i max rep both sides before doing final quest ?
---
Is it possible you can send me a picture of where it is?
---
so is that the only option that is viable?
---
Nothing fancy, but just a quick video showing how it‚Äôs done: https://youtu.be/QPrjWP9htm8
---
I haven‚Äôt tested it, but I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt work, you can find ballistic bock without crafting it.
---
My suggestion is the raiders because you will get the reputation faster for the ammo machine for your camp. But in thr end it dosent matter that much because you can still max out both settlers and raiders reputation after the questline is done.
---
It's too good it feels like a real steal tho xD
---
Here you go: https://youtu.be/QPrjWP9htm8
---
Yeah my luck with it has been great so far! I traded it for my first legacy a be90 laser which is insane
---
Go to flatwoods
---
I can when I get off work lol
---
I'll send a pic in like an hour-hour and a half unless someone else beats me to it...not sure how popular that spot is.
---
And chinese stealth armor from settlers
---
Tru using luck of the draw. Very useful. At least if you use fast-firing weapons like me
---
That's the idea!!! That thing is way more difficult than the Queen, so you have to be more strategic than fearless üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Im still waiting on a mothman plushie
---
I just want long hair :( none of this medium shoulder length stuff. Down to my lower back stuff.
---
I just break into their houses. I try to find a window where they might have a chair, work bench, etc and hop into and glitch into their house and usually wait until they show up or someone shows up.
---
That would be the raiders
---
DR is damage resistance. It is a scaling form of damage reduction Heres a link, it works the same in fo76 as fo4. The chart on that page kind of shows you how it appliea and how it starts to suffer from deminishing returns the higher you get.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance.
---
Little example:
---
- 100 dmg vs 100 DR armor, damage is reduced by 50%
---
- 100 dmg vs 250 DR armor, damage is reduced by 64%
---
- 100 Dmg vs 1000 dr armor, damage is reduced by 78%
---
The % damage reduction the SBQ and earl have are on top of that  very high DR number, thats why they take so little damage. With the 80% damage reduction and 400 DR Earl has, my 10mm deals 22 damage with sneaky headshots, while normaly vs something like a lvl 68 supermutant they do 375 damage. Thats a massive reduction.
---
A harpoon gun... to hunt... err, ROCK WHALES!
---
I'm very much an introvert IRL but online I'll say hi and offer free stuff for low level players.
---
2 hours later they come back to camp, crops are grown, collector has collected, but they might notice the lights.
---
shhhhhhhhhh or they'll patch it out.  It's a great breather to "earn" some notes while you get a drink, visit the loo, check that the kids are all still alive, etc.
---
The secret service armor does offer a good amount of rad resistance. It‚Äôs definitely nowhere near a hazmat suit or power armor or stealth suit and I‚Äôd definitely warn against ‚Äúexploring‚Äù a nuke zone with it. It‚Äôs pretty good if you get spawned into a nuke zone and don‚Äôt have anything else available. Offers enough resistance to run out of the zone without sweating it too much.
---
The treasure hunter for start. I wear it all the time cause this gun show needs to be seen.
---

Idk, photomode is about 5-8 mins from elevator to completed launch prep. if you can do that without photomode, the whole run, I'd be impressed
---
Not only are they a scam (they don't work), but they are one of Fallout's absurdist jokes.
---
They're coin-operated.  So the fraudulent manufacturers could never hope to profit from their scam - by definition, if there is ever cause for people to run into these things and pay for their use, civilization pretty much just ended.  Even if the Pulowski company people survive to collect the money, it's gonna be worthless.  It's more akin to a prank than an actual scam, as there is no possibility of profit.  Either the Pulowski people were dumb as a stump or they were brilliant performance artists highlighting the absurdity of nuclear detente.
---
No. You can continue to increase your rep after you finish the final mission and raidnthe vault.  And honestly keep the gold for yourself. You will lose a couple days of rep gaining but it's worth having the gold to spend.
---
I wanna say yes. Everything else besides a hazmat suit and PA doesn't really come close in regard to Rad resist. Someone correct me if I'm wrong! I'm a PA guy
---
In fact it takes over 30 days to get Ally status with each one so you'll be waiting a long time.
---
Update: I switched my PlayStation to my living room that doesn‚Äôt run on a LAN cable and my friends list started working, I think it‚Äôs WiFi
---
Oh shit, I'm not the only one.

I usually jump on my mining cart grill and pretend to look busy :D
---
Nice nice, u a quantum spammer?

That‚Äôs a perfect picture of the front, thank you!

Nah I want the good loot and xp regardless of where I am
---
Out there, in a world outside of Yonkers.  Way out there beyond this hicktown, Barnaby.
---
And?
---
Oh never mind I‚Äôm pretty sure I found it IT LOOKS AWSOME!!!!!!
---
A new fresh to the game wouldn't struggle. You can't say I'm reaching when you think every new player knows what to do.
---
The best I can do is half a cap
---
Automatic doors my friend. I like people coming and checking out my house, but I HATE having my front door left open, and having to close them myself as well. My solution was to rig pressure plates on either side of a powered door, with the wiring off to the side so it doesn't stick out everywhere. I have a little enclosed 1 foundation decon shower room w/switch followed by the auto-door.
---
The only doors inside are my secret fireplace door to the armory, and the locked doubled doorway metal door behind it (they can look but can't touch :D).
---
That's the thing, my dude. For the sake of understanding the mechanic, I've done it both ways. If you are offered the option to change servers. If you stay on the server, your camp is destroyed. If you choose to change servers, when you load into the next one your camp is destroyed. 
---
The destruction apparently happens before the choice is given to the player. I sure hope that isn't the way the mechanic was designed and it's just an oversight or a bug.
---
Right?
---
This
---
Melee meats will. They're hooked up to allow stacking
---
People can turn off the generator?
---
There are still minimum levels.  You definitely can't fight in harder areas as a noob
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter your gun will spit them out before they‚Äôre spent
---
Think it's broken cause I use to run that perk and could cripple everything. Now, not so much.
---
I get an anxiety attack when like more than 2 people are there. I feel like they are plotting against me... that‚Äôs even with me attempting an SBQ repair shop close to the drop site.
---
All these people are just innocently scrapping, unloading, or repairing, and I‚Äôm like... ‚ÄúHMMM, something is fishy!‚Äù
---
So, I just fast travel far away.
---
It is. I think I still have one.
---
Update: I now have access to my friendslist again. Not sure if its fixed for everyone yet, just wanted to say for me its working again.
---
If you do that quest with a level 50 then yes. You need to make a new character tho.
---
RNG , I mostly find legendary pipes but once and awhile I‚Äôll find something neat
---
If you do the quest above lvl 50
---
I work around the problem by having no friends.
---
I surely wont forget it. Im still pretty new and didnt realize making my base right near monongah was going to put me on the lip of a dozen nukes. So there I am preparing to watch a nuke roast my front lawn and here comes two dudes in power armor, one just going ballistic about a goat. Set a good tone for this game for me.
---
Level 50 all rise is far from best in class, but is half decent.
---
To follow that thought, I think the issue may be that the warning is issued for the *player* loading into a nuke zone and not your *camp* existing in a nuke zone. Doesn't excuse the issue, though, because either way your camp is destroyed due to bad luck. 
---
I mean, strictly speaking it could happen to any player outside of the forest nuke-free zone. The reason it doesn't is because no one wants to spend a half hour launching a nuke if it doesn't trigger an end game event or good farming.
---
I suspect this happened more often for people who lived around Whitesprings back when that was a popular nuke location, but I started after wastelanders so I haven't seen it dropped there as much as it used to be.
---
Oh ok i did it with a friend a while back before i reached lvl 50 but he was lvl 80 so my allrise is lvl 20
---
i usually put all consoles in the same room with generators, but no people cant turn them off, but they can cut the power it they can get to your switches that are not with passcode
---
Oh rly now? That is interesting as hell. Any limitations? Like no two recipes from the same critter meat?
---
I built an upstairs room and made the floor farmable dirt tiles. You can place the Brahmin pen on them. Not sure if this is common knowledge but gave it a try and it worked. Brahmins are safe from just about everything up there.
---
yeah, I'm sure you would have reported on your neighbours in Nazi Germany or Communist Russia too. HOW DARE THEY LISTEN TO BBC! I am gonna report those people for not wearing that star. 
---
My point is, if it doesn't affect you, just mind your own fuckin business.
---

Only works with pre war booze. The odd exception is sweetwater's special blend, although technically that's still bourbon.
---
I enjoy when people visit and give them a wave or a thumbs up and  then go back to whatever I was doing. Sometimes I talk to them on the mic but not many people respond. I like visiting other people's camps to see what they have built also, it can be fun and inspiring.
---
I have a suspicion I wonder that people are telling others that glitching score to autocomplete means that it‚Äôs a bug and if they report it as such they get the associated score without actually having to do the associated tasks. It is generally acknowledged that staying on whilst the score tasks change / update increase the chance of locking out task by autocomplete. that people continue to report this almost daily means that either nefarious peeps use this to prank others by saying hey it‚Äôs a bug so if you do this glitch you‚Äôll get the score when this bug is fixed knowing that one it‚Äôs has been fixed and two glitching it will mean a loss of score for associated person glitching / abusing bug. I merely state this as a possibility fully aware that at one stage it was a bug. Just find it odd that on reddit it is posted daily.
---
Thanks.   So it's no windows and big items lining every exterior wall, then.   Anything else I should do to keep my private space private?   I don't mind people wanting to craft but I'm sick to death of people trying to start pvp in my own camp.
---
Oh man I want to see actual Unstoppables comics so much...
---
I do hope they also adds difficulty options though(like lvl 25? k, like lvl 76? sure), but it seems like it will be quite uniform on the chart
---
Yeah im lvl 76 and still struggling to kill even lvl 20 enemies i have to put a whole mag or about 4 whacks with the slegde, getting a bit disheartened when im this high and cant even wreck weak enemies, is it me or are the enemies to bullet spongey
---
I have 1500 fucking treasury notes. Please Bethesda.
---
If you want a two handed weapon, I'd go bsss super sledge
---
Full buttressed SS still has you taking like 16 rads per second in a nuke zone. Stealth suit or hazmat gives best resistance
---
Consider trying out some 1H melees.   If you have not done so lately, you might be pleasantly surprise at how well some of them perform.
---
You can‚Äôt trust damage numbers.
---
You cant repeat the quests no, i have to start a new character
---
ok holy shit I know why. tried in many different locations and methods for 30 minutes because either he got insta killed or the revive didn't work. this is bs

But just think of all the beautiful beautiful death music you can make with that trio of percussion death instruments.

You need to optimise your build, focus what you want to do and what health level and stick with it for a good while. Mix and match builds rarely fare well :-)
---
Why do you have a door on it?  Even you don't need to access it.
---
Hahaha well then... I got a fuck ton of those too
---
I finally realized where I could go to farm wood so i have like 1k Wood atm. I do have all the work benches and a bunch of other stuff, but it‚Äôs just small and kinda lame, I guess it would be nice to come in and use a bench and dip but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You can't stack the same exact meat, but you can stack *Mutton Chops* and *Mutton Meat Pie*, for instance.

ok managed to get someone else to do it. took us a while because he couldn't damage himself and it would insta kill him most of the time. but we found out the the rocket launcher was the only weapon that worked somehow....
---
Best I can offer is a paper clip.
---
For one I never pvp never have never will. And I‚Äôve played since beta. If I wanna pvp I‚Äôll play a different game. But yeah if you don‚Äôt want ppl in don‚Äôt let it near windows
---
Since when do they give you the Score you missed? I always heard and others ‚Äúoh well, we can‚Äôt do anything‚Äù.
---
Besides it takes more effort to lie and do what you said than just do the Score challenges. They‚Äôre stupid simple.
---
They are not bullet spongey, except Early Boii &lt;.&lt;

Curious what a level 50 would be worth?

Default save is every 10 minutes or when you fast travel, rest, or leave the server. If on PC you can change that in the custom ini. Mine saves every 1 minute. Also make a habit of fast traveling or logging off after you receive a good drop or buy something important. 
---
The custom.ini command is
---
fAutosaveEveryXMinutes=1.0000

Default value is 10.0000
---
game was way too easy. Even without a proper build or good weapons.
---
you do realise bloodied still does WAY more damage than every other build yeah? Like the one video i've seen of the bloodied "nerf" made me laugh because they were still hitting the legendary sheepsquatch for like 160 each shot rapid fire.
---
What‚Äôs your platform?
---
You can reach Ally with both, so choose whomever you like (you will get a small bump for doing so and a small hit to the other side but it will be made up fast - and depends on the choice you make in the vault) and continue to grind dailies and rep for both!
---
All Rise is one of the worst weapons in the game for melee, FYI
---
Power armor, all the way
---
What‚Äôs a FED?
---
Yeah i didnt realise until now that i chose the wrong places to put my points, now im having to level up and move points which is a grind in itself, wish i could respec my points, bit crap that its not an option
---
Amen, brother! o7
---
I agree. Melee model swap weapons should be universally applied. Having these restrictions only hurts their sales.
---
I'm in the same situation although i like it when people visit my camp...but i can't help being awkward..XD
---
White knight is definitely not broken, i use it to prolong my chinese stealth armor, and Ive noticed a significant drop in my repair rate since equipping it two weeks ago.
---
Locks won't work 100 percent either, as they can be picked.   People can phase through doors if there isn't something in the way right inside.  (At least, I hope that stops it.)
---
When people were stealing from the Christmas collectron, I put it in the smallest shed possible and no doors.   When I accessed it, I stored a wall.   When done, I put it back up.   There was no room for a person to stand on the one foundation block in addition to the collectron, so I think that took care of phasing.  Or I was lucky.   I made it through without theft, and I've had stuff stolen from water purifiers and an extractor before.
---
HA! Tell that to my Medic/Tank/Heavy/Mule lol
---
If you run with a group, just have 2 people both slot fully ranked Rad Sponge perk (under charisma).
---
Shouldn't have any issues after that
---
Yeah there‚Äôs been a lot of posts saying perk x is broken Beth please fix. especially if the person hasn‚Äôt played without said perk equipped. Also like when ppl were saying I‚Äôm having to eat drink more often when they were obviously playing more than they were normally.
---
Really. Havnt found anything better that weighs less and gives good damage, need help lvl 76 and still a noob
---
I can help with your build. Are you high health build or low health? do you use power armor or not? what weapon type do you prefer? (1 handed melee, 2 handed melee, unarmed, shotguns, rifles, automatic rifles, heavy guns, auto pistols, semi auto pistols)
---
All common liquor is 1 cap.
---
I'll drop gifts from time to time mostly ammo but sometimes I camp plans for the lower levels other then that I'm off doing what ever I'm doing and if I'm just chilling taking a break I just lock myself in a room
---
it's a win-win for Bethesda. players will be left picking up the pieces of their builds and reworking them entirely while they work on some more mediocre content, all the while making the game more grindy so people waste more time online doing inane busywork.
---
Ultracite ones are for primed gatling lasers and regular are use for non primed lasers and power armor. When creating Ultracite fusion cores you can use regular ones that have any charge, great for primed gatling lasers since two 1/100 cores can potentially become six 100+/100 Ultracite ones.
---
One Wasteland is moreso geared towards higher level players.
---
Didn't they specifically change it after nukashine was implemented because it was just too damn op? lol
---
What the others said plus:   sick of people trying to start pvp with me in own camp, tired of people bugging me when I just want to get something done and get out there again, etc.
---
Is power patcher broke as well? I run with that and I never needed to repair my power armor but idk if that is cause of the perk now or not as this is the first time I have heard of this bug.
---
True, I‚Äôll serenade Earle and become the Pied Piper of Monogah
---
Yes, my social anxiety disorder appears to extend to gaming life üòÜ
---
I usually give a wave to let them know I'm friendly and then run away
---
No, only works on effects that are set up to be magnitudes. If it doesn't list a change with Party Boy on, it won't work.
---
it's about only 50% stronger than a full health junkie's build now.
---
you want us to play with nerf guns or something?
---
Nope. However. If you are able to drop into the actual silo when it fires a nuke AND the silo is at the edge of the nuke zone (not the center) you can survive.
---
Visual bug
---
You can use [NukaCrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/) to get the codes
---
The way you can control yourself outside of PA makes it seem intentional to be this way. The mouse/control sensitivity is greatly lowered, which makes it harder but not impossible to not die if you're unlucky
---
There is no way to survive a nuke blast in the overworld.
---

---
The data on the toolbox indicates it's cut or unused content from the quest coded BoSZ04... that's "Daily: Heart of the Enemy". The tombstones aren't tied to anything, they're just null content. Leftovers.

And the note "Mission 099-01 orders" can be found ingame: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mission\_099-01\_orders](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_099-01_orders)
---
No it's on the cliff over looking the rear of West-Tec
---
I'd imagine when BOS finally gets here they will either be gold billions rewards or something from a vendor
---
I had a jackass join my team to tell me I was in his spot and move or he‚Äôd nuke me. Got all his buddies together trying to harass me and follow me wherever I was going. They nuked it and would take over any workshops I captured so I stayed for all the hours I felt like playing to spite them.
---
Scrap it and replace
---
Yeah, they aren't broken at all
---
I never thought of this one, but now I need a jet pack escape hatch.
---
I kill greedy bastards' cows.
---
Serves em right for that 10 cap per ammo.
---
I mean, 10 per .38.  you on crack m8?
---
A bit of everything m8, i use rifles and sledge, i have mutations as well, i cant put i pic on here to show my cards no
---
No one. Scrip it. Furious on a shotgun is eehhhhhh
---
All of crafted or repaired items are capped at 200%, only thing that higher intelligence helps with when crafting is overcharging fusion cores.
---
playing nuclear winter, eh?
---
The Raiders offer optional reward Slug Buster plasma rifle, which is horrible. Tell Ra-Ra to open a door or glitch through yourself.
---
Besides that, the only rewards are an outfit and hat exclusive to either side.
---
All the GB items can be bought regardless of who you take to the V79.
---
Who?
---
**Only?**
---
Oh well then. If it's only 50% stronger then they need to nerf it more. IN TO THE GROUND!
---
Yup. It‚Äôs neutral at dawn/dusk. Peak at midnight, bottom at noon
---
Thanks guys, that was what it was.
---
I was originally planning on getting to ally with both before I chose.  
---
But it was very slow going, and I decided I wanted to collect Treasury notes, not script, from events.
---
Seemed like the best thing from Crater was the Plasma Caster (I‚Äôm melee, so no big deal)
---
I already had enough reputation from Foundation that I could buy Chinese stealth armor plans for caps (and I did).
---
By that time, I had all the prerequisites for both sides done, but I had about 30% more foundation rep than crater rep.
---
I sided with foundation.
---
There's still progress. If you're level 5 and you go to the bog the enemies will scale to the lowest level they can which is current max level (or close to), whereas someone who's level 500 will get max level whatever.
---
The gamma gun is way more efficient at getting rads back after dying by the way
---
Because Vault Dwellers are barbarians.
---
Or Foundation is much less good than you think. Depends on your view.
---
How do you get your camp over max budget?
---
Floating in space forever...
---
I let her go after I finished her story arc.  I find raider Punk to be much less annoying.   I suspect people who find her annoying keep her around because she is a female character they can dress in underwear or a bathing suit.   Or at least 90% of the Sofia's I have seen were severely under dressed.
---
I mean missiles can track with the right scope anyway. 
---
The really funny ones are VATS crit MiniNukes.
---
Could very well have been you then! :D
---
2shot fat boy is funnier
---
That wouldn‚Äôt be a bad security feature, either. 
---
See a player coming, crank the wendigo noise.
---
You should trade, because those marks are more valuable than any armor piece
---
I certainly don't want crossplay with PC for obvious reasons, although console crossplay would probably be cool.
---
"Never underestimate the value of a meatshield"- me when I posted this
---
I don‚Äôt know, at low levels your still have limits on perks.  At level 20 you simply don‚Äôt have the 3  of the specific weapon perk 3\* and bloody mess 3\*.  I know they are flattening the curve some with the damage changes, but if your damage without the perks is on par with the damage with those perks, why bother even leveling at all?
---
Bloodied commando maybe, but not single shot.
---
Nerfs aren't a bad thing when all other builds don't hold a candle to bloodied unyielding build. I don't understand the people who want everything to be too easy.
---
Basically these people think anything that takes more than 2-3 hits is a bullet sponge. When in reality a bullet sponge is something like a scorch beast queen.
---
When they have to develop new content with actual mechanics involved that make it CHALLENGING. How are they supposed to do that when most weapons can do HUNDREDS of points of damage for every hit multiple times in a row using automatics if not straight over a thousand when it comes to gauss rifle?
---
The game desperately needs one wasteland update, the only thing they need to tweek now is to make all lower damage weapons such as one handed melee and scoped/pistol builds more powerful.
---
Maybe missile launcher/fatman will actually be worth using now?
---
is that with a radx aswell?
---
Marriage is a promise; a commitment to be with someone through better or worse. The commander and I fell in love while going through hell and back helping her solve her robot-whale-induced migraines. Those are memories she won‚Äôt ever let me forget. No amount of nightmares will shake our bond.
---
Sometimes build budget glitches pop up that let you build stuff, then reduce your budget bar back down so you can build more. I used one about 4 months ago and have just been maintaining that same base ever since. It was a 10hr long addition to my already max budget camp.
---
I wasn't accusing you of that....just saying several players have done it, and I don't want to engage them.  I only have one window....the only thing by it is a couch.  Next time I'm on, I'll try to sit on it through the window and see what happens.
---
I appreciate learning from you guys.
---
do you play a nocturnal build? do you actually enjoy doing inane busywork every other day? because we'll be pumping twice as much ammo into enemies now, at the very least.
---
I'll never get people like you. nothing's stopping you from playing with crafted gear. but now I'll have no choice *but* to shoot bb guns.
---
it's literally
---
&gt;because this is not to my taste I don't think anyone else should be allowed to enjoy it.
---
Go do Wendigo Colossus and get that Cursed Pickaxe. It blows All Rise out of the water.
---
i was just answering the question, not actually complaining about it. i finished it in 5 weeks and purchased level 90 to 100. as i was sitting on 5k atoms anyway. but i'm playing every day so that was easy. yep, the fireplace is cool. i like the tree and plushie as well. but there was a lot of filler though. i may not try that hard to finish it on Season 2 as i realized that i was just focusing on XP gain and was not enjoying the game as usual. we'll see.
---
all of it. and as a junkie i say nerf that as well.
---
Is there some anti-bovid meta? I've had multiple people come and kill my cow.
---
I went in 40% with PA and my Bloodied Gauss Minigun/TSE Gatling gun and died three times. I didn't move if Earle was next to me, he even when he got stuck in the ceiling, I just kept shooting and letting the wendigos beat on me.   I ended up soloing Earle because the other two disappeared after he mutated.
---
I think its just them going with the theme of a nuke being symbolic of a true endgame level event. I have no issues with this, unless its like idk, 20 different events in the future that need nukes? Big endgame mutated boss battles, go for gold. Robots like the sheepsquatch imposter? Lets keep it to how they've used the recall card.
---
I just wave and go about my business.  
---
I try to have everything set up so they can use things conveniently, and everything is open so they can grab whatever they might need.  
---
I may have to add another guest room at some point.
---
Nah, it affects the public servers. It is my business since I play public; go play in private if you don't want me to report your, what, 200 mm rounds? Several hundred hours for some minigun ammo? Go for it lol

DID I HEAR COMMUNISM(warning: loud)

I feel like a crashed alien spaceship would be a cool location to explore in the Expeditions.
---
so a rifle, 2 handed melee hybrid build? i'm headed to lunch, but i'll post a link to a custom build for you in an hour when i get back....are you high health or low health build?
---
Not if I drink it, no sir (:
---
Supercow a resca te!
---
This is dumb. Are all the other structures in the blast zone destroyed? No. Just our camps. It should not be like that.
---
I have been on a server where a nuke was going to be dropped on my camp. I logged out before the bomb hit and logged back in only to be placed on the same server. My base was fine. This is the way it should be.
---
Works as intended.
---
Nope. Lights turn themselves back on when you return to camp via fast travel. It‚Äôs one of my smaller annoyances with the game.
---
Why?
---
One that also launches you hundreds of feet into the air for an epic superhero landing.
---
Provide evidence.

Depends on who is saying it.
---
Orchestra geeks call it a double bass, everyone else that knows it isn't a cello calls it a standup or acoustic bass.
---
And, isn't he calling them The Brian Setzer Orchestra these days?
---
I ended up deleting most of the downstairs doors other than the one for the bathroom, plus even with my camp not being super elaborate, my budget is at max because of double walls. Might have to keep this in mind for once they give us instanced interiors though.
---
If your on XBOX I‚Äôll give you a bunch of cranberry cobbler lol
---
How do you figure that?
---
I had a bunch of low levels in my camp yesterday, I'd just bought the Mr Fuzzy Ride on sale and in the end there were 6 of us riding simultaneously. That was the best "in my camp" interaction ever
---
Cool, so am I.  
---
I‚Äôve been carrying around a max level 1\* AA fixer for a week or so.  I scripted a bunch of stuff last night, and honestly don‚Äôt remember if I tossed it in the machine or not.
---
However, if I did not scrip it, and you want it, I‚Äôm sure we can work something out.
---
psn aj ninetyeight
---
Thanks for the data check !
---
I do find it funny that the box is under the tomb where the asylum hat spawns...
---
I like how you think, but one step at a time. Let's get the hatch installed first before we become ceiling pancakes!
---
Totally agree- your point on the other structures being A.O.K. is a good one! Maybe this is a newer bug? It's hard to say, I don't think there were many people willing to build by SBQ who would have dealt with the same problem.
---
Hmm people will do things to get attention the effort required doesn‚Äôt come into it really.  Whether it‚Äôs the truth or a lie. You are saying it‚Äôs a bug without actually having a shred of evidence that it is still occurring or that it affected you personally. I merely propose that it could be part of a hoax to trick unknowing individuals via another channel say discord and direct them to this reddit post  and say hey there‚Äôs a post saying it‚Äôs a bug to trick more people into glitching during score update to make them lose score at their expense. The fact your response to me is nonsense merely reinforces my musings. Good day to you and try again.
---
it's subjective either way. nothing wrong with wanting enemies to be bullet sponges, nor wanting them to go down in a single shot. difference is that you can always play with an underpowered build if you want a 'challenge'. now I have no choice but.
---
they could also always buff other prefixes, or make more bosses like Earle. no need to cut damage by 50%. not to mention all the grinding required to make up for that. add contextual drops to every enemy and I'd more or less be ok with it.
---
and if you think the gauss is anything close to op then you're really not the right person to be talking about nerfs or buffs.

it wasn't normal how easy the game was or how powerful bloodied is. Should have been fixed a long time ago. You'll just be killing things easily. It'll just take 2 seconds instead of 1. Stop getting your knickers in a twist.

---
I seen a gauss rifle able to get boosted to 1.1k damage using old formula for damage, now it's at around 640 after nerf, which is better.  I don't think gauss rifle is the best example but at the same time 1.1k dmg is ludicrous and will one shot most enemies. This is not even considering sneak attacks or critical hits.

---
I'm looking forward to one wasteland, but a little confused on how it works, since an enemy can be both high and low level at the same time as I understand.
---
What happens if 2 players with a large level gap attack the same target? Does it have 2 different amounts of health somehow? Or are its defense ratings different so the lower level player can damage it at the same rate as the higher level one? What does its health pool look like then?
---
Cool, I‚Äôll add you tomorrow, I‚Äôve got a lot of stuff spread over 5 characters so can always move stuff around
---
'normal'? what does that even mean? I guess they should go back to Skyrim and Fo4 as well and fix 'op' gear in those games as well.
---
not to mention that doesn't really address any of the points I made.
---
Ohhh yeah yeah I think I‚Äôve seen a few people running around wearing that.
---
I hope it‚Äôs giant!
---
Great idea.
---
that's also too powerful.
---
Also, while I‚Äôm at it, I‚Äôll rearrange your perk card order every load in.
---
I generally play with the sound off so I've got no complaints about her complaints. When I see her at other people's camps she is frequently underdressed so I make her wear full secret service armor at home for safety reasons, and not some because it's some weird stormtrooper fantasy roleplay.
---
You should be good.  It goes into the shop as Free.  So it shouldn't matter that you change or not.
---
better is subjective.
---
and like I said, if you really think gauss rifles are a problem, then you're clearly not qualified to be talking about buffs or nerfs.
---
I've stopped visiting people's vendors if they are at their camp. Twice in one day I had people stack punja boards under me as I visited their camp (one immediately after spending 5k on Flux). 
---
While I know they can only do that to get anything in the very specific situation I had above, if I see the owner standing around near the machines...I'm no longer going to visit.
---
I don't get any of this, why the fuck they're trying to balance weapons when there's still loads of things that dont even work properly In the game.
---
The way we choose to play this buggy mess should be the last thing on their radar.
---
The fucking stupid thing is, that they haven't nerfed legacy weapons. So the only way to play will be with duped legacies soon enough.
---
Just focus on distracting wendigos, not getting hit and reviving players. There's plenty of spots you can jump up on where the mobs can't hurt you.
---
Don't leave an event like that, unless you want to keep bring a noob forever

https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks

Great tool to use
---
Looking at cards like weapons  artisan and ammo Smith , dont keep them equiped. Swap cards quick when you need to craft or pick a lock/hack a terminal. This lets you utilize those spots for cards that can help you in combat, kind of the whole reason behind the card system.
---
If i was running a melee /rifle hybrid build, this would be the minimum. Theres 11 points left for QOL perks/power armor perks.
---

---
Which leads to the conclusion that since it seems to happen to a lot of people with the Tesla but other people have had no problems with the Tesla at all, then it is likely a combination of the Tesla plus some other thing happening at the same time that is causing the frame rate drop. It‚Äôs almost like there should be a QA team.
---
People had me worried the nerf was going to throw my whole build out the window. So I bought the game through the Bethesda launcher so I could see for myself how bad it was going to be. I loaded in at my camp and was almost immediately attacked by five or six level 75 floaters. I dealt with all of them with a few shots each and realized I‚Äôd be fine if this was the extent of the nerf. Enemies didn‚Äôt feel like bullet sponges to me and they don‚Äôt drop from one hit either. I may not be in the majority, but I don‚Äôt really mind the nerf anymore. I was excited for one wasteland bringing some difficulty to early areas of the map, the nerf will add to the difficulty as well. It‚Äôs been amazing one shotting everything, but I also want a challenge that I just don‚Äôt find anymore.
---
No effect using this perk with B.Bock. The same 15% damage increase is written in pip-boy. But in case with Whiskey for example - effect is x3 really
---
dootedup
---
A new fresh to the game isn't going to be hitting Rank 23 of the Armor Ace season right off the bat. When they do, they most certainly won't be needing these rewards as bad as an extra Perk Card pack or an extra set of lunchboxes.
---
Moving back to the point: the Rad Kit Bundle is a joke and Bethesda should put in something more helpful or realistic. Common loot in dismal quantities shouldn't be the reward for an entire rank.
---
Everyone should be a PA guy when calibrated shocks and 10 fusion cores for the price of 30 are a thing I mean even as just a hauler that is an extra 100 carry capacity no backpack and deep pocketed can do that
---
I had 20k wood in my scrap box so I donated 10k. The best thing in all those atlas provisions were the 25 to 100 caps in each one

---
I have not had this happen but I would be **extremely upset** if it did.
---
I am lucky I am in an area that is not nuked much at all. (Toxic Valley)
---
Yes you can loose multiple minutes but it not because that time was non connected time. It‚Äôs because the game saves progress less often than you think. I have lost multiple legendary items I got minutes before a crash. During that time between getting the items and the crash I continued to be perfectly connected to the server, talking with friends and killing mobs with friends.
---
as in. it was not normal how easy the game became. i guess other games have nothing to do with this. 
---
you waffled on about bb guns. how do i address the waffling? I've already said you'll still be doing WAY more damage to than any other build and still one shotting most things
---
If you can make or buy Radshield, use that instead.
---
Wow, that is bad.
---
true. as much as it pains me to say, legacy weapons are a perfect example of how twisted their priorities are. or magic weapons, which remain, well, magic.
---
it's clear at this point they don't really intend to fix most of the bugs that plague this game since the beta. since Fo4, even. if Todd couldn't be bothered then, he sure as F won't be now.
---
I think that white knight is working as well as it always has, but I also think that something has been wrong with Gunsmith or at least ware on certain guns since wastelanders came out. I went from repairing my Lever action and fixer once a day to 2 or 3 times a day. the fixer is a plain Jane, the lever is instigating. both with hardened receivers. However, for the past few days I have been using a Bloodied combat rifle with a powerful automatic receiver and I am repairing it less. only 1 or 2 times a day. To me this points towards something being messed up. I should have to repair an automatic .45 more often than a single shot .45, especially with events like "colossus" which should be tearing my guns apart. Where the problem is eludes me. Nothing has changed with my build. except I have swapped out "rifleman" perks for "commando", and swapped out "Lone wanderer" to more team friendly perks like "strange in numbers" and "squad maneuvers". I have never min/maxed bloodied. I usually stay at about 1 3rd or a tad more health. This is not a scientific or data driven conclusion, but surely there is something strange afoot at the circle K. I don't have the head to count my ammo as suggested by u/Daemoni73, but that seems like a really good suggestion. I have a feeling that there is more to this than the guns and gun perks though.
---
Too powerful for what? What difference does it make?
---
Why not make other prefixes better, rather than make   the 2 good ones worse?
---
Also, I mentioned enemies getting more powerful. They could have nerfed the enemies while nerfing the weapons couldn't they?
---
Just wait till you're surrounded by 10 or 20 level 70 liberators with your anti armour handmade. Those 25 rounds are gonna go really fast.
---
Wow, thanks! I‚Äôll plug that into the ini. I wonder why default is 10 minutes. So many things can go wrong after getting something rare!
---
With all the serious issues that need fixing this is what you bring to the table? üòÇ
---
Lol, i was pleasantly surprised with the direction this went. People though, am I right?
---
It depends on whether the damage adjustment is due to damage being above what was expected for content. Which would mean unchanged boss stats. Or  if it‚Äôs more just a general rebalancing it could mean something slight will change but will be barely noticeable. So my guess would be unchanged with maybe slight nerf to stats.
---
Right? The game has such a heavy monetization emphasis on camp building. You'd think, as a result, the mechanic/use-case of "complete obliteration of a camp" would be held to a pretty high degree of testing/scrutiny.
---
Lol. So many things do go wrong. I have lost a few good legendaries to the save time issue before I made the change.
---
On my new character, im doing her questline and then getting rid of her for the settler with the endless guitar riff.
---
Fixing bugs is always going to be a thing, they need to prioritize which bugs need fixing first while introducing new content. I would like all the bugs fixed too but they can't keep players waiting for EVEN LONGER for a proper endgame when it's already been 2+ years and there is barely anything to do at end game.
---
Here's a video from Rifle Gaming that went over this a while back.

Changes daily
---
I hate it when they don‚Äôt call you after smashing your face into a car windshield
---
10-15 caps for nuka there is the cola nut so sell them the same you sell a stimpack so 40-80-120 heaping nuka cola is sold a bit less than the price of a stim the quantum sell it the price of a super stim and the cherry or 100-200-300 healing nuka in the middle
---
I don‚Äôt like people just standing in my house when I come back to camp especially when they don‚Äôt buy stuff. It‚Äôs weird lol
---
Because they know I am famous for three things. 
---
1. Sleeping on all beds. 
---
2. Not wiping my butt crack thoroughly. 
---
3. Getting killed at random camps because of my break and entry habits.
---
Have you heard of cola nut basically makes nuka a improved stim you get lots of healing lots of ap and water so sell them like stims
---
I have a SBQ farming platform camp at the map border south of Fissure Prime.
---
I have logged into many existing nukezones but personally have only had my camp destroyed if actually there when the nuke is dropped.
---
Yours sounds like a bug to me.
---
You know what, I don't care if Earle falls through the floor 100 more times or if my SCORE auto completes for the rest of the season, but dang it if I have to hold that left arrow down for 3 more seconds, and then overshoot 20, and then go back and forth 5 times because I keep overshooting it.
---
normal is subjective. what's normal to you is clearly not normal to me. alternatively, I guess Fo4 and Skyrim are not 'normal' to you either, since you can be terribly op in those games as well. it's a terrible metric either way, and I'm not sure why you even brought it up in the first place.
---
a lot of people play this game in a singleplayer, coop fashion. so keep that in mind as well.
---
not to mention, if you're so sure I'll still be one shooting things, then why nerf anything in the first place? just so I waste twice as much time gathering resources? it's stupid no matter how you put it.
---
I would rather have more content like colossal event but more story and connected events. Right now I jump servers because there are no events worth doing or even fun to do that pop up. Very few random encounters, no random large battles between NPCs.. Just seems so empty. Meat week felt like a kids event and cheesy. You do it a couple times and what then? 
---
I think its all the caps placed on currencies that slow the game and limit the fun aspect for me to be honest. If I have a full stash of legendary trash and can not sell or exchange anything because of such a small allotment a day.. I have no urgency to continue playing that day.
---
The whole idea is to make it so you explore with your mates and not feel like you are stealing all the experience and just vaproizing everything. When there is no possibility to lose and you just hit the win button. 
---
All the tension disappears. I used to be afraid of death claws in other games, now i laugh at the sight of them.
---
Are we going via vertibird?  I'm sure as fuck not walking from West Virginia to Colorado and back for a dog...
---
- Do you balance is around bloody unyielding, in which case all other builds are too weak to compete? 
---
Compete with WHO exactly? This is a pve game. 
---
Maybe they should just remove the legendary weapons and gear all together? Then well all be equals pequals. Sounds fun.
---
I...don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre talking about. You don‚Äôt respawn in a new world when you die. You‚Äôll be on the same server, usually not too far from where you started. In an instance, you might be sent all the way back to the beginning of the area.
---
I know this ain't me be I am also a level 22 colassal problem player and got my meat pile plan and vocal sack the second run
---
LOL
---
Same here. I think people should keep Bethesdas development cycle in mind and realize that if it wasn't for 76 we most likely wouldn't be getting any new Fallout until after TES6 which at this point would be many years away. I know it's not the single player RPG escape that most people want but it's a dose of Fallout for now that took a chance on sharing the fun with friends and despite its blemishes I think it's very fun.
---
I just tried that last night with my high Agility melee build, Enforcer refused to proc on Earle. Bizarre, because I saw the targeted limbs lose a chunk of durability with every shot but then when i use it on scorchedbeasts it's rarely more than 1 shot to break a wing.
---
I can only conclude this game hates me.
---
Nope, they're a scam. I tested it once just for kicks. Fired a nuke at Whitespring, fast traveled to the station and hopped in the shelter. Nuke landed and I was vaporized.
---
I'd hope so, or maybe we can get our own highwayman
---
I know this spot intimately.  I like to explore the map  before I start getting into a game.  My wife and I found this place exploring during Beta and then again after launch we went back when deciding where to build our CAMP.  We were worried because we were low level still but the place was beautiful and just stuck with us both so we figured worth the risk. For the first year we played we hardly ever were bothered and nobody seemed to know where it was. We went through all the learning curves and all the camp bugs at the beginning until we figured it out. There wasn‚Äôt a ton out there yet so to our surprise, one day we saw a YouTube video drop about good camp spots and our site was number one! Shortly thereafter it started appearing as number 1 or 2 on all the top 10 camp building videos. We started getting lots of visitors and then eventually the griefers showed up.  We weathered it all there. We have several alts and have built all over the map but it‚Äôs still our first and favorite campsite. Now, GET OUT OF MY POND... my vendors around the corner ;) Enjoy the views, they‚Äôre breathtaking when the nukes fall!
---
Ok thank you for the tip üëç
---
They hard to come by from scrapping?
---
Just scrapped a dozen and unlocked nothing
---
Someone made that deathclaw travel size
---
I run luck of the draw i can farm pretty heavy with my gatling laser all day and only repair it once, but that said it isnt two shot explosive so it isnt breaking down nearly as fast as yours
---
magic anything.
---
Alright, message me too, lol. I like creative homes
---
First of all, using qualifiers to determine whether someone can talk about nerfs or not is a pretty scummy thing to say, you contend with actual arguments don't use your cite to fake authority that you just made up to bully people into silence.
---
Also Consider 1.1k dmg gauss rifles BEFORE  sneak/critical damage /consumables WAS OVERPOWERED.
---
The only reason i mentioned why the gauss rifle is way overpowered is because the higher the base damage the more it boosts from additional effects under the current dmg calc. So that 1.1k can turn into an insane amount of damage since you can keep stacking more effects with the multiplicative dmg calculation.
---
Secondarily better is not subjective when over powered builds like bloody unyielding break the balance for all your content your developing for the game ...because what do you balance content around?
---
Do you balance new challenging content  around bloody builds or everything else that is miles behind bloodied/unyielding?
---
If you balance around bloody then everyone will feel obligated to use it to play the game in order to beat high level fights.
---
If you balance the game around everything else then the plethora of a people who use unyielding bloody will find it too easy.
---
If you throw the one wasteland update out and keep the current damage calculations and boost everything to the level of bloodied then certain weapons will become too powerful with multiplicative formula and you will be able to reach the damage cap(if there is one) when the game was already too easy.
---
Better is not subjective in this case since the current damage formula  directly makes the game imbalanced which become a nightmare to develop content for.
---
The one wasteland update is genuinely healthy for the game non-subjectively and allows more challenging content.
---
This. The raider quest is much more fun and has some interesting story choices that impact who survives. The best character on the settlers side is the dog and he doesn't go with you on the vault raid sadly.
---
The game itself. Are you collecting a set of Mutant's Safecracker's +1 END armors? I suspect you wish to progress to something better than that.
---
If you find yourself taking too much melee damage, pick up the blocker perk,makes a huge difference. If using blocker switch to using 2 ranks of slugger,expert slugger and master slugger instead of all 3 at rank 3.
---
For melee martial artist and incisor are a must.
---
You reply to the most inane pointless and unimportant posts. Yet when we have real discussions and tag you for some sort of input you are nowhere.
---
What exactly is your role supposed to be?
---
I know in your profile you've said 'not a dev' so what actually are you here for?
---
I really would like to change my hair but we don't have a lot of choices since release :(
---
Stalk them. I like to creep on them and build stuff around them when they‚Äôre at the vendor.
---
So lovely!
---
Are you on PC?
---
Too close to real-life... "We should talk more! I thought you'd never come back! Where have you been?, etc."
---
1) people leave my bastard doors open
---
2) people attack me when I'm crafting/scrapping/modifying
---
3) I don't like people
---
to be completely honest it's mainly point 1, if people learned to close my doors and/or Bethesda added self closing doors I'd probably leave them unlocked. I mean I have a balcony that's open so if you have insane parkour skills, marsupial or a jetpack you can get in. Just don't mess with my bastard doors
---
I‚Äôve been using weapons with Vampire effects. Helps to keep me alive while still dealing damage.
---
I‚Äôm assuming console players remain on 10 minute save windows with no way to change .ini? That‚Äôs silly
---
You could use the earth merge glitch. If you want to know more about it there are a bunch of videos explaining it on YouTube
---
I read about this months ago, it's not exactly new and it doesn't seem to do anything sadly. Maybe for some upcoming content, one day?
---
Until you fast travel to a camp, your encased in a solid room, no doors or windows, surrounded by rad barrels and under water.
---
Only when they do creepy things. And people do.
---
Put powered doors in instead and pressure plates
---
Yep. Console players can‚Äôt do all the fun shenanigans like reducing initial load screen time, changing save time, removing grass, preventing dead body chunkification, make water clear, etc. btw that last one is awesome. No more murky water.
---
I've been using a instigating/limb damage/reduced weight gatling laser. Haven't tried it solo, but in a team it does drain Earles damage bar pretty well
---
Raider Punk will never ever be replaced in my camp
---
Reverend Horton Heat jumps to mind.  More on the side of "punkabily" though.
---
I like when people visit my camps. They don't stay long sadly. Usually buy and leave. If someone lingers and checks it all out I usually drop a nuka or some stuff for them
---
For some reason my Sophia disappeared from my camp so I got the lovers embrace without the annoying headache nonsense
---
I don't know about hacked/bugged weapons as i don't like using them.. But B2525 Fixers seem to do the job nicely. Captainoob soloed Earle legit in 38 seconds with it using stealth commando build, and 3 guys (3 man team that is) here on this sub posted a legit kill video with them that took 12 seconds.
---
Depends.
---
Either they're serial mooderers. Or your prices suck.
---
I think I sided with the Raiders ‚Äúbeen awhile‚Äù. But reached MAX rep with Raiders and was able to get the Gauss Minigun.   Went to settlers ‚Äústill 1 level down from full ally‚Äù and the Chinese stealth armor was available.
---
I have a switch that turns off my vendors (so I don‚Äôt appear on the map) while leaving the rest of the camp powered. I keep it behind a locked door just so other players can‚Äôt turn it on and off. Had to get rid of the ally because she wouldn‚Äôt leave it alone.
---
It has gotten harder to find out here on the west coast too. It used to be in all the mom n' pop stores out here, but they all stopped selling it when Jones made a distro deal with Starbucks. Now Starbucks doesn't sell it either. :(
---
I love it when someone shares bloody mess, because the team is suddenly causing more damage, whatever the weapon. 
---
I share Radicool.
---
In case some one figures out a new glitch in case his to steal stuff from my displays.
---
Wow, that's impressive
---
No, I love it. I poured in blood and tear to make my camp nice and my vendor prices are sofa king good. So good in fact, that I have a stool close to the vending machine that I sometimes just sit there and watch customers come and go along with that sweet CHAAAA-CHING sound. That is until some knob decided to leave a bag of spoiled meats and fruits on the porch. I will then collect said spoiled goods and locate that player's camp and dump it back on their porch. Kids, don't leave spoiled food on people's camp, its just rude.
---
so what happened to me today does not happen.  thanks very helpful !
---
Yea.... that scenario I forgot about. That would be very nasty üòî
---
Earle seems to have really high energy resistance. I recently dusted off my anti armour gauss rifle. I‚Äôve seen reports of players using 5mm weapons as you get back tons of 5mm from the spawns. And crafting it is nothing to resource draining.
---
we have no idea
---
I think I'm going try this, I seem to die just before Earl, so I don't get to raid the body
---
Provably not. There is no reason to since most are purely cosmetic.
---
There are to many other issues they need to address first.
---
Yes, I excluded legendary and legacy items for the most part because of this. Magic effects as well. Can't imagine what a JE could do with magic damage, I'm almost thankful it's BEs that were duped in comparison.
---
If i put myself in a position where i am surrounded by ~~30-50 feral hogs~~ 10-20 liberators then that's on me. 
---
Every time i defend this buff and nerf i get in the same loop of discourse. But it's happening. And if loads of bloodied players leave the game because 'wah wah my build is roo-inned' then that's good for everyone else.
---
No. They don't have wallpaper options and the thick ones look like hot ported garbage compared to the other walls. 
---
You don't need to be in my camp. Go use somebody else's crafting benches
---
I don't even use doors anymore. What's the point? Aesthetics?
---
charisma for pets?
---
Separate band though. BSO is on the big band/swing music side of things more than rockabilly and does not include the members of the Stray Cats. (not 100% sure of that, though)
---
Bethesda specifically states that players will NOT get S.C.O.R.E. reimbursed, so why people would try to lie to get it for free is beyond me. I have been hit with this bug twice since they said it was "fixed", and both times I submitted a ticket. Hopefully everyone else did too. I'm not expecting to get anything given for free, but another Extra Challenge week like this week's, or a week extension on the run, would be very nice, and would go a long way in keeping Bethesda in good graces with the affected player base. All I want is acknowledgement and to not feel burned by said glitch.
---
as the other poster suggested, you can try the earth merge glitch, but I also don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd get any great shadow from them (if that was your goal), the light source would radiate normally on all sides
---
We had them in beta and they were removed for griefing reasons. They are still available for workshops though
---
As a devoted stealth commando i will first max out *Follow Through*, then dump all the rest into the ones that give extra specials. My alt will become my ammo crafter with maxed out *Ammo Factory,* as there is no point wasting coins with your main on that.
---
Master Infiltrator so I can free up slots in Per and Int.
---
if i hated every character because of their repeated ambient dialogue, i wouldnt be able to enjoy most games.
---
Really wish we had an in-game way of leaving comments or something at bases to let players know when we like what they did with the place. Sure, it would immediately be abused by jerks but there has to be a way to implement some sort of in-game messaging or chat that won‚Äôt devolve into abuse
---
I don't understand why people are always such dicks about it.
---
normal to you is GG EZ mode? Why play the game if you're gonna have it on the easiest setting. it can not possibly be any fun. 
---
BUT when the update comes enjoy using your "bb gun".
---
Oh dont worry. I'll just clip through your windows XD.
---
I didnt know that you couldnt apply wallpapers to them. That sucks.
---
No mine waits to crash until I killed a 3*** scorch beast and level 50 scorch beast countless scorched and I‚Äôm heading to get my loot from the 2 SB    That‚Äôs how my luck is.
---
I don‚Äôt know what do you want I can trade
---
Yeah, I post a few SCORE pictures and next you'll say "how do I know you didn't complete them yourself". People like you don't help anyone or any problem.
---
There‚Äôs a camp on PS4, 36 guns, 20 amor, 20000 ammo, single walkway that drops you into a pit of punji sticks that kill you in a hit or two, too deep to jump out of even with marsupial. Right by the wayward.
---
It's a bummer Bethesda hasn't utilized the Highwayman.  Oh, the trunk space...
---
And now I can't level up my lowbies real quick by putting them in high level areas. The enemies will be scaled to them. &gt;.&lt;
---
you sure all your friends didnt unfriend you?
---
It definitely takes fall damage, my cow jump off my roof and died once, right before my eyes
---
Sorry about response time, work lol. Umm not typically unless there is a lot of Tesla's running then it's kind of hard not to. My build all around is decently tankey so I'm not into the stop for 5 second crap and spam spam away lol. So I'm totally cool with if you want to work on your build tonight while we pvp if you wanted to try some different setup's. Can set matches for 10 mins or whatever, fix your gear, ammo, whatever I'm down.
---
When you're wanted and a low-level player kills you then you kill them and  they get their 2nd account thats over 300 and kill you and start destroying your base ;-;
---
It‚Äôs unplayable right now on PS4 , game straight up disconnects me from my internet every time I even try to load in
---
Earl knows he could just fart and kill the guy.no threat.
---
Follow Through is another one that I'm thinking of but not too sure
---
I turn on my microphone and do my best lawyer commercial impression.
---
#Have you or a loved one been diagnosed with The Blight? You may be entitled to significant compensation!
---
There are some people who stick around for haggling and trades.  I was visiting a camp and did not buy anything so the person asked me if there was anything I was interested in because they would drop the price down for me if that was why I wasn't buying.  I ended up trading with them directly.
---
Yeah the lower the better, for comedic relief. As if high lvl players dont show up ill prepared either. Sometimes I'd join the event in a rush and screw myself over, other times I am prepared and hold my ground. Sometimes you get a solid group that stays alive, other times you get ppl who die in the same spot. It's a game, ppl. Life is like a box of chocolates
---
So your hanging your entire argument on a single word?
---
Compete in people's minds for actual use for endgame. Tons of players i see that are 100+ have 80% radiation and have ungodly amounts of special stats from unyielding. So bloody unyielding outperforms all other builds.
---
Bloody out competes all other builds in terms of performance so it directly impacts how the game can be designed.
---
Also when you don't get any credit from killing things because players out-compete you with insane damage on legendary creatures such as scorchbeast queen who gets anihiliated in under a min WITHOUT MAGIC WEAPONS.
---
It kinda becomes a problem for other PVE players when they need to do X amount of damage in order to credit and get items. So you get scenarios where the person that launched nuke doesn't even get the credit for the queen since they did too little damage.
---
Also it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs launching with one wasteland, it just says it‚Äôs happening in fall
---
Except themselves hahaha they will walk right through walls and fall to their death
---
I'm basing myself on your apparent knowledge about the game. or rather, lack thereof. gauss rifles are the last thing that need a nerf. one, because they're broken currently. and two, because they're supposed to be the strongest bolt-action rifle, yet their dps falls behind pretty much every other weapon class in the game except bows and crossbows.
---
yeah, they hit for 1k damage when charged and are capable of one shooting any mob in the game except sub/bosses. guess what, literally any properly specced build can do that. and the nerf is not going to change this fact, if you aim for the head. so at the end of the day every build can do what the gauss is supposed to excel at, while being obnoxiously bad at boss battles.
---
**wow**. *clearly* it needs to nerfed even further, so it's completely useless instead of just half.
---
regarding the rest of your post, Earle is an example of how they can, in fact, balance the game as it is without making new content too easy or too hard regardless of your build. there's also no need to balance preexisting content, or literally the entire rest of the game, so it takes twice as much ammo, forcing us to waste twice as much time gathering resources.
---
but please, do tell me more about your idea of proper balance considering you think 1k damage on a bolt rifle is op.
---
Smol dps ftw
---
If drinks sold by player vendors acted like a free PartyBoy perk, I'd be more than happy to pay for any drinks I see. Otherwise, I expect them for free in people's Pristine Nuka Machines and Punchbowls. I know mine are free and always keep them stocked to the brim with various beverages.
---
I love me some reverend. If you haven‚Äôt heard of em may I suggest Tiger Army and The Horrorpops
---
I just rotate one of my perception and intelligence perks for Hacker and Lock Picking
---
Could not agree more, there is 0 reason to visit Ash heap , Toxic walley &amp; the Forest atm
---
Where's the buff? All I see is nerfs to everything. Buffs to the mobs?
---
I was all for a rebalance, but I was expecting improvements to things like mutants, nocturnal, berserkers.
---
Instead they have rather lazily, changed the way damage buffs scale. They even said themselves that this is to make things easier for THEM. Not considering how it will damage the playerbase.
---
Nah, I'm kidding. I have 3 serum recipes. Marsupial, Bird Bones and Adrenal Reaction. Which ones you need?
---
I have the same problem my camp is located to the right on top of that hill with a nice view of the savage area
---
Nice! I just found a guide from angry turtle that mentions those things after reading your comment. I love reddit
---
Yeah thats what I meant, awesome. I run bloodied heavy weapons primarily, so I was unaware that food for melee damage stacked. 
---
I just picked up the new cursed pickaxe though, so this is good to know in case I need to swap over to melee. Especially since I heard the new mutations thing in upcoming daily assignments thing will have enemies that only can be damaged by melee attacks.
---
mine wore a Vault Tec jumpsuit.  I thought it had an "off duty astronaut" kind of vibe.
---
Are there any class actions for Jelly Fingers as a result of working with Stingwings?
---
I want the gauss shotgun or Gatling because they seem really good, but I know alot of that has to do with the legendary perks on them and I have a good legendary double barrel that I'm not willing to trade out anytime soon.
---
Are you usually grouped with inspirational?  That‚Äôs 15% and that plus class freak int (2% per int) May explain it
---
It also saves every time you drop something, such is why there's a slight delay before the loot bag appears on the ground.
---
marsupial
---
Lol haven‚Äôt seen that happen yet. But they will glitch out to the ground below and shortly thereafter, teleport back to their room lol
---
Yeah... And depends whether I'm getting any PVP aggressive vibes from them.  Had some level 424 named after a rare WoW flame blade drop, who 3rd partied into a contested workshop situation with me and my team mate. He started throwing his weight around with his OP bloodied build and repeatedly killed my team mate. The fight came back to my base.  I was just trying to access my Stash and maybe do some crafting but this guy wouldn't leave. Eventually my team mate logged out in disgust and the self-righteous salty player eventually left too, after a final pop at me.  I was glad to have my camp back to myself.  Also been attacked in my camp by a clown with a shovel for no reason.  Didn't retaliate in case he also had a 1-tap weapon in reserve, to deprive me of all my carried junk, of which I had plenty at the time. I ended up server-hopping. I may go back to locking my front door if this keeps up. Maybe if Bethesda hadn't added capture a workshop as a frequent daily we wouldn't have to fight over the damn things which were probably rarely used before all this dailies/weeklies business...
---
I guess the first fall from my base isn't enough damage to kill it then. Cause sometimes my cow isn't there (fell down and wandering) but I don't need to repair it either (so it's not dead yet). But my fall is kinda tall cause it's seneca, so I always just assumed no fall damage.
---
You need to be a bloodied build.use a heavy gun plasma gatlin 3 star.or a 3 star gatlin laser.modded.perk cards maxed.it is still very tough.but it can be done.oh yeah and power armor.
---
I have two accounts so... Tryna get some serums to help w doing missions solo
---
I calculated that i can max out 3 legendary perks (without sacrificing all my swap perks). That leaves 3 rank 1 perks to fill out. Meaning Follow Through and 2 specials maxed and 3 other specials with just 1 rank = 13 extra special points.. That will open up sooooo many possibilities on my build. Too good to pass on.
---
I'm not used too the format with multiplayer in general, so I feel awkward just by meeting other players. I don't wave or anything at anybody and don't even know how my mic works. I have only played like 30 or so hours so I'm still kinda new. Here the other day I walked in the area of an event for a quest, and got a price for participating, and had no idea how to say sorry for accedently cheeting. I diden't want to participate since you seem to hate low level characters joining on stuff with people who are high lvl, and I kinda just felt bad and awkward. I would actually love to kinda find a group of people to play with, but that will not be my friend group since everybody hates bethesta for the moment and are highly sceptical of 76. 
---
So I'm basicly thay kind of player who explores alot, and once I see people I just run away because of the awkwardness of everything.
---
I've seen both. It's frustrating and hilarious
---
Yep, bit of social anxiety, but I also like having people visit. 
---
My work space and vendor spaces are separate from my living space so I assume anyone who finds their way to my living space is there to explore, which helps quell my anxiety for some reason.
---
My only concern about visitors is the Enclave/raider battles that happen outside my door. If the drone is shot down by a visitor and the package lands in my camp, when it self destructs it'll take a huge chunk of my camp with it, lol.
---
I accidentally did this to someone else's camp, literally blew it off the map, and have been afraid of it happening to me ever since.
---
I‚Äôd recommend ammo factory for heavy guns. There‚Äôs no need for the explosives perk when you‚Äôre already melting everything but the bosses in 2 seconds, and the bosses are resistant to explosives anyways
---
This is typically short periods of time, like leaving nuke zones for ACP or respawning during Scorched Earth, so no. I‚Äôd imagine you‚Äôd still need to be spamming radaway even with radx though, rad resist is like DR and ER where it has diminishing returns
---
normal to you is playing with a paddle ball? why play the game if you're gonna have to hit everything with the equivalent of a commie wacker. *it can not possibly be any fun*.
---
nice arguments by the way.
---
first let me clarify that it is no Insult to you.  FED is an abbreviation for Federal Reserve Bank.  this is a private bank which does not answer to the Congress in any meaningful way, and is about as Federal as Federal Express.  Congress  has the responsibility for the issuance of currency for the country (the U.S.), but has instead violated the constitutional mandate and turned control of the economy over to the third chartered private bank the U.S. has had
---
in short, these are the people responsible for your future financial security and the financial security of your loved ones.  always remember that
---
Damn! You level 300 or something?
---
I'm only 145 so I'm pretty sure I can do 1 max Legendary Perk
---
Nothing has been implemented, the point of a test server is to see how things go.  If it's too much of a change, they'll adjust.
---
I know a lot of people are complaining about how bad things look, but I also know people who *actually* are testing on the server, and it's really hard to tell that there's much of a difference.  There are some edge situations that aren't balanced well (certain combinations of mob level and gear level), but for the most part it hasn't been overly difficult.
---
Like you, I haven't been there myself, but the people I'm seeing are definitely having a different experience than you're describing.
---
Oh so I don't need the membership to accept invites to private world's?  I see
---
But I‚Äôm Canadian lmao
---
Master infiltrator without a doubt, 1per has made lockpicking almost impossible (and changing perks for hacking gets old quick
---
The farm tiles are nice.
---
They are very strong weapons, all of them. Just not my thing.
---
A few times I have entered the mine to find a wall of rock impeding my movement. Forcing an afk event.
---
PS4 üò©
---
 Nah, you said you would report it even if it did not affect servers, that's irksome.
---
Beat me to it
---
Low levels going in to earl of sandwhich should play support.not balls to the wall.you will die quick.just help the higher ups.get some shots in to earl when you can so have a chance to grab his loot when they kill him.
---
I still dont understand how this works.  Ive got a lvl 315 and a 130. If my lvl 315 is at Scorched Earth with a bunch of level 50s, they should be able to kill it a whole lot faster than I will if its scaled down for them and maxed for me.  If the "scaled Down" is killed quickly, how do they help me?
---
\~700 :)
---
I love this.
---
And Nuka Grape is stim+radaway. Helpful for anyone who isnt a bloodied build
---
I need my milk for tato salad and the cows in Flatwoods are almost always milked; literally live right next door to the place so I know from experience. They just need to fix the cows like they fixed player tames by making them unkillable outside of PvP mode; they should still die to NPC enemies obviously.
---
I can imagine, I don't even bother with lock picking or hacking in most instances
---
The barrel is so short that if you turn the end of the barrel 1mm your bullet will change 2meters. I did competition shooting and it's a bitch
---
That's what I thought, but what made me post this is that Bethesda have apparently been and adjusted the damage again to make them a bit more powerful.
---
 It worked out at about a 70% nerf instead of a 73% nerf...
---
Just a bit off then hahaha
---
I had wood, but after fast travelling it was gone. Thinking of raising a ticket.
---
it's mostly chems, booze and magazines doing the work. people see videos like that and instantly assume they can pull off the same/that bloodied or sneak is op.
---
but sneak doesn't work in groups. and your damage will be 1/3 of what you see in captainoob's video without buffing yourself up.
---
I do Camden dailies if haven't yet that day. Or visit mumbles.
---
Since I literally live in an weird wood cube because I'm not good at building definitely yes
---
Yes, it is a bug in the game and is being abused by people. Ofcourse I would report the bugs and said person even if there is no affect on stability. It does have an effect on servers so obviously I would report it. Quit being narrowminded; this is unintentional game design and people are abusing it. Just go get the munitioms factory like everyone else did before hand and grow up.
---
Inspirational?
---
Went with Raiders :)
---
I am fine with some damage nerfs and enemy buffs but something MUST be done about durability. I am sick of having to repair my weapons after every event. Nerfs will make this problem worse.
---
It's not fun to have to go to a bench and move perks around twice an hour to repair.
---
I haven‚Äôt got nuka grape yet
---
I usually just go inside my toilet and stay there until theyre gone if I'm not doing something
---
aaaahhh this aggravates me too!!!! ü§¨ü§¨
---
xD
---
Honestly not really for me either but sometimes I feel like I should just because.  I still haven't done the vault run yet so it's not like I'm in any real rush.
---
hows the fix for the dehydration bug coming?  let me guess, no one has any idea what I''m talking about?
---
Worse case, can anyone tell me if it will persist if I make an entirely new character (had a pre wastelanders character)?
---
Follow Through most definitely. Taking one for the team looks good too.
---
I'm like "Yes buy my adhesive and whiskey"
---
Sure man, you do you i guess. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Won‚Äôt it leave the store though?
---
Same, audio stutter the desktop.  Updated drivers all around, higher end specs.
---
I usually share (level 2 generally) Goat Legs, Ironclad, The perk that makes energy ammo weigh less, Strange in Numbers, Squad Maneuvers, and during the event Good with Salt.
---
I've had a few instances of the infinite loading screen when trying to fast travel to camps over the last few days
---
It depends. I had a stalker + 33 vats Combat Rifle which was a critical headshot machine, really good. Better than instigating, close to bloodied in terms of numbers because I knew all shots were hits. 
---
It's name was Deadshot. 
---
Then VATS got screwed up and it lost most of its appeal, since I got false hits with no damage. Sold it for 5K.
---
I close my door, and peer out the window....then wait for them to find my museum of mr fuzzy and teddy bear display cases.
---
My love life summed up
---
I'm interested to see how Taking One for the Team works. Is it like if they've attacked you at least once, they'll be affected or they are agro onto you
---
I‚Äôm not at all arguing with you, I‚Äôm on your side; but this has been going on forever. My buddy and I have played every COD And Battlefield game for over a decade and it‚Äôs the same. There are always guns that every asshole uses because they‚Äôre clearly better than other guns. I always enjoy using all kinds of different weapons, and I do, but it gets frustrating when you keep losing to the same gun over and over. So I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs far from a fallout 76 problem, it‚Äôs just weird that game developers can‚Äôt find a way to make all guns viable.
---
Is that a "magic" gun? Because in theory, that gun shouldn't do any more damage throughout the fight than a non legendary version.
---
JOKES ON YOU, I DON'T HAVE ANY WINDOWS.
---
Tbh, I really don't care if anyone uses my benches. It's really all the open doors that bother me. If they self closed that would be great, but they don't, so locks are the only option that works atm
---
Legendary  SPECIAL skills. +5 to a SPECIAL is big imo
---
You can go to the top floor in Whitseprings. There is a Nuka Cola vendor up there that sells nuka grape
---
Hey, I love my yellowcake flux.  I make orbital strikes like crazy.  I'd make more but I can't collect fiber optics fast enough.
---
But I am currently working on gathering up enough mentants and teddybears to reference the old world blue DLC in new vegas. So I got that going for me, kinda wanted to give a fun referance to people who love all fallout games, but then again, I'm so low lvl right now so it will take some time.
---
pops some Formula P with that gat laser. It'll concentrate the beams for tighter pattern.
---
Two high level players can do the event at this point so i don‚Äôt know why ppl worry about lower level players joining.
---
Definitely, there's a few perks that would be super beneficial but I'm only level 145 so don't have many spare perk choices so would involve another 5 - 10 levels to get it to what I want
---
With What Rads? literally the only radiation I still need to worry about is nuke zones and Radiation Rumble. It's so good. Then I'll pick Taking One For the Team, since I'm a melee tank I'm pretty much always taking damage, so it'll be pretty consistent for me.
---
Debating if I want to take Survival Shortcut and throw away all my food &amp; water, or if I'd rather keep the food (Rejuvenated and food buffs) and pick something different.
---
No way. I have to see this for myself...
---
I don‚Äôt know what system your playing on but on Xbox if I tap my LT 4 times it goes to zero even if the counter is at 30000
---
But it's a mechanic that's already in the game. I too think it's silly but whatever. At least the fight is fun
---
Nope. I use it for ACP. Unfixable, but good-looking. It'll fall apart someday. But it'll do its job until then.
---
Now that‚Äôs good to know. PS4, I shall try it tonight
---
What's the PA glitch?
---
Fuck those rats :D
---
And it makes events like leader of the pack, uranium fever, and horde events more worthwhile because you'll get legendary loot you could actually use, instead of being scrip farms
---
Yeah it's a magic gun
---
At my camp, Sofia is cosplaying as her hero, the Mistress of Mystery, in one of the tattered dresses. I like to think of her as my first recruit into the resurrection of the Order. I just wish she'd acknowledge the outfit, though. I hate hearing her talking about it all geeking out, and not able to enjoy the fact that she has been inducted unofficially into the order by me.
---
Thanks that‚Äôs a real bummer for this nice looking suit, hope they can fix it, it‚Äôs apparently a bug.
---
Understandable. I dont need to worry about that issue because I have the Red Rocket Garage. It closes automatically lol
---
What type of ghoul?
---
I just follow them and let them into my locked rooms
---
Is this getting fixed anytime soon? Just hit the block on my new characted
---
I put the rad in radrat that day.
---
it is. a lot of people don't realize they're using magic weapons.
---
gonna be real fun once the nerf drops and they get a reality check. specially once Bethesda fixes magic weapons.
---
The doors at my camp, "Last Chance Garage" are never locked. 
---
(Except for my fusion generator....that locked door keeps the riff-raff from playing with the switches.)
---
I guess ‚ÄòJust‚Äô could mean this minute or this month lol
---
Yes but not half as bad as when someone wants to trade and I still dont know how it works. I literally panic and fast travel.
---
Sorry but i know enough about the game to know what i am talking about, You pretend that one shotting everything but non-bosses is not broken, you are a lost cause.
---
Also notice you don't even address that bloody unyielding is way above all other builds which is very imbalanced. Why even have builds around special perks for speech checks for example when you get insane gains through unyielding for all your stats making all individual special stat increase completely useless by comparison when you decide between the two.
---
Vanilla 76 is so flawed in every way this change has been a long time coming how they even add new effects to weapons or add 4 or 5 star weapons and stack more effects without every weapon just becoming even more ridiculous?
---
With the way the game is designed now enemies are way too easy and the game rewards playstyles that infinitely boost damage, so base  high damage weapons like gauss rifles have the most potential to be broken since they can keep multiplying there damage with more effects.
---
The less accurate you need to be and the more times you can hit in a row the more broken your weapon is, also high base damage weapons just break all the PVE/PVP fights when it comes to choosing lesser weapons and builds.
---
Everything needs to be brought into a certain damage threshold based on Fire Rate. I understand why gauss rifles were high damage since they take some skill to use in comparison to a tesla rifle in pvp. 
---
However when it comes to picking the highest damage weapon that can get the most broken boosts, the highest base damage outshines the rest and would eventually descend into godhood with 4 or 5 star versions. We all knew this nerf was coming.
---
I got mine a while back but since i heard it‚Äôs non repairable, I haven‚Äôt use it yet.
---
As long as we're in a correcting mood...
---
Muffled is completely pointless with Escape Artist. I don't mean figuratively, Muffled reduces movement noise while Escape Artist eliminates it completely.
---
Secret Service armor currently lacks several mods and is getting closer to a complete suite every patch, it having Shadowed or not is a hypothetical at this point.
---
The Improved Sneaking legendary("harder to detect while sneaking") doesn't stack, so Thorn armor having it as a set bonus means being supposedly impossible to roll for is a further buff to the armor because that would mean there's less chances of a literally useless effect on your roll(I'm looking at you, Stalker's Switchblade that Earle keeps dropping!).
---
Fixer outclasses every non-legacy rifle. In semiauto it's fire rate still gives it the edge. If it was only about the per shot damage, Dragon would be king and both gauss and lever would be competitive but they're not.
---
I remembered the stats of the Sheepsquatch Staff incorrectly, yes.
---
What do I want? A transmog option would be pretty cool. If I could have a B2525 Fixer look and sound like a Radium Rifle I would be VERY happy. That, and, OR a niche for all the currently inferior weapons to shine.
---
A wizard did it
---
Thank you for sharing that info I‚Äôll definitely give it a try!
---
sadly everything i said stands.  research the "Great Depression" and the ramifications of every U.S. bank panic, recession, and monetary crisis since the creation of the FED at Jekyll Island.  people in every developed country are about to learn exactly what i am talking about
---
Ill probably just use the perk points ones
---
That's exactly what I'm gonna go for; probably gonna get multiple of those over time to take at the very least endurance and strength to max. As a tank/support character having all the health I can get and strength perks for melee/heavy weapon abilities is far superior to most of the other legendary perks. I also plan on getting Taking one for the team as well at some point since that's a no brainer for a beefy tank build.
---
Oh yeah, you know when it's about to go down. It's not your PC, don't you worry about thatüò¢ It is what it is unfortunately...
---
Sorry i was at School I‚Äôll be on in about a hour at most
---
So you're not bloodied and want it nerfed, mind your own bloodied business then!
---
Agreed. It positively boggles me that they all have the same fire rate.
---
Arent you whining about something right now?
---
Not intended, just laughing at childish adults.
---
That's a good shout, just would involve another re-arrange of my perk points and really don't fancy doing it for the 4th time
---
It's dumb, apparently all the left handed gloves got burned up during the nukes and only right handed gloves were immune.
---
Not to mention some of the hairstyles are downright bizarre. Like, I‚Äôve never seen anyone, not even an npc with some of the weirder ones.
---
I'm a lvl 121 bloodied unarmed build, I still do my best to kill as many wendigos as possible and sometimes will even take a high jump and punch Earl in one of his faces. Sure, I usually die right after, but it's still fun. lol
---
It's not in the PTS right now, so whatever it is we'll probably test it for Patch 23 after One Wasteland comes out in September.
---
I really hope it's not another limited time event though...
---
No, and from screenshots it appers to be like Cattleprod and Gauntlet: inferior versions of existing weapons because:
---
You can still braid the body the other tunnel opens up go back down that way
---
I didn't even realize apparently I have a magic weapon too? A J/33/25 handmade. 
---
But I don't feel like I get magic damage from it. Against Earl I come out the gate doing about 45 damage per shot to his head (if I'm in stealth). Once I get my adrenaline and gun Fu topped out, I can get up to 125ish per shot but that takes a lot of effort and the right circumstances.
---
* 1 Rank Master Infiltrator
---
* 1 Rank Far Flung Fireworks
---
* Max Follow Through as far as I can
---
I'll save SPECIAL buffs for later on. Nothing else really interests me among the Legendary perks, but I know I'll always use stealth and ranged combat no matter how I swap my build, so I figure those are safe bets.
---
/notifiesFBI
---
I would install a piano right beneath the hatch, so every time i use it to enter my camp, i would land directly on a piano. Ou, and a fire extinguisher next to it.
---
Emote !
---
I have another idea for a post about this, but I'm getting a lot of shit as it is tonight so I might hang o to that till another night!
---
But yeah I agree, I use flamer and a shredding minigun on my raider build. Even with max gunsmith and weapon artisan for 200% condition, they both break incredibly quickly.
---
The shredder can't even clear the golf club before it breaks.
---
I dont ofter hear people talk on ps4 tho
---
And i played since beta
---
I follow them around and angry react if they leave my doors open
---
Omg me lol
---
Nice I hear ya man. Hm that's weird. Most of the time splash damage from explosive bullets can do it without fireproof I'm pretty sure
---
Everybody's doing their own thing usually, even in public groups people usually stick to their own tasks and just enjoy the perks of being in a group like the xp boost, free caps, and free fast travel to eachothers camps/vendors 
---
During public events is when the most multiplayer stuff actually happens, just make sure you're contributing to the objectives and you'll be fine 
---
You shouldn't be targeted for PvP unless you take over a workshop or something
---
Or very simply they could be dual-wielded.
---
Nah just buy my shit everything is 25 caps, ultracite jet pack to metal building set
---
who tf using nocturnal builds anyway ? ü•¥ take you and your .000000003% of ‚Äúnocturnal‚Äù build players issues else where ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Same with the harness underarmor for women. Just looks trashy as hell with the bra strap. 
---
I assume that the undergarments are basically painted on the character skin, so removing them isn't an option. Looks bad, though.
---
There are only 2 to maybe three if you count a atom shop skin. Prime barrel makes your ammo cost a violet flux and you get about 100 more per craft. Damage is good but it‚Äôs not as efficient as a lot of ultracite compared to normal ammo usually is. Heavy barrel increases damage  too. Always use the heavy and the prime if you have the violet flux. Other then that it only has one skin a gold atom shop one which is weird because of how popular a weapon it is.
---
Sometimes, but sometimes I open all my locked doors and show them around and they buy my stuff from the vendors so I can't complain. One time I had a guy jumping in front of my window and I just stared at him from the other side, that was pretty awkward
---
Just leave me roughly 6 wendigos per minute so I can max out Adrenaline.ü§£
---
Pretty sure you get it from the main quest don't you? Or did I just get super lucky with mine?
---
I play on pc though, and I can probobly just google how to use it. I was thinking more of the social rules and atuff
---
I‚Äôve never got it... I‚Äôve done it about 15 times, latching my own nuke it on twice and not got it
---
Y u down vote
---
I don't really mind the underwear being on the harness, it fits what the outfit is I think
---
Probably would be better if they have girls a tank top or something for it tho
---
But with costumes like the grognak outfits it really stands out lol
---
Or the swimsuit, I don't get why that has a bra strap either lol
---
They were taking a concerted effort to kill her, and repeatedly gave a thumbs down at the poor cow.
---
Oh dang I thought it was a guaranteed drop. Sorry man
---
Dont know what you mean
---
If you're available, I'm off work early today, I can get on anytime
---
You disgust me
---
I‚Äôm just going to check if I can actually build it and I‚Äôm just being a twat or not
---
It isn't "obvious". It's only "obvious" to a grass. Grasses will report it even when it does not affect them. SOme people do not want to devote significant portions of their game gathering the ingredients to make ammo, and the munitions factory is woefully inadequate. The Armco is a joke and the ammo converter is an abomination. I would rather spend my time expending ammo rather than collecting it, so I am fine with the ammo factories. 
---
In my neighbourhood, snitches get stitches.

You also disgust me.
---
Can find it on top of west tek 100% of the time
---
I would guess probably not.  I don't think these events have been done before, but I don't know why they would remove community rewards. I mean, the whole event isn't over for another month I think.  So you should be good in that timeframe for sure.
---
I have a stalkers explosive fixer. Only messed with it recently. But I don‚Äôt know what perks to equip for it to see full dam.  I‚Äôm guessing commando perks.
---
Yeah, I don't have any bad experiece with that, I got shot on once by another new player when I was lvl 5 or something, but I just ran away and he just gave up.
---
Sounds like the cow did something to them. Maybe blocked an entry?
---
I regret learning the plan because it diluted my drop pool with weapons I don't want. And can't trade.
---
Check out the wiki. 
---
Mini sheepsquatch plushie.
---
Cool well enjoy your temp bans if I roll into  your neighborhood. It's literally steel, lead, and gunpowder; both easy to get. Nah, you can die on this hill "grass"
---
Oh my god I have it.... I‚Äôm so stupid. Thanks..
---
i only just recently started playing again after not playing for a long time (before any actual npcs were in the game) and i remembered that supply drops were a good way to get decent loot quickly and early on. i still don‚Äôt have any idea what could be wrong cause any glitch post i‚Äôve seen is from a year or 2 ago, hopefully it‚Äôll either be fixed soon or my luck will get better soon
---
This can not be upvoted enough.
---
I sell for between 10 and 15, depending on the drink, but I sell alcohol as part of a themed vendor. I don't expect to make many sales, I just like the idea of people checking the vendor and seeing lots of Vodka and White Russians for sale in a camp with an exterior loosely inspired by the Kremlin. (this game needs green roofs!)
---
I did have someone buy my "Nuke Cola - My Blood Is In It" for 666 caps once. I did that as a joke but it payed off nicely! :)
---
Not sure how they will do it for 76, but for Elder Scrolls Online all mobs are the highest level, but they just give buffs to low levels to equal it out. A max level char will still do much more damage due to skills and stuff however.
---
Sheepsquatch Plushie. :)

Maybe if y'all shut my doors you heathens I wouldn't have to

Yeah, sorry, I know how to use them (had to google what it meant), but I wrote something about the headset in a comment in another thread and forgot that I dident mention it here. So I get why it don't make sence. But yeah, I know how to use then, but still feel wierd about it.
---
I've had two from the machine at the Rusty Puck.
---
I forgot to include shotguns. Well, I think shotguns have the opposite version of the same issue: a definitive worst in class. There's niches and situational reasons to use Gauss, Combat, and Double Barrel, but the Pump Action is objectively and subjectively inferior. Even it's sole unique benefit under ideal conditions(the lightning quick single shell reload when stacking all reload bonuses) is of questionable value with it's low fire rate cap.
---
I built a big explorable camp on the Cliffside and I just stand on the roof invis
---
Now *that* is some interesting information. I appreciate you chiming in. With all of the novelty of good ol' Earle lately, has your SBQ farming platform been nuked recently (like since the past patch)? Maybe this whole situation is a recently introduced defect!
---
When doing events and fighting legendary Creatures with groups of people get your hit in but don't try and take him out until everyone has got there hit in to so they can also get the rewards
---
I'm proud of my camp design.  I put too much time into it, LOL.  I really think it's better a night with the careful light placement.  Sometimes if someone shows up just before I log out, I'll chill for a few minutes and let them look around.  I have a good tower build off the base of a cliff and a decrepit old camping ground.  A deathclaw pet paroles the grounds too.  :)  
---
But TBH, I have a little perch on top of a flamingo on a patio umbrella on the fourth floor I usual crouch upon and let chameleon take over while they check it out.
---
The unwritten codes
---
When encountering a player. Wave emote at them
---
At uranium fever don't be the asshat who 1 shots the legendary enemies
---
If you accidentally shoot a player by accident, put your weapon away and either wave or use the sorry emote. Usually that's enough to subdue the player and they know it was an accident ( doesn't work about 15% of the time)
---
My doors were closed, I read all the documents on computer, then put in fuse, read documents, then analyzed and worked, it stopped my about two hours no joke, glad the fix was here, thanks!
---
Taking one for the Team because weapon damage specific perks to me are a waste of a perk slot that I can be using for something more beneficial.
---
I think Luck stat increases chances. I‚Äôm running bloodied build with unyielding armor and I get them quite a bit.
---
Thanks, now all i need to do is find the plan for a mat
---
Somebody told me its based on your luck, I don't know if it's true (haven't tried it yet and my base luck is low) but you can try that with a piece of unyielding armor and some food/chems buff.
---
I didn't?
---
They‚Äôre killing me with these plushies. Gotta have em all!
---
are you high health or low health build? do you use scopes and sniper rifles or full auto rifles? do you mainly use power armor or not? vats or no vats?
---
They‚Äôre client-side predictive, and not very good at that. I can think of several situations off the top of my head where they lie.
---
Hell I can even think of a few cases where the Pip-boy numbers lie! Although it‚Äôs far more trustworthy than the damage numbers.
---
I like it this way. I am the only one who wears it.
---
Ohh some one apparently someone doesn't like me lol
---
&gt;Sorry but i know enough about the game to know what i am talking about
---
don't mean to be a D although I certainly come across one, but you don't. no one who says gauss rifles are op do. check captainoob's queen tested videos to see how terribly op gauss rifles are. spoiler: they're not. they're one of the worst weapons in the game. all bolt rifles are.
---
&gt;You pretend that one shotting everything but non-bosses is not broken
---
it's not. that's what progression means. I play to get stronger, not weaker. the whole idea is wasting less resources so I can put that part of the game behind me. not to mention that's how it worked in past Bethesda games. at the very least it's subjective, and I never claimed otherwise.
---
and based off the previous quote what I'm getting is that you think not even bolt rifles should be able to one shot trash mobs, which is just laughable.
---
&gt;Also notice you don't even address that bloody unyielding is way above all other builds
---
you never brought that up, that's why I never addressed it. first, bloodied and unyielding are two different things. bloodied excels at what it's supposed to, damage. or do you think medic's should be able to output the same damage?
---
and the special bonuses from unyielding are hardly game breaking. I've had this discussion before, but who in their right mind would make a build dedicated to speech checks? just so you can hear an alternative line for yes? the majority of checks in wastelanders are there just to give you the illusion of choice. and nothing's stopping you from respeccing charisma points later on.
---
except for melee builds (which now will have no option *but* to use unyielding gear, so in this regard the point you're trying to make backfires hard), special doesn't do much for the average player. it gives you extra carry weight and more experience, which is nice I guess. but vats accuracy is dictated mainly by your weapon's range and you can sneak just as well, if not better with a chameleon set. and you can get ap refresh with that as well.
---
and let's not forget that PA essentially gives you a bonus 100 carry weight for free, on top of massively reducing incoming damage compared to any set of regular armor. plus radiation damage reduction. people always complain about unyielding but what does it do, really? make you better at what you already excel at? wow.
---
but I guess next you're gonna tell me that making hacking terminals easier is unacceptable and 'hard to design content for'.
---
&gt;pvp
---
who cares about pvp? that's a terrible metric. not even Bethesda does.
---
Because the damage numbers don't show the correct damage in many circumstances.
---
Earle always seems to target the highest damage-dealing players which is usually me. He doesn‚Äôt go after low-levels with pipe pistols usually. Only the normal Wendigos do and although they have high health, at least they don‚Äôt do *that* much damage. I did A Colossal Problem with my level 30 boyfriend and he went around reviving everyone including me and it was great
---
I guess you could say you were screwed.
---
Stealth works in groups just fine. Whoever told you it didn't is an \*\*\*\*\*.
---
Same here put few point in strength so don't have to keep swapping the carry weight perks in and out and the ammo crafting one.
---
I like he doors to be open, if someone closed it i will open it.
---
I want a free balling mod.
---
Okay well what about time to kill? I haven't rigorously tested, but with the wendigos, it takes me 2-3 times longer to kill them if I am in danger.
---
there is a formula to its drop chance  *chance*=((*luck*√ó4)+*attempts)/20*
---
thanks for replies btw i think it looks fucking delicious what about you guys
---
if you‚Äôre on xbox i would love to come visit!
---
Just asking somebody had posted something like that last night on the f76 thread.thought maybe that's why I havent had them drop again
---
But I thought this game was about shooting green people with glowing dogs
---
Just don't join a team, but also don't not join NW because of players like this, the easy challenges are well worth doing. I don't play NW and I do this all the time but got into the habit of not joining a team. I also never have audio turned off for players for this reason, I never have to listen to any insults .. let them blabber away all they want.
---
Ah, ok, thanks man
---
I‚Äôve been enjoying a non PA heavy build. If I need the extra damage I have PA
---
dont it look tasty tho
---
Yeah turn off the fill team option and you can just do what ever you want without worrying about others (except that they all want to kill you, lol).
---
thanks but dont it look tasty
---
fed76 is a good tool to check out also
---
Trade it now for any usable weapon, armor, or rare outfit. Whatever the best offer you get. People are being incredibly irrational and impatient while trading for these. This will not be a rare commodity very soon.
---
That's what I believe at least, based on my anecdotal experience. I just don't get why I see so many people saying it doesn't.
---
Is it just one of those hearsay things that just catch on? Or did someone do some testing and showed evidence?
---
Because none of y'all motherfuckers close doors!
---
***"IT'S OVER SHROUD! I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND!"***
---
Oh yeah, I bought one for the collection for 200 caps and that's the cheapest I've ever seen it üòÇ it looks awesome on my stand with a handmade gift
---
Not going to happen, as this gating keeps you coming back daily.
---
Why noy mini nukes?
---
Appreciate the heads up ...
---
It's a great spot! I recently recommended a friend move up to around the same area (he's south of the train station and north of the giant water station / coal train). He's having the same problem, too. Feels bad, brah.
---
I get some pretty decent vendor foot traffic from all levels there, too. I think lower level people (I suspect anyone who buys mounted bug heads is a lowbie, lol) are up there with the Rosie quest lines. Higher level people are using me as a waypoint to Crater or after ACP fights. 
---
All are welcome at The Big Pharma to peruse the collection of serums, chems, Junkie weapons, and ammo!
---
Isn't it a guaranteed drop once you drop a nuke for the first time ? It just adds it to your notes, you don't actually get it from the SBQ.
---
Does that mean that with the PTS damage changes they will be more reliable and accurate?
---
I said fat man in the main post, but it's easy to miss.
---
Yea, just hearsay. And the first time i hear about this btw. I have well over 2000h on this game (most as stealth commando) since launch of it and i can assure you it works.
---
I don't know.  I just know people say the numbers are not accurate all the time for one reason or another.
---
Yes I did not I only got the other dudes joke
---
Same here. Usually when I'm in the middle of combat, both in PvP and PvE. Everything freezes, controller starts endlessly vibrating, and my audio gets fucked up. I either have a blue screen or have to do a hard reboot.
---
I would recommend testing it
---
Just a quick addition that if you never plan to do PvP or want to avoid mentioned accidental shots just turn on a pacifist mode on settings.
---
you should work on that reading comprehension my man
---
Taking one for the team (because  I'm a big team player), funky duds (because F88k stingwings) and then bonuses two four of my six SPECIAL so my main account can truly be 'all in wonder' being able to effectively use any build style. Ammo factory is benig fully invested into on an alt - that way I can transfer materials and then make the most of the ammo making  on the account.
---
Damage numbers shown aren't accurate, I would know because of my experience in teams . Things are easier to kill alone than with my buddies
---
Haha I doubt it! In fact pip-boy is even more broken on the PTS- energy weapons only ever show their base damage before perks, mutations, and legendary effects. That‚Äôs about the only case where the combat numbers are better than the pip boy, because the combat numbers still show ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.
---
You mean the 60 sec wait? It‚Äôs apparently intentional and won‚Äôt be fixed.
---
It's already listed most of its value, it's worth maybe a few thousand caps.
---
Gatling Laser you say?  Probably Brotherhood.  Scoundrels.  They must all die.
---
God bless you
---
I just wave at them then act like they're not there and hope they go away.
---
it only works with high rate of fire weapons. handmades don't make the cut. it's also tied with your framerate, apparently.
---
but I guess a faster fire rate handmade could maybe trigger magic damage on PC, assuming your framerate is unlocked.
---
Yeah but you just have anecdotal evidence, and I just have anecdotal evidence, and we're both in contradiction to each other. 
---
It takes less time to kill enemies if I am hidden, regardless of whether I'm solo or on a team, than it does if I'm in danger.
---
If a legitimate Tesla is able to kill you so quickly, esp with the amount of HP you already have, something else is the problem here. Because I can tank legitimate Teslas with half of that HP.
---
Reading this, I am now tempted to build a house of nothing but level 0 locked doors without doorframes, just to see how long it takes to get them all picked. Maybe add a box with a laser/flamethrower trap JUST to grief clowns that use exploits to walk thru walls.
---
Thinking of how these Fallout social conventions would work out in real life.
---
&lt;walks into neighbor‚Äôs open garage, starts using drill press.&gt;
---
&lt;neighbor steps in from the house&gt;
---
&lt;give enthusiastic wave, go back to work on drill press&gt;
---
&lt;neighbor shoots at my feet with explosive bullets&gt;
---
‚ÄúOh, he wants my attention - he probably wants to trade!‚Äù
---
Whait, there is an ctual chance of getting the pie!
---
Its just a bug that can happen when a player leaves a session for whatever reason.
---
I'd stop complaining. You're getting a magic weapon. Use it wisely until they figure out how to fix it.
---
I switched accounts between xboxes, and that fixed it, and it stayed fixed when I switched back--both xboxes on wifi (not sure that helps anyone with only one console)
---
LOL Thank you for the laugh!
---
Can confirm that this is not correct. I tried 10 different server hops. Public &amp; private and never seen one on westek roof by the painting that everyone says is there. Have 4 now. 2 from Rusty Pick and others from random diner doofers.
---
Who‚Äôs post you callin pointless and inane.
---
I saw a scam camp once, and they were in artillery range. The asshole left as soon as he saw blue smoke
---
Depending of your build, I would recommend trying to get a good weapon for it  
---
bloodied/Junkies/whatever suits you.  
---
I would skip the armor, since both the secret service and t65 power armor are the best choices, and you can "craft" them for 50 legendary scripts a piece.
---
I call those Gulper hotpockets
---
Reporting solves nothing.
---
I think it does work last time I used it still added damage
---
I'm serious, they were delicious, but now i'm too lazy and i made a mess in my kitchen
---
You're a commando build , I'm a rifleman. You dish out dps faster for you to actually notice anything and on top your buddies attack the tankier targets than you so your lack of damage is made up for easily
---
No offense.
---
I was really interested in Cleave. Not as interesting knowing I have to VATS. Most definitely taking Strength perks. I like master infiltrator but not sure I‚Äôll snag it.
---
I want one of those Surface to Air turrets at my base. I don't care if it takes up 50% of my budget. Gimmie Gimmie.
---
I don‚Äôt want it so I can complain all I want. I rather have a gun that has better prefixes and I don‚Äôt care to shits about magic weapons I have plenty and never use them.
---
Ok maybe i put pig salame instead of gutting lizards, i'm sorry
---
There is one on nexus but it's not what I'm looking for here lol
---
Oh, absolutely.
---
"Better Prefixes" than the one than can instagib the SBQ?
---
This happens elsewhere not just meat week. During SBQ there‚Äôs always a few naked players standing there fearlessly.
---
Really? I've gotten one every time
---
Yeah but I have to many magic weapons and I don‚Äôt use them. I have a shotgun and a mini gun with it and I‚Äôm good.
---
I‚Äôve got a few of the outfit (no hat). and I can be on for at least a bit right now, if you‚Äôre available
---
If your couch is anything like mine...it will require legendary effects to get me off it.
---
Yes please.  Ignore all the current in game bugs and work on this instead because currently it's impossible to get on your roof with a jetpack.  /s
---
Are you monopolising on that critical damage? 
---
Better criticals, Eagle eyes and 50 vats critical stacks . If not, then you won't get results
---
Thanks for confirming it :)
---
I think i have like 800 notes after meat week.
---
Legacy weapons benefit from demolition expert. There are several videos testing it on youtube.
---
Someone said that the damage numbers don't reflect this, but it still works if you compare it on health bars. I don't know if this is true or not as i have not tested it myself.
---
EDIT: This is a post about this subject from 3 months back, there is someone explaining how it works on the comments  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gjfduh/questions\_about\_the\_explosive\_legacy\_energy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gjfduh/questions_about_the_explosive_legacy_energy/)
---
No there is a bug that happens. When you respawn you get stuck at a point where you are told to fast travel but cant. Sometimes when you die you are also stuck and cant be revived or respawned. It has has happened to me 4times today
---
I was looking for one a long time ago and read the westek roof was a good spot but genuinely never seen one there.
---
Yes I'm aware. B2525 is still levels better especially against earl, dps is much better.
---
no the one when you die you can¬¥t join the event back
---
Herbivore with Cran Relish wearing off?
---
I know it takes less than a quarter of a magazine to kill a wendigo when I'm hidden and it takes almost a full magazine to kill one when I'm detected....
---
That means stealth damage is working even in a group. It doesn't matter about DPS, there is a very clear distinction.
---
Well I‚Äôm not one to do that. So i again don‚Äôt want it. I‚Äôm not a dick and insta kill a boss while everyone else can‚Äôt get hits in. And if I go against a boss on private server I rather have a challenge
---
ha  ha
---
Aw man how could that sweet old lady lie to me? With that sweet voice?
---
Strange in Numbers
---
[according to dr google it‚Äôs an issue with our console](https://support.playstation.com/s/article/CE-34878-0?language=en_US)
---
you can't buy the tiles until you have bullion later on, and max rep with the settlers.
---
I usually just ignore them.
---
Oh i see, yes happened to me once, just like the one in Encryptid. Death cam circles around my body but can‚Äôt press any button.
---
Try doing it in a group and trying doing it alone (the event) . It doesn't matter about being detected or hidden
---
I constantly wear 1 of them but honestly I dont know what I would want for as a trade u know.?that miner mask is cool looking but in time I'll have that.so weapons?
---
So i have to choose a side 1st?
---
I lose so much carry weight when I jump into power armor that it is basically unusable for me. My chemist backpack allows me to carry hundreds of stimpacks and radaways and my unyielding gear boosts my strength more than the boost from PA, so yeah Chinese stealth suit is still the only option for me since I can keep my backpack on.
---
My main account has this issue but my alt doesn't. Hmm.
---
Yeah that's what he means. It is very frustrating and it seems to happen alot more recently:)
---
Yes.  I would recommend raiders, but your choice
---
So then you're agreeing with me that stealth works, you're just saying damage numbers are wrong.
---
I tested a handful of handmades I have against Earle.
---
piercing magazines do nothing. explosive ones also deal 0 splash damage, although that may be just a visual bug.
---
dealing around 120 damage per head shot with a bloodied one. 200 crit. 250 with a b50 handmade. all sneak shots.
---
although crits don't register? again, could be just a visual bug. but I keep seeing '120' instead of '250' whenever I crit him.
---
Brahmin at Flatwoods, Wayward, Foundation and Free Range don‚Äôt cost a lot of camp budget.
---
Ok, cheers.
---
Maybe the brotherhood gains access to the silos and gets a little overzealous in launching nukes.
---
Apart from what others mentioned I can add from my experience. Not saying it's an absolute truth, but it's your choice to listen or not. So if there's something unlocked in someone's camp like purified water, resources, ammo, etc be careful and always watch what it says "steal" or "take". If it's steal it's usually red, better not touch it, if it's take then it's left intentionally for free and you can help yourself.
---
If you're at someone's camp and there are other people at their vendor please wait a minute until their done and go to the vendor they've used to avoid "cutting the line". It's just a courtesy, if you take like 10 seconds to browse and leave it's fine, but if you're like me and take time to decide, read, etc then be polite and wait your turn xD at least it's what I do and I wish others would do so as well.
---
Try not to block interactable objects with your character unless it's for a reason. You probably noticed if someone's standing next to an object you want to interact with it's nearly impossible to do as the button "invite/join team" blocks it.
---
Can't really think of something else that wasn't mentioned already. Hope it helps :)
---
It's annoying to travel over there.  Over all it's not a big deal.
---
Which level of Gunsmith?
---
Well, lucky you :-)
---
What about this fight is challenging? Bullet sponge with 1 mechanic ‚â† challenge, just time consuming
---
Thanks üòä
---
I got it in Fallout 4, once. Looks good, too, for a 210 year old piece of pie.
---
Ya the game definetly bugs out in the event sometimes but ya the b50 is definetly still solid for it!
---
If he's trying to get the tiles why would he side with raiders?
---
I‚Äôm on PlayStation, but I‚Äôd love to have you visit if you could!
---
But why build a camp to jot let other players see it?  Thats the beat things about camps is seeing the detail players put into themm
---
Herd Mentality?
---
The head is a small target
---
YeP.  Not going to find a stranger willing to go through this...at least not easily.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
They should add a target dummy as a camp item that tells you how much damage you actually do per shot/hit or have a few 1 with 0 dr/er 1 with the same dr/er of an assaultron and 1 with the same dr/er as the SBQ
---
Thanks. This is good to know.
---
I just started hearing it, but like reading through comments you'll just get someone casually bringing it up like it's fact haha.
---
Everyone just says "it doesn't work, the numbers are lying" 
---
I haven't had a change with my stealth commando at all, and I'm at about the same amount of playtime as you.
---
I would wait till mid September with that update, the game will become much more enjoyable.
---
No worries, I‚Äôll be free by the time you get off, let me know when you‚Äôre on, my PSN is Mealdiamond
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/Z9kPC1O
---
Headshots have always been harder to hit in vats in all fallout games. Smaller target, harder to hit but more damage.
---
Been testing heavy weapons lately and it seems like the Je gat plas is my go to for insane damage. 
---
The splash damage is what gets him the most literally shoot between his legs at his feet then it‚Äôs a GG for earl 
---
Fastest time I dropped him was in 48 seconds so basically almost a min
---
Ps. I apologize to the people who are in the event when Explosive gatling Plasma go off...
---
Edit: I have also tried a Explosive Cryo and it seems that he‚Äôs immune to being frozen
---
That's what I read almost every patch but it's just the same.
---
Will do
---
Try killing a tanky enemy by yourself and note the amount of bullets used. Then do the same while it is aggro by a team mate or something and note the bullets used.
---
It's pretty good now
---
But how would you get out?
---
Sorry, what update? And whats so great about it? genuinly asking
---
Man, that sucks.
---
Isn't it ugly to be making deals on someone else's post?  And if you better publicize what you buy instead of stealing deals from others?
---
I don't think the tiles are worth it, that's why I said it was his Choice
---
Max
---
I couldn't help but hear Skeletor when I read that and I don't think I could read it in any other voice again.
---
You don‚Äôt have much experience with older people I see
---
Have you rested?
---
Trying to group what I saw:
---
*Events/Hunting:*  
---
\- try to let everyone tag a legendary, so you can all get the item it drops  
---
\- if you can, try to do the objective (collect the items, repair the generator)
---
*C.A.M.P./Vendor:*  
---
\- try to treat another man's home like your own  
---
\- don't try to steal stuff, will end badly for you  
---
\- don't trap players in your homes (self-explaintory)  
---
\- price your items reasonably (ammo mostly 1-2 caps, weapons for fed value or script value)
---
*General:*  
---
\- wave/waveback if you see players- don't blast music loudly over your speakers in events (yeah, meat week was fun)  
---
\- don't be a stranger to stimpack a downed player, especially in events  
---
\- don't steal others "dead belongings" unless they absolutely deserve it  
---
\- if your build allows it, bring some shared perks into groups (even if it is only a "radicool" or "inspirational"  
---
\- keep your "vault tec launchboxes" for important events (for me it's mostly ACP)  
---
\- try not to steal others workshops, or be prepared to fight them over it
---
Damn.there is a sub reddit for selling and trading  but getting any decent piece for caps might be a little hard.hope some one comes through for you
---
Ugh
---
Also food buffs don‚Äôt stack so it should just be 30 pounds.
---
I personally like my camp spot under the rail bridge where the proto scorchbeast is pinned to the cliff. It's quiet, on Graham's route, on water and is close enough go top of the world to get traffic but not where everyone else has their camp.
---
Looks to me the difference isn‚Äôt worth using 5 perk points for...
---
Yeah but this is bringing balence changes, eliminating the horrible gaps of leveling by scaling to you individually.
---
For me? To prevent griefers or people seeking revenge from destroying too much.
---
It's called One Wasteland, it's like One Tamirel was for ESO, it's basically making it so every enemy scales to you individually.
---
Waste want not not
---
He/she said they have TWO jackets available. Surely you aren't going to buy both of them. üôÑ
---
I don't have a time frame yet but it is still being worked on.
---
I mean, this was a very short test, but over all, after thousands of shots...
---
No I'm on xbox!
---
This should be a priority. I'd rather lose my magic hunters bash damage lmg that does more damage to a boss than a damn legacy...its insane
---
I just agro all the wendigo spawns on me and move to the other side of the area so everyone else can focus on the colossus.
---
Have you not thought that the other will keep it?  and will not sell it?
---
Was that you that dropped 40 pork and beans at my CAMP two nights ago??
---
GOOD IDEA
---
There's one on ebay.   Not my auction.
---
Tried this as well q exp cryolater...no dice
---
The other day I was in an office supplies store and they had a stack of wooden clipboards. The first thing my mind went to was, "I need those for springs!"
---
I have gunsmith at max rank. And there are times I forget to put it back if I‚Äôve done a lot of crafting and my guns definitly break faster. 
---
It works.
---
How would I know their intentions? That's why I asked.
---
I can remind them that players would like more hairstyles.
---
Sounds cool I guess but we still lack any meaningful endgame. We need proper dungeons with loot tables.
---
I haven't but some one will flag this post, can't trade on here. 
---
I would say you are looking for 10-20k for a Gatling gun.
---
I seen some traded for legacy's now is the time.every day more and more will flood the market
---
Oh yeah! It's also adding things called Daily Ops that are dungeons.
---
Sure, but when someone is convinced it doesn't because it "feels the same" Science! comes to the rescue
---

---
 &gt; I can remind them that players would like more hairstyles.
---
There is a balancing update coming which should improve enemy scaling along with new content for the Brotherhood of Steel which is a fan favorite faction from the previous games. However, the game is much better than it was at launch and there has been new content added that makes it more interesting. There are absolutely still bugs and they will never fix all of them and will likely introduce more with the new update but overall things have improved.
---
The bottom line, play it and don't get too hung up on what people on the internet tell you. Make your own decision on the game.
---
Nice! I heard the some of the explosive gats do insane splash damage when u shot at the ground next to it.
---
Fast travel out
---
Is there a way I can get this to use as a loading screen
---
I'll raise this and see what the intension is.
---
I gotta be honest, taking a donkey kick from Earles weird hooved chicken legs to the face seems like a melee right of passage.
---
I'll have to check it out thanks.
---
Oh I know.

---
 &gt; I'll raise this and see what the intension is.

yeah :)
---
Beth would need to fix these issues first...might be a while
---
Still need help?
---
So we balance things by moving Earle to Whitesprings so you can farm all the ghouls for their nuke drops right?
---
And also because nuking a elitist golf course just feels *right* yknow
---
Fantastic song choice!
---
As long as you don't take the deal from me, do what you want, but it would be logical that if he has 2, one would keep it so as not to be left without any
---
Just get Lou to do it. If he can blast in to a sealed vault, a collapsed mine should be pretty easy.
---
I don‚Äôt really care about getting flagged on reddit I barley use so it‚Äôs fine, and yess that‚Äôs why I said 8000 or more cuz I have around 10k or more caps

Anyone that wants to do a colossal problem I‚Äôm taking request 3:50pm - 5:00pm central time

Thank you!!! I hate that bitch with her stupid church and hordes.. Thank you for saving my sanity.

I respawned at forest area while escaping from the cave lol.

COW (milk &amp; fert) &gt; chicken coop (fert and **NO EGGS** [missed opportunity])

***YA GOT BEANED***
---
You need the 5 to get the best weapon possible. I have a 5 for crafting, and a 2 for shooting. That's a lot of perk points invested, but I feel it's paid off.
---
I understand that, but is that a normal percentage difference to have or do I just have a poor build?
---
What is fashion without hair options
---
Ehh if you wanna do that testing and then come back with the numbers, go for it. I'm not that one that thinks it doesn't work.
---
I'm starting to suspect bethesda don't know how to fix "magic" weapons like shown in the clip. Like they don't know how to fix fast travel and other bugs that have been in game over a year. The "magic" effect rely heavily on your latency and can therefore can be difficult thing to fix. And i see more and more people using them when the damage nerfs eventually hit live. Really a sad thing..
---
The only reason i have a lockable door is if I'm crafting ultracite plasma or fusion cores I dump all the full or 75%+ cores cause the workbench will use the full cores first and i don't want some player checking out my camp to find a bag full of cores.  Other then that the door stays open
---
Like I don't know what's in ammunition. You can't "die" here, though you may need to change your name and use a VPN. I'm telling mom! jamtart.
---
Honestly, the impact of side with one faction vs the other is not that big. I went raiders and was able to get both to max rep around the same time (maybe 1 day apart).
---
Understandable but I'm not sure if the game is built to handle that. The clipping!
---
Yes, there are perks to reduce them, you can also eventually farm them very easilym
---
Whatever dude, enjoy your bans
---
If Big Gun perks affected the wouldn't that render Demolition Expert useless though?
---
The 200% repair perk is just as good and you only need it on when you repair
---
They are going away in a soon to come patch.  So you will not have to worry about them anymore.  You will only need to eat to get food buffs.
---
I play on PC with mouse and keyboard so I can't answer your other question.  Sorry.
---
I just heart them up and down the pike lol
---
Why'd you do that when the purveyor sale is on the way? You coulda gotten 16 stalker weapons and 2 nocturnal
---
no perk to make it go away but supposedly they're removing the penalties from not eating or drinking. it'll probably take a while, though.
---
there are perks to reduce the rate at which the bars deplete but it's a waste. set up a dozen water purifiers in your camp and you'll have enough water to last you a lifetime. get the carnivore or herbivore mutation and you'll be able to source food as you go.
---
by doing those things, the meters become a minor annoyance at worst. can't comment on the shortcuts.
---
Also a visitor just decided to hang out and AFK at my picnic bench, so I joined him. ‚ÄòTwas a great virtual day
---
For me I have calibrated shocks so it adds an extra 100 carry weight onto my PA
---
These are my favourite camps to come across.  The amount of attention some people put in to making it look as ‚Äúreal‚Äù as they can is amazing.
---
I would recommend against reporting people just for killing bosses quickly, with the right chems, food, drink, build, weapon, you can kill bosses almost instantly with legit weapons.  Also, you can hardly report someone for using a magic weapon.  I mean, it's so easy to get them, I legit didn't even realize I was using one.  It's not fair to get reported for doing something unintentionally like using a magic weapon.
---
When you initially contact her in the base game, she reminds me a lot of M.O.T.H.E.R from Venture Bros.
---
I usually grab a workshop with one or two when I'm just running low on materials in general, they are great for just picking a little more stuff up
---
Come to my camp!  Free water and an unlocked collection bot thingy.
---
Still waiting to see someone make just a free standing wall with nothing but a locked door. Just to give visitors the option of making themselves Wanted (there *is* a challenge for killing wanted players).
---
My last camp had a small room with two locked doors and nothing but clown items inside. It was clearly labeled The Naughty Box on the outer wall.
---
I never bothered to think about the numbers as i use concentrated fire perk and therefore i don't really need to worry about that with automatic weapons. One or two misses and i will be at 95% hit chance. But yea, the chance to hit head is way lower.
---
Ooooh, if its OG skeletor that's even better.
---
I second this request!
---
Thank you for running it down- I sure hope it is just a recent defect!
---
Don‚Äôt know when the sale is.
---
They could stack.
---
Well, I ofc find her annoying mainly because of the stupid repetitive lines that even after months after completing her story and removing her from my camp are still ringing in my mind. I like Beckett even tho some of his lines are just as repetitive, but he seems happy and grateful and I enjoyed his questline and his character in general, I also like his commentaries on the landscape when I move my camp. He fits better in camps than Sophia to be honest, he has a bar and you can role play and decorate at will while Sophia even after completing her story is still doing something on her console. It's just my opinion tho, maybe I didn't pay attention in the story, it was just extremely dull for me. Well I also like Beckett more because he's a male character. I wanted to bring other allies, I've found them all, but as far as I know they won't give lover's embrace.

I would love some dread locks (full on predator locks) and some skull ,day of the dead, face paint that be cool
---
I would love to stop by on PS4 sometime! üôè
---
Gauss Minigun loves it's outings into the mine. Plasma Flamer for the kids too. ;)
---
Agreed. But I‚Äôm also just as impressed with creative inventive camps.
---
***DON'T TRY IT***
---
*me groknak, me tries anyway!*
---
What are you talking about? That's pure skill not vats
---
This looks like a combo of hacked weapon and stealth. Earl was still munching on his corpse pile which tell me that everyone in the party was stealthed or far enough away. 
---
Magic weapons don‚Äôt go that fast. Neither do legacy or energy weapons.
---
Thank you. I‚Äôll start scraping the stalkers to be ready then. Lol.
---
Because after a dozen or so runs you'll have way more screws than you'll need.
---
A buddy and i went into that event. Hit the button the clear the entrance but upon going in there was a second wall.  We both said screw it, going to the bathroom. Came back with enough time to get out and got the reward
---
Np it's gonna be a 50% sale I think
---
Tried it many times, Sadly it doesn‚Äôt resolve the issue.
---
Ah ya gauss mini is always a solid choice...as long as u have ammoüòÇ
---
No cause my camp is hidden
---
They will be going away soon. So that won't be much of an issue for longer.
---
No, not really. I just wave &amp; move on with doing whatever I was doing.
---
Because his body is higher up you can really make the *magic* happen on those legs. Plus the splash damage from Explosive, you're not missing!
---
I can‚Äôt select different ammo, It just makes default 10mm
---
Bloodied gauss minigun, I think I may have killed him before others got a chance to hurt him enough... whoops.
---
Nope.  I strip down to my chonies and dance
---
Stealth works fine for me in groups. Things like Encryptid, it makes big difference. I can't say for sure on the SBQ and Earle, but based on the damage numbers it works. I have no way of testing it further. I keep seeing people say the damage numbers are wrong but I have not seen anyone offer any proof other than saying "it takes longer to kill things." I would like to see some data or real testing to back it up. I know that Angry Turtle has done a lot of testing with stealth on his channel and is often in a public team but fighting the SBQ solo and stealth definitely works for him on that situation.
---
No problem I rarely goto anybody‚Äôs camp anymore being half the ppl have the same plans I‚Äôve already learned months and months ago or they have weapons that aren‚Äôt good for way to much. At least on Xbox. Every now and then I goto a camp and see how amazing they built it. And I go back to mine and realize I‚Äôve only really built stuff when it was for atoms or then score lol. Recently I moved my camp and started getting camp bundles/ plans and trying to build up stuff I never had before after seeing others do it
---
Nope.  I strip down to my chonies and dance.
---
I'm going to need to hear about how this "under the graveyard" camp works.
---
The package being under the world makes sense to me. It's often easier to move something than to delete it thanks to how complicated programming can be, so really the activating tombstone prompts would ideally also be underground.
---
I guess they could but then durability should only get a slight buff for balancing purposes. 60% from Heavy Gunner perks plus 60% from Demo Expert would be nuts. Makes sense for explosives damage wise but there'd need to be delicate balancing otherwise the new meta would be SBQ getting nuked into non-existence by 20 bloodied fatmen
---
Only 120lbs? You obviously are not eating enough meat in your diet to get double bonus benefits. When I slam the hot pockets I get much better results.
---
to be honest with you it's a common bug, when characters even with the custom apparel on them appear naked. I have seen it at my friend's camp and I didn't believe him until one day my Beckett was wandering around my camp naked like some lunatic. I checked his inventory and it said he was wearing clothes I gave him but they didn't show. so I redress him like a little kid every once in a while xD
---
And it's a paradox-- if I follow a stranger around in my own home, why do I feel like \*I'm\* the lurker?
---
I use a gauss mini too, it rips him to shreds harder than my uncle ripped me to shreds when I was 8 and no one was watching.
---
Oh no a survival/rpg where you have to eat food? The horror
---
I like it when people drop by, simply because I know it's random. I think I've put some decent work in my camp,and made it looking good. But I'm a little bit off the beaten path, so it's not a highly trafficked area. And I don't have Vendors set up,so I'm not highlighted on the map. So the only way people know I'm there is if I've been in camp long enough to see my map spot in one place,and was interested enough to come see. Or they have simply stumbled across it while exploring Appalachia,so it's like a surprise rest stop for them to refresh. Last visitor was a new level 19 Fire Breather. Showed him the purifiers so he could grab water, gave him some lead from my extractor,he fixed his stuff,rested,retuned and was on his way after a thumbs up!
---
Try powering up Mount Blair some time if you want a junk cannon :)
---
Because using a nuke requires burning a ton of ammo and stimpaks in the launch silos, killing robots who drop meagre rewards and the entire purpose of the game is to have players grind slowly to find stuff, then use it in a orgy of consumption, then flow chart line back to slow finding. It‚Äôs why we keep searching for tiny amounts of typewriters, and crystal and ballistic fibre.
---
You're luckier than me. I did this event a lot and every time it gave me a plushie plan and nothing else xD
---
Moral of the story is never judge a player by their level.
---
It definitely needs well fed! I tried crippling Shotguns on the spawns, but they were still a nuisance, the Plasma Flamer works wonders if you get crowded.
---
It depends which ones.  I'm not going to do that in radiation rumble, for example
---
Yes, even with calibrated shocks on my Excavator, its still not enough to offset it. I could stop carrying so many stimpacks and radaways, and make it better on myself but I like to give them out to new players.
---
Yeah, I thought so. I find from personal experience that critical bonuses are better on high output low for rate weapons.
---
There is only one answer: Ammo Factory
---
You sure that you don't have the herbivore mutation? :)
---
We'll compare this to our studies, thank you!
---
I'm afraid you are wrong. Magic weapons really go that fast. It depends on the weapon and latency.
---
Funniest thing I have seen all day lol
---
K.  Just checked- I do still have it.
---
I know its a throwaway for some people, but ideally, I am looking for a faster swing speed vampire switchblade.
---
What about collectron? that fellow brought me a lot of useful scrap. Now I'm sitting on a concrete extractor at my camp because it's something that spawns not so often and I rebuild a lot. in my opinion if you have collectron why would you need a junk extractor?
---

---
They never said the donations were tied to the events happening tho
---
It's pretty much that one dude just trying to impress them by following their radio instructions
---
The donations are literally only for the public rewards, idk why people think otherwise
---
I don't stick around my camp, so I'm usually doing menu stuff/crafting when there and people think I'm afk. If I'm not, more often than not I'll intentionally go into menus to do something if people are around me until they go. Really the only case I can imagine is if I want to restock a vending machine but somebody is going around and has not looked into that one yet
---
Spruce knob actually counts to the challenge, the challenge completed for me with one workshop unclaimed.
---
I watched. Sigh...
---
-
---
*Unzips*
---
Will you let us know if you get fucked?
---
Just found this. Probably too late, but I still have a quad LMG from the first few weeks
---
I thought I saw eyes through the crack in the closet
---
you'd have to be extremely naive to think they even have a system in place to track progress in the first place.
---
yeah, maybe they do. maybe the events are for real. but more likely than not it's just a stunt to get people busy with a common goal.
---
we'll only fail what Bethesda wants us to fail. even if 0 people donated the bar would still fill up and we'd get the rewards regardless.
---
I think there are less and less people who actually enjoy the survival aspect of this game. Of all the things food and drinks are the easiest to get/find/craft..
---
Love my G.Mini's, trying to roll a decent Junkies one atm, but currently using Vffr and a *magic* Suppressors one for now.
---
It doesn't make any sense.  You probably one shot everything, so why do more damage to something if it's just going to be dead?
---
dootUped
---
Wasn't just that crack...
---
I have a magic Vampire's and a magic bloodied, together I either have the choice of literally not dying, or literally melting everything
---
Happened to me at ACP. I was left in the cave with 7 naked statues.
---
Uhhh...
---
Don‚Äôt you think nukes should be a viable way to kill the strongest enemies in the game?
---
Plant corn at your camp and get a water purifier. Use corn and boiled water to make corn soup which helps hunger and thirst. Purified water for the rest of the thirst or to sell to vendors. Also everyone is saying its going away soon, but there is no timetable on that and no official announcement from Bethesda on that so take it with a grain of salt.
---
As for setting your weapon swap, equip your first weapon, go into the PIP Boy or favorites wheel and equip the second weapon. Now you should change between the two weapons. If you want to change it, always have one you want to keep equipped, then equip a second one. It will always use the last two you equipped and you can swap between them.
---
Lmao!
---
Can't count the number of times I have seen a high level jump to the event, then immediately leave, then return in his PA. Sometimes you just forget shit.
---
Gatling lasers are pretty accurate as they are and the explosive seems to work better with splash damage than direct shots
---
Hey I think I ran into this on Xbox the other day
---
No fucking? Damn I hate a tease.
---
Can confirm one is available on the rooftop of West Tek.  All my toons have at least one one, and only one is from a machine.
---
You can max the ranks on all 4 of them with no consequence
---
There is a safe zone for this exact purpose....
---
I swear i got 4 cursed pickaxes then 3 cursed shovels and then 3 cursed harpoons all in a row. Blowing my mind lolol
---
U have to craft one in the tinkerers bench
---
I bet if you chase it with a cranberry cobbler later it'll be a great experience though.
---
Have you crafted one at a thinker workbench?
---
Yeh, I was the first to arrive there and 2 players shot him behind me and he instantly died.
---
I just hope they'll buy something, I'm camped right next to the rusty pick so anyone that comes by, I know they'll have some caps to buy something of mine.
---
Yeah the time literally doesnt matter to me. I just said 8 PM est because people would already be acclimated to that time because that's when dailies reset.
---
Oh nice, a *magic* Vamp Could be pretty handy for me. I could just chuck on a blocking Armor piece, but nah. You got a Gauss Shotgun too? That's my favourite. The sound when it hits. Delicious.
---
I use a combo of vampire's and bloodied gauss minigun, I'm  either an immortal vampire that literally can't be killed or killing earle in about a minute
---
I always think that they‚Äôll think that I‚Äôm stealing from them, So I try to make a beeline for the vending machines and leave as quick as possible.
---
Wow, just did it thanks lol
---
For some odd reason, neither area nor team chat  seem to work any longer.  (Yea, I know about the volume sliders).  Speaker icon lights up like its supposed to, but no one can hear.
---
Have to goto PS4 level party chat to talk.
---
3rd post I've seen on here like this, I won't flag it but someone will. You can't trade on here, there is a market place. There's some politics between the mods of this sub and the trading sub that prevents me from posting a link though.
---
*Smiley face.*
---
Oh that sucks. Really weird tho. Can it be built by a friend in your camp? Just saying, to try something else
---
No, I don't use shotguns, although I just got a be15 gat plasma with a splitter which is essentially a huge shotgun
---
Probably ammo factory, but the chem one had my interest if its unique chems. Other than that I'm waiting until they're live and finalized before I worry too much about it.
---
Survival not being a required aspect of fallout 4 is probably why
---
I can neither confirm, nor deny, a beaning.
---
It's normal, perception helps a bit 
---
But with concentrated fire, every shot will increase your percent chance to hit, even if you miss
---
So keep firing
---
I agree with you, I believe they don't know how to fix it since it's live for so long and it's an increasing problem. More and more people are using such bugged weapons these days and ruining public events left right and center.
---
What? Are you suggesting that your camp should be destroyed or not based on your luck of the draw on which server you load into if you choose to build outside of the forest? That seems really arbitrary and not, ya know, fun.
---
The West Virginia roc be really cool as boss fight
---
Definitely, could be a month or two until it's finally live
---
Maybe then the paddle ball will finally get its mods publicly released. They've been very quietly making fixes to it over the past two years for seemingly no reason. Originally, you could learn the mods from scrapping, but it was treated as a legendary item and you couldn't scrap it except through a bug (and you needed to get very lucky with lag for that). Now it's no longer treated as legendary, but it is still for some reason referenced in some legendary loot lists, and the mods can no longer be learned from scrapping, only by using the dev room plans. It's a gimmick weapon that sees no real use, they don't even drop paddle ball string as ammo from events/containers. Why would they be making these adjustments over time if they were not planning on reintroducing its main functions?
---
Aw that‚Äôs nice of yo- wait a second hold on...
---
There are still bugs, I can't/won't sugercoat over that. I wasn't playing in 2018 so can't comment on whether things are better or worse than then, but personally I don't find the odd bugginess that I come across spoils the experience.
---
There has been a major update to the game called Wastelanders, which added NPCs and two new factions with assorted quests, plus a couple of other new quests. I think it's worth a try, the Wastelanders update was what got me into the game.
---
Well you are forgetting the nerfs that are on the way. And those extra points are not gonna be affecting the damage that much as usually people (like me) have all the damage related perks already. I will use the extra points on additional defensive ones on my bloodied build and some on utility ones. As damage goes down, the enemies stay alive longer... Meaning they will have chance to shoot you more. And we all know easily bloodied can die. Especially when the level scaling goes live. Lv100 super mutant with minigun is nothing to laugh about if he happens to get a drop on you.
---
As a filthy high health build I‚Äôll be putting at least one point into ‚ÄúWhat Rads?‚Äù The rest will go into ‚ÄúAmmo Factory.‚Äù
---
The nerf doesn't affect magic guns.
---
Ofc this should be a priority but it isn't, is it? Why? Because they're obviously not interested in making their game a safe and fair place for everyone, they're more interested in money. From what I see in posts and my own experience bugs, glitches, hacks, griefers, dupers.. nothing significant was ever even attempted to fix this, like for example anti-cheat? But knowing Bethesda a lot of players including me are worried that by trying to fix things there's a big chance they'll make it even worse..
---
If I could post a video on here I would show you that a explosive gat plas insanity disintegrates him.
---
Honestly I would prefer not to use such weapons in that event cause of lag and it just doesn‚Äôt seem fair.
---
For some reason it didn't come up for me lol
---
So, TSE wasnt removed? Just energy. Huh
---
u carry 120pounds of pepperoni rolls
---
Eh.  I've played around in the PTS.  Not really concerned.
---
Right!?!? I feel cheated
---
Ha. I wish there was a ghost halloween outfit to dress him so he could haunt the ruin.
---
Oooft. That sounds like a face melter likes! Nice. I haven't really used Gatling Plasmas, need to try them out. I'm not Bloodied, but, any other decent effects worth trying to get for one? Ffr perhaps? I've got a Jffr Gatling Laser and it's just ridiculous.
---
Who still needs treasury notes
---
Thanks didn't realize, sorry about that, I thought I was pretty good with reading all the rules
---
The Mistress of Mystery being expanded upon was excellent, since she has her own tools like the Shroud‚Äôs Silver Submachine Gun. Grelok is also an interesting addition...was he on any of the covers or anything, or is completely brand new? The Mistress appeared in Fallout 4‚Äôs radio plays.
---
What about licensed plumber?
---
Stay out of my room!
---
I swear my couch was made by Zetans and they snuck a quantum singularity into it to keep me glued to it.
---
I have a JE GP and a BE GP dont need the vid. Yes those weapons do ok butNot that OK. Earl is pretty resistant to explosive damage.
---
How do I get up there
---
Well, that's because it's a magic weapon.  I don't really like the plasma, to be honest, it kills me too easily.  I prefer my gauss miniguns.
---
Likely will work as percentages instead of actual damage. The high level will "see" a lvl 100 enemy, while the low lvl will see a lvl20 enemy. When attacking, with everything held the same, they will both do 5% damage per hit. So if they are both using a standard pipe pistol with 38 in it, they will see the same drop in health following the hit.
---
\&gt;Even JuiceHead on YT speculated that they won't be able to deliver everything remaining in 2020.
---
Despite Juicehead sounding so surprised for whatever reason, it was obvious since the day they published the Roadmap that the Winter section was about the January-March window, due to the way they tied DLCs to Seasons. There's not enough time to run a third 10-week season this year. If we're lucky they'll only release the Score board on 12/29, but most likely the two weeks between Christmas and the Epiphany (Idk if it's a thing in the States) will be the two-weeks break.
---
I love the "feels" of this community, I'm actually surprised we haven't had any complaints about stealth nerfs recently. I mean literally nerfs to stealth. There was a point last year where with every single update, we would have a bunch of "wtf stealth feels so bad now why did they nerf it" posts, and I think the original ones were literally just being spread around because people misinterpreted what a stealth nerf is
---
I'm not either, but the extra points will give a lot more room to play around with your build. The legendary perks that increase specials are way better than most of the other legendary perks.
---
Fine fine, two versions of a hatch, one a door that you open first, the other a roof that just explodes out in massive pyrotechnics when you slam into it.
---
Well I didn't play much fallout 4, it's my least favourite game of Fallout series, but if I'm not mistaken none of the previous fallouts ever had the survival aspect, there was food and drink but it was optional. And honestly I always wondered why not. I was pleasantly surprised seeing  in Fallout 76 things like resting, eating and drinking, because it adds some realism to the rest radiation and disease stuff. Too bad tho they will always listen to people complaining over some stupid stuff like food and water, instead of focusing on serious problems..
---
Yeah, my first thought when looking at this game isn‚Äôt really ‚Äòwe need more soft toys.‚Äô
---
Yeah.  The new craze is legendary effect rolls being tied to servers.  "OMG, I got three troubleshooters in a  row.  That must mean the servers decide your rng and there's some amazing server that only gives you bloodied."
---
If you've got the stomach for it, there's always the option of creating another character and leveling it up to lvl50 and running through Beckett's quest one more time; and then passing Final Word to your preferred character. Time consuming, sure, but it's not too bad...
---
It‚Äôs not a conspiracy theory, we already saw they had to game the goal for concrete, so there‚Äôs no reason to believe they can‚Äôt track the numbers, and they just throw some multiplier on there.  Likely someone forgot to do that for concrete.  It gives the appearance of an active game for the casual observer.  
---
Concrete and cork are an order of magnitude less common that steel, and we had comparable cork numbers to steel?  No way in hell I buy that, the math just doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Unless people thought that making guns that magically produce cork, at the cost of precious screws, was something actually done en masse.
---
All around this whole ‚Äúevent‚Äù was a mess:  poor in game rewards, questionable goals, questionable reaching of the goals, and further proof the devs don‚Äôt play the game.
---
I'm planning on ammo factory, fire and poison resistance, and probably a special.
---
There are two Sheepsquatch plushies in my camp, one on a sofa inside and one outside on the Have a Great Day sign. I choose one of those and for the former I [sit next to it](https://imgur.com/a/0Brgddn), and the latter I crouch next to it, hop into third person, and creepily watch the person buy from my vendors while my character faces another direction so they don't get the distinct feeling that I'm waiting for them to get the heck outta there so I can reload my machines.
---
I think they're working on having reasons to nuke the entire map so blast sites are an actual thing you have to worry about and fits a little better with lore.  The game isn't very dynamic if we're just constantly nuking SBQ.  By making more hot spots it's more apparent that the world could have been recoverable, but we decided to blast it to hell.
---
One of the biggest reasons my camp hasn't moved in ages. Got a junk extractor and water resource, plus the workshop just down the road from me has a junk pile as well. I leave mine unlocked and use the one at the workshop as a billboard to show the shop is open to claiming once I've got what I need out of that workshop.
---
If I can get hold of one I‚Äôd defo use it
---
Not really fussed about power armour either way but only seem to use my power armour for nuke events at the moment
---
I personally think Earle is harder just because of the environment I rarely die in queen fights but that red stuff just melts bloodied builds
---
Ha ha tesla rifle go zap
---
Is your gamer tag Starstruck? I saw a player that was level 1800+ and thought if that‚Äôs not a hacker it has to be someone involved with the game.
---
The thing is, when I login, right now, there is this popup that reads:
---
"Congratulations!  The Community unlocked a Bonus Challenge event by achieving Fortifying ATLAS goals."
---
Given that the only goals for Fortifying ATLAS were the donation goals...this rather suggests that the donating was tied directly rewards.
---
Because he's all legs, it's easier to get Furious or *magic* effects to happen, focusing on one limb essentially. SBQ has those wings to cover herself, move about more and of course, fly.
---
I remember when that first came out and the guy who ran nuked whitesprings a few hundred times proved it wrong (well, "proved"), wonder why this idea is coming back now
---
He‚Äôs definitely easier then the queen, but he‚Äôs still tough for non bloodieds. You guys can take his health down much faster then my junkie build. Though I have been reviving a lot of bloodied folk off the ground in the mine...
---
I can take most of him out with a lot of Chems and bock, if I‚Äôm not getting much help. Will take up a lot of ammo and time though. 
---
Usually I provide covering fire for the bloodied and heavy weapons crew.  Try to keep the wendigos off them and then I have to loot of course. And then fire a few clips into Earle in between taking out the wendigos.
---
I have a small clinic that doubles as a silent hill experience. The front is a nice cozy house with plenty of beds, open doors, and all the crafting needs available in a fully furnished kitchen and work room.
---
If they should think to open the secret door up stairs and have the guts to cross over the presser plated doors it will sound the sirens and allow them into a black hallway filled with smoke, should they make it through that room, they will have crossed over to the nightmare realm where they are greeted with a macabre sight of many bones and skeletal creations, at the bottom of which lies an arcane pit with some strange ritual going on.
---
At that point they'll probably start to wonder why they still haven't found my vending machines yet. Impatient fools will fast travel away when they were so close. because the series of nuka cola machines  on the side wall is the final clue.
---
3 hidden doors among 5 nuka cola machines. if they open the correct door they will then be greeted with my vendor room with a creepy Halloween setting housing some of the best prices around!
---
I probably lose 4 out 5 customers because they get impatient or dont seem to know that hidden doors exist, that or are terrified of the possibility of it being a trap camp.
---
The heart emoji's i get as well as the glowing praises of people who love the Silent Hill experience are worth the loss of a few sales.
---
I sell my plans for cheap (Even exceedingly rare ones if i already know them), legendaries go for 100 per star even for got roles (if its not a gun I'm interested in), and even have a couple serums sold at a loss for the potential low level players stopping by. Usually have to keep the numbers low tho less some ass buy up the entire stock to flip it, usually the sort who empty my drink machines in one go too.  
---
Oh and I drop pre war food, booze, bubblegum, and other miscellanious stuff in a pile in the corner for free!
---
Mannequin displays and instanced spaces cant get here soon enough.
---
I just wish I could get people to spawn at the front of my camp instead of in the middle or back.  .o  ,
---
Usually I find it odd that I come home and my front door is closed. At least it's much less a headache than the house with 1000 false doors I made last time. XD
---
You should really consider maxing the ammo factory on some alt instead. It will save you 300 perk coins for some other legendary perk that will benefit you more . As i doubt you will craft ammo every day.. Or even every week. You can easily do it on some alt and transfer the ammo to your main. Or other alt. I personally also considered the resistances, but then realized that i have done just fine this far without them thus making them useless in my eyes.
---
Did it give you bloody diahrrea? They gave me bloody diahrrea. Does this mean im a bloodied build?
---
More like stop not using a tesla :3
---
&gt;Magic weapons don‚Äôt go that fast. Neither do legacy or energy weapons.
---
They absolutely do.
---
It's become quite tiresome and, believe me, no one is impressed when one of these players shows up and ruins the fun for everyone.  They want to act like a badass and kill the boss in 3 seconds?  How come they *never* run the damn silo?
---
I only lock my junk collector and ammo machine.  Everything else regenerates quick enough that if it's there, you're welcome to it.
---
Oh, they may very well have a system in place to track the progress but a) I doubt it works properly, b) the progress display is "manually updated" and c) they'll not let us fail (by moving the bar or misreporting the results) because it would waste the work they did and make them look like fools :)
---
I think it's equal but different, he's seems easier to take down because he doesn't fly away, but the environment and the wendigo swarms make up for this oh and that fear run lol
---
As cursed weapons fall under the umbrella of "everything" I'd assume they do less.
---
Ha.  I craft ammo at least every day.  I use a minigun.  The hassle for switching the ingredients and ammo back and forth would be worse than losing a legendary perk slot
---
He‚Äôs mentioned that a number of times but I never read the roadmap in the same way. It specifically mentions ‚ÄúWinter‚Äù for the last update and there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre launching a huge update in the last week of December when every studio winds down for the holidays. I know it says ‚Äú2020 Roadmap‚Äù but I always read it as *fiscal* year 2020, not calendar year.
---
What's the beaning of this?
---
Yeah, Gauss Minigun all the way bud! Fucking superb.
---
People want to be mad at something
---
If you‚Äôre quitting i‚Äôll take all your stuff
---
While I agree the game should not function this way, is it difficult to repair your camp? If this were to happen to me, I would simply find my C.A.M.P. machine and repair all.
---
It is indeed
---
Well I hate to be the bearer of bad news but you do carry those extra 120 pounds, they're just part of you now :p
---
It's worth like 10 caps maybe
---
You overpaid.
---
This. Most of the legendary perks are mediocre at best. I'll get Follow Through and specials.
---
Ah ok thank you
---
it's not rare
---
I love the idea of being able to reenter the game, but I'm pretty sure that, as of now, your loot despawns when you leave the server.  Imagine you're player 24 and disconnect.  Someone around the world wants to connect around the same time and fills that spot.  You wouldn't be able to reconnect anyway.  They'd have to create a reservation grace period and it could keep players in a queue and out of game if too many people are disconnecting from a world.  Shall I say: Server hoping?

Would love to see this change but it ain't gonna happen. Bethesda wants you logging in daily for that bullion
---
Have you tried shooting him at his feet? If your directly shooting him then you are wasting your time and ammo lol. 
---
Yeah I have both to I‚Äôm also a bloodied build but prefer junkies cause of the magic damage it does.
---
Yeah earl is pretty resistant to explosive damage your right on that. I‚Äôve done this multiple times my dude. 
---
Fastest I‚Äôve ever dropped him was 48 seconds would‚Äôve been a lot quicker if a wendigo didnt jump in front of me and blew myself up
---
Edit: like I was saying I‚Äôd prefer not to use such weapons hence lag and the fairness of it, been using a vampires 50 cal to keep me alive at least lol
---
It glitches the hell out of the event. Almost to the point of being unplayable.
---
Nice try!
---
A minute?! Wow, that's huge.
---
Yeah, did it once and now i don't have to worry about alluminium
---
Is that still happening? What platform?
---
Im on PC and I've been using my tesla again since last week and it hasn't been messing with the game like it used to, even in radiation rumble it's not causing huge framerate issues like it was a while back 
---
If other people still have technical problems with Teslas I'll stop using it, I had no idea it was still doing that since I've been fine
---
Huge?  As in good?
---
Some people just can't take a compliment üåù
---
Not at all, do you feel awkward when dinner come to you?
---
I‚Äôm not sure actually - a quick search says he was mentioned in F3 and had a text game in Hubris Comics in F4 https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Reign_of_Grelok
---
Not sure if there‚Äôs any art before now
---
Wouldn't a "big" pepperoni roll just be a Calzone at that point?
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is bring a whole bunch of tesla to every event and give them away for free
---
I'm amazed by the creativity I see in camps too.
---
Nah.    
---
I put all my plans for zero caps last night. I want to get rid of so much stuff except for the harder to get stuff and if I have to spend more time being picky that's fine. I have yet to have someone attack my camp. The random enemies are the annoying ones. I try and Wave when I see someone there but still go about my business. My store is on the top of my shop and there's a Vault Boy pointing the way. I have every crafting station including for Power Armor.
---
At this point I feel like I only ever go back to my camp if I need to drop something off or just harvest crops, so I'm hardly ever there.
---
Not that big, it's the size of a hand, but still with a roll shape
---
Plus the calzone isn't a roll, it's a fold
---
I want the 30 seconds of my life I spent reading this back..
---
If you want to be THAT guy, then all you dude.
---
I like it when people look in my vendors then ask me to barter with them. I love bartering. I usually take the first offer just because I both feel it's a fair offer, and because I want to encourage people to do it more.
---
If you melt Earle in 3 seconds, you know *exactly* what you're doing.  You can literally see the life bar draining away.
---
Clearly, Bethesda doesn't care enough to make the magic weapons a priority.  But it's up to you to use them responsibly, and when you don't, you're damn right someone is going to report you.
---
Happened to me yesterday. Got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt move without the game bugging out.
---
I would have gotten away with it to if it wasn‚Äôt for those damn stoners!
---
They probably disconnected or left. I saw a lot of those before in different places. My first time was pretty funny. I was a low lvl noob running from some super mutants and spotted a high lvl player. I rushed to them seeking shelter but noticed something off. They were completely naked and all mutants' bullets ran right through them xD Then I realized there was no dot on the compass nor on the map. It's like a visual echo of a player who's no longer on the server. Saw a lot of naked allies playing their guitar in the air when the owner left xD
---
Yes, really good.
---
Sarcasm doesn‚Äôt translate very well through text does it.
---
Generally speaking I think it‚Äôs to keep the annoying traveling merchants out of your CAMP rather than players.
---
Tssk, listen kiddo, you just don't go into a forum asking for feedback like that. What do you think this is, an internet community? Man up.
---
It was definitely worth what I paid for it (got it for free on Game Pass).  Played pretty much daily since 7-9 and have enjoyed the story and the world/exploration quite a bit.  It does remain unstable and buggy but it's more "normal Bethesda game" levels of buggy rather than the "they should be sued for actually charging money for this buggy mess" levels at launch.
---
I think I'm nearing the end of my time with it, but a couple hundred hours of enjoyable game play and a good community (the people in game have been very kind and helpful) are enough for me to, cautiously, recommend it :)
---
Clearly not ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I want the Brahmin to squirt milk from its own udders as an attack
---
Yeah, but "your average player" will have a really freakin' nice time defending their workshop when the "defend your workshop from ..." event involves 3 legendary Scorchbeasts level 50+.  
---
Yeah, real fair to make them better, push those people to embrace the "cheat route" (bloodied, magic weapons, sneak/stacking buffs) even more.  
---
Here is some nice suggestion: make other weapons worth something, make two shot/anti armor useful again, let legendary enemies with 2-3 stars DROP at least 2\* items, drop items the enemy is clearly holding, etc.  
---
Nerfing weapons for the two endgame fights is fine and dandy, but I frankly saw waaay to much people goofing off to do this with underpowered weapons. Having to deal ACP with weaker weapons while only 3/8 people attack the boss will only breed salt, and people will probadly cry for "extendend group" or "kick/invite in instance" features to get rid of this (and then we end up in every MMORPG raid/group finder ever)
---
&gt; I know you‚Äôve got it, I‚Äôve seen it in there before 
---
For instance?
---
Lmao thanks for the laugh,
---
god I love this community
---
Nope my gamertag is also Lady Devann. I try to keep it consistent.
---
I think it may feel like that because SBQ spends a lot of time flapping about out of reach. If she were grounded the entire fight even without glitched weapons she would get smashed quicker than Earle.
---
Stealth, as in hiding, works fine in groups, it‚Äôs the bonus damage that doesn‚Äôt work. Basically, if the enemy you‚Äôre attacking is aggroed to any target‚Äîany other player or NPC‚Äîsneak attack bonuses will show as working, damage numbers will show that they work, but health bars will rubber band and take back the extra damage. I don‚Äôt know if this is intended or not, but it‚Äôs definitely how it works. 
---
The exception to this is if your teammate/nearby player is also a stealth build. If they‚Äôre hidden or in caution, you‚Äôll still be good to go. In that case the enemy isn‚Äôt aggroed to anything. 
---
Look no further than a Queen fight for evidence. I and any other bloodied stealth commando can solo the SBQ in a few minutes (some in under a minute). However, if I take that build to a group fight I‚Äôll dump 3X the ammo in that time and she‚Äòs nowhere close to dead, despite seeing high numbers and being in caution the whole time. 
---
I can see it when I farm places like WestTek. I run around one shotting SM‚Äôs alone, then another player runs in and draws aggro‚Äîrubber banding health bars everywhere. It‚Äôs like clockwork. If I go in with a stealthy friend I can tell as soon as they‚Äôre detected because it suddenly takes 3 shots to down a SM.
---
Take 3 points of Lead Belly and you can eat and drink everything you come across naturally without getting any rads. It makes food and water much less of a pain in the ass to manage since you can drink all non dirty drinks and all pre war foods you come across. To make things even better get the carnivore mutation. You'll have a 0% chance of getting disease from eating raw meat, and all creatures drop meat when killed.
---
Deffo, I mean which console didn‚Äôt matter, it would have worked!
---
Lol. Are you me?  I run with a VE 50 cal as my backup / I don‚Äôt want to goo pile myself weapon.
---
That happens when you fast travel that camp.How can you become encumbered after that
---
One Wasteland will help a lot with this!
---
" Usually I provide covering fire for the bloodied and heavy weapons crew. "   I was in a group of five or so players today.   Someone had to have been doing this for me because I only had to kill three wendigos and was really able to pour the heavy weapon damage into Earl.   *I appreciate it so much*.
---
Gladly, trade you for a Nija cola fridge hidden door

 &gt; One Wasteland will help a lot with this!
---
The stairs.
---
Go up to the highest floor. There is an area with a wide open space. It is behind one of the walls around there
---
You saved me at least 30 seconds of my life by reading the comments first , thank you.
---
Thanks.  I should clarify, that's probably the 10% high.  If I get unlucky and get "frightened" a lot or get swarmed by wendigos, it takes longer, but when I put the bullets to earle, it takes about 1 minute or so of shooting.  I haven't timed it or anything though.
---
The head is, typically, a smaller target and prone to sudden shifts of position.  This is normal/expected behavior for VATS in a Fallout game.  If you have high perception you can still have 70% head shot chances at 20-30 feet and 95% chance withing five feet.  It helps if you have a weapon with a very long range statistic.
---
Nuka
---
All of BGS's work is going into One Wasteland (and the nerfs), we won't see anything now until Patch 22 goes live with that nerf.
---
I'm expecting once the nerf goes live they may look into other bugs (nerf), since they usually fix multiple smaller nerfs ... er bugs when they release a nerf. Er, i mean patch.
---
Nerf.

Charleston fire station, the motel weight room outside of Flatwoods, and the Eastern regional penitentiary courtyard.
---
Yeah you told me the same thing about me talking about earle williams' dick right?
---
That brought a tear to my eye. Well done sir/ma'am. You are what we should strive for. Fight hard and be helpful to your fellow vault dwellers. You are a true inspiration.
---
Every silo has a unique code that change every week. You can just Google it and it will most likely direct your to nuka crypt website where valid codes are posted with a remark when it will expire. Good news is, once you enter a code in certain silo you won't have to enter it again until the reset, so you can just use the same silo if you plan on launching nukes more than once a week.
---
I might have I don't remember
---
They're not killing me quick, it seems people are missing the point of this thread. I want more health so I can tank more in pvp fights, plain and simple.
---
Such as the nuka cola hidden door which was there a few days ago
---
IDK about PC, but it's definitely still happening on PS4. Sucks to blue screen just as Wendigo dies. We even repeatedly asked the dude to stop. Good times.
---
&gt;And i see more and more people using them when the damage nerfs eventually hit live. Really a sad thing..
---
It's going to be a terrible look when the re-balance happens, that's for sure.  How can you tell your core audience that you're going to nerf all their gear, but the exploiters that have already been ruining our fun will be able to keep right on doing that?
---
Just checked all I said was 
---
Oh dear god
---
Predator style helmet with dreads to go with the chinese stealth armor.  That coupled with a shoulder mount mod for gauss weapons...
---
I roll a weapon, it's a bloodied gauss minigun with 33% vats hit chance and 250 damage resistance while reloading.  Not the best, but it's bloodied, so Ill stick with it.  I go down to fight earle and kill him easily... as expected, because I'm bloodied with a good weapon, perks, etc.  No where in this do I need to realize that little 33% modifier is helping way more than it should.  Even if I do realize it, what do you want me to do?  Roll for another weapon?  I don't think so.
---
Yeah i remembered your username tho
---
I also hate these people. Haven‚Äôt experience it there yet but massively in radiation rumble. Teslas ruin everything
---
Site alpha; lake, cliff, reocurring Yao Gui, frequent visits from vengeful mothman. Plus a quick 80 lead from alpha when you need it and 5 cap fast travel to westtek for steel.
---
Partly the roleplay aspect. But I also had problems with critters getting *into* my house and garden (radroaches can open doors!! it's awful), the locks stop those from being able to wreck stuff inside as easily. I have a space where players can jump to get into the house anyway through my porch, so even if it's locked up they can still look around
---
Cant see what it is exactly but for some reason I was anticipating the communist collectron
---
Pa build- Legendary charisma for tenderizer, ammo factory, funky duds, power sprinter, power reboot
---
I've been looking everywhere for a glitch or skip of that name  and I'm finding nothing :(
---
Honestly if he's revving people then he pull his weight in his own way. One low level out of 8 players is not bad. Doable, especially if they heal people.
---
If somebody whips out an explosive gatling plasma it's the only way I can keep up with tagging wendigos.
---
It pretty much does the same damn thing during ACP but you‚Äôre getting slapped around by Wendigos and trying to dodge falling debris instead of getting kicked in the dick by Ghouls.
---
Oh ok
---
Lol! Two minds think alike! Yeah after 6 times from blowing myself up almost average in that event and not being able to respawn. Ill only use it if I have to haha
---
Not as far as I know. It‚Äôs TNT Dome 3 you want access too.
---
That's true but there's a backpack that can grant you 120 extra carry weight tho :p
---
While I fully agree with your reasoning, do we have any idea why they CARE if we come back daily vs just a few times a week?
---
Gunsmith perk card
---
Hmm i weigh 10lbs lighter. Oh hai mark (bad the room reference)
---
Donation events in MMO's are always fudged to autocomplete. Way back in classic WoW some servers couldnt open AQ, so they just fudged it and its become an industry norm
---
I got like 8 from machines, so there's a chance and I'd say that chance is higher than it was in Fo4.
---
Yes please! Challenging fights and dungeons is exactly what this game needs
---
Finally role play as Iron Man? Yes please
---
I just can't wait for the croc.
---
Super Mutant Behemoth Horde Event.
---
And then a Xmas variant, where they can trip over their Santa beards.
---
&gt; Even if I do realize it, what do you want me to do?
---
Take your finger off the LMB for a second?
---
I mean, my Shotguns are magic.  These are the Bloodied Shotguns I have, and have had from before this glitch was even a thing.  That's just how it is.  But I'm not going to sit there and annihilate Earle, even though I technically can due to this glitch.  That's ruining it for everyone else.
---
I was using a bloodied ffr fr napalmer and it was doing a solid 20-40 damage, it broke twice durine the fight though. I also used a vampires ffr 250 Dr reload until it broke as well, that worked nice. After everything broke I just used a suppressors machete with the poison mod to tag everything I could. I was ill prepared.
---
Well imo you should try a new way until this is fixed or it's selfish af. But if you wanna be a DB, keep at it.
---
Run in when safe, get vats crit with bonus crit dmg, dip out. Pick wendigos, or run out of danger. Repeat
---
How?  Everyone still gets the xp and the legendaries at the end, which is the most important thing.
---
I carry 3 different PA on me all the time. Mine only weigh 2.5 each to make it worthwhile. 
---
Excavator, T60, Ultracite
---
oof ive gotten 2 in a row
---
Question on legendary perks, can you swap them out like regular perk cards or are you stuck with them?
---
i have a generator room (nothing else there) and players keep leaving the doors open, so now it's locked.
---
"played long ago," "bugs," "internet shitstorm."
---
Yep, all the ingredients for the copypasta!
---
Just be careful not to get sloppy with them cuz I hate to admit I picked off a few and forgot to check the ceiling maybe once or three times
---
This seems like a good spot to ask: how, exactly, do you revive another player?  I've seen a number of people downed, run up to them and...well...nothing?  No prompt, nothing to suggest they are interactable, etc.  Do I need to use something?  Does it only work on people in my group?
---
You realize Bethesda has their own forums that they pay attention to more. Yes they read here. But their own forums get first attention.
---
I'll give you 5 caps for it.
---
To quote a meme: "Why not both?"
---
I've got my robo-pal's Station parked right next to the Extractor, for Double Junk Jeopardy!
---
You could chuck a Forceful Stock mod to the Rifle to give it more Durability. Other than that, just the Weapon Artisan Perk for 200% Condition.
---
If there‚Äôs a bunch of high levels with good weapons he‚Äôs easy meat , doing the last Earl I got bored poring extra fire into him and just wandered around shooting wedigos
---
Body tats would be cool. Could help incentivize us to wear a more varied wardrobe of outfits to show off our ink
---
I always click on a crafting station or some thing. So it looks like I‚Äôm busy/doing something productive.
---
Buffs where off or I take from an extractor
---
I dont have fallout 1st. can you add me and help me with the private server?
---
Or when you get caught in his scream and running terrified into a stack of corrosive barrels
---
If you do die in queen fights it‚Äôs annoying cuz the. You spawn right in the middle of the blast zone which sucks.
---
You are wrong. I submitted a ticket once out of frustration after my challenges autocompleted and got an automated reply mentioning that they're aware of this problem but none of them is able or more like wants to award score points. so even if people are cheating it's pointless because it's pretty obvious they won't directly award points to anyone, even people who lost a lot..
---
I‚Äôm never at my camp when someone else visits but if I am I usually wave at them and then get back to what I was doing.
---
It was the most common. Hey no worries about over paying. The game will never run out of caps.
---
Yea that‚Äôs too I forgot about that problem
---
Na I prefer to see ot on my head
---
Cripple the legs or else get fucked
---
I did not know that , thanks for the info , get it via Bethesda‚Äôs main site ?
---
I can relate to this üíØ
---
Still laughing!!!
---
Love how supposedly cursed weapons were datamined to be a lower percent chance drop that the mask and I've only gotten 6 harpoon guns and 2 cursed pickaxes....
---
I saw a level 13 get the helmet before.... I just want it XD
---
ƒ∞ always carry 20 whiskey and 20 bufftats for that  üòÅ
---
My guess would be mid-late September ü§î
---
I may give a pass the people with Sofia's in underwear.  But I know the people with Sofia's in swimsuits did it on purpose.
---
New Vegas literally had one of the most brutal survival difficulties I've ever played, fallout 4 had more diseases but NV? cruel
---
Yes.

---
Sorry you feel that way.  I quite enjoy her  quirky chat and the raider backstory with David is interesting.
---
Doesnt earle have high energy resist tho??
---
Oh well then yeah xD I'm a more active scavenger it seems. I have my robo-pal too but it brings a lot of different stuff, I prefer just go out in the wild and pick up what I need.. but for this time while I have FO1st I just vacuum the map haha
---
Just took the tour, definitely delivers as an amazing Camp
---
Thanks üëç
---
Yeah, my barbaric balls should be swinging in the wind as I wind up war mace.
---
The problem is that the underwear is physically part of the character model.   It's not some separate thing the model wears.  It's part of the actual texture.
---
Believe me, for the sake of versatility, I wish it wasn't.  But it's not like there aren't ways around this.  Things like the Chinese Stealth Suit, you can tell they do a total body replacement.  The Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit is the same way.  There's nothing under that suit.  So why couldn't the King Grognak Outfit be made the same way?
---
When though?
---
As melee unarmed, i'd pull aggro after one crit and bonus sneak, and as soon as I went in danger, I'd kite him away from the aoe
---
If they don‚Äôt deal with these things before the rebalance goes live it‚Äôs going to be a serious problem. While I expect the most out of place damage drops to be brought up by then, we‚Äôre still looking at an overall reduction to damage output. 
---
You can‚Äôt do that and just let the hacked weapons, ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù weapons and duped legacies that have been broken since day one keep doing the damage they are. I hope they have a plan for these or it‚Äôs gonna be a wild ride.
---
Ah right, I still haven't tried hardcore, I'm a relaxed player. In 76 this survival is easy and not limiting. like sure you might want to cook a specific dish to get a good bonus, but you can eat dog food of you have to xD also if it wasn't for food meter I would always forget to refresh the buffs
---
If you have ANY version of a Stimpack (diluted, normal, Super) in your inventory, and the player is kneeling (knocked down) you can press 'E' to revive him.  
---
If he is completly dead (after he took dmg in this state) he will have to respawn.  
---
Reviving players is beneficial, since they won't get a respawn timer AND won't increase the timer cooldown for repeatedly dying (starts with 3 sec, up to 60 secs of waiting for respawn in events)
---
Gotta keep the Nuke Silos relevant is my guess. SBQ runs were getting old.
---
I‚Äôd loooooove to be able to put tattoos on my girl‚Äôs arms .. shades of grey tattoos .. nice looking sleeves and stuff 
---
And yeah I keep hoping to find new hair styles every time I log in but I know I should not keep my hopes up like thatü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I'll be disappointed to see the need to eat and drink gone. This game is feeling more and more watered down for mobile-like gameplay.
---
You know the wee flaming barrel attached to our Armor Workbenches?
---
The Bunny fits in there perfectly, plus it's expression.
---
Same my volume is always low as I listen and watch YouTube while playing for the most part
---
So you want it to be nothing like Fallout.
---
Well that swimsuit is old-fashioned and looks pretty, not like today's underwear, guess it's a matter of preference.
---
LOL **bows** My pleasure!
---
Personally I've no idea what price metas are like so sell all plans at 50% the default price. I don't get many sales though so its probably too high.
---
Savage!
---
they're getting armor penetration through tank killer. next patch, I think.
---
but yeah. pistols don't serve any particular purpose. maybe make rifles louder, I dunno. something.
---
No they are too busy nerfing guns that NOBODY asked for
---
God help you if you ever have a real sweet roll.
---
Exactly, I know the nuka suit has to be a full body texture swap because whenever I wear it on my dude, his back textures get fucked up
---
Pleaaaaase especially us girls need to be able to customize our characters a lot more than that üòÇ
---
Fair enough.
---
I‚Äôd save for a few months as it‚Äôll legit take that long to get to max rank and get the good items
---
Can I get a legendary drill, please?
---
Lol that's great
---
I'm eager enough to do it (for the backpack if nothing else) but never been able to get it to work.  From your description I think the issue is that they have been "dead" rather than kneeling.  Much appreciated.
---
Thank you for a good laugh! I had a hunch it was a scam and kinda always wanted to try it, guess I won't xD
---
It‚Äôs a good thing we don‚Äôt have to use the bathroom in 76...mutant mud babies everywhere
---
Is the card still worth it if I generally use a lever action rifle? It is basically that or Exterminator, which is what I had been using before.
---
Why can't it be both?
---
Honestly the bar is why I don‚Äôt use becket. I run a speakeasy in my camp and I don‚Äôt need more than one person selling alcohol in my camp
---
Playing 4 in anything less than hardcore makes the gun fights slow as hell, and also makes enemy traps completely ineffective
---
If you get max raider you get a ammo making machine it's pretty good I really don't use much ammo because I mainly use heavy and melee weapons but it's good too sell for extra caps in my vending machines
---
Aye, this could be the way.
---
Fuck that noise, I love my little moo moo.
---
Okay, now I'm wondering if you can survive in any of the bunkers? Like whitespring, Abby's, etc. Can anyone lift the curtain of mystery for me?
---
I think people are over thinking this. I just went in with an AAE handmade, and saw the damage ticking him down. There were four other players, and we finished it with over 10 minutes left. Ammo is more important than prefix. I healed a bunch of players, and it came down to ammo, as bloodieds were falling right and left, but combined effort was the key. It's not hard, just a bit resource intensive.
---
people who play multiple toons
---
Or possibly contracted both Herbivore and Carnivore Mutations.
---
I suspect it has something to do with the fact your camp spawns into the world before you do, once you go into the loading screen after 'world found' your camp spawns straight away while your character hasn't, this has been witnessed by myself and a friend that I regularly play together with, it's how you might sometimes find people are already at your vendors as soon as you've loaded in
---
The loincloth covers everything fine lol
---
It even has it's own leather underwear, that's actually why the regular ass underwear peaking out looks so silly
---
Perfect.

I have a shit camp and don't spend much time there. If someone else shows up I just ignore them because I'm there for repair and replenishement and then I'm gone. The only thing I lock is the ammo creator and my scrapbot. Anyone and everyone are welcome to use my benches and take as much water as they want. Sleep in my beds, with or without the Commander, play the instruments, harvest the tatos, have a nice day.
---
When visiting other camps I appreciate the work and creativity of some of the players and treat their camps with respect. If a camp is being attacked by some creature or other I will do my best to defend it. Where I come from we call that being neighborly.
---
Not sure if you need to complete all the Wastelanders quests to trade with Samuel or the robot at Crater. What you do need is reputation. You can check that in the social menu at the upper right. The higher your reputation, the more items will be available at each.
---
It's a matter of preference ofc. I've seen some good ideas of utilizing his bar, I also build a cozy bar myself with him as a barman, but it's a choice.
---
Not Earl's legendary. But, more importantly, people didn't come to watch you destroy the boss they came to have a fight, to play the game.
---
I logged off over encumbered somehwere and when i logged in to do my next pregame ritual (scrapping, stashing) i spawned at someones camp and just kept forgetting to do stuff out of sheer anxiety and eagerness to leave. Left and came back about 10 times and the camp owner and their present company didnt know what i was doing or what to do themselves lol
---
I meant New Vegas. Heard it's fun xD I will never play 4th ever again tho. Worst fallout for me.
---
I don't know about the engine thing, since Skyrim already allowed dual wielding with freedom to put 1 handed stuff in either hand.
---
If they lock the abikity to dual wield behind a perk card, it could work wothout having to create new assets other than the animations.
---
Should have told him to ‚Äú get good ‚Äú they love that response
---
No, it's a gold bullion plan so you cannot build it in anyone's camp except your own.
---
I have zero doors on my camp, and I don‚Äôt understand people who do.
---
Me and a friend, both bloody heavy took it out with a low-level.. I run BE 50cal, and he runs BE Gatling Plasma. I died maybe twice?
---
Maybe Beth screwed up the math and the things that are supposed to be rare are common and vice versa
---
Was this your card? If so, I would call it rude, but woah w/ the rage. If it is the other players card, be happy you got your chance at a fixer plan( but all you got was a white wolf fedora üëç)
---
Well good news is that when one wasteland comes out pistols will get apply tank killer perk giving them AA.
---
I‚Äôd first get the Food backpack from the Settlers or the Chem backpack from the Raiders, depending on which one will have a better effect on your carry weight.
---
This is basically the same grounds on people exploiting the game when they dupe. They kno they‚Äôre doing more damage than they should be if they‚Äôre killing bosses very quickly. So they should be suspended or banned the same way you would w/ a duper. 
---
However, I believe the damage nerfs will give them a more clear picture on who are using hacked guns which are much different than magic guns. 
---
Hacked guns are modded using a 3rd party software e.g. the infamous hacked 50. Cal machine gun with energy damage.
---
Magic guns depend on latency, and commonly have bash damage.
---
Ive wondered though. Can you ally and mobs open doors that are locked as well?
---
Scrap. Quit game. Join new server. Read a different terminal. Enter/exit power armor. Build new one. Try again.
---
Done it 3 times and still says to complete initial wave...
---
Maybe refused to be milked? xD i once killed a random cow when it attempted to kick me instead of giving milk that I really needed at that time. I didn't get milk but I could carry extra 20 pounds after *smirk smirk*
---
My furious gp tears him up
---
It is worth *many* Deep Mining Masks
---
More styles would be great!
---
I'd like a second set of pigtails with thicker hair/more stands.  They're my favorite, I've always loved pigtails but these are just a lil bit too small.  Volume, please.
---
Didn't think of that! Good call!
---
True but sometimes you get that one player who for unknown reasons thinks hes a raider and if you have pacifist on you can't shoot him and do damage
---
I don't know who you are, but you're a filthy casual now.
---
I don‚Äôt bother , you can‚Äôt put most on legendary weapons. What‚Äôs the point
---
Because I don't want people to shit on my bed.
---
I'm sure you'll see it run again! It's a permanent event so you'll have other opportunities to get what you want from it.
---
Yeah, I'm always a little worried about that. Wish there was a quick switch on/off for this. But don't they make very low damage if you don't shoot them back?
---
No, as far as I know.
---
I've gotten the plushie about 8 times, the rug 4, the heads twice, meat pile 3,  the pickax 7, shovel 3, harpoon twice, I just want the damn mask lol
---
Had to put the game down before because I crashed during the event. Rejoined the team to log on but was placed outside of the mine so I couldn't rejoin the event. Fucking crap.
---
Same difference.
---
I love your videos :)
---
That sucks, oh well.
---
I can tank most weapons with less than 400 HP.
---
Hmm I used a bass on a stair initially but that's been replaced by a grognax chair and a weapon station. I'll find pictures.
---
I've found that I don't really need to collect junk.  I don't really craft anything, I use repair packs to repair everything.  The only things I need are lead and steel for bullets.
---
Not too many PA skins probably. Perhaps a new colour scheme or something adapting the existing PA skins? Perhaps that vertibird thing?
---
I noticed that my cow was missing today... and then I continued on with what I was doing.
---
A miner with tic tac toe games behind him
---
Someone told me if you die there as the cave collapses you get your junk and loot but you won't get the special rewards like plans and flux? I haven't had a chance to test it as I always make it in time.
---
Happens to me when I load into one, but my friend is able to load his in without anything breaking.
---
ü§î 
---
ü§®
---
So, when you say "make" do you mean heat in the oven from the store.
---
Or do you mean actually MAKE them yourself.
---
If you actually made them, gonna need to know your recipe.
---
Had a super cool person randomly bump into me while I did the responder quests. I felt bad not accepting the team invite. I had work in an hour and wanted some me time.
---
Hope I run into them after work tonight tho. Prob be cool to show me the ropes.
---
Thank you. I‚Äôll try this.
---
If you don't think you're doing enough damage to the boss, make sure you're keeping the wendigos off the people fighting the boss, and bring a bunch of stims to revive your teammates.
---
You reminded me, need to grab more berries from the Farm. Do you use the Turbo-Ferts? Handy as fuck, can get rid of Crops at Camp for more budget!
---
I kinda would be down for this ngl.
---
Same but with the Legendary perk, I can drop 2pt from Perception to shove somewhere else. Plus I won't have to remember to put my cards back after using them.
---
Honestly it feels very atmospheric. Last time got nice event buddies and it was epic as we rushed together to the exit covering each others backs and shooting stuff, reviving fallen comrades on the way. But seriously now. I've been told of you don't make it and die in the cave as it collapses you don't lose the junk and loot but you don't get special rewards either like unique plans. I don't know how accurate this is tho.
---
I personally think it goes by too fast. I‚Äôll go to the restroom or make a quick snack and the once full meters will already be red.
---
Am I missing something? Outside of completely logging off is there a ‚Äúpause‚Äù anywhere in the game?
---
Made as in made. 250 grams of flour, 150 ml of water, a teaspoon of yeast and salt (lmao j forgot the salt in my dough) then let it rise for a few hours and morph the dough into an oval shape, kinda like a pad. Then put pizza sauce (tomato sauce with oregano and olive oil) a bit of salame and mozzarella and roll them up and into the oven they go. Delicious but now i'm still dead
---
Funny thing is, if you know the exploit, these fuckers *can* be transferred. So Bethesda should just let the normies do it too. It's ridiculous that the normies can't trade such among their own characters because *~whAt aBouT tHe GriNd~*.
---
A pretty post apocalyptic bathroom..
---
I scrapped my rad shower because repairing it was sucking up stable flux like crazy. 
---
I have an almost full camp budget, so fixing it all up (with the camp module, of course) takes roughly 100 steel and between 5-20 of damn near every other resource. Do that 5 times and you run though your materials like concrete pretty fast. Also, steel is lyfe for my gauss minigun 
---
A slightly less pain in the ass- my chicken coop takes a corn to fix. I ain't no farmer, so having unspoiled corn in my inventory isn't a sure thing. Sometimes have to go raid a farm to fix up my chicken coop.
---
You mean the blue power armor skins? Those could very likely be replacers, it looks like the Fallout 4 Brotherhood paint schemes will be replaced with the newer ones (At least that's what I'm thinking) i personally don't like the time traveling rank schemes. I mean i fully understand they're Fallout 4 assests but eh, it doesn't fit the current Brotherhood time period at all.
---
Uh ok? Good for you. I'm a dedicated tank build so I have high resistance above 700 energy resist and 650 hp. that's just how I run, I 1v1 alot so I fight the best of the best one on one, but I can tank 2 Tesla's at once cause of my health
---
Man i just made and ate 4 pepperoni rolls by myself and then collapsed on my sofa. Filthy casual is a compliment honestly
---
We gotta love it.
---
Ok found it got 3 nukas
---
I am sure you are right. Hopefully they can make the camps 'invincible' until you agree to zone into a nuke zone if they can't work around it spawning ahead of the player.
---
Damn
---
It has been happening on PC, but also with any weapon that creates ash or goo piles.
---
Yep, the (Turbo) Fart Bombs are a handy tool!
---
But like, handguns are sidearms, I don‚Äôt think pistols are meant to be used as primary weapons. Like the single action revolver for example.
---
Damn this is creepy and cool.
---
Uh hoh. Hopefully the devs don't hit us with a "can't reproduce" and tell us to go to hell, lol
---
I'll upload the proof when I can.
---
Fantastic. I hope they never fix it. It just made my meat week more memorably weird...
---
The thing with melee is that I find I just cannot match the DPS of a solid heavy gun build, but as a good teammate I would say work crowd control, a lot of posts on here are about how the Wendigo Spawns take them down, with 112 on Earl you probably are 3-5 hits to down a wendigo spawn, so keeping them off the team would be a good use of your attacks. When the adds are eliminated switch to attacking Earl. I also find Melee seems to get Earls attention so you can try and pull aggro from time to time to take the heat off your team.
---
If you have the mountain scout uniform in the atom shop then that goes well with it
---
I love that boy Rifle
---
As soon as someone travels to my camp I just pretend to afk or hop straight into a workbench lol
---
As a non PA player I just started on the SS Armor.
---
It‚Äôs beautiful
---
What are you playing on cpu gpu?
---
You're just jealous they know how to game.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject

---
I gotta be honest, this would make sense. Not to be like "Bethesda Bad"; but it would make sense. I think they've had percentile issues before. 
---
That's probably why they've updated the mole miner pails I'm the PTS, allowing a chance drop of the new items even from the rusty pails.
---
Yes, it counted for the challenge when it was claimable. If you claimed it pre-Wastelanders but aren‚Äôt at 21 yet, it still counts. It‚Äôs just ‚Äòhidden‚Äô.
---
I have most of the gold bullion plans. My advice 1 secret service torso then secret service jet pack, then secret service under armor then Shielded mod for under armor then buttered mod.
---
Who cares. The Imposter Sheepsquatch doesn't issue anything worth while to loot off his body. As long as you're there you get the rewards and thats all that matters.
---
I'd be glad to have someone one shot the guy so I could save my ammo. The event is crap anyway. I've done it many times and have yet to get the Fixer plan from it.
---
It's worth what you're happy to pay for it. Saw some guy on the road to Flatwoods with two pies in his vending machine for 30000 each. Now, I love pie, but not that much. Someone may buy it though.
---
Yup. Ya get what you pay for
---
Before you get downvoted to hell by salty bloodbois: I agree 100%. I've played on the PTS and it's a blast.
---
Idk its considered rude to one shot the bosses and such. Just generally rudish behavior, but tbh let's be real with ourselves its not like OP was gonna get a b2525 fixer from the corpse lol. I think it was a bit of an overreaction/tantrum.
---
Intel core I7-6700hq and gtx 970, it's a few years old but by no means bad.
---
Maybe food doesn‚Äôt stack, but alcohol does. I can feel the Str and Chr go up and Int go down with every drink.
---
but make sure you do enough damage to the boss so you can loot it... unless my game glitched. 
---
i went in. shot the boss in the face several times with my gauss shotgun and then started killing all the wendigos. next thing i know earle is dead and i got no loot from him.
---
Me being thanked by randoms when I take all 3 pylons and spam stims(lvl35) in encrytid so they can deal with the imposter
---
Mmmmm buttered
---
Shame they don't work in the wild. I'd have farmer's daughters hanging off me... Do you know if they work at other folks Camps?
---
Confetti on the floor, free standing curtains in a narrow hallway.
---
Yeah glowing jack o was added it‚Äôs a plastic atom shop item
---
Lol! I prefer stacking edibles myself
---
What's the deal with the Tesla bug? First I'm hearing of it.
---
I'm a bloody bloodbuild goddamit. It's first time PvE is actually thrilling. It's literally first time F76 has anything else to offer besides exploration, socializing and PvP. PvE always sucked, and now it's finally gonna git gud. So is, I hope, PvP.
---
there is a cap on how much gold you can hold I think it is 5000. I personally got the entire T-65 set while maxing out my relation with raiders and foundation. Once I got that up I got the Ammo factory from the raiders right away. From there I got all the weapons unlocked so they would have a chance of dropping without me needing to make them. I then got the Strangler Heart Armor the Thorn Armor (Just to unlock the exclusive player icon). After that I bought all the weapon mods and now I am working towards the secret service set.
---
Existing stacked punji boards can still be placed at will, so every CAMP can be a trap CAMP is the owner still has them blueprinted.
---
Try clearing your cache. Might help!
---
And, a nuka shine fermenter
---
Only if you have a lot of time to waste.
---
My camp is just off of a fissure site so sometimes I'll go tag a scorchbeast and lure it back to see if they help with it or not. It's a fun game lol
---
The main problem isn't bloodied, it's unyielding armor. 15+ if not higher of every stat except end. High carry weight, can int and char check any convo, huge exp boost...
---
There haven‚Äôt been any FO1st exclusive items that have left and returned, yet.
---
Have legacy weapons with magic effects been confirmed to not work in the same way as non-legacy magic weapons? I don't have the means to test it or have seen anybody comparing them. Two magic weapons if they work just "right" can do that. I've found miniguns can sometimes kill bosses once they reach half health solo so those get scripped. I've also seen hacked weapons three shot SBQ before she's in range but that's a much faster kill with no wind up.
---
How do you get junk extractor
---
I lock my house because people turn on my Devon station and leave it on. But everything anyone would need is outside anyways so no reason anyone should need to enter my house anyways
---
Are magic weapons fixed with the new damage calculations? Or at the very least not so effective? I've found some heavy junkies high fire rate weapons lately and they are absolutely ridiculous in live currently.
---
Bro next time add deep pocketed mods
---
Exactly, just another 3*. Better she die too quick, instead of not at all.
---
I'm wearing a bathrobe dude, 2 pockets it's the max
---
From my perspecitve:  
---
Either the server lag was too small because of not enough players connected for the issue to occur  
---
or  
---
they fixed it completely.
---
Lol yeah its the teslas. Definitely couldnt be the explosive flamers or plasma gats. ü§£ü§£
---
Poesiden
---
They really need to add a level restriction to the event. No one under Lv50 gets in.
---
Meth.
---
It‚Äôs meth.
---
They are cooking meth.
---
Actually didnt know that about muffled with escapee artist, good to know! Still it would be as good as stuff like combat, worse than the other 2 normal top tier armors though, bcs shadowed and sneak effect. I feel like SS not having shadowed is an intentional balance thing, but yeah they might just add it then it would be the best for everything.
---
The improved sneaking effect does stack, it has diminishingg returns though.
---
Agreed about the fixer thing honestly. I just prefer maxxing per shot damage and honestly think the gauss is at least fairly competetive (10960 dmg per shot, without chems or revenant), i could get maybe 2-3k max out of a fixer. Fixer would still be more dps, and its sneak buff (which is literally 3 shadowed buffs if i remember correctly, it could be muffled but i think it was shadowed) is super nice too, but i disagree that non auto rifles cant be competetive with autos. 
---
(At least in live, in the pts where the damage curve is severely flattened, non auto rifles are worthless when compared to autos from what ive played, which admittedly isnt a tonne)
---
The transmog thing would be actually a great idea though, thatd be sick. I love the radium but it does suck that its just a flat downgrade to the handmade, which is a flat downgrade to the fixer (and the combat rifle should be in that chain somewhere but idk if its better or worse than the  radium).
---
I feel like the radium could really use a buff to its radiation damage, since rn its prett much negligible. Im not sure how id address the issue but honestly your idea sounds like itd be good.
---
Yes, this is the way.
---
A whole bottle of vodka will give you a strength boost, should help you get back up. Good luck, buddy! üëç
---
But you are carrying 120lbs.. Its your fat ass :D
---
Because I want my doors closed.  I used to think it was players leaving them open but then one day I was there when my doors on both sides opened at the same time.
---
No player and no mobs were around.  I'd come back from being gone for like 10 mins and the doors would be open after I'd close them.
---
It's definitely not just players leaving them open!
---
You can't. Sadly.
---
With the past PTS iterations they promised a free high level character, which for most of us never came, then they simply never mentioned the PTS test character again.
---
We also frequently ask them for a kind of cheat terminal to manipulate our characters to test specific things, or recharge perk coins once exhausted, or make another copy of our character from live servers, but we've never received much of an answer.
---
Somebody stole it. üò¢
---
That can't happen to often. There needs to be other variables in place or a lower chance.
---
That is really funny! :)
---
Am I the only one that wants more things that look like they belong in fallout and not a teenage dream of what a mansion should be?

Goddammit you guys i'm not fat! I'm big boned

Saved your comment for later :)

BEEFCAKE!

Happened to me today as well...
---
I didn‚Äôt know you could get cores at mount blair. Where at? The best places for cores are the three nuclear power plants btw. You can get like 3 per hour at each maybe more by powering up the power plant then the fusion generator outside.
---
Glad to help y'all

Use Sweetwater's special blend with herbivore and party boy/girl. Gives a massive perception boost.

I got no idea why would someone downvote a troubleshooting thread. Not that I'm butthurt, I just genuinely need some help.
---
Anti armor explosive and +1 agility.
---
Better then the explosive gatling i had.
---
And 3 star, old one 2 star
---
What a bummer.
---
I disagree. I think the bloodied/nerd rage/serendipity/unyielding combination is the game's prime and best class in the game, and every single one of them should be readjusted until it becomes 'bloodied, but with different twist'.  
---
In pre-PTS math, its either Bloodied, Junkies, or for niche situations - Quad.  
---
In post-PTS math, I honestly am not sure which of those is going to be the MOST UNIVERESAL: Bloodied, Junkies, Quad, Vampire, or Anti-Armor. Bloodied will remain the most powerful, it's only the 'most universal' that's not clear yet.  
---
They should follow the footsteps of bloodied in terms of building synergies for other perks. Berskerer is the one that demands the most care - this is the game's most dangerous playstyle (at least 300% more dangerous than bloodied, yet only deals 50% damage). If Berserkers were to be aligned with rest of the game, it should deal 200-300% bonus damage, not the laughable 50% it does for the sacrifice for being an actuall glass cannon. Whoever calls bloodbuilds glass cannons is wrong - they're either extreme tanks, or done incorrecly. Glass-cannon bloodbuild is self-contradicting term.
---
Highly informative.
---
It's all in the numbers. If you log in daily, you count towards the constant number of players.
---
Keep waiting like the rest of us, unfortunately. I -was- going to start an alt. Or should I say did. Now it's just a mule until this shit gets fixed because you can't progress the main story or wastelanders story without finishing OoP
---
I used to log in and load to a nuke zone with my camp being perfectly fine and undamaged (Whitesprings) and many flux farmers used to come around for a good time, scrapbox and radshower...
---
It's a new bug. I've loaded into a nuke zone before and my camp was fine.
---
Thx
---
They've got an ashtray, but no fat one burning away haha
---
It's called sales tactics, and you have it backwards. The way they have it now makes them more money than the way you wan't it to be. 
---
 As it stands, most new items are in the shop for 2 weeks. In those two weeks if you can't complete enough challenges (personal challenges not the nonexistent dailies, sad their gone) to earn the atoms, you're forced to buy atoms or not get it. 
---
This is a sales tactic that uses limited time to "scare" people into spending money. And it works, or they would have changed the formula.
---
(Ugh, everything I want is toward the end and theres a whole lot of useless-to-me fill in between. Gonna be even more of a drag than the last one :/ )
---
Funny
---
I‚Äôm about to launch one now. Pork Sword 00.
---
You are a brave soul trying to make a sane discussion about bloodied builds.  Please take my upvote.
---
Don‚Äôt even act like you wouldn‚Äôt eat that without influence you fat fuck
---
Man im tryna see this camp for sure
---
"  takes the junk from the event, and immediately goes to passive. "
---
Had you been passive he would not have been able to do that.
---
What you should do is be on the roof shooting in the air screaming in the mic saying, "get off my lawn".
---
Heh, I had a lvl 22 engage me at a workshop while I (lvl 135) was overencumbered, and I just hobbled away to my stash and he gave me a heart emoji. Nice guy
---
How does you're tse handmade break after 4 magazines? I can put 2k + rounds through mine and it doesn't break. But mine's an original pre nerf handmade. Got it about 3 weeks after release.
---
Yeah, I kinda hate it. Today I tried to launch a nuke from Site Charlie; first nuke run for this character and second I've ever done. And because everyone wants to do A Colossal Problem and therefore is nuking the Monongah Mine repeatedly, someone else speedran it or something (no one was there on the map when I started, so they must have started after I did) and launched the nuke from Charlie while I was still in the storage room. I Am Become Death is still sitting in my quest queue, not completed, and there were three different nuke site templates one on top of another over the mine. Really wish it required something other than a nuke so lower level players, or even just more casual players, could still get a chance to launch them.
---
Or you just look around before the whole camp loads in and see a hoard of flamethrowers hovering in the air.
---
I nuke bottle when i need to open it
---
He probably was shitting himself after seeing your level lol. Well, I‚Äôm glad this wasteland has peace
---
What happens is that Bethesda doesn't know how to fix the broken weapons, so they nerf everything in hopes that it works. And when it doesn't work, the nerf stays and things are still dying in less than a second. Then you have a pissed of playerbase that still strokes Bethesda's dick
---
Chefing it up
---
Magic is fixed on PTS
---
a chally and grahm plushie and also statue of them both together.
---
Who the hell uses fertilizer?
---
Milk is for fine tuning radiation and for +75 carry weight pepperoni rolls.
---
Careful ... after 8 you turn into a Bloated Glowing One ...
---
&gt; Whoever calls bloodbuilds glass cannons is wrong
---
Sure, they have some built in damage avoidance, but when they do get hit, it hurts, so glass canon is accurate.
---
Yaaaaaas
---
Aghh sheee now we done goofed
---
Not true. Punji boards can kill you even if you're passive
---
My base is a fortress.  It'd be silly to leave my security gates swung open.  I'm really proud of my base and I'd love if people saw it, but the RP is strong.  You're free to break in.
---
Traditional calzones dont have sauce in them also
---
Turn on pacifist mode, problem solved.
---
Yeah I like it because it has a giant smile
---
Iv'e killed the king already so just make sure to leave, I need the cow set.
---
But that‚Äôs not what was described here
---
I'm just a guy who tests/learns first and makes opinions later, not the other way around. But I do appreciate your support much!
---
Yeah but seeing as you can't stack them anymore (At least Beth said you can't) getting killed by them should not really be possible unless you are standing on them AFK.
---
Oh, I've been stocking up on nuke cards and have all night, tomorrow. You up for causing some mischief?
---
If he goes to passive does that eliminate your ability to get revenge?  It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve taken that off I have no idea how it works anymore
---
Legacy blueprints are a thing
---
Been adding to this post in favor of drills too
---
You're not wrong
---
it's a 10% chance. You're just unlucky it seems. if you're on xbone i could add one for you.
---
/facepalm
---
Wow.  Lets fix this problem but not really fix it.  Lets just stop it going forward and the people who were already doing it will retain the means to do it.
---
Classic Beth.
---
He‚Äôs more of a bullet sponge and the event is actually dangerous with the hazards. It‚Äôs a more satisfying fight as long as people put the Tesla‚Äôs away.  I‚Äôve come to accept the fact that I‚Äôm going to die a few times, but it‚Äôs fun. Queen fights can be more frustrating when she refuses to land.
---
I'm hoping that calculating damage efficiently is a first step towards fixing issues like "magic" damage as well as rubberbanding.
---
Or if the vending machines are impossible to find, it‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôs a trap camp. Very narrow hallways leading to the vending machines is another giveaway.
---
Buttered secret service armor, enemies slide off when trying to attack.  +1 Scent
---
OP never says if its PVP or punji that killed him. Since he said griefer I assumed punji
---
Nah. We both know ricochet dodgy serendipity ECT means not a glass cannon.
---
Source: am bloodied
---
The only context in which fullHP character can outtank lowHP character is PvP. In PvE, the damage ranges that monsters achieve don't ever let them do anything serious to a proper powerbloodbuild. They simply don't get into damage ranges where they could do anything meaningfull against properly DR-ed target.
---
You have to build your camp near a junk node or resource node. Those are around the map, apparently one is just east of vault 76. Then you will have the option to build one.
---
There‚Äôs at least 4 Motherlode units.
---
Hackers?
---
What's your intellect stat? Doesn't intellect increase chance of learning mods from scrapping? Did you try claiming the middle workshop in the ash heap? Did you rank up makeshift war?
---
It all depends on how you build your bloodied character. You can spec into a lot of damage resistances, and if you can get SS unyielding armor then you're even tankier! On top of this, you have herbivore with HP regen and +HP food, chems, mutations, etc.
---
Because this game was not made from the ground up to be like that. I get it, they advertised PvP and you want your PvP, but as the community has shown, most do not want PvP. We had dedicated PvP worlds and a ranking system for those who did the best in the worlds, and no one played those worlds. I played in those worlds a handful of times to earn the named guns that were offered and most players on those servers were either just trying to get the gun like me and playing the objective, or they were Minmaxed characters rushing around looking for other people to kill. Through it all many players just did not show interest in this.  
---
We do not have classes because we have perk cards, if you make classes you essentially make people commit to one play style for the game, no changing it as you go, no running multiple builds.   
---
As for raids we are working towards that already, Earl is pretty much a raid boss, spawning adds, creating stage hazards, limited raid size.   
---
Where would you put a clan hub? Foundation and Crater?   
---
You have this idea that sounds like a Fallout MMO, you want ESO reskinned for Fallout. I do not know if it would work. The people who play 76 are not looking for ESO, at least I am not. When I started 76 I was sniping for most of the time, then I switched to melee, then I switched to heavy guns and full auto, now I am back to melee. 76 offers freedom to experiment, to build your own style outside of a class structure and factions.
---
And this is the reason I don't take a pylon (or lately 3) until I've shot her. Even the hits you put on her, when she's in stealth, count. There's plenty of time to do this while the pylons are acquiring the target

Does armor sets ‚Äúmatching set of armor‚Äù refer to armor type or legendary type?

I'm up for a blast, all tonight and tomorrow. Gimme a shout, will be running Nuke Silos all night and tomorrow. I've got some nice Argentianian Wine and some fresh pajamas. Death awaits the Wasteland.

Mwhahahaha, now everyone has to buy my ammo!!!!!

‚ÄúAnd why does it look so human?‚Äù

It‚Äôs bugging me that the note itself is spelled incorrectly, but you wrote‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Äù. At the same time, I can‚Äôt bring myself to correct your... well... correct spelling... with the, er... correct incorrect spelling.

I built my camp on a monorail tower and the game sometimes randomly spawns people at the level of my camp in mid air. I thought about putting some spring traps to fling enemies that try and climb my stairs but I can imagine how pissed off people would be after spawning at my camp and falling several stories just to climb up and be thrown off. I don't want my camp nuked so I decided against it.
---
But not gauss rounds?
---
3/hr? wasn't that once 3/10min?
---
Imposter is just a run of a mill legendary but people think it is the holy grail of loot. Only worthwhile loot is the event drops.
---
Most people don‚Äôt know how the event works either, so while I would like to get one shot in on the Sheepsquatch. I‚Äôm almost fine with someone killing him quickly. 
---
I find myself running two pylons when I participate in this event now. People literally cannot read.
---
You can think of it as if the character added a directive that tells it to make gamma rounds
---
Why drop stuff? You have a stash! And a scrapbox if you‚Äôve got 1st.
---
No it's not?
---
The vaccine worked!
---
No, it's not nearly that bad
---
For the outside at least lol

Dumb hackers? My son is always yelling about dumb hackers when he plays a game.
---
Thank you finally someone noticed the problem and I was getting downvoted to hell in my previous posts
---
Maybe that‚Äôs what it is now. I haven‚Äôt done it in a long time but I thought it used to be 3/hour then it was changed to produce faster.

Transfering to friends without annoying trade screens.

Just get them from power armor that spawn in the world

Sounds great! I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll get to be on more tonight. If not, I‚Äôm definitely in for tomorrow!
---
He lying?
---
Unless you are bloody heavy in PA. If it's not a poison or fire, any incoming damage is more like "what was that sound?". So you got huge damage outcome and tank pretty good.
---
Will it though?
---
I thought creatures were still supposed to have minimum levels.  My assumption is that Earl / queen - would still be at least level 50;  if not 100.  No ?
---
My team had disconnect issues, and found that if you fast travel to a team member in the event, you can get back in.
---
I mean, I don't want to throw shade, but I haven't noticed a difference
---
Before I started Sofia, I returned to Beckett in his tightly whities. Just figured he didn‚Äôt like the Pioneer Scout uniform I put him in.
---
Please try and search for solution next time.  You either need to complete it on a private server or server hop to get it done.  Its been an on going issue since patch 21.  It may take several hops but it can be done.  The most I have heard is 25 minutes of hopping.  I

I clicked on my ulg in my stash, fast traveled to the event, pulled up my pip boy.. no ulg. Thanks server lag! Shit shotgun it is...
---
Ok good lol
---
No need to stack them, you use a trap and put the boards on top, active the trap and the boards get destroyes, then you place some more on the trap and repair the trap. Et voila, stacked again.
---
Now... if you still have blueprints of already stacked boards, it's insta death.
---
Intelligence is 8 and makeshift is 3. Havent tried claiming that workshop though, what does that do?
---
IMHO Sophia constantly repeating the same lines is nowhere near as infuriating as the Wanderer playing that same damn guitar riff over and over again!
---
private server or server hop to get it done.
---
My Sofia rocks the Nuka-Girl outfit hard.
---
I think its 8 per hour, but max of 3 in the processor
---
I appreciate the kindness but I wouldn't feel comfortable handing it over to someone without a guarantee of getting it back. Please don't take offense to that. Im still new and I see people posting that they got scammed everyday lol
---
Probably completely out of the question given the current engine, but I'd love to see some Road Warrior inspired stuff. Give us a large vehicle that is our main area to move around, lots of enemies in smaller vehicles trying to take it over, and the wasteland zipping by. We have to defend the vehicle for as long as possible, perhaps even getting it free of the pursuers.
---
That sounds more accurate. Can anyone confirm?
---
Oh so now you want the benefit of a backpack in PA. Some other person wanted the benefits of the chinese stealth suit in PA!
---
My last play through of NV i finally tried survival but the moment 8 started DM i turned it off üôÜ

" Or is a better tactic to just get in a few hits on Earl, then turn my  attention to keeping the spawns off teammates and stimpacking?  I can  nearly one-shot a spawn from a distance and with gun-fu can clean them  up pretty quickly. "
---
This.   Get in some damage so you can loot him, but one-shooting all the spawn and keeping them off the heavy hitters as we pour in the damage.....  the value can't be overstated.   Thank you!   Definitely, absolutely join if you can one-shot wendigos.
---
Picking up the gun is greater than shooting the gun which is greater than acquiring a key card

If you Tony want to take over/monitor the power plants, then hit the PA and generator spawn points.

Throw your melee weapon
---
I want a pony.
---
I suppose that makes sense.
---
But I also have to question this from a game design point of view. Rarely have I seen anyone use a gamma gun, but I‚Äôve seen plenty using a gauss weapon with the new endgame items.
---
Does it use durability when you use it?
---
Ooo, ok, thank you! This will help alot
---
Thank you it worked when I completed it with one of my other characters
---
But lower levels can go beat ass on the adds.
---
bungi jumping !
---
Noticed the same thing during meat week.  I can't say I have jumped off of anything so I'm not sure if that triggers it, but I was doing the Chally jump glitch that catapults you 30 feet into the air and would teleport back to the ground every time.
---
Not sure what the deal was.  I was just trying to get downed at the cookout for absolutely no reason and confuse people but I couldn't.  Wonder if it's a temporary thing until both of the meat weeks end?
---
Hi neighbor! I too am camped just north of Sunnyside Station and got nuked for the first time (my fault for not getting off the server faster). But finding a nuke zone at or near my camp has become a common occurrence. I hope they can figure out what is causing this.
---
Vampire minigun with an accelerated barrel.   It may not do terrific damage, but it keeps me alive while damage is ongoing.  :)
---
Well I only want what seems like it could logically follow. The Chinese stealth suit would only technically make you nearly invisible inside the Chassis, as it moves light around it to obfuscate your image. So you would obviously still see the Chassis. I don't really find my request logically incoherent like that. However you absolutely should be able to use the Hazmat suit effect of the Chinese suit inside PA. That one doesn't make sense either.
---
Search for underground camp glitch on YouTube. 
---
I generally prefer the stove option but the bass on a stair, while it can be finicky, can be more useful. 
---
Key is the graveyard is on a flat spot on top of a hill ... so you use the slope of the hill to glitch through, then build. Once I had foundations kinda where I wanted i replaced the bass with a weapon bench (it is tall) and then ultimately with a grognax throne as this is the character I have patterned after my wife and she's a funding boss .. so throne it is.
---
Yeah, thats cool. Im just saying, wow, what a nice guy!
---
One of my fears is if they cant fix magic heavy weapons or shotties they will nerf them to the ground and assume every one is running around w magic weapons
---
Plus the broader point is that the backpack is not really a benefit if every time you want to use PA you still need the equivalent perk in your build. I think that's the main issue I have.
---
Could not agree more.
---
Was doing ACP yesterday with 4 randoms two of which were  level 50ish and the other was 200ish.
---
Then one of the 50s pulls a Tesla and the frame rate tanks.
---
20 plasma cores and 1k plasma rounds wasted.

The funny part is we almost killed him but duo to bad performance we could not finish him......

how about a compromise. you lose any bonus carry  weight from the PA and you can have the effect of the backpack

&gt;finally fixing the game

The point is universal skins for weapon types with similar functionality. Don‚Äôt you want a screaming eagle skin for the fixer? Or the battle mace skin for your level 1 Grognak role play?

Ammo Factory
---
I actually done some testing with several of my magic heavy guns and I have a live vs PTS video proving it has been fixed but since people are disliking my first comment I'm not gonna bother posting it...
---
No, because the carry weight bonuses are base to the armour That's equivalent to saying if you put on a piece of armour with +1 strength, and you want a backpack as well then you should lose the +1strength. Logically the Chassis doesn't actually interfere with having a bag on. You fit inside it still, and it is a nuclear generated suit with plenty of power. I just don't see what the reasoning is. I kean there could be a reason they've done it that would totally make sense, but I don't see it except for wanting to make you need both options there
---
Also, items in display cases shouldn't take both stash space and camp budget.  This is really annoying.

Yep ever since the "bug fix " patch update screen pixelates or game freezes and crashes on PS4 too .

Please Miss Devan, don't forget about a stealth backpack skin so we can hide it if we don't like it. And also, smaller backpack designs, maybe pouches or bags.

This is correct. It generates 1 every 450 seconds with a capacity of 3. It fills up once every 22.5 minutes.

Haven't you heard? No fun allowed these days
---
Well, as long as you dont die, tag earl, and wipe out the wendigo spawns, we are happy. I have on several occasions experienced that. I know i have 3 minutes, so I take my time and show up when prepared. Had to let some lower level "borrow" my extra PA once. Was worried a lot i wasnt getting it back at the end. He did though. 
---
I saw it written here before, but having the stash box in the waiting area would be really nice.

Could you elaborate on what the "optimal" bloody melee setup is?

The old workshop glitch could get you around 150 in an hour in the divide. Too bad it got patched out

Because leave me alone that's why.  Don't use my stuff, leave me be

Yes. Depending on if they are sneaky commando bloodied are squishy; heavy gunner bloodied are somewhat tanky but still can die very quickly despite emergency protocol, etc

You‚Äôll be able to do it. I did the same thing. Slaughtered the lot. Once I got done to with raiders they forgave me.

Can't be modded

What was the rest? I missed it with the delete

THANK YOU!  I had been stuck at that ruddy point for a week.

I‚Äôve done this with my zelots explosive lever action too, not sure if it‚Äôs a damage calculation or just a bug with the mob

Get FO1st and use a private server

If that doesn't work, you might need to revalidate your install
---
I just be like "welp this is what it looks like"
---
The collectron collects at a slower overall rate. So with just one you get more from the extractor but end of day "why not both?" governs most people who want all the junk possible
---
1. Yes. Use the Scrapper perk card when you get it
---
2. If you see a random Stash box - yes. Not workbench
---
I talked about how in fo76 the pepperoni roll gives you carry weight, but after eating 4 i could hardly walk so i slept on the sofa. So yes, fallout lied to me
---
On my main probably agility and luck, follow through, far flung fireworks, take one for the team
---
Or, give us mods for the arms, legs, or torso to mimic the effects of the backpack options. Grocer‚Äôs torso / chemist‚Äôs torso? Lose the jet pack.   Grocer‚Äôs leg / chemist‚Äôs legs? Lose calibrates shocks.
---
As much as I appreciate this, I would still like the game to run in fullscreen mode, got anything for that?
---
1. Yes you can, they have a chance to let you learn how to make mods for them when you do this as well
---
2. No, all it does is break down junk and leave it in your inventory. Example: Globe -&gt; Screws, cork and whatever else
---
Metal Cot, 400 caps.
---
"Oh, you found his locket. Thank you. So.. what happened?"
---
Well... Someone launched a nuke that slowly uh.. rumbled 7 boulders out of the way. Then 3 guys in power armor unloaded more laser beams then I could count into this 3 headed monster that was trapped down there. I spent half the time running from endless wendigo spawns cause my guns don't kill them fast enough. Then, as the monster died I by chance found your dads locket in the back of the cave.. Then tried running out of it as more wendigos chewed on my ass to collect a small amount of ore from a chest before the cave recollapsed again, somehow. I didn't even find a cool helmet, just another harpoon gun.
---
"Wow. Here's 60 bottlecaps. Guess my dad never made it out of that cave."
---
Nope.. haha, certainly didn't turn into a 3 headed giant terror wendigo. Ha... ha.
---
Hi again, thanks but unbelievably I found the plans I needed..  you're a good man for offering. I appreciate it üëçüèª
---
hey, you still available for transfer?
---
Your connection to that server is unstable. It‚Äôs possible you could have experienced that multiple times until you switched servers.
---
Yeah! I‚Äôm actually on my private right now. GT is OrangJELO add me. What‚Äôs yours so I can add you back?
---
This has just made me realise why all of sudden my raider camp is always completely broken, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm fairly close to monongah mine. But yeah my camp is always broken whenever I log in, even when I don‚Äôt see a nuke on the map at all.
---
1. Where do I do that?
---
2. Ok but it does put it in my global inventory I can access anywhere?
---
All crafting stations are linked to both your stash box and junk box(fo 1st).
---
I‚Äôm down! Feel free to join. I‚Äôll be playing for an hour or two more tonight and then a little in the morning.
---
Honestly there should be faction paint for every type of armor. The work is like 80% done for BoS and the Enclave, they had great faction armor paints from the Creation Club, and Bethesda has shown it has no problem using that stuff. 
---
LET ME REP THE ENCLAVE GODDAMNIT
---
Thats a relief! Lol i havent decided who to side with or anything, ive barely even done anything for foundation &amp; im only like level 35 &amp; kind of stuck not being able to do any of my current quests i have or going any further exploring. I feel like this is the first fallout game ive played despite having started (and never stopped) playing with fallout 3 12 years ago lmao. I have only met one other raider who wasnt hostile but whichever s.p.e.c.i.a.l i needed to continue the convo with him wasnt high enough. I feel so lost with this game honestly. Ive been trying to just keep leveling up by dping events &amp; what not but idk.
---
1. Any work bench that gives you a scrap option. Just go to the weapon/armor and select the one you to scrap
---
2. Your stash is the only place to store them
---
mines big mounch
---
Yeah. They're making this game super easy to appease the casuals. Way too watered down for a survival game.
---
Is it now? I'll have to dig out some old guns then
---
Latency is what is giving some of us "magic powers" and that is really difficult to fix.
---
First thing I do when logging in is taking Charleston landfill. 3 trash deposits, copper, aluminum, and a large water purifier already set up. It‚Äôs one of the best workshops in the game.
---
Maybe upgrade your PC? It‚Äôs not an issue much on consoles, so you might be screwed apart from first
---
I‚Äôm trying to get a TSE combat shotty so I can finally feel powerful lmao
---
That's because you're hitting magical damage with a gun that cannot handle it yet. It basically acts like a shotgun so you either need magical legendary trait(which the cursed harpoon doesn't have),or need one piece of armor with the perk resist 15% crippling(correct me on this o don't recall). With the armor the magical damage should stick and you should pretty much one shot anything with that damage.
---
When will it be added? Tf
---
Got a chuckle out of that one! Too bad it got removed :(
---
Just be careful it ain‚Äôt bub buths fault
---
Hiya buddy, thanks for offering to help out, I got a couple plans today that really helped me out so I've been good to go all day today, if I need a hand and struggle in future I'll save your name in my friends if that's ok ?
---
OMG!..I run a comic shop, I use the RR PA skin , I could Rp as a secret super hero, " Is that a nuke I hear? oh no someone has summoned the SBQ! Fear not people for I Flongle will save you DA DA DAAAAA " (whooshes off into the sky from my secret base" .... AP runs out and comes crashing down only moments later...... :P
---
Heard this awhile back. Something about dealing to much damage at once, or something like that. Happened using my explosive shotgun too.
---
Sometimes I do that when the owners are watching, the visible look of confusion some of them give as they look at you and then the window is glorious.
---
Even currently without a patch it just doesn't work sometimes.  Not saying you are wrong or anything but the conflicting reports have me curious now as to what the hell is actually going on.
---
My first and only player kill was when I was vendoring stuff at a train station.
---
The other person kept meleeing me to get me off the vendor.
---
I was level 20, they were 60.
---
So when I exited the menu to see what was going on, then ran to the vendor.
---
So I put 2 shotgun shells into the back of their head, grabbed their scraps, and server hopped.
---
I've got one, and it felt NICE during the TSE hayday. But my bloodied magic combat just outperforms on every level
---
Nope. The item is in game, plan is unobtainable
---
Yes please!
---
Heavy vampires weapons work well if you have a good one.
---
Bethesda has never shown any ability to understand what motivates human beings. In turn, this causes them to invent the dumbest "solutions" to problems that emphasize flash over sense.
---
I got a wanted bounty for unlocking someones ammo factories. I immediately pulled all my armor off, jumped to a person i recognized(had done trades with him before) and waved to him. He must have been busy, because he ignored me. Ran up to another person near by, he was on point and killed me after a little prodding. 
---
Jumped back to the camp with the factories and just kept running about collecting the ammunition, wanted level free since the guy didnt kniw they were unlocked. 
---
In many cases, killing a person with a wanted level is a benefit. I had no armor to lose durability. I was shopping so i had no junk on me. So chase those wanteds. You might be doing them a favor.
---
It puts it in your inventory that you carry around with you. Your stash is different and can be accessed from any stash box (at train stations, red rockets, camps
---
You can‚Äôt store anything in a workbench. You can only use them to break down junk, weapons, armor or to mod or craft gear
---
I‚Äôve seen 3 and even 5 but I‚Äôve never seen 10 for ballistic rounds. That‚Äôs insane.
---
Here's an idea, stop complaining. Play a different game. I will never understand why so many people come here just to bitch. Dont like it? Dont play it. It's a very simple concept.
---
To expand on what they wrote.
---
1. You get basic materials from scrapping weapons and armor. You get a higher quantity of those basic materials with the scrapper perk card.
---
2. Workbenches where you can craft stuff, you can break down the junk you are carrying into scrap. Scrap weighs less thank the junk, so it's beneficial to do this. Stash boxes is where you can store stuff and access from any stash box. Basically character storage.
---
The secret service is part of the enclave in a sense, well that's my excuse for wearing the underarmor instead of the BoS officer one lol.
---
But I do get your point, we need more enclave stuff released, there's apparently a load of enclave stuff already in the data-mines it just hasn't been put in for some unknown reason
---
Great! I‚Äôve just finished my pvp build. Not sure if it‚Äôs gd. I use stealth boys and run full assasins sentinels armour.  I use je laser and qffr Tesla. I may snipe u from a far ot I may use a stealth boy and get close.   I use lone wanderer And dodgy and serendipity and born survivor to tank stray bullets people fire at me when I‚Äôm using a stealth boy. My build works quite well and I haven‚Äôt died to pvpers I met in the open so I‚Äôm interested how this will go
---
pvp = quantums and stealth boys using explosive plasma. no thanks.
---
Ram is one of the better and more useful contributors around here. I'd trust him. But dont trust me, I'm here for shenanigans.
---
Awesome, is it magic?
---
Shotgun bug.
---
It regains like 90% (or some high %) of the damage dealt.
---
Why it occurs, I'm not completely sure, but you are likely in the general area. Too much damage, server thinks it's weird and negates most of it.
---
If I look on the map and see someone‚Äôs dot on my camp, I always wait until they‚Äôre gone before fast traveling back.  Sort of pathetic.
---
"For the crime of creeping everyone out in JCPenneys......."
---
Don‚Äôt think so
---
Try scraping it to learn mods.......
---
Dont do it .sorry I had to
---
The secret service in the enclave (ie Frank Horrigan) is different from 76's secret service. You can flout your General title to the AC in the vault and he basically tells you to kick rocks. 
---
I just want black armor tbh
---
I tried it twice &amp; it finally worked, You‚Äôre a absolute legend, Thank you for taking the time to help.
---
Sometimes I potter around my camp doing stuff moving things making stuff "just right" and I like to do that in peace with the radio playing, not with some knob head just standing there making the place look untidy or stomping around ruining my ambience, but most of the time people are welcome to to use whatever I have.
---
I think the best aspect of my camp is that Grahm‚Äôs route takes it right down the middle of my camp. So it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs one of his regular stops for trading.
---
Gamma rounds were popular during the Survival era. Very effective against bloody builds.
---
No they expect you to buy the stupid repair kits
---
Are you using a laptop?
---
Heh its fine i didn‚Äôt.
---
Nonono I'm sure they are working on it. Give the small indie dev credit it's only been two years since the game came out! /S
---
The ironic Wasteland ü§£
---
Some better beard options for men would be nice.  Even the longest option seems pretty short.
---
My uncle is a dev and he didn't fix it.
---
Oh sorry, by just I meant I literally just have one. My bad.
---
Yes I am. It runs other games just fine, even in various display modes
---
I hear if you stand on a spike board trap in your CAMP that you can trigger it and it'll send you flying in the air
---
I run a bloodied UNY build and made my CAMP at the diner in the toxic valley. There's a pie machine in there and let's just say i gathered more pies than anyone should have before moving. I've given them out to newbies, sold them in my vendor and still have a bunch. Sometimes i worry Beth will think im duping them for some reason üòÇ
---
Definitely get hits in for loot then crowd control
---
Probably fry me but we will give it a go lol I'm just finishing setting my guy up. I don't play as much anymore, how long before you're ready or are you waiting on me?
---
That would be great. the styles tab content has been so dry everybody‚Äôs gonna be rocking the same new fit just like when new iPhones release. unless they release a hairstyle bundle for us to buy w atoms of course, then there‚Äôs some variety. Even then I don‚Äôt expect much. Because everything we ask for ends up in the shop. From fridges to robots to wallpaper.
---
No, but more things will become available to buy as you increase rep with the factions.
---
Mine don't if I logout or FT the lights I switch off stay off until I switch them back on again?
---
Perhaps use the old photomode wall glitch to pass thru? Lol
---
Amen brother.....OR sister.  I don't know.
---
No. Charisma is for things like death tambos, guitar swords, and war drums. Maybe a violin crossbow could be added.
---
To be exact, I got it 6 days ago
---
Il be like 10 hours üòÇ
---
If you have any discord overlays, steam overlays, Xbox overlays, turn them off.
---
Or Just relocate
---
tips: just hit the sheepsquash before activating the pylons. this wont hurt him at this point but you will register the kill.
---
Lol  I thought you were jumping on now lol
---
I don't use any. Running it from the bethesda launcher and steam isn't even running in background
---
Ye sorry :( I‚Äôm just a bit tired mate :(
---
Do you overclock?
---
Yes it does. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
Nope, should I?
---
Or at least give us the ability to embarrassingly explode through our roof with the jetpack.
---
Also when I die from fall damage while using the jetpack I want a custom death animation that ends with just my legs sticking straight out of the ground.
---
Is Grelok a |STAND| user?
---
100% no. I don't have the challenge complete and I've probably picked up over a thousand in NW.
---
No worries man, just give me a shout tomorrow. I definitely want to fight your guy. Sounds like it would be a good fight
---
It came from the same Factory where BumbelBee was created!
---
I am also curious about this
---
Light Footed Perk card.
---
Hopefully the BoS gives us new plans to make PA more diverse
---
I think bloody is performing just fine on the PTS.  The problem is that sniper rifles no longer have any punch.  Commando and heavy gunner are both great, junkies/bloody/whatever because of rate of fire.
---
Unless everyone is fine with single shot rifles, bows, revolvers, etc completely falling out of the picture, slow RoF weapons need to have their base damage buffed in order to be viable again.
---
I‚Äôm concerned that everyone interested in end game play will be forced into some kind of automatic weapon.  Right now my rifleman works very well, but on the PTS he‚Äôs complete garbage and needs to swap into commando perks.
---
Pleasantville reference?

The robot absorbed the fury and hatred of everyone around it and unleashed it in a giant bomb of justice.

Well played, robo.

Adrenal reaction, twisted muscles, all two handed melee damage perks, bloody mess, martial artist and the one perk that makes melee ignore 75% armor

Seriously?
---
Motherlode continues to exist in the game already though. Theres a Motherlode in Breach and Clear and another that can be used as a free fast travel to fixed points from The Deep. Regardless of who you side with, Motherlode to some capacity is still operational and existing within the game so using it to activate the ACP event is possible.
---
And while you make a very good point about a nuke being the vehicle to restrict how often its run, theres no reason they cant put a cool down on it like other events such as Riding Shotgun, Encryptid etc.
---
The nuke star is silly and as the op has pointed out it runs against the established "lore". The overseer left tapes that berated players for using nukes willy nilly so using one to reclaim a watch for some rando is definitely not part of your purpose.
---
Nope just a furious 25 90
---
Why? They can‚Äôt do anything to your stuff
---
My ammo ranges from 1-10.  Deal with it.  :P
---
5-10 is for the rarer ammo types though.
---
Ganja you can get up to 9 if you go throghe the train yard at mount blair if you do battle bots the big bot drops 2-0 and there are two power armors and 5 genaraters going up to mount blair

Cow gib milk.  Milk make food.  Happy tummy.

Top priority is ammo factory then legendary endurance probably.   Edit: what exactly does "coming soon" mean anyway?  If they don't announce a precise date,  I just assume it's never coming out.  It's just a method I've developed to insulate myself from disappointment. And if they do announce a precise date then I don't expect it to be released on that date, but weeks, maybe months later.   Bottom line: I take announcements about upcoming content with a grain of salt.

Yeah man, junk extractors are where it's at
---
Gotta give em credit im level 50 and i havent tried yet.
---
I agree I see no nerf. Just a balancing hint. I don‚Äôt care too much tho, I‚Äôll still kill shit like normal man
---
Give the cow your Chinese Stealth Suit so it can graze at your camp cow-vertly.
---
Gotta keep those bovine under cow-ver.
---
nooooo you can't just not complain no, thats not allowed. stop accepting bethesda, nooooo, you need to complain about balance, but how are you going to one shot scorchbeasts now?
---
I have a bad memory and only know the power armor locations in mount blair
---
I do too, just google it and write up a list
---
It is absolutely there. It's on another part of the roof ABOVE the painting stuff.
---
‚ÄúOne time‚Äù?  I must have picked a popular spot because I get ‚ÄúYour CAMP could not be placed‚Äù pretty much every day haha. Usually just choose another world but sometimes like to see what others have built. Still think mines the best lol

I was politely asking for feedback. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. I did not violate any rules that this subreddit has.  The internet community creates the forums. So therefore, I am allowed to ask for these types of feedback. It‚Äôs a post related to fo76. I am asking for information that I possibly don‚Äôt know about. Also. it‚Äôs a smarter move to ask someone for his / her experience from the bunker bundle. I don‚Äôt understand why you people feel so big when you call someone a kiddo. Good God.
---
I just don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not like anyone would be able to find their way in anyway
