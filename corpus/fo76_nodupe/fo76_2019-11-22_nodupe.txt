I really hope so. I sent them a follow-up message to the ticket just to be safe. That loss of flux was really rough.
---
---
---
Yeah, i run a .44 bloodied ffr les vats cost and i love it for my detective character but i bet i could do way better with a western.
---
Yes. My friend lost like 200lbs of junk. Now he has more than 3x the vault steel i have farmed and he's never stepped foot in the raid
---
I don't have an unlimited stash, but I do have an alt character with 18,000 carry weight of junk on her, including 3,000 of each flux and some 4,000 ballistic fiber, so if I *did* have unlimited, I would have junkbox'd that and lost it all.
---

---
600 Vault steel doesn't even touch that value.
---
For the pistols I run a 3,2,1 on the main cards
---
Aligned mods and the -25% vats = basically unlimited vats so you can skip action boy. Add some ultra light armor if you need a little more ap
---
In order to determine if more damage was done than good, you'd have to actually weigh the good. This is just a complaint.
---
Scrap box would NEVER cause lag server issues... the increase count of different items types would - the scrap box doesn't do that.
---
This is why ask money for the scrapbox was noted as a scam, because is a marketing presenting a solution for a problem that doesn't exists.
---
I'm not a FO1ster and I'm pretty sure my scrap takes about the same amount of server resource as yours, even if you are a scrap manic.
---
Having multiples chars thou, increase the used server resources...
---
in the end, people without the subscription uses more server resource by the use of mules than FO1sters with all stuffs on same char stash...
---
Yup. I logged in last week and my bolstering powered marine chest piece with wwr was gone.  It went poof. I was thinking of submitting a ticket, but I know I will get nothing good back..... was not in my stash box. It actually disappeared from my character. Still irritated.
---
Yeah, it's not every subscriber. I never received notice of anything. And I think I lost scrap on my alt.
---
If they did allow stuff like this in the atom shop then we could finally get the ghoul mask from FO3
---
Yes I just got done with one, about 8 lv 50 players joined, so you know they weren't doing much damage. It still went down as easy as in private.
---
Bethesda is not in a position to be anything but overly generous to its paying customers.
---
Do you use Bloody Mess?
---
Yes I am one of those people, who understand this Is a game &amp; the only way to make it better is yo submit tickets. 
---
What have they done to everyone? Made a game  that you either like or dislike?
---
A legendary raider once one shot my level 200 character with a glass rifle In nuka world and to this day I wonder what effect he had.

---
You would love the power.
---
the problem is most people like to complain, i mean, they Really get off on it. 
---
hate makes you feel all warm and alive, and the birth of the web was the perfect thing to get those types to be able to brain nut as hard and as often as they want.
---
Something like that would be kinda cool for a lengthy quest, and only useful one a certain spot im the map or if you get to close the cover is blown. 
---
Similar to the watoga quest.
---
Yes?  Could you explain for those of us who don't even know what "ArmA" is?
---
Yes it was overly generous, but hopefully it's the start of something good.
---
We all know there will be similar bugs in the future. Let's hope they treat the next one in a similar way.
---
How much damage per shot habe you been able to pull of?
---
https://youtu.be/WXvciKOS8hQ?t=24
---
Not every Fallout First user got this as of yet, including people who actually lost items
---
Nice, I’ll be on the lookout for one. I’ve got 3 characters with 1000 scrip each. Maybe Mama Murghr will be good to me during the sale (not holding my breath)!
---
Not every Fallout Firster got this though
---
Budget intensive but awesome!
---
Im a 1st member and recieved no email or junk. Im also pretty salty that a couple of people on my friends list that have never done the raid now have much more vault steel than i have farmed in months
---
ArmA is a milsim.
---
\+1 I agree with this , kinda sad the PVP in adventurer mode is not balance and someone cant shoot SB in 1 hit , imagine kill NPC in 1 hit just not fun
---
Dies that mean the SBQ should be a lot easier to kill with that wooden armor?
---
Nice. I might give that a try.
---
Yes... Yes it is. But thank you:) 
---
I made a small blueprint and included 2 variations.
---
Someone on my discord literally showed a letter and a screenshot showing 600 vault steel.
---
lol wow so many posts about this in a short time. Not every Fallout Firster got this. I'll let you know if I get one OP
---
Learn to read. u/Nino_Furioso said "Nothing like good communication!", yes we need bugfixes, but the real problem has been the lack of communication.
---
Most of them did
---
Yeah but I have Fallout First and didn't lose anything, haven't gotten this pity package
---
Dont forget, with a pistol build, bolt pipes can double dip with rifle!
---
Yeah I know, post wasnt finished sorry. 
---
I recieved the bounty of goods, just thinks its hilarious though 😂
---
How do you know most of them did though?
---
They do apparently have a match for the HH Desert one though, so who knows?
---
Cheaters?
---
Pay more?
---
Please...do tell me more about these so called Cheaters.
---
The Scrap Box minimizes server resources by limiting what can be placed inside to a fixed list of items. All the server has to look at is how many of each item you have.
---
A stash box is much more server-intensive. You can put a much wider variety of items into a stash box (unique weapons, armors, etc) that cannot be handled with a fixed list.
---
Characters don't increase server load. The server only has to handle your active character. You cannot swap characters in real time because the server doesn't load every character on your account.
---
See? Something for everyone!
---
It's fine as it is, this game is not PvP focused thank God.
---
Same here
---
Yes it beats a blank
---
That's good for that person. I lost a lot of stuff. An entire year's worth of flux, and other mats. I haven't received anything even though I was supposed to (according to an email). 
---
The other mats that come with it don't even come close to meeting the stuff I lost. I know I'm not the only person who lost that much.
---
Doesn't matter no one lost 600 vault steel its bullshit
---
People who lost all their scrap in the scrapbox are getting bulk junk as compensation.
---
Highest offer for mine is 25k and I can't take any more caps
---
Was it ever really fixed? I encountered it right after the January patch where they "fixed" it, and tested it out to still have it happen pretty much every patch after that. Then with vault raids, it came back to the same horrifying levels it used to be before the original fix
---
&gt; I find it strange that they’re so open about how bugged the game really is
---
What an odd thing to say.
---
I agree with that, but if it wasn't vault steel to complain about it would have been the 1500 pounds of flux
---
Ahh well I have the caps but if you can't sell its fine.
---
Where's our pity? Can't even rub two caps together rn. My atom wallet has dust in it
---
How does it affect you?
---
i usually only get to play late at night when the wife and kids are asleep and people leave me alone, that doesn't happen if I'm talking into a cheap mic.  and it's hard to really roleplay when most everyone communicates in pantomimes anyway.  I was going to get myself high lever, build a shop, and roleplay a shopkeeper originally, but then the extremely limited time I have to play, combine with the introduction of vending machines just kind of made that plan peter out.
---
Agreed! I’m just used to them either making no statement at all or vastly underselling the reality of the bugs
---
Who cares? have you even run the vault once successfully?
---
Fake news, It's patched already, It has been for a while
---
And a middlefinger one. Would prob be my most used.
---
Nice! Needs an animation similar to the homemade bunk beds in Step Brothers.
---
im against doing this.   but i would like my items to count for less
---
Ya.. I have fallout 1st too and I got diddly.
---
Yes. A few times with friends. 
---
So, if all of your farmed materials went poof from a bug, you wouldn't be uspet? Everything. From day 1.
---
Doesn't really bother me that I'm not getting it. 
---
I didn't have any interest in the vault steal or whatever and I have more scrap than i will ever know to do with at this point.
---
Yeah i was talking with the fella above he gave a solid good reason why somone would state that the bug re-emerged
---
You obviously haven't ran the vaults...
---
That's a golden idea. Just have a bunch of people doing a hyped up dance 😂 Thanks :)
---
The funny thing is that my first BE Western came from Purveyor. Its actually the reason I have a pistol character and its amazing.
---
Makes me think the story is either being embellished a bit or they're releasing these in waves
---
I added an Edit a while ago at the bottom saying that I would rather them count for less instead of increasing the Budget as I didn't realize what I was saying until after lol
---
My 2 NW builds actually match perfectly with my 2 Adventure PvP builds.
---
oh Haha.  i was just trying to be an a hole but thanks!
---
&gt; Main issues are that the scrapbox should be for everyone
---
Why?
---
At certain points I've reached 3k with headshots and sneak. I'll need to test with Adrenaline and Revenant with some chems.
---
I might as well not run the next vault and just wait for someone to lose their stuff
---
No.. because I didn't store vault steel in the lootbox they added haphazardly to the game because I didn't expect it to work right away. Have you seen the timeline from Gizmodo about how broken historically this game has been?
---
Okay. Wow. That is a lot.
---
1) They can do the Standard and Expert faster without you in the group so...🤷‍♀️
---
2) You are a liar. You tried to get her arm so you could buy a weapon specifically an AAE gatling laser from someone. 
---
3) If you are an "aristocrat" too stop looking down your nose. You gave into what you cried about. Hypocrite. 
---
4) I don't care about that last bit because (a) it has nothing to do with anything that I have said. (b) I haven't been defending BGS. I think they are greedy. However...BGS is NOT the devs who have families to support and spend countless hours working on this game to fix things and try making it better. YOU are lumping in the small folks in with the CEOs. That seems more elitist than any person I've seen yet who has Fallout 1st.
---
Whaaat how is that possible!? That amazing!! Teach me your ways xD
---
I don't care about the scrap &amp; will give most of it away to my son, if i do get it. He mainly just uses the game as a building simulator with the occasional queen fight, 
---
Yes it is over generous, but let's hope the next bug that causes similar is treated in a similar way.
---
Be that for fo1st or not.
---
If in the future if a similar non fallout 1st bug occurred &amp; they did not recompensate in a similar way, then I'd understand an outcry.
---
Receiving the junk or not - I see it as a step forward
---
a guy in my discord lost 548 vault steel so it's entirely possible someone lost 600+ of the steel
---
Theres a post where someone said he got an email about the scrap reward without even losing anything.
---
Oh a post of 1 person claiming he is getting it means most got it? Cool
---
I didn't get anything either.
---
One person is basically the opposite of most. I'm sure more than one person did, but until I and people I know got it, I'm guessing it's a minority of players receiving this
---
And they are murder machines with them.
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/dielectric-flux/video/81971764
---
It murdered everyone trying to fight the queen, and every time we killed on scorched, another would pick it up off the corpse, and keep using it.
---
I've been playing since Day 1 and reporting bugs to them since Day 1. Which is why losing materials collected since Day 1 is so damaging. 
---
If you stash box suddenly deleted everything, you wouldn't be upset? Bethesda assured people it would work. It did for many. It didn't for some. They fixed the bug, they're trying to compensate people as an apology.
---
It feels like less of a grind because you'll tend to have the materials on-hand when you need them as long as you are diligent about collecting stuff as you play normally.  There is no weight concern, so you don't need to sit there contemplating if you actually need a material or not - you just take it.
---
Ok, but I still see no explanation of how it handles mods in a multi-user game.
---
That's what the OP was saying.
---
Kinda want a pity pack after everyone posted about it. But I'm kinda selfish tbh. I'd be fine with someone's 1500 flux being up for trade lol, don't care about vault armor much
---
There is so much to say about this game that is negative but honestly it really comes down to one question; Is Bethesda capable of making a top-tier game anymore?
---
After making these games for years and years, they still haven’t been able to get their products up to the same standard as the rest of the industry. Why do they have so many bugs and unfinished games? Why do they still have the sam bug issues they were prevalent in Morrowind and Oblivion. It’s pure laziness and must be incredibly embarrassing. 
---
Now take one of these poorly designed, almost broken, barely finished games, and remove all content and you now have Fallout 76. Haha
---
Never mind all the lying about the game, the paid subscription after saying there wouldn’t be one, scrapbox bug and also even making an unlimited scrap box. At least %75 of this subreddit are bug reports, the rest are subscription complaints. 
---
If Bethesda wants a happy and healthy customer base, they should make a finished product, with as few bugs as the rest of the games in the market.
---
 **Sliding Enemies:** Some of you have encountered enemies like Ghouls and Scorched that occasionally glide rigidly over the terrain. While that’s eerie in its own way, 
---
I'm gonna miss this.....
---
That's true, haha. Honestly, I wish they just made all junk weightless from the start (when stashed).
---
You know the name of the game, look it up.
---
Once I suspected they would be nerfing Bloodied PvP builds, I did exactly the same thing with one of my mules 😂. Got it to level 110 in Adventure by playing NW. My NW character is around 129.
---
Something like Swrord Art Online's Christmas Boss?
---
yeah, makes me wonder why bother naming a character in the first place
---
You're good xD I didn't even notice honestly, I'm used to people not reading everything as I usually don't either lol I enjoy skimming and miss a lot usually.
---
I say, Fallout 4 is still a thing. One may wonder why and i have an answer: mods. Modified game allows me to do with settlements everything i want and this is what i like in F4.
---
Also, your hit box should be just as minuscule as the Liberators.
---
yeah, but those are names you find in any MMO, usually ends up being someone obnoxious anyway
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
but would still be for a character name being displayed, I have 2 diff characters, I named them different names, what's everyone see? my account name
---
Coming soon to the atom shop for 2000 atoms!  You asked for it!
---
I shall teach you. Full Unyielding, BE western, Bloody Mess, Adrenaline 5, Revenant, as many pistol perks as possible(2 maxed and 1 basic), Pistol Accuracy perk, Gun Fu, Concentrated Fire 3. That's some of them.
---
As much as it is and I still play it, I would love to play with friends and build things aswell! 
---
Hence why this is in the Fo76 reddit but yeah, trust me I mod the VR version all the time and love it to death but sometimes you need some friends to accompany you in the wasteland lol
---
Same here! Both our builds are very similar. But I think in NW, you can lean heavily on a variety of the SPECIALS and still get a decent NW build.
---
The difference between first class and economy.
---
Survival was more or less what i originally thought the game would be, i wanted to live in a cabin in the forest, i thought food and drinks would actually matter but no. So yeah, my cabin survivalist dreams were shattered upon launch, i had hope again when survival mode came out but it wasn't even close to what i wanted actually.
---
Oh my God it's not a secret
---
No one even knew this game was coming out. I don't have any pity for the day one crowd, who cares? You think you're more important than the rest of the playerbase because you didn't understand what an alpha or beta phase of a video game is?
---
Thank you! Exactly what I was looking for!
---
Updating the Description of the post with this and your name!
---
But yeah, we can only hope it comes with wastelanders, I know I'll keep playing if it does!
---
I haven’t received anything either. Looking at the forums many people who didn’t lose things are getting the compensation pack though. So I’m not sure if all original 1st people get it or what? I got it day 1 and not sure if I lost stuff on any characters. It would be kind of shitty maybe if some and not all get this.. I haven’t decided if it’s something to be upset about. But your you might be right, it could be waves because some received an email and haven’t got it yet either
---
I have al the perks mentioned but revenant as i play alone and the accuracy per as i dont run a scope.
---
Does revenant trigger with the misterious stranger or life saving revives??
---
But how would that be equivalent to 3k damage??
---
Day 1 release isn't supposed to be a beta phase. The game got a decent amount of press pre-release too. *I'm* the one confused by what a beta or an alpha is? Those come before release...
---
If you ever lose your equipment or items in the game, glad to see you don't think Bethesda should fix it.
---
If you can use both commando and gorilla together stacking the effect of a bloodied 10mm smg. I enjoy my pistol alt.
---
Well, that combo really gave players an unbeatable edge in PVP. Can't have that... I mean, come on... a blinky red light neck thing AND A shiny skullface gas mask? Noone needs that kind of unbridled power.
---
Bullshit
---
Any luck mate? I'm interested but sadly I could not do it this evening unless it's a bit later
---
on a related note to camp budget: my most recent build is a 4 square 1 story box that has living quarters, vending room, and a lounge area.  so camp budget hasnt been an issue these days.  thought id go with a minimal approach
---
You can have a public beta, many video games have. I've been part of multiple public beta and alpha development video games.
---
I'm a Fallout Firster and I didn't get it, should I be upset? I'm not, but all these posts about it is making me think I should be. Tbh I'd be happy if some of that flux ends up on the player market lol
---
Its not like u can build the armor unless uve learned the plans which u have to do the raids to do so unless u did the raids before its useless. Also not pay to win theres no advantage of it
---
Definately, I've gone through probably 6 different builds with this character. I have enough banked levels in adv, that I can change all my points around almost at will.
---
Yeah, same happened to me. I unequipped it. Then when I went to put back on it was gone.
---
Yes, public betas come before release. 76 had a public beta. Then it ended....when the game released.
---
If you truly have been a part of multiple, you'd understand the difference between the words "release build" and "beta build".
---
So just move opinions YOU deem not ok elsewhere?
---
What a nice gateway drug to censorship you are.
---
Revenant triggers on any revive. For me the 3k was a Headshot critical. I'll have to sign in later and check.
---
Lol hure durr ok. 
---
Except I lost both of those as well.
---
Yes to both, played a life-saving build for a little while
---
Ty! Ill give it a go then
---
Get the regular bunk bed plans, build one and then put a sleeping bag on the top bunk...
---
Ight, i just cant see how to sneak with revolvers tho.
---
Stop crying no one cares
---
I don't think so at all. I think the game just isn't set up for having fun while roleplaying. It is essentially just a shooter in which you collect stuff, and oh yeah you can do emotes and build very strictly defined buildings that only essentially do anything for you.
---
It’s happened to me a few times in the last couple of days.
---
Like I said IDGAF about fluc, it's the Vsteel that's got me livid.
---
Do you think a handmade w/ FFR would be able to pull this off?
---
Same here. I don't think many people will receive that package since there nevere were lots of complaints about that issue here. And it'd be kinda stupid if all subscribers would receive free resources since there would be no need to farm anything in the nearest future this way.
---
They're better than average weapons, but they're far from great. Personally, I've spent the past few months trading/scripping them and getting different stuff. 
---
Two shot destroys weapon accuracy and barely adds any damage.
---
Explosive is cool, but gets annoying real fast (in my opinion).
---
This is why I grow a lot of corn. Make like 50 corn soup with super duper and enjoy the quicker ap regen too.
---
It was fixed for about a month and a half, at the time I was running around playing the game way more than is normal, and playing with people who had it occur on everything from a Tesla to a pistol, and everything worked.... if briefly
---
I'll swap, it's possible I included the incorrect formID, lol
---
Give it a shot, for most pve play it will work well. Only probably queens &amp; sheepsquatches is where extra damage really helps.
---
Quad FFR
---
I am a FO 1st'er and didn't receive anything nor do I care .
---
 I also don't give 2 shits if other people received 10000 vault steal.  It doesn't affect my gameplay at all.
---
I think you nuke Morgan town and you will get more. Include the airport
---
As someone that lost both, I don't think we are getting enough. But this was a nice step.
---
I play "Pirates" with my pistol build... 3 legendary Black Powder pistols, each in it's own hotkey spot. I have a VATS/Crit build, but these actually work better outside of vats when you can skip the reload and switch guns fast...   
---
1) \* Instigating - Opening shot in or out of sneak (1200+ for a headshot)  
---
2) \*\*\* Executioner's - Finishing shot   
---
3) \*\*\* Stalker's  - "sniping" with VATS.
---
I also recently picked up a hilarious/awesome L50 \*\*\* Executioner's/Explosive/+1Ag Pipe Pistol. Threw a hair-trigger receiver on it, the fire rate is 90 (semi-auto). Far more effective than a .38 has a right to be. Great for tagging mobs in group events.
---
you didnt unlock the last one
---
Okay. I’ll have to take it out for a spin then. 😀
---
Honestly, I feel like some of the people throwing a bit fit over it are the ones grinding the PA and the selling it on eBay.
---
I agree
---
Oh okay. When you call explosive annoying, I’m assuming you’re referring to the fact that you can be injured by the splash damage. Because I’ve recently gotten an explosive pump action shotgun and I actually crippled myself whilst battling some mole rats. 😂
---
You lost over 600 vault steel? Dont lie.
---
Because there is one more for you to unlock. You have 26 out of 27 total.
---
Yeah, but since there isn’t a Buffout recipe in game, I’ll take it.
---
krampusquatch
---
I'm dead!!! so awesome
---
Not sure if genuine concern, or low key attempt of trading it, but please continue, you got me interested now :D
---
K bye.
---
XBox
---
Yeah the damage to yourself can be, but I find the sound grating for some reason. To help with damage, use fireproof perks or dense torso armor mods. 
---
Personally, when it comes to explosive weapons, they're fun with standard shotguns, but terrible on a two shot shotgun (because of the accuracy penalty).
---
They can be a lot of fun though! Give it a try and see what you think!
---
Lol. 
---
But if you are missing one mod you may want to check if there is a prime receiver for it that you have not gotten yet.
---
Red Rocket Mega Stop.   
---
Purchase from Train station vendors and the "Soda Fountain" in Whitesprings Resort (Red and White decor, upstairs).
---
skin maybe?
---
Green thumb did work on some of them for me, but others it didnt
---
I haven't bought 1st yet but have been contemplating. If I buy 1st now would I also get the 600 vault steel? Or is this just for people who were confirmed to have their stash wiped?
---
I will! Thank you for the advice.
---
I love it when this gets recommended to me.
---
I think Bethesda considers the non-subscribers to be more like stowaways in the cargo hold than economy class.
---
I agree. Imagine acid rain or other worldly effects that would cause us too seek shelter from harm.
---
they are being compensated not just for the junk that was lost but also for time it took to give the compensation.
---
These players lost a whole month of time with availability to their junk. unable to sell serums to players, unable to craft the raid armor (for those who did have mats), and even simple things like repairing their gear was made more difficult.
---
All of that could have made it more difficult to even do the raid during that time frame.
---
Compensation does not have to equal what was lost. Just like Blizzard used to give an entire days worth of subscription when maintenance lasted longer than expected, or how amazon will sometimes let you keep a package that finally arrives even if they sent you a second
---
Can't find Nukashine except in player vendors. Nuclear Material in bulk is usually farmed at the nuclear waste workshop. Glowing enemies have it in their loot pools
---
Scratch that I haven’t got it yet have the email just no scrap
---
You quit because they actually compensated people who had their entire scrap box wiped out? Ok. Makes sense.
---
This + you can run a plasma based weapon and check goo piles for possible nuclear mats
---
Nah It's patched, A service Rep from Bethesda confimed it on a Reddit Post, Stop trying to spread something that hasn't happened in over a month. It's safe to run the raids now. Just because someone told you so doesn't make it true. I'll share the link if I can find it again.
---
&gt;Not fake news i was warned by another user however he did not provide any proof
---
Lol
---
Rea the post, I'm done bc of the vault steel.
---
Already stated that please read all of my comment
---
For sneak you need to choose your targets at range;   taking out the weakest first for Adrenaline perk. Also don't forget Adrenal Reaction mutation. Make sure to use critical shots too. Use Escape artist and crouch after detection. Unyielding allows high sneak.
---
Did they take your vault steel and give it to someone else?
---

---
Also every perk related to either picking someone up or being picked up applies to the effects. This includes Dry Nurse, which says you keep your stimpack. Since you don't actually use stimpacks for those effects, you're getting free stims
---
Could you send a screen with your perks if possible?
---
this, cant get the prime receiver by scrapping, only by getting the plans
---
Please do and not trying to spread rumours as i said already not sure if its true or not but its a precaution for others.
---
Lmao
---
Possibly. I'll finish up and login to my gunslinger soon.
---
Ive got a problem with how much of a horder I am in these games but since I am like this I felt like over half the time I was on I would be constantly dealing with the weight limit. I wish I didnt have to pay a monthly fee to get past that problem.
---
Tyty!
---
Yep. And the alternative of using vats, doesn't always work either, because vats in melee sometimes locks up and you can't do anything until you leave vats and try again. Happens to me all the time fighting the queen where I'm just standing hitting attack and nothing happens. Incredibly frustrating, but this was there before, nothing new.
---
I've had some since launch that are still there
---
Doesn't justify 600 steel. It would take 50 days of running all three difficulties to get 600 steel and like you said they only lost it for a month. Last I checked theres only 30 days in a month. It's not justified and I'm trying to see other views but I dont think it's possible to accept that amount of vault steel is necessary compensation.
---
What feed the people bug?
---
Yep, what should be basic implements takes Bethesda like 5 days to implement so until wastelanders come out, I don’t think we’ll get minor suggestions in just yet
---
Appreciate it bud💪💪
---
Sorry, I just thought it was funny because of how applicable it is to the digital age of information we're in. We all take someone's word without doing research ourselves to see if it's the truth or not. I appreciate the warning!
---
I bet my account there was hacker in your team. 3/4 games I play the winner is hacking.
---
Do biv's quest to get the nukashine recipe, then it just takes some corn, razorgrain nuclear material, water and a nuka cola quantum to make in a brewing station. Farming nuke zones for enemies often gives nuclear material and there are a few locations on the map where you can farm quantums by server hopping.
---
You realize people could have and probably did (as I did) have some stored before the scrap box lost our items, right? We lost everything we put into it. And then had to wait 30 days for Bethesda to try and say "we're sorry."
---
That is awesome ill have to look into my set up then, ty!
---
I had a blast with the black powder pistol working on the challenges with it for atoms. If Murghr gives me one, I’m gonna give it a go. Thanks!
---
Believe it or not im not the type of guy who criticises this game despite all the controversy i love this game play often. And i haven't taken their word hence why i opened up this discussion post to discuss the issue openly with everyone since its a bug that's been patched and if there is the remote possibility however small (after all its fallout 76) i feel obliged to at least give others a heads up.
---
Getting the strangler is a sign of doing something exceptionel and hard to do.
---
Now suddenly it's reduced to nothing, lowlevels can run around in the hardest to obtain gear, and the real raiders are possibly dropping the raid, as the armor no longer represents anything of value.
---
Lucky ;D I enjoy minimal but I have a very nice spot on the highest part of the world with a cylindrical base that took me 6 hours to make lol
---
Yeah, you can’t win when you alienate fans and sell skins that cost more than fallout 4s dlc’s
---
There were a lot of posts about this within the last week asking this question over and over on Reddit, wonder if any were research for that vid lol
---
Datamines from a few months ago showed new customize options for the Handmade Rifle to give it the Chinese Assault Rifle appearance.
---
ITT: 50 ideas all better than anything Bethesda will give us.
---
Well we as a community support Bethesda's greediness and allow them go more for P2W when we buy stuff from atomic shop and support Fallout 1st.   
---
Don't believe? Look what Valve just did to CSGO... They added player skins because microtransactions are nowadays more profitable than the game itself.   
---
As example, I have bought near all atomic shop stuff yet I don't play the game at all. I played 400h during first few months and now bored out of my ass. 3 characters all up to lvl 100 and then new one. Too little content but hey at least we can have different power armor skins for small price of 18€.
---
Probably something you can only get from a vendor.
---
People were upset about this game to begin with and with the things like wastelanders being delayed and then the subsciption you kind of have to expect this. If they put out wastelanders and it was actually good and then they put out the subscription there would probably be less complaining about it. I was hoping to come back to this game for wastelanders but now with more and more going behind a pay wall I doubt ill be coming back. Some people have to save money to buy video games and dont have disposable income to drop nearly $20 (Canadian) a month on a game that wasnt finished and  that quite honestly is the buggiest game ive played in my life by far. Alot of people love Fallout and this game is abit of a kick in the face to alot of fans
---
Xbox faction wars? Gotta check with my faction clan....... The Enclave Armada will see to this!
---
Being in a group, with just a little communicating, greatly increases the chance of winning or ending close to the top.
---
80-90% of players are hiding/afk'ing or just not playing with the group, but doing their own thing.
---
Winning while in a group with friends is too easy in NW, you'll ever only lose if up against a better group, but even that is rare.
---
Legendary Bloatfly Anus
---
True, it did help a lot
---
&gt;Winning while in a group with friends is too easy in NW, you'll ever only lose if up against a better group, but even that is rare.
---
Uh that happened quite a few times lol
---
I am still waiting for a reply from them for my ticket.
---
While I'm running full health yes. And I use a Vampire Explosive laser w/o fire damage mod for full health.
---
Reading is fundamental!   You just wasted all of that curios tapping on your keys to what? Make a non existent point.  Oh and go read his comment that is before the one you cherry picked to cut and paste just now.  Never mind the fact he was talking about how the atoms to price is over-inflated in the first place.    Now I’m sure your mother is tired of you pacing the basement fuming because you wanted to type Rekt at the end of your post except you didn’t do anything but Reeeeeee. and still come up short.   
---
But feel free to fan girl all you want it won’t change the facts.  Bethesda has shorty business practices.  The game is still a steaming pile of shit a year later.  And there are still rabid fanboy apologists like you.   
---
Feel free to write another diatribe tho.  Your fragile ego won’t allow anyone to besmirch your favorite game now will it. And you’ll have to have the last word no matter how wrong it actually is.

I’ll leave you to it. You’re dismissed.

I’m Scoty028. Once in, private message me, I can answer and questions you have.
---
I mean two shot gets you 25% dmg and bloodied gets you 80% at 20% health, and that’s not even factoring in nerd rage or adrenal reaction, which I think brings it up to 150% total dmg, but if you’re looking for a high health pool, I’d just recommend going with anti armour, furious or instigating for semi rifles, explosive has also been replaced with faster fire rate now, but if you’re looking for efficiency go with explosive so you get more dmg per bullet
---
You can earn that in a week for free though...
---
Probably not. Ive died with vault steel to test it and it stays in the inventory. I imagine this would be the same.
---
The minimum necessary compensation would be what was lost.
---
Perhaps not impossible it would be impractical to figure out what each person lost.  So they went with a bulk option. In addition they padded it as a way to apologize for the time it took. You say it’s “only 30 days” but that 30 days could be impactful, especially for rarer supplies. 
---
I could see if this was a package all 1st members got, but it’s not. It’s an attempt to make amends for a pretty major fuck up. i just don’t understand getting mad because someone else got something, especially when they got hit with a bug. I mean do you get mad at people who get a closer, reserved parking spot just because they had a kid?
---
&gt;The cores not breaking due to explosions is a bug.
---
So, you're saying that the update added a bug to something that was already buggy?
---
That almost sounds like what the title is saying.
---
Fix cars. If I can have 50 intelligence and repair a full suit of advanced X-01 power armor in mere seconds, why can't I get a car going?
---
The thing is nobody would drop money if things were cheap and we could still farm atoms. Maybe Bethesda would do it if it were cash only, but there's no incentive to lower atom shop prices for everyone. People actually do drop cash in it, much to our detriment
---
But people are purchasing them for $18, so it wouldn’t make much sense to lower the price for them as nice as it would be for us.
---
You do realise for that to happen, they'd have to release the source code, and I think there's fat chance of that happening.
---
Why is this PA overpowered?
---
I think that's only *part* of it. Of course, a lot of people just end up not roleplaying because the game doesn't have the sort of tools they were dreaming of using, but I certainly think the conflict between idea vs. reality is still a part of it.
---
Inert Flux is way too heavy. I usually just build a bunch of small Water Purifiers at home and just grab as I need em.
---
Maybe we're misunderstanding each other, but that's essentially what I meant. I feel like we have been asking for more roleplayability, but haven't received it.
---
Nothing.
---
&gt;when any FO 1st player gets 600 just for being subscribed
---
That's simply not true. I have first, I played during the time the glitch was active, I did not lose anything...I also did not get an email, so no, not every subscriber is getting "free" vault steel
---
Drama.
---
I do too, I also have herbivore so it's boosted. But constantly having to watch the hunger and thirst bars because they aren't behaving the way they should is rather annoying.
---
Hahaha that sounds right.
---
I for one wanted to host arena fights in my [raider arena](https://imgur.com/a/JSSshr4) since before the game was in beta, but nobody was interested. At least it looks neat.
---
I thought that bounty hunting and (fair) PvP would be a bigger part of the game, but people just use these systems to grief. I'm all for PvE, I mean I love it, but I never even see anyone in Monster Mash fighting, even though it's a PvP event.
---
What they do
---
What they'll actually do: SHITTY SANTA HAT FOR 10 DOLLARS! SANTA COSTUME FOR 18!
---
Alternatively everything could cost 25¢ to 1$ and atoms are non earnable.
---
I can too, should be online within 30 minutes.  Add me, psn is Anunnaki61
---
I personally wonder if they made the box eat scrap so they could do this, as a publicity stunt, in order to make more people buy subscriptions.
---
You cant trade V94 armor
---
Added. Thank you.
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
three weeklong holiday events with camp and cosmetic rewards (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
I get it but honestly, this Reddit is like a bunch of preschoolers who are jealous at their English teacher for knowing more words.
---
Jeez man, I'm nearly 60 so I'm bound to know a few words longer than one of two syllables, I don't have to scour a dictionary every time I write something online. smh 🙄
---
Same.
---
Anyways I haven't seen many massive camps at all honestly, all I ever see anymore is shacks and nothing great, I know myself as a creator I don't have much budget at all as power things like complex wiring take up so much budget aswell as lights, I enjoy making things weird and not simple so when making something complex it becomes very annoying to see the "You do not have enough Workshop Budget" or whatnot as I can never make even the simplest cool complex builds look nice. The best looking items are as most would assume the most budget destroying ones aswell as lights taking up 1% each and display shelves literally eating your budget like it is nothing. It just isn't fun and my camp isn't even that huge, it is fairly small compared to most, I just like my circuits and complex decorations is all. Basically a little bit more space would be rad as it doesn't seem like camps are really eating frames much to me or others that I know that play and I am sure don't crash others almost at all. So yeah, maybe to some it is unnecessary but to most it is.
---
Also to add there is a height limit to camps aswell as a radius limit so even if items percentage of the budget were lowered slightly all you would see are just more items appearing in camps rather than anything really getting any bigger than before besides maybe a few more rooms or something of the sort.
---
Alright, I ended up loading it up today with bo issues. So just another laggy start up bug.
---
If Bethesda don’t steal this idea, then they just need to all retire.
---
I noticed that sometimes it wouldn't remove things but the times I didn't want it to it would. This sucks too as I would've been fine had I just figured out the glitch that fixes the removing the walls issue for now. As there is a way and I don't fully know it but can test and figure it out with a dummy wall to make sure I'm good to continue.
---
But if they do something that works or is what people asked for then there is still a vocal outcry, as I said, they can't win.
---
Barbarian in strength, lone wanderer, scaly skin and grounded mutations, shielded underarmor, armored backpack and of course armor itself.  I am currently at. 691 dr, 619 er, which I believe is higher than any power armor.
---
Minimum compensation would be 200-300 vault steel, enough to let everyone craft another set of all 3 armor, not double that amount.
---
Not saying I dont believe you, but why would you have 400 vault steel stored? 
---
I see the OPs point of view on the vault steel, not so much the getting to angry you'll quit playing part. All of the other junk has been always available so I could see people having hundreds of flux and thousands of scrap lost - but vault steel? I'm very suspicious anyone had mass quantities of *that* stored. 
---
Everything else I'm ok with - and not experiencing the level of anger OP is over the situation.
---
RemindMe! 5 years
---
🤪🤪🤪
---
Pvp ghosts get them. No lol I think the server stays as is for around 20 minutes from what I heard.
---
It ain’t stealing I give them full permission
---
I was going off what you said, realistically that was the minimum they could do if they weren't sure what everyone lost, but 600 is ridiculous. I'm not making an argument or debating anyone, this is how I feel as a veteran player. There is quite literally no reason for me to play anymore aside from quick atom or cap grinds, because of this surge of vault steel. I dont even have the desire to run those. Maybe when another vault opens up I'll run that, but what happens when they just hand 1st players those rewards on a silver platter? I dont expect you to understand how I feel, but I know for a fact that plenty of players feel the same way I do
---
Because nothing much to do other than raids and dailies once you have 3 level 150+ characters?
---
I’m definitely running a gamma gun as a secondary with this build. I got a 3* bloodied ffr 50% dr gamma during the last purveyor sale. Ammo is a bit of an issue,also, I’m not a PvP’r. Here’s hoping Wastelanders brings me some human enemies!
---
But you didnt lose 600 vault steel
---
Then he submitted a ticket. I ordered Fallout 1st while the servers were still down on day one and I got no email.
---
&gt; I did the dromedary thing for a bit. It helps. 
---
I equip that with the equivalent for food before I consume food stuffs then revert back to original perks. Quite a hassle but can't be helped if I want to reduce the foods and drinks I have with me.
---
&gt; I do run thru-hiker and travelling pharmacy though. 
---
I currently have these perks but I have to remove them soon because I'm in the middle of shifting my perk builds and I need every slot to strengthen my attack damage and defense.
---
&gt; Yes, purified water is nice. But boiled water is easier to get. Boil up 50 water, drink up 45 of it, boil some more. Always pick up wood. Keep an eye on your boiled water, make more whenever you're low and near a cooking spot. 
---
I'm doing this one. I have a decontamination shower so I can easily fetch water from the pump and use it to make soups and juices. It takes time tho.
---
&gt; Also I keep nuka-cola, cream, inert flux, in small amounts for emergency water. Same with a couple bits of old-war food. I get a lot of meat just running around, and always keep my boiled water stocked, so I basically never need emergency supplies. 
---
I do this too but it takes a lot of space. I don't have issue on procuring food and drink stuffs, my issue is they take lots of space and I have to maintain a certain amount of them.
---
I'd be content with no lag. My game pauses every few seconds or so for several seconds to a minute. Does not matter what I am doing or where I am in the game. My crafting benches more frequently lately cause my entire game to either freeze or bluescreen. When I started the game 2 months ago this was not happening.
---
6 standard runs minimum is nothing
---
YESSSSSS PLEASE!!  I would LOVE this!!!
---
Sounds like you didn't get lucky.
---
Yup
---
I keep seeing the same people and the same camps over and over again on PS4. So yeah, it's alive. Just barely.
---
Feed the people used to give everyone on the server food even if you weren't there completing the event.
---
I had a decent amount sitting there before hand. Mix that with what could have been earned during the break I took...
---
I agree that it's excessive for some, some people did lose that much. I lost other mats that were more valuable to me. A year's worth.
---
100% Test before launch!
---
i seriously doubt that but whatever
---
Dogmeat!
---
This shit happened in FO4.  You don't want this.  A trash raider would suddenly turn OP because they'd have a minigun in their inventory to use instead of a pipe pistol.
---
I usually use purified water to dilute meds and sell the excess for caps. I actually have 3 industrial purifiers and I can get 9 every few minutes. My issue is not about procuring but maintaining a minimum amount of my food and drink stuffs, which increased since I acquired the speed demon. So I have less space for hoarding stuffs, and it will increase once I remove the weight reduction perks to improve my survival ability.
---
It does and if you find a Gun with the Vats Crit do 50% dmg it blows explosive rounds out the water..  Ever since explosive rounds got nerfed it's terrible for dmg but good for pvp
---
Copy paste this one more time. You are doing great damage control for free to your overlords.
---
How'd you get the walls and roofs to get like that? I'm trying to recreate it on PC
---
I agreed the prices were expensive, so you are wrong. The hilarious part is that in my diatribe, I had put in there that I needed to point out that, but I deleted it because I didn't think you were actually so bad at reading that you would miss that. But, looks like I was wrong. Rekt.
---
You changed the point of the conversation to getting 1500 atoms in a week, not I. Seems like the only person fuming and pacing here is you buddy. So, reeeee? Rekt.
---
I'm still trying to figure out what "curios tapping" means. Rekt.
---
Still loosing 15k acid i farmed from the meltdown event would be worse than those vault steel
---
I'd love to hear how exactly can you tell someone's sexual orientation through an Internet forum.
---
It's not necessary. DR/ER are borderline useless outside power armor, put you perks elsewhere. Three things you want are dense mod for chest, serendipity and a decent amount of firepower to kill shit before it even starts making a dent in you.
---
I am not calling you a liar, but half gone from full is not my experience. Try unequipping perks and armor, or removing the mutation. Honestly, I barely notice a difference between my clean and mutated characters.
---
You're really emotional and making a lot of homosexual references about Todd. It's okay, man don't worry. I am an ally to your people
---
I seemed to recall a rather large wailing from people about the creation club.
---
I started a 3rd during the double xp weekend. I’m currently level 46 and haven’t been to Flatwoods. I’m using this one as a resource mule/ammo maker for the other 2. I’m gonna do the main when I’m fully specd out for a bloodied melee. Might be a little anti climactic!
---
I don't even have class freak and am fine with it. No fix is needed. Just collect some meats from whatever you walk by easily, cook it with super duper and you're always good.
---
No list, just a discussion. I started the thread, so look for it here on Reddit. It drove me crazy when building my melee unarmed.
---
I rarely interact with anyone on the game since 99% of the people I've met around the wasteland are hostile and attack me on sight. Generally if I do anything nearby other players or even if I am on the opposite side of the map from everyone, someone will soon show up and begin attacking me. If it is not someone attacking me then it is me watching people run away from me when I show up in an area, usually yo scavenge or use a vendor. I stay in passive mode. More often I have randoms attacking me while I am trying to vendor shop, use a stashbox, or in my camp. People for some reason love to play an online game solo, this is my 3rd game to play online on a console.
---
Mine was the opposite. Before the update I only needed 5, this time I needed 10. 😞

---
you have to scrap a legendary 😆
---
So homosexuals are more emotional compared to heterosexuals, is that what you are saying? And only gay people make gay references, of course.
---
Also, an ally "to my people"? What are we, the Rebels vs the fucking Empire?
---
I’m sorry brotha, that effing sucks. It would be amazing if we didn’t have to farm so much junk in the first place just to play the game.
---
That said, the Vault steel may not be valuable to you, and it feels like a slap in the face to players like me. Don’t we all lose with this 600 vault steel?
---
The server goes away five minutes after logging out. You'd have to go AFK and use one of the tricks for keeping it from auto logging you out. You'd also be inundated with protect this workshop quests and you'd probably lose most of not all of them to mobs.
---
That's also assuming you don't earn any duplicate plans and you earn a plan every time you complete it which is not the case. I've only completed Dead In The Water 3 times on standard. I've yet to earn a single armor plan. I run Unyeilding and my Charisma and Luck are at 26 and 28 respectively. I'm a 1ster. I recieved the email and had the "Scrap this in a scrap box" on my secondary character that doesn't run raids and it's non transferable so unless I want to spend time trying to raid on one character and ferry plans over to a character that isn't my main. Which who wants to craft super dope character specific armor on a character that isn't their numba one boo?
---
"Fallout 1st members now get 250DR"
---
FIFY
---
Now you're just trying to argue :(
---
I didn't submit a ticket, but was compensated
---
Dunno.
---
What is vault steel? I'm a level 50 loner... Is this some high level thing?
---
My camp is near a Yao Guai spawn and I see them all the time
---
Ya think, just a little?
---
You dont get it because you obviously had to have someone explain it to you so you could write out this response. 
---
You were being pretentious with your word choice, your age has nothing to do with that.
---
At first it was pretty lack luster but this latest batch is pretty decent.
---
Cool idea but I have not seen any builds there.
---
Nah, its a great game.
---
I did have 1500 serums 🤷‍♂️
---
Thats the problem, they should be able to indentify exactly what was lost, like every other mmo.
---
Damn son good job, that's more telling of your gameplay than the "time played" challenge
---
Ok, well they can’t and this was a good solution.
---
Bethesda fucks up and some people lose all their scrap: "BOOOOOOO FUCK BETHESDA BOOOOOOOOO!"
---
Bethesda admits their mistake and compensates people for all of the scrap they lost: "BOOOOOOO FUCK BETHESDA BOOOOOOOOO!"
---
How much manufactured outrage can this sub produce?
---
Just dropped a nuke about 2 hours ago, zero issues with using explosive weapons (guns and grenades) to remove mainframe cores.
---
FYI, no software company includes a complete list of everything that is "patched".
---
You sure? Cause I'm a member who didn't lose scrap box stuff, and I got none of this stuff, I think its only for those who previously filed a report
---
It'll probably come back eventually.
---
I hope I get it.
---
If I do, can I just make the power armor or do I actually have to do a vault raid?
---
It will most likely come around again
---
Deep inside op's heart, it hurts them.
---
Slap on power user, it will only eat the low charged ones if you are a super smarty. 
---
&gt;!Power user + overcharged Ultracite fusion cores allows them to exceed 1000+ ammo per core, but the gatling laser can only "hold" 1000 per core, so when you reload the previous core is injected back into your reserve with about 1 to 10% charge left, depending on the overcharge levels. my character has 20 INT and my core ammo crafting can exceed 140%!&lt;
---
I have it maxed
---
I never knew that,thanks.
---
No. But why? Can save it for later when they come out with better stuff.

Just playing devil's advocate here - but does this not just cheapen the outfit and make it less desirable? Part of the reason it's so sought after is the look but a big part of it is the rarity. The fact you have something (somewhat) unique and rare and not everyone has. Bragging rights and the ability to look cool. 
---
Look at the Whitesprings Jumpsuit for your example. I ran the event enough times to where I ended up with 7 and I'm sure others got even more. Nowadays you cant even give the things away lol. Obviously not as rare and valuable as the Red Asylum but it's still a rare outfit that wasnt just easily obtainable for everyone. 
---
Another side you have to look at is how this would make somebody who does have a Red Asylum feel. They either put countless hours in to farming it themselves or traded valuable stuff for it. Now they give it as an event reward so everyone and their uncle gets one? Not really fair.
---
I wouldn't say explosive has been replaced. Ffr  is only useful on either a low damage per shot auto weapon or in end boss fights. If you can use explosive without killing yourself it is 85% of the time a better option. More per bullet damage, so less bullets required.
---
Look how 5.56 is now it's own currency, Ffr  weapons created that.
---
I don't think I have anything that would further decrease thirst and hunger, but I'll mess around with it to see if that might be that case. I have too many other mutations that I'd rather keep, so I'm probably just gonna have to continue monitoring the bars. Obviously it isn't too much of a problem since it isn't game breaking, just a minor annoying inconvenience.
---
Definitely.
---
Not connecting with a Colonel Gutsy with a Melee weapon,can be the difference between life and death.They shred Armour.best way to stop the damage is to get in close and personal with a Melee weapon.
---
As I bought the game I was hoping to be a caravaner and start my own trading company, the Appalachia Trading Company
---
I used the scrap box the whole time and didn't lose anything. I'm also not getting any free vault steel. What do I win?
---
There's a little green coloured house on the map directly east of the Uncanny Caverns (cant remember the name, I'm at work). just behind that there are stone steps, leading up to a lookout and a gazebo. you can basically build everywhere there! I love it. I only discovered it myself this week. I use the lookout platform as my workshop, and the gazebo forms my front courtyard to my house, which I fill with plants. it looks great!. I'll be staying in this spot for a fair while, the view is also amazing. I'll probably still tear down my camp every few days and rebuild as I love building, but I'll be hanging around this spot for a while. If you are on Xbox and wanna check out what i mean feel free to add me up - Distortedmind87
---
Couldn’t they create the mod fix in a private server and submit it to Bethesda to implement?
---
Absolutely nothing is different for you compared to before you read about this... but suddenly your entire experience with this game is ruined because someone else gets something and you don't.  Grow the fuck up.
---
Dodgy, Adamantium Skeleton, Fireproof, Lone Wanderer, Ricochet, and Serendipity together with a high Agility for dodgy can make a player very hard to kill outside of Power Armor - I used to run with this build when I played a Berserker
---
Because they want those sweet sweet upvotes and awards and a title like this is going to make the youtubers and folks from /gaming jizz in their pants.
---
I do the herbivore route, but I equipped class freak for other mutations in hopes speed demon would actually benefit from it. I'm not the only one that sees this as a problem, I've seen many posts and comments about it after realizing class freak won't decrease the negative effects. Sorry to sound like a whiny bitch from my post lol it just seemed today was especially bad with speed demon for whatever reason.
---
just south of watoga there is a broken down house with a stream running through it and with a shed near that has a weapon bench in it. i use the house to set up my vending machines and display cases. its pretty sick.
---
I think you can take  **Federal disposal field HZ-21** as a workshop for nuclear material.
---
It's accidental pay-to-win, in the sense that no one bought first in order to lose their junk and get free Vault steel. If anything, I'd call it overcompensation. Bethesda, maybe because of how trash of a company they've been, are overreacting to the bug and giving away too much as a fix. Either way, doesn't bother me too much. I'm still waiting for Bethesda to fix their game, so at least it's a step in the right direction.
---
Nope its dead.. game is dead.. this reddit is dead.. no one is here.. we are all alone. no one plays.. what even is Fallout 76?
---
Manufactured outrage implies that its not real. Bethesda did this idiocracy and it's unfortunately very real.
---
All of you asking for all this Christmas crap, I'm over here just wanting them to fix the damn things that already exist in the game. C'mon Tom, I bought your stupid 1st membership so I can play the game the way it should have been on day 1,... I've been a good boy.. I just want a game that works.
---
A cookie.
---
No, we all stopped playing months ago.  Bethesda keeps releasing patches and updates in hopes that someone will fire up the game and play again.  
---
One guy in Belarus logged into the game last week, which gave the development team hope.  But he quickly got disconnected so he gave up.
---
yeah...if only they would've given us truly self-hosted servers then we could do that
---
No you can’t.  You could drop pieces of PA on a PA frame and that was patched.  You can’t trade V94 armor.  Do your homework
---
I can't wait for this game to be a finished product. That is not to say finished with dlc and updates and the like; I love that they have planned such a pile of beautiful possibilities for us. That is to acknowledge the fact that it is still a work-in-progress at its core. Road map or none, this game has had no clear direction since its first fumbles. 
---
I fucking love fallout. 76 is just a pain to play and that kind of sucks. I understand both the overwhelming rage and the undying support people have toward the game and its developers, but I feel it's important that both sides keep displaying their opinions. This game still has a chance to be awesome. The constant back-and-forth, I believe, drives the progression of things in a "positive conflict" sort of way. Left to one side or the other, this game clearly would have died long ago.
---
I've developed a weird kind of love for Watoga too.  I hope they do more with it.
---
Noticed tonight during an SBQ event that my 50 Caliber Machine Gun was constantly slowly reloading  every few seconds.
---
Found myself jumping around a lot.
---
Personally not had this problem before.
---
Also SBQ when flying towards V9 Drop Site would disappear under ground and reappear  behind the V9 Drop Site.
---
These Bugs are actually getting worse every update.
---
Starting to think it  has now become a social experiment to see how many Gamers will continue playing.
---
Ah I did not know this. It sound be fixed, but I am unaware of the actual increases in food rate by moving before or after class freak is applied
---
Bcuz they keep pushing off updates and leading people with false hope of the npc update then say that we have to wait 4 more months like cmon ? I don’t think they even brought the legendary player update yet and that was supposed to be on the roadmap and it still hasn’t happened and no one is talking about it anymore
---
And here's the kicker. You know there will be more strangler armor sets out there with the strangler bugs crashing the game that means more people are going to be inadvertently crashing the game.
---
It's more helpful to answer the question being asked or to modify your comment to be relevant to the poster than it is to drop a response you use regardless, but it is nice that you wanted to be helpful :-)
---
I have all five many of each
---
Yeah, sorry about that, I meant to have said popularity wise I’ve seen f fr more, and seen it sell for a bit more as well
---
If Bethesda would have given us self-hosted dedicated servers like many other games have there could've been a server browser where you could see all kind of public servers and maybe also their installed mods.
---
You could always just continue playing on the official servers or you join some community ones with community patches and so on.
---
Look at the Skyrim Together project, they made something similar for Skyrim already.
---
lol what’s Belarus I’m confused?😅
---
To play what's obviously a fallout mmo with friends. Same as every other game with pvp, I completely ignore pvp since it does nothing.
---
I got it and I didn't lose junk. Maybe someone can piece it together if its a luck of the draw or if its given to certain people.
---
1. I play everyday at least once
---
2. I have 1st
---
3. I hace purchased atoms before early in the game
---
If they add it to the event then it won't be rare anymore, no one will be interested in it anymore, and you will have one less thing to try to get. People got pissed off that they did this to the Whitespings jumpsuit and lowered its value.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus
---
Belarus is a country...
---
I’ve got 1st and I didn’t get jack. All this talk of every 1st player getting free stuff is manufactured.
---
Do your homework, look at game flip or ebay... it's still possible
---
I think it is like Morgantown. I would love to take a roof and build, but nope. And with each patch, it gets smaller and smaller. Wastelanders will probably turn all of us into homeless raiders.
---
East of Bolton Greens there are cabins and you can squeeze two of them in your build zone
---
Apparently some paying customers don't pay enough for that treatment.
---
Yeah! I thought it said somewhere when they were first introduced, that they would have a hide option..maybe I'm not remembering correctly.
---
yeah a text chat would've been helpful for that...but how could we bother Bethesda to implement something a modder had programmed 2 weeks after launch one year after launch?
---
imagine ur sitting at ur desk, working at balthesdar doing some bug fixes and u hear the nuke warning and everybody starts fast travelling home.  hopefully buddy howard is overencumbered with all his prewar money.
---
I used an m79 does that not work any more?
---
Nope, I died to a queen before I even noticed I had them in my inventory
---
&gt; Oy. They don't even know their own bugs. 
---
Amen to that!
---
Patched
---
oh ok thank you very much
---
Not to be a dick but what was the point of PVP before?
---
Fun
---
Bro, I know this thread is 3 months old but I just got that "scrap this at a scrap box" can you trade the plans to craft the armor amongst characters? Like can one character ferry the plans to another?
---
It’s definitely not all members.  I talked to many who didn’t get it.  I got mine today thankfully.
---
Yea because the game is now p2w so snack on a satchel of Richards
---
Valid,  even though I don't relate to that.
---
Now this is beautiful rhetoric. Proof with examples  shown to significantly impair our actions or abilities, when we are already are rendered wasteland wealth... only seen when under the perspective of significant  intoxication and/or chem induced hallucinations hah. Love your style, facts and impression to what was communicated to players and what really happens in game reality. Well done!
---
Good. There never should have been any. This should’ve been multiplayer fallout. Not call of duty: fallout.
---
Without server-wide communications and a better way to chat with one another, this wont happen.
---
The problem is that everyone can do everything so there is not that much need for specialists. Everyone can repair, cook, heal, and craft everything. If they actually make it to where we would have to specialize then you'd have more restaurants, special shops, repair mechanics and whatnot. On top of that if you made high level loot actually dangerous to find, not just tedious and grindy like the current legendary system then you'd have specialists who could go out and get those items you know?
---
I get that, it’s not everyone’s cup of tea.
---
But I’ve been a PvP player since this game came out, and it’s never been as bad as it is today. You can only play as a Stealthboy-Tesla player. 
---
And is it really any fun at all? 
---
Invisible people fighting invisible people. I’ve used 3 stealthboys since the stress-test, and by deciding to not be part of the problem, it’s impossible and I’ve just not played.
---
The PA is the best in the game currently. One of the reasons it's so desired. Anyone doing the raids, the first thing they will do is make the PA or armor sets. That will take a lot of vault steel (not sure the exact amount without looking it up). The only way youd have that amount of vault steel saved would be if you ran the vault on normal/expert every day since it was released and not crafted a single piece of armor. 
---
You're saying you did this?
---
I messaged support multiple times and didn't even get any emails or the scrap junk package... all of the junk I currently have is grinded from after losing it. And I lost it after the hotfix. Yet people who didn't even message them about it got emails explaining they'd be getting them. Fuck that. I'll continue playing because I quite enjoy the game, but I probably won't be getting a membership again if they're going to be that incompetent.
---
See I know Santa claws and krampus would be sick and all but what about a thanksgiving day enemies. A giant terrifying turkey or something. Just imagine that.
---
But you see, Players fighting players would only make sense for a multiplayer post-apocalyptic game. There have been raiders in every fallout game ever made.
---
And even if you do believe this is a good thing, the only PvP players you have left are the scummiest
---
this is why steel should not of been in the box...
---
you have to run them
---
*Cathartic* was the one that is pretentious? Maybe *bile*? *retaliate*? surely not *moderat*e! 
---
Your comment showed arrogance, immaturity and was a bit daft to be honest.
---
You do you man. Peace.
---
i think they should overhaul the whole system.  make us mail them real bottlecaps for in game items.
---
I hate you.
---
I don't even know what launched since July, someone had to tell me it was only the vault raids, nobody can answer it besides "nothing" which isn't true lol
---
Yeah I’m not sure if being hit removed it or not.
---
dont hate because i solved it first.
---
It only makes sense. Most mmorpgs I've played give an option to hide certain cosmetics like backpacks, helmets, capes/cloaks, etc. while keeping their active effect
---
I have worked my ass off grinding for vault steel in vault 94. It took me weeks to get enough to steel to make my strangler power armor. I purchased a year subscription to Fallout 1. I have people on my friends list who did not lose any junk or ever completed a vault raid. Wtf? This isn't right. There is no way in hell anyone had 600 vault 94 steel in their scrap box. I have over 1500 hours into this game, but I am about ready to quit.
---
Well you're lucky then lol like I said though, not a major problem, just inconvenient and still think bethesda should look into that.
---
Except people that did not lose anything are getting the scrap. There is no way anyone had 600 vault steel in their scrap box.
---
You dont drop at the loot
---
Because especially when most of your ammo is crafted, a bottomless scrapbox is a huge advantage over the 800 limited stash everyone else has. I have to be very careful what I store in my stash, scrap included, and have lost out on so much scrap solely because I didn't have the space for it. Ended up having to bulk it and sell it to train station vendors. It doesn't help that the stuff we're selling in our own vendors also takes up space in the stash box instead of being set up so that once you put something in a vendor, it must stay there and will disappear if you try to remove it from the vendor, but in exchange for not being able to get something back once you place it in your vendor, doesn't take up any space in your stash box.
---
they should have done this on various occasions.  
---
I liked their introduction of the Scouts with the backpacks, you got the basic ones for free and got skins for them in the AS.
---
Then they started to fail by introducing the fridge and the scrap collector as AS-exclusive without a normal in-game counterpart and in addition started selling skins for those.
---
Now we even got this Scrapbox where they again failed to prevent the backlash by simply being fair to every player, with the basic stuff for everybody and skins in the AS
---
Agreed. The two worst problems for me are when mobs spawn, don't move and are unkillable (which happens a lot) and my Gatling laser won't fire when doing zooming though scope animation (every time).
---
My bad,  a mirelurk queen..
---
Didn't get it, but I also didn't lose anything.
---
&gt;"Your comment showed arrogance, immaturity, and was a bit daft to be honest."
---
Thanks for proving my point about you being pretentious.
---
Probably best you excuse yourself to go wipe that egg off your face.
---
Just like our armor can be hidden by our outfits
---
You make it seem like every Fallout 1st player is getting this...we aren't. I'm not getting this.
---
The problem is some players lost 10+ months of work, over 10,000 pounds of collected scrap, and everything but the vault steel is a tiny, microscopic percentage of what was lost.   
---
This seems to be them "trying"....  
---
personally would rather have the 9,000+ screws (and the rest of my junk) back, but hey, better them ignoring us again
---
Look out for the materials on Mappalachia.
---
Prime receiver. The queen drops the plans.
---
This. I ran vault raids almost every night to get enough steel for the power armor. It took me weeks. I purchased Fallout 1st the day it came out.
---
Hmmm still nothing. To be honest i lost  nothing valuable, knowing bethesda track record i left vauable things like vault steel and fluxes in normal stash and just lost few hundreds basic materisls which were top 3 hours to farm. I made a  ticket, maybe they respond.
---
Did this work for you? I've been down and out since the update on the 12th, and none of those steps changed a thing.
---
&gt;1
---
It took me longer to grind for the steel. The plans were easy to get, but I also completed the raids on each difficulty.
---
Yikes, that's definitely something they need to fix... Sorry that happens every time, sounds very frustrating. The only weapon bug I've encountered is that sometimes I'm kept aiming down sight until I reload.
---
Can you sell/buy vault steel?
---
Fallout 1st sub. Didn't get shit. I have a few friends that didn't lose anything that got the scrap. Xbox one.
---
Good catch on this, thanks.  
---
Applies to all of them  
---
Submitting as bugs now and documenting.
---
I want yetis.
---
Hrmmm how much do you sell them for? Looking to pick some up. I usually buy between 100-200 caps apiece
---
Well at least in 76 you can show off, either how dedicated you are to the game or how large your wallet is, to other players.
---
Yes but the last piece only gives 10% of wwr I think
---
I didn't have any issues getting the plans. The steel was the hard part.
---
Slightly disturbing that these little guys are all over the place, am I right?
---
Well I've had a shitty day but you put a smile on my face haha 😂
---
Bethesda: Here Fallout 1st people, have some free stuff for your troubles.
---
Fallout 1st: Wow this is great! Thanks!
---
All other players: ummm.... wtf? How is this NOT pay to win? 
---
Bethesda and Fallout 1st *standing in front of 4 fully built tanks with 20 nukes*: what are you talking about, it’s just some junk. Quit crying ya baby.
---
Agreed.

---
At first I thought this was related to the FaceGen issue they mentioned in the patch notes, but examining this closely the Correct change was in the ArmorAddon records where they added Slot \[32\] FaceGen Head.  
---
The slot \[50\] Neck appears to be a rogue / unintentional edit.
---
Fix.
---
Remove the slot \[50\] Neck from the Armor record.
---
Maybe it was all a ploy by Bethesda, to get people to do more vualt raids, and to lower the market prices.  
---
Also, cool, now I have some more stuff to do on fo76.  Thank you Bethesda!
---
You are wrong, the real price is 9999
---
Fanny Packs are making a comeback!
---
Twist: Beth suspends all players who received this special junk for acquiring more rare items in 30-days than is possible through gameplay.
---
Add me, I'd love to start doing raids.
---
My build... A sloppy stealthy railway shooting son of a gun.
---
I'm not always on, usually during the day for a few hours.
---
Psn is Anunnaki61
---
Cool. How should they be able to indentify the items that went missing?
---
So in your opinion would it be a smarter move to get a piece of aid reduction or junk reduction just to keep it moving? I am only asking becouse someone wants to trade a qffr Tesla for 1 piece of my wwr armor but not trying to screw myself over  on my weapons farming
---
Hang on. You can shoot cores? I would always just click them to destroy them.
---
Are you still able to keep any side items given to you for purchasing the membership? For instance, once your membership ends, do you still keep the NCR Ranger Armour?
---
Honestly though, isn't that a little more of a reason to put it into the event? I mean the trade value of that damn thing has become insane. It should have it's value knocked down
---
Get in power armor and spam stimpaks, you can out heal their damage lol
---
Iirc you don't keep any of it? But you might be able to keep your emotes?..
---
Don't take my word for any of this, it's just what I've seen/heard!
---
God I loved the honest hearts dlc cuz of those 45 caliber guns that they introduced.
---
Hope this isn’t true as i’d like to keep the armour, but thank you for the help!
---
If it is it’s not listed on the wiki. I even have the only skin from atomic shop and that doesn’t count for it.
---
I think he described the dnc perfectly. He plays 40 hours with yong's rage (bds)
---
I would be happy if you never commented again. Make me happy would you?
---
If ur on PS4 I might have a TSE revolver
---
Yeah, same but I think that's what the big issue with 1st was sadly. We can only hope though!
---
Put in a ticket under then”list items” category, mention the scrapbox and you get an automated email saying you will receive the 4 bulk scrap items. Mate of mine did it and got it already.
---
They could win if they made a good game

what about the damage cap though?
---
gratz on the new place though
---
Diwnvoting becausr hell no sorry not sorry i like it beibg rare
---
I've been playing a Viking based build since launch on PS4, Haven't ever really shot a gun, been using the same Grognaks and wooden gear and it works out pretty well.
---
Came here to say the same thing. Even if they'd give me tons of free vault steel I doubt I'll even consider to do these stupidly tedious and buggy raids for plans. Some might do that though even if they didn't try before but I doubt everyone will go fetching those plans right after they receive their care package. I don't believe there are many people who lost their junk due to scrapbox bug and only fraction of these people really are into raids. And only fraction of that small crowd will endure the challenge of getting all the plans, considering how unreliable it is due to lags, glitches, crashes (be it server or client-side) etc.
---
So yeah, I think people are blowing this problem out of proportion, I'm sure there won't be hundreds of pa suits flooding the market anytime soon if it won't be for dupers (and if they could dupe that armor, believe me, they already did that without any sort of care packages from bethesda)
---
This
---
Especially with the holidays coming, I’m sure a lot of bundles will be back
---
Can't you just buy vault steel from Mumbles for scrip?
---
might wanna check out  r/fo76filthycasuals
---
No because it just devalues it. It's not the best analogy but its the best I could think of on the fly - think of diamonds. If once a year there was a week where everyone in the world could go and get as many diamonds as they want.. yeah they would still be nice to look at but not as valuable and nobody would care because hey look I've got 7 diamonds also.
---
😂
---
they just posted a guide a few ago
---
Did you forget the part where Bethesda promised they wouldn’t charge us for content? They were to only charge for cosmetic items... Lars I checked unlimited storage wasn’t cosmetic. 
---
But this isn’t the first time they have broken their word, Bethesda is a greedy organization that doesn’t actually listen or care what the life long fallout fans say or think. 
---
I’m a man on principle so that is why I do not pay for it. But because of y’all who are suckered into to it we will all suffer.. now and in the future. Doesn’t matter anymore now, little late for a boycott to change things the way they should be. 
---
It would have been fine if they had not gone back on their word but they see how fast people are to blow money so they take advantage.
---
Guess it’s the world we live in where people who lie cheat and steal are accepted and embraced by the Victims.
---
Pretty sure suiciders are in 76. Along with the dreaded beep of death
---
yut and if you run unyeilding you can boost that strength up

yes of course!

Its really based on your build and what you carry around on your person

when going to a new world wait 10 seconds so it won't go back on the same one.

PvP was an advertised part of the game. It was supposedto be a post-apocolyptic wasteland.
---
Then it was taken over by farmers.
---
yut best defence and all.

/lurk
---
It is pathetic when people pull them out immediately 1v1. It is understandable though when one player is fighting 2 or 3. Many pvpers will agree on no sb or teslas. Pvp is the true endgame and will always be Watselanders or not.
---
Damn that sucks.  
---
F
---
it got you too huh brother?
---
Watoga was my favorite place before they nerfed the bots.
---
Wait...the armor speaks Chinese?
---
I'm for this.gg
---
Imagine if the damage cap disappeared (110 damage per bullet)? I would love pvp, it would be more realistic, and more diverse.
---
Barbarian only works up to 20 strength.  I sit at 19 or 20, depending on my weapon without unyielding.
---
i don't understand.... upvoting anyway
---
oh damn you're right
---
I'm referring to your complaint that you can't turn off other players. That's the whole point of an online game...
---
lol I mean you collect caps as well
---
Maybe paid to ridiculously short cut, a similar model free to play games use.
---
Serendipity might be the most useful perk in the game.
---
Cool will do. I'm GenomeNinja
---
That would be sick
---
Challenge. Anything pve is stale or boring (vault raids). And the occasional loot piñata that showed up for war but died way sooner than he planned.
---
You’re opinion is noted, and has been filed under “everyone should play my way”. Have a nice day.
---
I heard it will work similarly to the Libert Prime one although I don't know about the language. It would be kind of useless if it was Chinese only though ;)
---
what's the best barrel mod?
---
I kinda liked the dmg differences that were in survival before its removal. But I guess either way, the way it is now just sucks
---
On behalf of the whole entire Fallout 76 community; we need Santa Claws. Bethesda, if you see this, please add this boss into the game since the one-year anniversary was pretty scuffed, to make it up to us.
---
Agree 200%.  Last night somebody dropped me like 1100 rounds of .44 ammo and I wasn't sure so I just thumbed up ( but a small or big THANKS! would have been much nicer ).
---
I also accidentally shot someone who ran out in front of me as I was sniping ghouls and there just wasn't anything I could do to apologize so they just shot me back and killed me.  A simple 'oops' would have been handy.
---
I'm surprised in general at the limited number of emotes.  I mostly just end up using the 'thumbs' up one and the 'wave' one but would love a simple 'thanks' at least.
---
Out of curiousity, do dupers bother you?
---
Have lost caps too, now I remove +5k items at 20k and close my shops around 25k.
---
There is no dmg cap in pve
---
I agree with all of this. But I see people all of the time seriously use it as part of their build.
---
But it’s not a build, it’s just BS that anyone could, and does use.
---
One single run isn’t really a good metric to gauge from.  Some silo runs have like a couple dozen robots at most and some have close to 100.  It’s always been like that.
---
I’ve almost always just clicked the cores. It hardly slows me down.  Burning ammo and weapon condition on something I can click seems wasteful to me.  50 cal and 5.56 doesn’t grow on trees.
---
I was asking about pvp, you said it was good for pvp.  thanks for the reply though
---
I love taking them on and learnt how to beat them and I don't care if I die because they can activate god glitch on me by killing me with stealth boys and engery weapons lol
---
i literally saw someone doing this just yesterday, i'm not sure what the deal is.
---
Most of that stemmed from the fact you could get the same stuff for free through Nexismods
---
Probably not worth anything really ( except scrip ).
---
I have done that before and ended with the same result. Also it auto reconnects when it asks you if you want to try a new world.
---
90 % wwr max with 5 pieces.
---
what do you guys actually spend caps on in game? granted it's been a long time since i've been any where near a daily player. but literally when cap limit got raised to 30 is around when i scrapped my vending machines and stopped holding onto stuff just to sell it. And probably haven't spent 2k caps since then.
---
If you like fallout 4 you will like this. I've gotten hundreds of hours into this game despite the bugs and other annoying stuff. It's a fun game and worth 20 bucks
---
Thanks
---
Pay 2 win is transactional. What you're describing isn't a transaction, it's a one time reimbursement intended for players affected by a bug.
---
It doesn't seem very balanced as far as numbers, but it's not p2w.
---
Someone nuked whitesprings tonight and I picked up 15 of them in this one run. Not sure that is nerfed? They went up for sale at my camp as soon as I was done....
---
exactly, vault steel might not be worth anything to you.  if your a bloody unarmed build you don't use power armor anyway. anyway sorry you lost your stuff.
---
Yea I close at 25k too! When people decide to splurg their whole bank roll it screws everything up!
---
False. Not every day. At least I have not. But there is nothing to do in game other than run whatever gives best rewards over and over and over with a few friends that still play.
---
I remember the feeling well.
---
Thanks. I'm hoping they're just putting the scrap out in waves.
---
I have been playing since beta, and everytime I decided I was tired of playing within a week I was back.. there is problems but it has never not been fun for me
---
Yeah it seems like all my legendarys are like that
---
Not if you speak Chinese.
---
You must have lost something to get this, and/or made a ticket. 
---
A few of my friends list things, myself included. We all made tickets. We all got the email. Two of us haven't received it as of early morning today. 
---
Two of us have. 
---
My bet is it's coming in waves.
---
you still need to raid to get the plans, can take a few weeks if you are unlucky
---
I agree with the others.  This is my favorite Fallout game, period.  I like the active economy, trading with other players, etc.
---
Yea I buy ALOT of stuff for scrip and an occasional decent weapon for 10k+ but I spend most of my caps they the trading subs on bulk ammo or high tier weapons or armor. I take all good rolled weapons and re sell them. I only can open my vending machine every 3 days because I’m never below 20k and only open if I’m well below that. A lot of my weapons can be utilized by mid level players that don’t need god tier weapons. Like one of the weapons was a two shot double vats related perks for 10k, an explosive zealots .50 cal for 2.9k then as I was leaning over to hit the power button I heard KA CHING! So they bought something else as well! And another person was buying random sentinel armor right before that guy! So no telling how much I ate. I generally keep 20-28 weapons in my vendor at any given time.
---
Hello. I run wwr sets. Both unyielding and bolstering. Its a real weight saver. I can carry all types of weapons and play which ever playstyle i feel. With that being said, that qffr tesla sounds really cool and high value. You could always get another armor piece same type with wwr so it doest affect your carry weight. And its much more common than acquiring a qffr tesla.
---
Creation club isn't an inherently bad idea, it was just poorly executed in FO4. If 76 had launched with paid modders creating reasonably priced content, Bethesda could have taken a fair cut and focused 100% on polish and major expansions.
---
There never really was a point to it.
---
The mainframe cores is a bug, but who cares if they made the silos more difficult? They're supposed to be end game anyway
---
but the ammo on my auto lol
---
People love to try and limit what constitutes as pay to win. But it's literally any situation in which you are paying for a perceived advantage over another player. This isn't limited to one time purchases or just weapons and armor, it includes anything in a game that players perceive as a mechanic to help them progress or "win" the game.
---
Yes
---
just remember run speed caps at 20% I think.  could be higher if anyone is 100
---
possibly its bugged. 
---
or he could be using an out of game aim bot, 
---
or he could be using berry mentants and just be very accurate. 
---
/shrug who knows, I dont like pvp in this game its pointless, unbalanced, and exploitable.
---
and gunfu
---
Can we get a fix for the freezing when consuming aid items.  And also proper 21:9 support would be greatly appreciated :-)
---
I run a full 5 piece set of marine wwr gear. I get almost all the junk I need from scrapping weapons. 
---
I use 3 points for stims wr, and 2 for aid. 
---
I also use 2 points for ammo wr, and 3 for energy ammo.
---
So seems like you need 5 pieces or 5 points each any way you cut it.
---
If you want aid or junk gear, you could use bear arms for help with weapon weight.  
---
I still give up some on armor and junk. 15 slots used for weight is all I'm willing to give
---
The qffr tesla is very nice, probably harder to find.
---
No but random people whom never put in a ticket are getting it which is what is causing some of the outrage.
---
Same. Following the post. I wonder if it takes awhile to show up
---
If lore is all you're interested in, sure, it'll be ok.
---
You just have to understand while there are some good lore and environmental story beats, you have to tolerate the overarching game. Not that much of an issue during the early game i.e. levels 1 to 20-30ish but it'll really kick in once to start approaching the end game.
---
If you've got the game already, go ahead. If not, I'd advise not purchasing it. Wait until at least Wastelanders DLC launches next year.
---
been playing since beta. I am happy with the game. not sure how you can get an unbiased answer here peeps either like it or dont. 
---
I tell my friends considering buying it. if you played fallout 4 long after the story line ended and just hung out in the wasteland, if you could cope with the many glitches of fallout 4, you will like 76 just fine.
---
In FO4 they are why I stay clear of mutant settlements. In 76 they seem to be really rare.
---
I have seen a dead suicider at one of the random encounter points. I think there was a live one at westtek one time?
---
Sounds like there were too many successful attempts, but with Bethesda who knows what number is too many ...
---
We all work for Bethesda here you'd best ask elsewhere.
---
cricketssssssssssssss..........................
---
Yeah ik, that's why I have to choose one or the other
---
I seriously dont understand it either. We can use literally every other CAMP item on the Atom Shop in workshops.   
---
This has got to be the easiest Bethesda please post... Im sure once they make workshops perpetual in private servers It'll get some outcry.
---
Bother me, sure. Affect my gameplay, no.
---
Nope lucky f******!
---
I haven’t played since this update lol but to my knowledge the plans can’t be traded
---
'it's literally any situation in which you are paying for a perceived advantage over another player'
---
'one time purchases'
---
Compensation for a bug = not a monetary transaction, the money was paid for an entirely different thing and the outcome was unexpected. You're REALLY trying too hard here. xD  
---
Just call it what it is, an excessive compensation. This is not a p2w situation.
---
They already confirmed that's the plan and if you put in a ticket and received an email your guaranteed to get it. Like I said idgaf bout the other materials, I wouldn't have a big gripe with 200-200 Vsteel, but 600 is ridiculous.
---
You received all that stuffs?
---
That's just a new diffuse texture for the helmet, not a new mesh.
---
P2W, you keep using this word. I don't think it means what you think it means.
---
Not me
---
How does one go about letting Beth know I lost stuff. Cause I lost my stuff and didn't winge about it. But hey they giving shit away I'll take it.
---
Yep, just as soon as you learn them.
---
I do understand that. I'd say around 400 max for it would probably be fair unless someone had proof they had more in a ticket.
---
try going into the atom shop for a few seconds and then joining again.  sometimes helps good luck bro
---
Yep
---
sorry, but hey good luck at the upcoming sale
---
I’m not getting any of this and I got a 1 month subscription.
---
I didn’t lose anything and I’m not bothered about it.
---
So people get the armour...what exactly did they win?
---
There are no leaderboards, no competition, just people walking around in fancy outfits and armour.
---
Does the armour make them unkillable even if they are a bloody build?  That’s the only way I could see it being unfair.
---
Wait, Fallout 1st members are getting free bulk junk? When? Does anybody have a link or can fill me in?
---
Nope, not me.
---
Fanny packs, 80s wrestler pre made characters (macho man especially, and iconic one liners of said wrestlers, like the prime armour)
---
If you've been saving it all for whatever reason and not making any of the armor then I could maybe see it.. but again I doubt you or anyone had mass amounts of the vault steel stored. I could see maybe 100 if the person already has full sets of everything and they still run it on the regular. But apart from those few outliers, the vault steel is a bit overkill.
---
You never know with Wastelanders. They may add a few wacky factions. There is a Red Chinese bunker under Mama Dolce's so you never know when the NPC's come back :)
---
Well you can’t sell or trade vault steel.
---
They just gotta tag you first. If the person isn't going invisible or behind cover, you can always vats while the sneak in plain sight, sometimes you have to hit them once free aim, sometimes you just gotta be closer.
---
The firefighter outfit from the mischief night hides the backpack.
---
I did not loose. I know some people that did. And thats why that if i had lost 15k acid that i farm doing vault raid back to back to back 50 time, 400 acid each run, i dont think bethesda giving me simply a t60 PA or a BE LMG that i already have would cut it. 
---
And its a small percentage of player that would get the 600 bault steel. Will increase a slight bit the amount of those PA in the game, but i dont expect to see server of 20 people wearing it all the time.
---
I didnt understand much of that, sorry xD.
---
Dnc?
---
Bds?
---
Yong's rage?
---
I never lost anything and I got 4 of them today
---
There never was any point of PvP.
---
Everyone is repopping SBs cuz we keep getting vats'ed through them. I don't trust continual use of one after a death right now. But people have a lot of them if those are the fights you are ending up in.
---
I've said this before: Bethesda needs to introduce signs that we can write text on at our camps. I would LOVE to be the guy to help out low level players with a good modded rifle with how long it takes to find and scrap them to get the mods. Made me furious because I had the perks but dont have enought copies of the weapons. Same goes for armor. 
---
I originally built my character around hack and lockpicking and being able to mod everything, so high perception and int, but that flies out the window when I have to find 70 bajillion copies of a handmade to unlock all mods. I'm still unlocking all the 10mm and shotgun mods
---
Bethesda is case you missed it. Bl3 put out its new patch notes today. Perhaps you should take a look so you can see an example of a comprehensive bug round up.. I know examples always help me better understand my work/goals.
---
And then what? You just don't relog and heal through bleedout attempts so no one wants to play with you?
---
No. If I am upset about something, I have every right to be vocal about it of I choose to.
---
Also, it's not just a game. I mean, Fallout 76 is just a game, but people aren't mad at the game itself. They're mad at people. The people that made the game. The people that have lied to us. The people that treat us like wallets instead of people. The people that released a beta for $60+ without telling is that's what the game was.
---
You don't like people complaining? Tough. They have every right to complain. Scroll past those topics and move on. Stop telling people what to do.
---
I did.
---
Its possible in the engine, Ive been two tapped by a raider in FO4 with a explosive shotty, it just isnt fun facing an enemy like that
---
Nothing here either, but don’t recall loosing anything.
---
A lot of us when just messing about 1v1 will agree to no vats to remove SBs from the equation. But if you are fighting with factions, not gonna happen. Course. A lot of factions are out of quantums and just choosing not to play cuz I guess dying is terrible or something. Idk.
---
I don't see them adjusting the price anytime soon for black Friday or anything else. Sorry hope I'm wrong but that would make them right so doubtful
---
Wishful thinking, I know. One can dream friend. 👍
---
Yeah and in a multiplayer fallout you should be able to gun down whoever comes near your house because its a fucking wasteland
---
Along with the fire breather uniform
---
The one main. Ive started a couple of mules, but i had not transferred any caps over this go around. Two of the mules sit with 30k. One has maybe 18k. The other has none as of yet. The reason for this post is, like I mentioned in another reply, this happened in a matter of seconds. Dude popped in, spammed the crap outta purchase and boom, 15k or so gone. Not a big deal, but it is rather irritating.
---
We need a chinese new year event based around communism.
---
Omg this is so true!
---
How did the nerf them?
---
So whiney.
---
Check out this video, some interesting testing:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqQZDPldfE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqQZDPldfE4)
---
There are some PA builds that can totally wreck and sustain. You just gotta make sure you have the right mods to make yourself tanky cuz 9 out of 10 PA boys just die instantly compared to legendary armor users.
---
It's not in the items like normal. Look at the wall as if your going to scrap or move it. It should give you a wallpaper or modify option. I cant remember what it says exactly.
---
I'm talking about hiding the backpack you have equipped, not putting on an outfit with a different backpack already on it. 
---
The responders outfit and Traveling Leather Coat both do this as well FYI
---
Tell me what you are doing to get that high of hp
---
Have they fixed the spot next to the watoga sign that insta kills when you walk in it?
---
I’ve gotten the plans on my first two characters, but the third one has yet to get one, and it’s already over level 100. I do wonder if it’s because that character is also bugged to whenever I log in, the quest pops up, without me picking up a new tech doc.
---
I came to argue, but when you're right, you're right!
---
Ahh good catch, I was thinking of an easily sustainable max hp but should consider those
---
About time someone said it
---
I’ve not achieved it, but theoretically should be possible using every possible source of hp increase
---
God the Tse days. Mine did 500 for whatever that meant cuz apparently it'd just one shot everything.
---
I know, was just saying. 
---
I have the BOS engineer outfit (I think that’s the one) the Oxygen tank clips through the back pack a bit and actually looks kind of cool.
---
That used to be an old standered place for experienced players to put there extra stuff for new players, I do it every now and then
---
Lol I was hoping for sling bags.
---
They removed the legendary spawns, you used to be able to make a circuit, and pull 3 legendaries easily.
---
Yeah I get that others like it. I don't see the fun nor the point of it personally.
---
Only if you now buy every single thing they sell on the off chance that something breaks and they randomly throw a bunch of resources at you?  That's not how pay to win works dumbass.
---
Well they dropped the price of the base game for a sale less than a month after release, so anything is possible
---
It was fun u less your farming mats
---
They cannot sell it.
---
The cannot share it.
---
Them having it does not make them harder to kill.
---
Them having it does not make them hit harder than me.
---
Them having it allows them to craft power armor that will soon be irrelevant.
---
This is not pay to win. Again.
---
On ps4 hit the button to modify the wall, then one of the trigger buttons to go to the wallpaper. The free grey is all the way at the bottom.
---
Just south of the sunken church that is used in that one Wild Wasteland quest is a sort of bunker made of cargo containers. It's on the eastern edge of the map, around half way up, not too far from Southern Belle Motel. Really cool place, and you can build inside of it. 
---
My current camp is build onto/into a ruined house just up the hill from R&amp;G Train station. Further along the ridge there are some cabins that you can build in/around as well.
---
Just be careful when applying it. While wallpaper doesn't take CAMP budget, there's a bug that can permanently affect your budget until they fix it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dyqbtv/warning_camp_budget_and_placing_wallpaper/
---
That would be a real kick in the face to everyone who paid full price less than a month ago.
---
They’re not as intimidating in 76. I’ve only seen them at West Tek and Huntersville and they’re much easier to handle to boot. I’d be more scared of behemoths and I’ve only encountered them 3 times since BETA.
---
It's fun for awhile, lacks content once your high level, bugs exist if they bother you don't vplay
---
There weren't any successful attempts, that was the point.  They weren't being it on that.  The guy never even reported it because he never even got it to work.
---
Did you check at your scrap box? I didn’t lose anything and I got it. My GF and none of my friends that have checked did. No idea why I did. https://i.imgur.com/n7wfPhQ.jpg
---
Just like it was when they dropped the price not even a month after release last year on P.A and Tricentenial editions last year?
---
Your refusing to acknowledge that this level of greed literally hurts profits. Epic Games charges less for skins in a FREE game than Bethesda does in a PAID FOR one.
---
Guess which company has a high market cap?
---
I'm an adult. I understand market basics but I strongly believe your just an apologist at this point.
---
I just sent proof of pur hase and still no recovery. I lost over 3k steel (yeah its steel but I build a lot) and who knows what else.... I farmed for like 18 hours straight on resources and know I had more than what I do now...
---
The main Fallout sub would be a better place for an unbiased answer.
---
That is very true. Stranger things have happened.
---
lol
---
A pretty cool one with only a couple radroach spawns and a TON of glowing mushrooms is somewhere in cranberry bog on the highway and it has an underground tunnel you can build in.
---
The amount of all the other scrap, and 1500 stable Flux... Can people sell that?  If so, looks like back Friday sales for the market came early.
---
Were you part of the event?  Sometimes I ft to the dropsite rather than the event and get killed before the event shows up in my quest list and Ill lose my junk.  
---
That said the game has been buggier than usual since the last update.
---
Your being willfully blind by labeling me as someone who hates the game. You can be angry because you want a game or an ip or other concept to do better.
---
You are using unrealistic examples such as grinding all skins in a game within a month when that is not what we suggest.
---
Cease the overexaggeration and open your eyes. 
---
Your magnificent analogy of taco bell is more as if they just started charging 5x as much and you started seeing the company falter due to the ludicrousness of what they ask.
---
I dont want a singleplayer fallout. I want a multiplayer fallout that isnt empty and packed with mtx. Don't hate on others because your too myopic to see an alternative.
---
Well as bombing as the game was doing yeah I guess still a kick to the face. I bought the game about 8 months later price matched on Walmart.com and it was 26 dollars. Lol
---
I just did a post about a serious bug been going on before meat week its prime weapon and ammo bug won't craft check my post for details
---
It only speaks chinese actually, sent you some examples on the Psycho discord server.
---
Whatever excuse you need to help justify why you can dismiss any point with abstract personal labeling.
---
This happened to me too forcing me to delete my second fog machine I had placed down. Grafton Monster... Angry...
---
You can't get banned for making unsuccessful attempts of that kind of exploit because they wouldn't be able to detect those attempts. They would all be limited to client side right?
---
I just dont believe you understand the difference between frugality and laziness based on your comment.
---
Sorry pal.
---
Give us a 400 Scrap box and 600 storage box

Personally  I prefer the Australian interpretation..... Bumbag
---
Succumb to depravity, unstoppable monster.
---
Nice hook. Great follow through. I love it
---
You make a fair point. Move on, right? Okay, so; to what? How many skins are earnable outside of nuclear winter? How much content is there aside from these mix's?
---
Same, but not 100% lost.  Went from 800 down to 100 .45.  Not a huge loss but still a problem.
---
Oh ty for the info!
---
Eksdee personal example kneeslap
---
Tyty
---
Vats still works but you have to hit em a couple times with normal aim first
---
Bounce ring for the camp to have fight nights.  Grapple emotes needed.
---
I tried to calculate it with a Fallout brand calculator but these numbers just dont add up, the end result keeps increasing but I'm not adding anything to it!
---
I was playing late last night, and fell asleep during a load screen. I think I had 15k caps at the time. I woke up about an hour later and saw my caps at MAX. I have no clue what sold or how much over max I lost. Shit.
---
Awesome ty!
---
A drop in the bucket and nuclear winter rewards. 
---
Colour me surprised.
---
Killing with friends or strangers is super fun dawg!
---
Ty then ill try and get one to replace the better criticals
---
Nope,nothing
---
As someone who only lost around 2 ceramic to be completely honest this does seem like a complete nerf of anyone's efforts. Additionally yes it may cause problems with the economy yes.. I was one of the lucky few who didnt lose anything noticeable and the even luckier who received the compensation. All i can say is to me it was worth the $13 however i dont think it was worth the division of the games fan base.. Bethesda is walking a fine line with micro-transactions and trying to remain free to play and free to win. However, i think at some point in time things will even out..
---
What an.. analogy.
---
I'm glad you are still enjoying it, however you patience and contentedness is likely not shared by the majority of the community. Myself included.
---
Ok, I wasn’t super into 4 without a lot of mods so maybe not lol.
---
Ohno... they combined the fog machines also in the latest update I believe x.x 
---
I know the feels though, did the same thing.
---
I would say that you are overestimating the percentage of redditors who are mad compared to the actual community.
---
A day ago you didn't know such a thing existed, I think it's fair to point out you also don't know Bethesda's limits to detect it.
---
I feel the whole game was the point of it.  It was advertised from day 1.  How do you not see a point?
---
Ok, no I haven’t bought it yet. I’ll probably do that to be on the safe side then. Thanks!
---
Just the bundles were over 5k though. I have a lot more than the bundle shit in there. Thinking I've spent at least 12-20k in the atom shop my guy
---
Tell me more stories about tse days grandpa!
---
Do you play much? I help new players daily. I'd say it is.
---
They literally have us no space to do this.
---
So is that a good or a bad thing?
---
What do you mean?
---
I did want to get a bunch of angry answers and figured you guys follow the game enough to give an answer that isn’t:
---
 “76 bad” 
---
“bethesda so bad.”
---
“Wheres my duffle bag?”
---
People get tired. It has been year. Sunk cost fallacy keeps the defenders stalwart. Not everyone has the inkling to endure 12 months of bargaining.
---
I believe you sent it as it popped up in my notifications but i cant find it anymore
---
 A much bigger b**uild budget, bigger space to build, less restrictions on where I can build, more STORAGE and a pack mule would be nice.**
---
Got mine for free from a duper friend when I turned level 50. I think it had a hardened receiver and that was it but you could do runs around whitesprings solo without a single care in the world. When I first did the nuke thing with all those fucking robots you would one shot everything, even the sentry bots. I would even go as far to say that the tse's sucked all the fun out of the game. God. The beginning. I remember spending all night the first weekend after Christmas in the ammo factory with 10 other friends getting 5.56 for our handmade.
---
But are they really gonna put that kinda effort in?
---
What is the end game in Fortnite Apex etc etc?
---
That's a rather large margin of error.
---
Would you say you find it immersive? I kinda miss that feeling of getting lost in world where I forget about everything else. Thats why I got into fallout 3 and new vegas so much. 
---
Everything felt so connected, I really felt like I was in another world.
---
1800 in 2 months means you don't play the game enough for then to care
---
No, and here’s why, the only reason people grind for it and crave it so much is it’s rarity. It’s not it’s looks that make it craved but it’s drop rate. It’s similar to a lot of art in my opinion, people don’t want that blank canvas that cost a million dollars cause it’s cool looking but rather it’s been assigned a hefty value so it makes them cooler if they own it.
---
$18 skins, atom challenges give $.10-$.40 each 🤣
---
Yeah wtf BGS.  I just earning my strangler heart PA and now you're \*\*\*\*\* giving it away? Spit in my face please. Guess i'm subbing up and putting in a fake ticket derp derp.
---
A raider, I feel like I’m being welcomed into a house to be murdered.
---
I definitely don't have any. No way I accidentally scrapped them without noticing either, I don't have that much flux. I wasn't expecting it anyway, I was just joking about how people screaming "pay to win!" are misrepresenting the situation. I have fallout 1st, never lost scrap, and haven't been bestowed these scrap bundles.
---
lol this is why I don’t even sell stuff that’s higher than 2k, that way I still have time to respond and minimize the loss.
---
Let's say I only spent 10k then, that's still 7k worth of atoms outside of the 3k that was in actual dollars. That's a quite a few of those PA skins. I might go through and count up the atoms though
---
I can't tell if this thread is daily or weekly for the past year. "We need X emote! We need Y emote! Anyone else agree??" 
---
Yes. Literally everybody does. They have wanted it since the BETA and Bethesda hasn't delivered.
---
Interesting I thought while sneaking you were impossible to target with vats. It seemed like me jumping was maybe triggering him being able to lock on though.
---
250 base, +75 from 15 endurance =325, +45 from life giver =370, +40 from nocturnal fortitude =410, +10 herd mentality 420, +55 from bufftats =475, +40 from food =515, +75 from alcohol =590, +10 from all rise =600, how do you reach 710?
---
This is a rather old thread and I dont want to spend the time calculating percentage of atomshop you own, atoms earned vs. purchased, and additional value given by bundles, as it would quite obviously be quite lengthy.
---
Let's agree to disagree?
---
Initially it makes it so your immune to lock on yeah. Once you get hit tho its game over
---
Dunno what the age of the thread has to do with it but sure lol
---
It’s a ‘my duped shit and aimbot is better than yours’ competition. You’re 100% right it’s pointless and pathetic to begin with.
---
Why? Do you use every legendary in your inventory? Why should the baddies.
---
I would never be caught dead paying for some dumbass shit that shoulda been done or fixed in the first place like tbh if you bought fallout 1st your a pathetic tryhard lol imho
---
Thanks, pc tho.
---
Thank you for commenting this so I didn't have to:p
---
I'm confused I just made prime ammo a few days ago and made a gun or two prime about the same time frame?
---
We have beer.
---
If 76 had launched with paid modders filling up the atom shop how much more space do you think this game would be taking up on your drive right now?  The strength of modding a single player game is that you only have to burden your system with the mods you want in your game, but in a multiplayer game you don't have that luxury.  Even if you don't buy a single thing from the atom shop every single mod from every single modder would need to have its assets on your drive on the off chance you run into someone who does have them unlocked.

*I've already filed a bug report on this*, but just to get it seen in as many places as possible: Crafting still gives preference for unscrapped junk items in stash over scrap in the scrap box.  Note that this is different from the bug fix mentioned above, re: scrapping vendor junk.  u/Ladydevann **is there any chance you can confirm this is on the team's radar for bug fixes?**  I tested again just now, post patch 15, and the bug is still present.
---
Example: Say you're crafting something that uses acid.  You have plenty of acid in your scrap box, and have a few acid-containing bug parts in your stash for future Stings and Things runs.  Crafting will auto-scrap the bug parts first before touching the waste acid in the scrap box.  This is the opposite of expected/desired behavior.
---
Can you send it in dm? It just doesn’t appear besides the notification. Sorry for the inconvenience and ty
---
The shadow prime armor.  Just click on it and it wi tell you have model its for.
---
Creation club is for an old zero maintenance game. 
---
Imo its an even bigger ripoff to charge for that crap
---
Lol you must be having a laugh.
---
Two months to earn 1800 atoms?  You can make that much in three to three and a half weeks tops, even sooner if you're not lazy like I am and actually do the raid challenges.
---
"Am I jumping the gun, Baldrick, or are the words  'I have a cunning plan' marching with ill-deserved confidence in the  direction of this conversation?
---
LOOK IN THE MIRROR
---
Wow. Nowadays it’s all about bloodied weapons with unyielding armour pieces.
---
The BoS Scribe outfit hides the backpack
---
When team agenst team relog so it's fair but when its one or two people using stealth telsa just wait till they had enough then it's pve walking around the map without the chance of dying
---
To whom? lol
---
Campaign and leveling up for the first time is really fun, but the endgame content is vey underwhelming.
---
Not bad, not bad. I ended up paying $54.00 AUD for my copy on day of the release. Hurray for price matching.
---
If someone is in sneak/invisible/stealthed; If you hit them once. You can VATS them. Stagger helps because they usually cannot move. Railway rifles have the highest chance for staggers next to Explosives. Sentinel does not work in sneak! If you are jumping- Sentinel does not work. Standing upright sentinel works but a vats headshot negates this. If you are hit you can be vats.
---
They are using bloodied or junkies most likely
---
It could be a scorched-rider with rifle on her back )
---
Lmao I have none of that stuff. I'm an on and off player. I still have roughly the same gear and weapons I had last December
---
Where are the behemoths? Isnt there a "swan" like one somewhere?
---
I already knew because its been on this sub for at least a week, and correct me if I'm wrong but the anti-cheat measures that B uses are just to identify if you are running 3rd party utilities like Cheat Engine. Those can be bypassed. If you could change your inventory with CE (if that was possible) would that even be detected, unless it included &gt;100k rare items?
---
Ah yes, because not being attacked by literally the first enemy you encounter in the game is all that much of an advantage.
---
Compared to litterally any other pay to win mechanic I think it would actually be pretty funny to have.
---
R u using max demolition expert in intelligence?
---
I’m ready to delete the damn thing after it told me I need to free up 50 gigs to install a 5 gb update.
---
There are glitches that allow it. In fact, leaving render range and returning allows an enemy to completely negate a stealth boy effect. You still show as invisible and under its effect to you, but to them you're visible and able to be targeted in VATS. 
---
This is often exploited further by some who will leave render range, sneak back in, then activate their own stealth boy. This means they're invisible and unable to be targeted in VATS, while the opposite is true for you.
---
Weird, I wonder why some folks got free loot when the didn’t lose junk and have a support ticket.  Did you guys who got free junk file a different type of support ticket around the same time?
---
Bloody mess. All rifle perks, tank killer. Demo expert for tse.
---
Eh, I feel a co-op setup like Borderlands does would've been a better fit.
---
Did you send it a different type of support ticket at that time? Or any other reason you might have gotten this that you can think of?
---
One free 18 dollar skin every two months is still alot Lol and where the fuck was the Merc Trouble Maker outfit?
---
I learned it had changed the hard way when I tried to find the key on my alt character, and it was nowhere to be found, lol.
---
Weird. Hopefully they figure it out for you.
---
Was it playing Cluedo before?
---
Did it kill  a 1* Mole Miner in the kitchen with that pipe and was disposing of the evidence?
---
I swear I've needed an I'm sorry emote alot lately.  A accidently hit the camp owner when they snuck up on me right after I saved their camp from super mutants,  I thought they we're one I'd missed lol.  Same thing happened during the event at the compound place cause the lighting was still funky.  Thankfully I keep pacifist mode on always so didn't hurt anybody lol.  Since I play with a headset with a mic I usually push to talk and tell them sorry thought I missed one.  Usually don't get a response or get shot back at so that's good.
---
That is a MASSIVE waste of perk points unless you have tons of extra points.  Only the 1st point is worth taking where you get 4% more next damage. After that, each point only add 2% more net damage which is horrible.
---
I hope it gets better!
---
Why would they waste their time on such a tiny inconsequential change to appease so few ppl?
---
I’m just spitballing ways to get damage higher
---
You only want to do Demo Expert 1.
---
yeah, I feel like all the:
---
" I don't want to PvP but sit in PvP zones to play Bonanza and act all tough with their cowboy hat and TSE dragon "  crowd who whined when they got robbed or had their little fort set on fire and their love interest slaughtered complained so hard partially because this wasn't Fallout 5; got PvP nerfed. This game would have been better off open world PvP all the time. oh well- I love it for what it is. PvP was the point and the babies got it taken away.
---
No, you cannot.
---
Again, I'm not equating the two.  I'm saying if you want a game where you can get all the cosmetic items you want, in a current day MMO, you are going to need to grind or pay out.
---
It's not ideal but without a lofty goal that only few can attain, it loses its appeal to many and will cease to be profitable. It remains a drain financially long enough and they will pull the plug on the full game.
---
I'm just saying 'be realistic.'
---
True, it it can gain him 12% total more damage with it maxed out at 5 of 5.
---
Reddit isn't that important, go post in Bethesda forums. This is a smack talk lounge
---
800 atoms for a fanny pack coming soon!
---
Is it really only that little? That’s so disappointing! I’m going to have to check on that. It may be time to redistribute some points 👍🏻 thanks for the tip
---
I believe they made the atomic shop so expensive to make the creation club look more appealing by comparison. I am willing to bet that when The Elder Scrolls VI and Fallout 5 come out, they are going to push the creation club hard.
---
What's with nerds writing essays ,with this game sheesh ever other post is a public outcry ....
---
if that was the case my luck would give me only super mutant suiciders
---
Coming soon!  Bigger camp budget for 5000 atoms!!!  You asked for it!
---
if you ever get two shot exploding gauss rifle/dragon, you know it means alot of caps
---
Why is it so important to you what character someone else plays?  Its their gaming experience, not yours.
---
You have issues man.
---
I thought it was because in third party, young guys (male) don't want to be looking at a dude's ass throughout the game, seems many blokes in Fornite do the same. Seems reasonable.
---
I'm gay and play a male character...
---
Bite Me! 😆
---
I subscribed to 1st just to try it out. I buy at least 1 sub month on every game because i like to play with the extra benefits. 
---
Anyways, i bought a fridge from the atom shop. I have a BIG nukashine farm (duper gave me 10k quantums wayyy back) and found out the refrigerators INVENTORY takes up budget space. After i found this out, i immediately unsubbed 😋
---
Bruh
---
Hands down one of the weirdest flexes I've ever read. Tell us more about your balls.
---
Why does it matter to you
---
Maybe you can float out of Craglorn.
---
Actually yes, I sent a ticket for not being able to access the scrap box
---
Because female avatars tend to have better styling done to their outfit versions. What can I say, I like my broads classy?
---
Who hurt you?
---
Could this be desperation on Bethesda's part, may not be a good sign for the game, maybe perhaps possibly? Dunno.
---
Okay, let me first say. I don't understand it either.... if I am playing a game no matter what it is I want that character to look like me so I can immerse myself further. ( I wish more games had dreadlocks as hair styles. As a white man with dreads lol
---
However dude, and unfortunately I hate redditors who bitch/moan/disagree/troll etc. For no reason at all. But this is a shit post... if someone wants their character to be a chick then it's their choice.
---
I could care less really but i see no advantage unless you just like to role play as being a woman. Notice I said ADVANTAGE not preference.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Totally agree. Everybody should only play a game as the same race, gender and age of their actual selves. 
---
I threw my Tomb Raider game out in the window in absolute fury at the idea that I would have to play as a *woman* and -- get this -- one with a woman's name. 
---
They just took it too far, y'know?
---
I have issues but being a woman isn’t one of them.
---
If this is such an issue to you, why not post it on the general gaming subreddit? Pretty sure this happens in every game 😂
---
My point is what is the advantages? Gay or straight shouldn’t matter.
---
Relax, don't be a  Mike Pence
---
This is not pay to win. Why? We didn't pay or even know we were gonna get this much scrap. Bethesda is being generous to us. Simple as that. They treat vault steel like any other scrap so that's why they gave back so much.
---
Who knows? Likely maybe! 😂👍🏼
---
Are you implying being a woman is an issue? Or are you implying that people playing however they wish is an issue? Seems you do have an issue with control, should probably realize you cant control others and that attempting to do so will just get you more ostracized than you already are.
---
I just don’t see hit size really being any different. Not a flex just looking for the advantages.
---
It's the perk, not shotguns themselves?
---
I wanna know if it helps them play better. I asked the advantages, simple question.
---
What if they reduced the number of players in a public server by 4 or 6, wouldn't that help with render times? Rendering time is the main reason for the low camp budget, isn't it? Also once they add an increase camp budget for 1st player in private server it should carry over to public severs as well.
---
In NW you pretty much only get 3 armor sets so style points don’t count lol.
---
I'll take it because I'm a sellout for Camp Budgets and other stuff that expands on anything.
---
I'm sorry people who hate this stuff, I do too but I want it ;-;
---
Not hurt, just trying to find the advantages of playing as a woman over a man.
---
Not my point. Notice I asked for the advantages.
---
Seriously, how do you not know that Belarus is a country? 
---
Put down the video game controller and pick up an atlas.
---
The guy that said it would be a kick to the face to the people that paid full price less than a month ago. I had the same thought as you did about how it was a kick in the face at launch to people who paid full price, especially the more expensive versions.
---
I just wanted to know what the advantages are. They could play as a frog and I’d want to know if it helps their game play in any way.
---
Freedom of speech, yo.
---
&gt; If you hate Bethesda that much - please move onto a game/company that you enjoy. 
---
The people that hate the game did move on, they are not in this subreddit. People don't complain here because they hate the game they complain cause they want it to improve.
---
Well, just off the top of my head all of the BOS PA paints, like 7 or so? And several nuka cola paints
---
It’s repayment for the earlier scrap box glitch that occured
---
I certainly think so, and the world is four times the size of FO4.
---
Not a issue I just want to see how or if it helps their game play. That’s why I asked if their were any real advantages.
---
Wow. Going to need you to step away from your computer for a little while. Do a puzzle or take a hit bath.
---
Trust me, I don’t wanna be a Hoosier.
---
I can’t hear you, I’m drowning in 1.5k stable flux
---
That might be it. 👍
---
I think some characters lost small amounts maybe even unnoticeable. I've had a few people in some groups say they had them on 2 characters. One person said 3 characters but it commonly seems to be one character. I didn't have any on my main but my secondary character did
---
That could work though it would make public servers kinda boring as for me already it is rare to stumble upon someone unless at a camp lol
---
But I doubt it is really rendering time as they said they couldn't expand the stash due to issues and unless they resolved that for the unlimited scrap box they had to have done something about it to make it possible or just told us that it didn't work because they can (hopefully not but with how things have been, who knows) but there are many different things that could've happened and who knows what it was but currently I believe it is easily possible with some tweaking and small reworking of the rendering system or other systems to improve everything to make this possible with as little sacrifices as possible!
---
Oh I though it was pussy bags?
---
The first point increases total damage by 4%.  Each subsequent point after that is only 2%.  So it’s a pretty bad perk besides *maybe* the first point.
---
I did.. maybe five times that much, ten times even prob
---
"It's not a bug, you're just bad! Wolves outside the floor is cheating."  
---
If you're serious and not just a troll, I'd appreciate a video for how to kill the wolves that spawn in the ground and don't attack after multiple molotovs and plasma grenades.
---
Why do games like TF2 give people UNUSUAL hats (used to) and special hats for finding exploits? Because Valve aren't shitheads as much as Bethesda. They should be REWARDED.
---
I've been using thumbs up for yes and thanks. A sorry one would be great.
---
Coming soon! Lightning bug jars for 1000 atoms!!!  You asked for it we brought it!
---
Idr it's location, but there is a Behemoth in a pond just like Swan.
---
For me. Almost all plans are 15c that's .25 lbs for each plan sitting in my stash. I want them outta there! Buzzblades, mutton meat pie, the super common stuff is sold for the insane price of 0c
---
&gt; No one signed up for 1st expecting to lose their scrap only to receive a ludicrous reward later on. These people did deserve to be given these reparations.
---
At least you have a backpack, I’m lvl58 and just yesterday I realized that there is backpacks in the game :)
---
I’d say if there are any advantages, they are negligible 
---
But let’s suppose for a second that there really is a small advantage... fallout76 is really not competitive enough of a game for that to matter 
---
I’m sure most dudes play as female characters because just because they want to.  And I’m sure some women play as men just because they feel like it.  
---
It’s actually quite funny that you made this post now, because after 300+ hours in this game, I JUST turned one of my characters into a female character.  Why? Because there’s a glitch with the trapper torso where the trapper torso goes over the clothing  that you’re wearing and it looked funny with the civil war era dress.  So I turned my character into a fabulous woman. That simple.
---
So many butt hurt ppl over a simple question about what real advantages their are to play as a female character. Play as a dead dogs ass if you want but explain what advantages it gives you in game play. And my comment about me having the balls to play as a male character meant I’ll play a bigger build and still kick ass, it’s about the perk cards , hand and eye coordination more the anything if you wanna be real about it. Sorry I hurt so many feelings asking about advantages. Play how you wish, I could give two fucks really but don’t say your not always looking for an edge to be better as well.
---
Eh, there's plenty of benches to craft at all over the place. I just find a station to toss junk sometimes, but I hardly pick up anything lately. Things for repairs, things for cooking, and that's about all I pick up that isn't right into selling for the daily limit. After that it's only ammo and legendaries getting picked up.
---
Lmao you tryin’ to psychoanalyze this person? 😂
---
Worked for me fine, did this quest just yesterday actually
---
Nope, just bought 100 and paid 10k
---
I did get the free junk, but I didnt notice loosing any scrap.
---
Though, the keyword is notice. I didnt manage the scrap box after reciving it, so I could've lost stuff without knowing it.
---
At least I assume thats why I got this compensation.
---
Well with a post like this, someone needs to.
---
Bug fixes coming soon to the atom shop.   6000 atoms for a finished game..    *actually I bet they could sell that shit for real...   "
---
Thank you! That answered my question. That’s all I was going for was what advantages there are. Ppl can play how ever they want but in NW like any competitive game I’m always looking for an edge to make my game play better. If the female characters fire faster, run faster or are harder to hit I would build a female same as if any of those where better on a male character.
---
We are looking for some more players to run the vault on Xbox. What's your GT? I can send you an Xbox message the next time we are running a raid.
---
This worries me. So soon we are going to have to pay to be able to use mods.
---
Kinda feels like I’m getting away with something.. idk.. junk is irrelevant now I guess.
---
Man this sub has really gone to shit
---
Yes, yes it has.
---
how bout useless stuff doesn't cost dollar amounts?
---
The reason this is not pay to win is that this is an unexpected, one-off incident in which the devs decided to compensate player for a major fuck-up.
---
P2W would be selling those packs in the shop for Atoms. 
---
That being said, there are undeniable P2W aspects in FO76. 
---
1. The Scrap Box
---
2. Repair kits for Atoms
---
3. Scrap Robot
---
4. Fridge
---
Bethesda is overcompensating for their mistake, being overly generous. It's a nice gesture of them, but also, it's arguably TOO generous. Probably they're trying to hold onto 1st subscribers and keep their money coming in each month.
---
You can however drop the strangler heart power armor, so you can sell that
---
I think this is an indication of the, perhaps, unintended consequences of a subscription platform. The reality is that when you have a customer base that’s paying every month, you have to keep those people happy. That means acting fast to resolve problems and being overly generous when you need to make them whole after a loss. 
---
For Bethesda, these items cost nothing. From their perspective it’s going to be smarter and more efficient to simply shower people with scrap than risk pissing off subscribers by giving too little. 
---
Is it right or fair? Probably not, but it’s clear that issues affecting subscribers are going to be dealt with much more efficiently than things have been handled in the past.
---
That quest is a little buggy, at least it was for me. The only way I managed to complete it was to do it when I first got the holotape. If I logged for the night it was gone, I couldn’t server hop either.
---
Mmm.. makes sense. I can see it from both ends, those that bought the membership straight off the bat paying $12.95USD/$22.95AUD for the membership only to have it become cheaper a month or two later. Or then there is those that are hoping it becomes cheaper, so they have the chance to purchase the FO1st membership and get to experience the perks of it.
---
But I guess, we'll wait and see if Bethesda chooses to drop the price or not. Only time will tell.
---
I know vats crit stacks. It makes my bloodied crit lever go from 1650 damage to just over 2000. Not sure if better crit does or not, I heard it was bugged
---
Aand here we have a reason bethesda finally fixed it, it can be exploited xd
---
Can't 100% confirm, but as far as I know, yes. It's more of a skin than a paint.
---
Wish you'd just posted this instead of that other comment.
---
You may be able to push that high with low health if running Adrenal Reaction and Nerd Rage. Remember though, that damage number doesn’t reflect the armor your AAE is ignoring. Nor does it account for sneak crits, which is really where your power is going to come from with those weapons.
---
The reason they do 28 is bc of February although most companies take this into effect and implement something to offset that I'm assuming Bethesda doesn't so they just leave it at 28.
---
Short answer:  Yes.  
---
Long answer: No, of course, it isn't, because they are just fixing a bug, it was unexpected, and all the items are obtainable through the game, and also I love to suck Bethesda's dick and I will downvote this comment for being hate speech.
---
Better to give everyone one month free for Christmas. That way, even if you already subscribed, you just get an additional month. And if you haven't subscribed, you can see what it's all about. Bethesda's greed would never do that though.
---
Yeah someone sent a post about it looking at the stats and demostraiting that it is bugged
---
So I have it with 4 points into it and I’m only noticing an 8% increase (roughly)! That’s ridiculous! According to the perk card my explosives now do 50% more damage... what a heart breaker!! Wow! 
---
Well thanks for the heads up! I only tested and did the math on two guns but one was like 8.6% and the other was 8.2% that bites!
---
My subscription won’t renew next month, and I got the scrap.  But I did lose a lot and even filed a ticket.
---
Yeah, but not gonna lie, if you have your guard down those things do pack a punch jaja
---
It's a hell of a technical mess. Very buggy, glitchy, unstable, poorly optimized, etc. That being said, I enjoy it in small doses. It's not a good game at all, but there is some fun to be had.
---
Thank you.
---
I guess camp budget is a cosmetic item?
---
Not sure what you mean by "because of February". I mean, yeah, I get it, there are 28 days in February... so what?... If there are 28 days in February then November should be 28 days too? What is the logic behind that, I don't seem to get it.
---
Food spoils. Cant select specific servers, cant chat to advertise. 23 players isnt a great participant base with level divides and events going on no matter what youre doing. Non persistent crashing worlds. No incentives
---
Roleplay was never going to survive. Best you can find is armor and weapon dealers, which is just barely good enough
---
I don't it would be Bethesda, to be perfectly honest. More so the parent company Zenimax, really wanting to milk 76 whilst it's still has fans. But honestly, seeing as Bethesda has gone dark in terms of communicating with us, I don't know anymore.
---
Is it possible to make a mod to solve the games problems?
---
Just saying Bethesda is taking the smallest month and Applying it to every month aka the way that'll make more money.
---
Not much. It's basically the same game, the good and the bad
---
You can equip the default lib prime skin to any power armour so dont see why this one would be any different! 
---
Sorry I cant be 100% but im 90% that it will fit for them all
---
This one actually doesn’t say specific pa models
---
Well then I'd say the reason they do 28 is that they want to make more money rather than because there are 28 days in February ;)
---
You know as they say "there has to be a reason" it's just something I came up with bc if someone ask why is each thing 28 days they would say "because of February etc" basically I'm just saying they would use it as a excuse
---
Can you sell/drop/trade vault steel?  I only have 3 and have never tried.  How much total would you need to craft every piece of armor?  I don't have the plans and know I'd have to earn them, but if I could buy the difference and save some grind I'd probably do it if possible.
---
 Why add new weapons, if Legendaries just give the same effect? Why waste your time on anything?
---
Gives more customisability and variety. Not to mention 95% of the work being done.
---
So, for those that lost flux and vault steel in their scrap box you think they should have nothing back? I am glad you are not in charge here.
---
When I built on whitesprings property I would have to try lots of worlds try a different spot
---
&gt;I seemed to recall a rather large wailing from people about the creation club.
---
Charging for mods when every game you've made since fo3 has an unofficial patch mod to fix the 10000 bugs and make the game stable tends to make people upset
---
Isn't the hellfire chapter a serious brotherhood rp group? That's literally the only one I've heard of because they take it so seriously
---
I know there are bunk beds in the game, just thought why not customise and make one yourself. 
---
I get what you're saying tho.
---
Is this official? Did they say they patched it?
---
I think 10 for a piece of armor and 30 for a piece of Power Armor. You can't drop or trade steel or pieces of armor. You *can* drop a chassis with Strangler PA on it, but it's technically a glitch and it can get you banned if you do it on Market76.
---
Fun, caps, and junk. 
---
You know how the game literally advertised it.
---
They charge your account 2 days before the new subscription service renews, they count each month as 30 days. Relax.
---
R u Fallout 1st?
---
You are part of the problem but thats whatever. 
---
Piece of advice for ya...if youre going to passive aggressively talk shit in your post, you should at least know how to reply to people's comments
---
Does your anti-armor tesla not arc as well?
---
Check your pip-boy after you pick it up. You might have mistaken clicked on it on the map and hid it when you had it early on, should still be in your pip-boy then, just hidden and you can track it again from there (most likely must pick it up first for it to appear as hidden in your pip-boy.
---
There have technically been some quests on the atom store, with the few posters that were released with some updates but there aren’t there anymore *cough cough * BETHESDA
---
Invisible Gloves and Cape was a microtransaction in MapleStory lol. Limited for 30 days when you bough it too..
---
The plasma pistol and tesla are really nice
---
Yeah, they are here. I've met them near FEV building... that brought back some bad memories.
---
Sometimes you have some other event active (Horde, Messenger etc) and don't count as joining the Scorched Earth Event, thus dropping your loot.
---
Mostly, you’re right, but I think 76 should go the way of SWTOR in terms of roleplay mechanics and names. Your character has a name, a title you earn, and then you choose to display underneath the name of your ‘legacy’, or characters you’ve confirmed are yours and wish to broadcast such with the in-game lineage system. Using my main character as an example, his name is Vitya Kallig. His title, right now, I just have set as Darth. And underneath that, it says ‘The Perle Legacy’, with Perle being my in-game account name. One of my side characters is Captain Ophelia Tabris, but it still says ‘The Perle Legacy’ under that. 
---
Maybe something like this for Fallout 76? That way naming my character at the start makes sense, and other plays that are on my friends list can see even if I am on a different character, which one I am on and who I am.
---
Thats dumb lol
---
You say this as if you're paying for a utility like Internet or mobile phone service. It's a subscription for a game.
---
There's absolutely zero reason why they would need to charge you early at all.
---
I have done multiple times on novive... Time races are stupid.
---
The Tesla, Plasma and 50 cal are all worth something. The rest are borderline.  I deal with this by putting 3 star weapons in my vendor for 2k.  If they sell; I'm happy I didn't scrip them.  If they don't, scrip.
---
I'd like them to release a smaller map, like just the Charleston main area and make it solos.
---
The most fun pvp i had was on release.  Invitation damage was a genuine threat if you were persistent. Eventually you could sometimes annoy someone by plowing through enough of their stimpaks that they would want to fight you. 
---
I fought hundreds of people, through pvp i funded all my mutations off full price serum purchases from the bunker, and literally stole hundreds of thousands of pounds of junk from the weight exploiters, only to dump it all in a random bush. 
---
I felt like a vigilante punishing the cheaters who were causing server instability with my oneshot kill Unarmed build. 
---
Now pvp is entirely dead, and i haven't played adventure mode outside of seasonal events since NW release.
---
I agree. Yet, that is what they are doing. I am just saying so OP would know.
---
No, they shouldn't have gotten that much back, 600 Vault Steel is ridiculous.
---
I think they just gave high amounts so there wouldn't be even more backlash from people saying they had more of one item 
---
Pretty much overcompensating instead of under
---
I agree with the “on release” part.
---
If you attacked a camp, you would get wanted, and the owner of the camp would attack.
---
I would rack up thousands of caps worth of bounties. I would try and hold on to that as long as I could, and it was awesome!
---
Besides Bobblehead-glitchers, it was awesome
---
This is a ridiculous post. 
---
They're making up for a major fuck up. The fuck up isn't just that the bug occurred that wiped out VIP player's scrap but they have no means\* to know what got wiped.
---
\*Well, they actually do have the means to i.e. go back to the last backup compare and contrast scrap and just restore back scrap lost. However, it's very time consuming and it'll be quicker, cheaper &amp; easier to do it the way they ended up doing it.
---
Given that they have NO clue how much scrap was lost, they have to err on the side of being generous.
---
What the hell would you do if you were in Bethesda's shoes after such a fuck up? For me, this seems about right.
---
Just not true.
---
I'm pretty sure that I lost a small amount on my alt. I sent in a ticket today, let's see how it goes.
---
It should be; bought it and put on ultracite/strangler. Though it's *very* loud. :)
---
Boooohooooooo
---
Ir it doesn't say any particular model then it's for all of them although I can't confirm either.
---
VATS isn’t that bad, plus with how chaotic we move and the poor gun mechanics it almost makes it like a typical MMO with lock-on.
---
There is not a single game with PvP that you can just be invisible through-out the entire confrontation with no counter. 
---
There really is no defense to the persistent stealthboy use. It’s just a poor, and overlooked, game mechanic that has ruined PvP
---
Fanny packs mean nothing without an economy to trade my Fanny items
---
Nah i seen theyre screenshots multiple people it was a tse
---
My turrets shoot each other
---
Except that more characters means more entries on database on whatever data storage they use... for all data that char has.
---
larger storages require more effort to retrieve data.
---
I still like the game. I've paid for it, I'm gonna play it. But bethesda, not so much any more. I'f heard that mods will be tied to private servers, guess that's a cosmetic item then.
---
Oh for sure, I agree with the seeing it from both sides thing. I don't agree with the price, because I'm in Canada so it's $130 per year or nearly $19 per month. I'm assuming you're Australian judging by the comparison of USD to AUD? Australians seem to have it the worst for the cost. I bought a month to try it out and love it, but I can't justify spending so much on a single game just to play it how I've always wanted to: in a private world. Bethesda can't please everyone, but they can at least make better choices.
---
Not until you are fallout 1st and have your crap deleted and then get banned for the duration of the whole event
---
Here have this comment in in lieu of a second upvote.
---
Whos to say that vault steel only works for this raid? Your point is valid but also useless and not damning at all. Getting lucky on your first run and getting the plans means an instant set. It also means only farming plans not steel. Its super fucked up. Especially after patch 11 thousands of players lost all their pa and were given nothing. Literally nothing.
---
It is pay for serious in game advantages. There is no winning in fo76 so that statement doesnt really apply
---
I agree, what I was arguing against was that you think they should have no recompense at all for lost flux and vault steel.
---
I love the game because there is no PVP, 🤷🏼‍♀️ maybe is just what the majority of people like! You should try Sea of Thieves, it is 90% PVP. :-)
---
nice! :D
---
was really nice this way to get a full perked out character still standing outside the vault 76 \^\^
---
only problem is i dont have the plans, ft points and stuff on that char. but this toon is for fun only anyways, so doesnt matter \^\^
---
Actually you can because it is. More pay for extreme advantages because you cant "win fo76 anyway. There is no end.
---
But you see, PvP is still in the game. It’s just horrible now. It wasn’t always this way, but this is what it’s become.
---
And plus, I love fallout, and this game use to be everything I ever wanted. I like MMORPG’s, and this was my favorite one.
---
Two questions
---
1. Did you put in a ticket?
---
2. Did you purchase 1st in those 2-3 days of the glitch?
---
1. Did you purchase 1st in those 2-3 days of the glitch?
---
Mr Pebbles fanny pack!
---
So everyone who lost months of work to 9ther bugs not 1st members getting nothing is okay then?
---
Not everyone uses fully duped shit
---
Your just so wrong its hilarious
---
It's fun hunting players instead or dumbass ai lol idk how most of these pve brain dead idiots will be killing the same ai over and over again picking more and more stuff up like wtf how does that even entertain you anymore
---
I’m a subscriber.  I didn’t lose any scrap, so I never put in a ticket. I didn’t get an email saying I’d get free scrap.
---
No I think it was after the all clear was given with the scrap boxes.
---
I see! I must say what I love about Fallout is that everyone helps each other, It warms my heart, I love the community, the trading and I am so shit at PVP 🙈 lol
---
Mate, according to your posting history you seem to really dislike pvp with stealthboys... I would assume the gamescape on xbox is quite different from PC, as folks tend to prefer easy to aim/vats weapons - here I meet all kinds of pvpers; sure there are many cloaked teslaboys, but also bloodied heavy PAs, junkie critters, bloodied lasers, gauss snipers, you name it. Keeps the fights interesting.
---
Makes sense, they would be able to look and confirm that you a "1st" at the time the glitch happened thus, make sure you're not on the list.
---
It takes a lot more than 16 runs as you stop getting plans each run after a time.  I'd guess it's more like an average of 30 or so runs to get 100% of the plans.  
---
But yeah man 600 Vault steel is a fuckton.  That's enough for 3 full sets of strangler pa and 1 of each of the other non pa sets.  And thanks to an easy exploit, the strangler can be given to other players and thus traded for high end weapons, given to alt characters or friends, etc.
---
Pussy
---
When was this? I ran into four legendary gutsies the other day in Watoga, but I don't recall ever seeing a gutsy there before so might have been a seperate spawn
---
While it is possible to do that with right build, you still have kill the guy jumping around and spamming tesla while click-click-clicking on those stims and quantums. Doable, but definitely not lol.
---
Auto mate
---
Probably this, you'll have to FT to the event itself, to get logged as taking part.
---
Not just the SBQ either, other day FT'd to the wife to help with her event, but because I didn't FT to the event itself (IE, pay caps) I didn't join nor complete the quest, even though I killed half the bad guys from the quest
---
This company could give some players the game for free with 100k scrip on all five character slots and a five year 1st membership, and the pitchforks and tiki torches will still be brandished.  Ridiculous.
---
I loled, thank you.
---
Have this comment in lieu of another upvote.
---
Then I had a disturbing thought, they will have unlimited cap storage for 1st members only.
---
I finely got it, I tried putting on a collar as others have recommended that and it worked first try.
---
Without the dmg cap it would almost certainly gravitate towards ohk weapons - blodied snipers and such. What would help though, is multiplying HP pool, at least several times,
---
For max damage you need five.
---
Oh yeah, hands down the price is the only issue I have with the whole subscription saga. And yeah, I'm Australian hence the comparasion. It seems, Canadians get it rough as well. :/
---
F*ck... So I have to successfully do the raids to get plans to craft the acid game crashing power armor? 
---
I'll just throw my 600 vault steel in stream then.
---
I'll keep the 1500 Flux, just in case though.
---
Thank you Bethesda.
---
What the fucknis a fanny pack? Fanny is slandered for vagina where I come from so I'm now pretty concerned/ disturbed.
---
god luck if u think they will gave us free budget ... u gotta pay for it dude
---
&gt;what I love about Fallout is that everyone helps each other 
---
yes, my favorite part of fallout lore is how there is no conflict anymore at all anywhere on the planet, and everyone lives in peace and harmony now.
---
100% agree ... bethesda must fix stealth boys and eliminate all vats restrictions ... the only vats restriction we shoulòd have is like in survival servers .... if u don't handle a weapon ... u r immune to vats ... that's it ... no crauching . no chamaleon . no stealth boy ... i hape the last chance of hope that bethesda will fix pvp shame
---
Bought it last week for 20$.
---
Totally worth it if you liked FO4.
---
Sure, I have had a few bluescreens and been annoyed about patch size and server maintenance, but that is because I like the game and want to play.
---
Probably put more than 20 fun hours into it already.
---
Oh, and community is amazeballs.
---
Thank you
---
Here have this comment in lieu of another upvote.
---
nerfing dmg is the way imo ... specially critical shots and headshots
---
having some fun with other players u don't know .... untill u get bored of pvping and became friend with them
---
They better have a lot of carrying capacity!
---
You took the word right out of my mouth.
---
If you had a microphone, you'd be able to get the message across fairly quickly.
---
&gt; a private Ultima Online server (POL based)
---
Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
---
(English Is not native language)
---
Months before launched i planned to build a stage, Sell entrance tickets and play instruments, all of that went away as soon as i saw how bad the building mechanics were. 
---
Tbh i expected f76 to be like Rust but with a Fallout coat of paint, needless to say, i was dissappointed.
---
Walking around at 18k pounds? you won't be able to pull anything off that character. That junk is useless. 1500 over max carry weight and anything you drop is insta destroyed
---
I do my best with the Silver Shrooouuuud but I've been super busy lately.  Most of my spare time this quarter has been job hunting, but I've got an accepted offer!  I have free evenings again!
---
You need some tesla arcs firing on that ring, then you could be summoning some kind of otherworl critter
---
I didn’t get an email. I’ve never lost scrap.  A tiny part of me in envious of those who did, but I’m just happy that BGS is going HAM on making it right.
---
I think it’s cool that they’re being so generous.  There is no way anyone can complain they were short changed, but of course that’s not good enough for some.  I wish internet dwellers didn’t twist everything into a negative, but that’s the age we live in.
---
lmao I know rip
---
You should change that, it's a big security flaw.  My display name is AgShroud, but that's not my account name.  
---
If someone knows your account name, it's only a matter of time before they figure out your password.  (Most people don't use strong passwords for gaming accounts.)
---
Yes there many oh so many pvp games. But coop not so much. Co op fits Fallout really well. The niceness of the in game community reflects that.
---
And here I was chalking it up to constantly getting Parasites as well as the other diseases.
---
Not always possible...a legendary Scortchbeast,how could be possibly use a 3star minigun?(On second though,that would be DOPE!)
---
&gt; It's one of the most empty feeling MMOs I've played.
---
It's not an MMO because it's not persistent.   It's just an arena game with RNG loot.
---
Some would like to but, especially when it comes to factions, there is no centralised hub. I tend to favour Responders. Others are BOS, Enclave, Raider, etc. But you can't go to a Centralised location in game, meet up with others who are doing the same roleplay, and do events,get news or meet up and explore as a group. So you might get 4 people in a server role-playing the same,but no idea the other exist.
---
Subscribed to 1st on release day. Didn't notice any junk lost, but could easily have been some lost without notice as I was unloading my mules to my main. 
---
I Didn't receive an email or any free junk.
---
&gt; Mic up, people! 
---
I bought a cheaper boom mic on Amazon for about $40, and it's really nice.  Someone thought I was in-game audio, but in all fairness I do have the Shroooouuud voice on lock.
---
bullets
---
Bullshit. I raid regularly and I'm friends with quite a few people that do too. Nobody will ever have more than 180 vault steel saved up. Some people wanna make the power armour at once. Everyone just rolls new armour once they have it built. Without exception.
---
One major reason I was excited about private wolds was mods, unofficial patches to be specific. Then 1st came out and all my hope was lost.
---
Paid skins shouldn't give you a PvE advantage. You can argue that it's small but it's still there.
---
Yeah, 2 of my friends got that and fuck sake I hate Strangler PA had a right asshat just destroy my entire CAMP cause he wanted to PvP the cunt...
---
Idk if I should expect it or not as I bought it around a month or so ago
---
This was my expectation. But with 1st being a thing I can't see this happening, who's going to pay for 1st if you can host a game.
---
Randomly... been trying to spawn him and the vendor bot no luck.
---
https://youtu.be/XYuL9pNVABU
---
Remove vats in PvP completely.
---
Good idea. Unless the game goes on a mega sale, I'd hold off for now. 
---
There won't be any real new content until the DLC drops and you'll know within the first few days after the DLC lands if it's worth buying into at all.
---
All I want for Christmas,  right here.
---
Do you like fallout games? Kinda sounds like youre an apex guy or COD guy that got lost
---
AA Tesla, Bloodied .50, Plasma are all good.  Most of the others is Scrip
---
Or just remove the cap limit
---
Oh god, really didn't need to be spitting my coffee all over my PC this morning because here the UK that slang for a womans - ahem - "front bum" shall we say.  
---
We tend to call them "Bum Bags" here to avoid un-neccessary sniggering and confusion
---
being released a year later so that they could have actually optimized the game and remove bugs
---
nah jk fanny packs
---
All those FO1st survival tents tend to block people's camps.
---
Congratulations, Patient Zero hahaha best of luck on a resolution.
---
I didn’t get one, nor did I lose scrap.
---
Cheers to people that did, though.  All that vault steel is really nice.
---
I agree with most of this. 
---
I liked the way Vats was in survival
---
You know what they say. sometimes "The winning move is not to play"
---
Absolute dog shit 
---
\-love god howard
---
A fanny pack is like a backpack, but for your ass.
---
Now that I can get behind, especially on PC - more about skill, less about build/gear.
---
2 and 5 were good examples :-)
---
nahhh .... u need to balance things ... not to remove them ....
---
ps:  if they remove vats HW will be the best option ...so we want a balanced vats
---
That's bad man. I've had exactly the opposite experience, only 3 pvp encounters since launch.
---
You just want to grief noobs don't you? "I mean why can't I just snipe someone coming out of vault 76? Those noobs deserve to have their heads blown off first thing! GAH! This game is so broken! Can't even piss off the noobs so they rage quit!"
---
hopefuuly bethesda will hear us .... even if pvpers r a smaller comunity ... i hope they 'll make some survival servers for us  .... i really loved the leaderboard thing .... it was amazing the feeling u get once u get on the top 3 ... and i know of ppl playiong the game just for hunting leaderboarder ... so fun
---
I want fun PvP, and that doesn’t sound very fun. When they got rid of survival, I complained that move really hurt the way we liked to play (PvP). 
---
Some PvP players said, just to attack people and pester them until they attacked and you killed them.
---
I had no interest in that, and I don’t have any interest in what you suggested. I want consensual PvP, or at least PvP where players know what they’re getting into.
---
I can carry 460 pounds so it's not really a problem for me.  I usually only carry 20 on me at any one time anyway, I keep the rest in the stash.
---
I loved the leaderboard! The reason I played the game became beating my best score and having the best score I ever saw. I did that up until the last week it was around
---
I pick up a lot more stuff now, but I haven’t been to Lucky Hole in a couple weeks.  To me, that frees up at least 2 hours of weekly play that used to be devoted solely to lead collection, so the scrap box saves me roughly 100 hours of grinding a year. Now I can simply pick up every tin can while doing other things and not worry about clogging up my stash.
---
We just got enough vault steel to build 4 power armors &amp; 300 of each flux..want more do you want lol
---
I'm bloodied build, all my commando, rifleman perks are maxed, demo a lvl 3, adrenaline lvl 3, bloody mess maxed. Doing head shots I have gotten over 1,000 in damage points
---
PVPers should be "forced" (for lack of a better word, not English) to roll play as raiders.
---
Same as what we say in the UK to be fair. Fanny has a whole different meaning here.
---
Yes. I miss the glory days of 100% demo expert and grenadier
---
Vats is all good in PVE, no problem there but for PvP it’s just an aim bot, kinda makes a mockery of PvP that all you need to do is press one button and you know exactly where your opponent is and then you get 4 or 5 free shots on them. Removing vats is adding balance, the only reason people use stealth boys is to avoid being vats’d. Stealth boys are a huge expense / grind. If there is no VATs people it makes sense that stealth boy usage will drop.
---
Agree, it's unbalanced... and at the same time it's like pissing all over the players who paid full price for beta access and not subscriping to their new cash cow... 
---
But nice to know that correcting bugs and mistakes is possible for Bethesda, now if they only would be honest and confirm this only apply to FO1st and the rest can just accept to be on the lowest possible priority- if prioritized at all...
---
What if scrap didn't have any weight at all while it was in storage?
---
Wow, this getting worse. I did not buy the game and i dont regret it.
---
The stash has a scrap tab that could easily be a window in to a separate table in the database, which is likely how they implemented the scrap box, anyway.
---
I think now he is bugged. I have seen the cow several times sliding on floor, flying and completly bugged without him.
---
Bloated ghoul in a ripped santa suit with + stats as boss difficulty
---
Looks like he wants enough to Vault Steel to build 20 Power Armors
---
Some say it's bugged, but if I take the better criticals card away, the max damage goes to about 756 dmg. I tested it with the Vampire's crit .44 aswell and got similar damage of near 1000, only with better crits slotted
---
Must be lol, still gotta grind the plans in the vault..kind smart of beth😂
---
i know about players who left the game soon as survival ended
---
Never liked pvp after it had a cap on damage per bullet. I wanted a survival game combat where you could die in a single shot or at the least a very small amount of shots. Now it’s weird combination of stim spamming and hoping the other person slips up on dps .
---
Death-claus.
---
vats is good ... gotta be balanced tho ... as said before , with no vats only viable weapon would be HW .... we want a balanced game where all builds r allowed and no builds shines ott top of others .... but again .... no vats will destroy the purpose of char build ... why should i focus on a crit build if i can't use vats?
---
Or increase cap limits as a bonus effect
---
Oh haha I like this!
---
you need way more than 16 runs.
---
its a 30% chance for one plan from one set. so you start with 3x 30% chances to get one plan.
---
once you got a full set its left with 2x 30% and once you got the second set its 1x 30% chance.
---
i had the steel for 4 pieces of the strangler power armor before i had the full plans.
---
Lol, smart but was it on purpose 😂
---
I'm thinking they should give these things out to every player. When people want to open these scrap kits up, they'll realize they don't have enough space in their stash for all this shit. Some of them will probably buy Fallout 1st just to store all the valuable junk they just received. Genius idea if I do say so myself.
---
Yep. I had it couple of times recently. And "Missing ammo type" message so even reloaded weapon won't fire ...
---
I was fortunate enough that I didn’t lose any junk.
---
I did not receive any compensatory junk from Bethesda.
---
Do you have a guide on how to get 12.000 ballistic fiber? I play since BETA and didn't manage to get all that
---
Thanks! Added a few more :)
---
[](/ppchainsaw)As a proud level 300ish:  
---
6 - Legendary. level 50. Buffed. Chainsaws.  
---
Add them in with a Doom Chainsaw skin too.
---
I like killing players yes because most of then can actually do damage and can strategize if killing Bethesda outdated ai is fun even though all they do is stand there more power to ya
---
Sounds like a reward for killing the raider boss in the new raid we can vote on!
---
A system that generates logs like every other game.
---
You're full of shit
---
To play with friends only.
---
And why isn't there laser sights on laser rifles?  We ca all see that cable on the gun that looks like 1
---
Honestly? I could use the extra Carry Weight. aslong as they look cool or look super old.
---
uh ok
---
This company cannot win.
---
Headline: Bethesda employee singlehandedly lifts burning car to save an orphan child.
---
The internet: F76 is being ruined because asshole Bethesda employees were rescuing stupid orphans that no one loves instead of working on the game.
---
or.....
---
Does Bethesda give performance enhancing drugs to its employees?!?
---
Bathesda plz we nead more burrning car skins 4 power armer!!!
---
Aka a bumbag if you are from the UK.
---
The same reason you don’t use pack rat when you PvP. Vats crits perks would be used for pve builds instead. HW is only viable to people who can’t aim and it still has a ton of downsides that can be counteracted easily with ranged or automatic weapons and stagger. Taking away VATs is a great way add more balance, it’s sad that it’s relied upon so heavy in PvP but I guess to agree with OP PvP is not what it used to be and certainly not what it should be.
---
It's a shame that TES and Fallout have likely already peaked.
---
You suppose wrong on both counts
---
Come back and ask that same question once Wastelanders has come out.
---
there's no way u can win a battle if u use a rifle and ur enemy a HW if there's no vats ... caus eu'll empty ur mag before killing him ... and he kill u while u r reloading
---
What ups?
---
Got ya..ty
---
LOL probably not haha. I didnt consider my fallout 4 game started until the storyline was out of the way. then I would roam about rebuild settlements and collect companions etc.  76 is pretty much that end game, you roam about collect things and people watch. it's not about challenge or awesome story for me its just a place I go to putter about in.
---
*Music twang as we cut to slides like in New Vegas and 3*
---
Words coming from up north from the region of the Pennsylvania, a city on fire with men who turn into creatures some say are worse than the scorched. 
---
*slides of trogs and the Pitt*
---
Where every day involves a bloodbath just to make it to the next. Some say it’s worth the struggle to get what lies in that city. But me? I just watch the poor fools run to their doom.
---
End slide show and we get going to the Pitt where we see what the hellhole was like before the BOS purged it before fo3. Could be a nice location for PVP make it like the dark zone from the division with lots of high tier rewards and quests.
---
Thanks for all the advise im making my second character an absolute beast my main build lvl 160 is tough and all but i just maiy made him a carry weight machine every weight reduction perk maxed so im makkng my female character a tank
---
Totally down for a dark zone or end-game PvP region!
---
Agreed. I miss the first map. I don't understand the reason in taking it away. Just let the maps rotate.
---
🤦‍♂️
---
Lol cuz you can’t take cover while reloading, cuz you can’t use sneak to get the upper hand, because you can’t shoot them while they reload, because HW don’t take ages to start firing, because staggering an opponent using HW’s doesn’t stop them firing so they have to start the whole process again. Get a grip man there are plenty of ways to counteract someone with HW’s I know because I do it regularly and I rarely use VATs, not everyone just runs directly into a battle, you’ve got to be smart and size your opponent up, that’s what PvP is it’s about countering your opponents strengths. VATs is just a cop out so lazy people don’t have to do that.
---
Ah. I see. Well, considering how long it took them to patch the apartment glitch, it makes sense. Lol.
---
Payment processing takes time depending on who the 3rd party is that they use. It’s less expensive to have a service that takes 2 days. Same day would increase their costs which they pass on to you.
---
Wrong. They just charge you 2 days before next subscription starts. You still get for a full month.
---
I'd be all over that! It'd also be cool to fight a boss that has a personality again. Raiders were nice for that. Super mutants, ghouls, the scorched, and whatnot on the other hand... less so.
---
Noooo you don’t understand, what the OP is complaining about is that amazon is giving out JCBs to people who lost shovels and they think this is like unfair. It’s still nonsense but it’s unstable nonsense.
---
The collar has nothing to do with it just an FYI. Got it last night, do not have a collar.
---
So I place it where the stairs meet the top floor on the side floor so you have q cabinet as you're going up the stairs ,that's out of the way . Always worked for me . It also places nice on rocks .
---
Danaher DLC
---
I use the term "worked" very loosely btw I found a way to use a non working item I should say
---
Public events don’t cost caps to FT to btw

I've made a bar too. It's called The Old Roadhouse and is located along the road south of Morgantown. I've been visited by people while I've been in the CAMP. Then I usually put on the Amusement park dress and chef hat and stand behind the counter. Several times people have sat down at the bar and started trading buying a Nuka Cola or some kind of beer. Once a group of three people dressed in space suits and tin foil hat came around and bought som beers and played the banjo and steel guitar and posed for photos. I've had some fun roleplaying in my bar, but it's not that often.
---
I've been thinking of what my dream version of this game would be when mods will be available. I basically realized that not only would it need more roleplaying functions in the game, more building options for the CAMP, but also I would like to get rid of legendaries. It takes too much focus getting the perfect weapon/armor even though that is meta and not really an ingame thing.
---
OP is on PS4, night not affect the XB1 or PC
---
This, I believe, was shortly before or around the time the Purveyor was introduced. The usual bots (mostly Protectrons) had a chance to spawn as legendary, which made for easy farming if you had completed Mayor for a Day. I don't think it was ever mentioned in patch notes.
---
"everyone that doesn't agree with me is a shill"
---
Jesus you people are sad
---
prove it
---
If you want it to improve. Submit tickets for bugs
---
 https://lmgtfy.com/?q=arma+3+mods+and+how+they+work 
---
Steam and its workshop do much of the heavy lifting on this one. The other side of this is the server hosting and client-usage of these mods.
---
There really is not easy way to explain it if you are not already familiar with the steam workshop. (I also assumed that most people already knew what Arma is and what it stands for, but apparently console players are blissfully oblivious to the rest of the gaming world?)
---
Nice try, Todd, but no.
---
People do fake shit on Ebay all the time, if thats your evidence then its not very compelling.
---
I am still wondering if Bethesda is company like Vault tec and by those practics they conduct small experiments on all players what they can and what they could not take anymore...
---
Well fuck that I just wont post
---
no... I understand everything. Makes sense, too. Beth took the shortest month and applied it to every other month. The follow up was the fact there's a reason for that specific number. Because of February. Not sure how you're unable to comprehend this.
---
Lore is well written and map is really nice, lots of variety and places to explore. I don’t think you will find many people debating those points.
---
Take down the game for a few months and fix the game to the point it has no bugs and has more content
---
Shhh, don't try to correct them, or they'll go buck-fucking-wild.
---
I'm mad. 600 is probably more than all the raid every day since the day it was released.  If you never did the raid is bo problen since you probably still won't be able to. But thise who did raid now has 600 steel to craft 60 armor piece or about 4 PA. It's unfair to those of us who raid every day and give this content a reason to still exist.
---
I hate the first map
---
I'm aware, the wifes event wasn't a public one. Berkley - Bots on Parade
---
You raid every day just like me. Don't you feel robbed of your efforts and the fact that we few are the reason this content is not already dropped by the devs? I do.
---
which is an exploit
---
&gt;No, I did not put in a ticket. Because I had no reason to, as I didn't notice any obvious loss.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Yes, I purchased Fallout 1st on the day it released, and I've actively played F76 since.
---
Thanks you for answering, exactly the same situation as myself. Not yet received anything. Was wondering if a ticket was required (Apparently not) and if it was a flat "Sorry" to "Day 1 users", Jury is still out on that.
---
Yeah but after that they can immediatlly craft 60 armor piece or 4 PA. It took us 2 weeks just for the plans,2 nore weeks for the first PA....then we had 0 steel to craft ant armor.
---
I'm gonna join the raider on 1sts ahah
---
I love pvp as well and hopefully they fix it it the future but for know I’m putting my pvp gear up. My opinion on what they need to change. Raise dmg cap, take vats out or atleast tone it down a lot, implement the stealth boy feature from nw plus some other stuff I cannot think of at the moment lol.
---
That's 13 Atom payments to me for my Fallout 1st Membership then? Awesome.  
---
Be 1st, or be last.
---
Not like all those AAE RW gatling plasmas being sold you mean?
---
100%
---
I put five of each into my vendor yesterday to see what would happen if anyone would purchase. I put them down for 500 caps a piece. Within an hour they were all sold the first person who saw it bought them all. To be honest I would rather trade for faster fire rate handmade.
---
Me
---
lol no wonder they haven't fixed this bug since 1 year ago. The programmers who work at Bethesda have been brainstorming for a year why they can't fix the 250 DR while "aiming"
---
i dont see how using duping as an example makes it ok?  it still does not change the fact that the PA is supposed to be untradeable
---
both are expoits, both are bad
---
Is it tinfoil hat time already?
---
I think we in the english speaking world need to agree onna new standardised name for then, i suggest anal pouch
---
They are, I just find it funny that people seem to be very selective in what is deemed ok when it comes to exploits
---
I think drug smugglers have probably already got that one.
---
Nope, I have 1st and my camp wasn’t placed because of a camp was in my place and guess what.. it wasn’t a 1st sub. You people need to stop making shit up and coming with all these conspiracy theories
---
Won't everyone then fuck over the low levels?
---
Ah maybe, how about hernia pocket
---
Noted, thank you.
---
That definitely seems more niche.
---
Sell or scrip. TS is garbage.
---
The only qualifier was that you had fallout first before the bug was fixed, I know this because I didn’t use the scrap box until after the bug had been fixed and still got my bulk junk. 
---
But it could have happened to me had I figured out how to access the scrap box before hearing about the bug.
---
Well, some people just find it fun to fuck with others, trolls and the sort.
---
Must be bad luck for me I guess. I'll keep trying
---
Alot of people seem to forget it is still Beta and treats it like a fully inplemented part of the game.
---
Oh ok that's sucks if it is an issue as I have converted a lot of weapons lately to max damage and ammo production after the crafting buff to ultracite ammo.
---
From what? Changing stealthboys from how they are now to how they are in NW?
---
You see, some low level players won't like this
---
Playing since beta and the second ever time I've bought something from the atom store: backpack with shovel to go with my leather coat. First thing I bought was the corvega backpack to go with my BoS jumpsuit, and it looked stupid on the leather coat hence needing to change it to something more suited
---
Nope, it does not work that way. Just a coincidence
---
It’s a post-apocalyptic wasteland RPG? 
---
Is this ironic? Play a fallout game and tell me a single one that focuses on “niceness”
---
It's plausible, just not guaranteed to work
---
I bought a second hand copy for 15$ at the beginning of august and it is absolutely worth this price, as lot of new content has been added to the base game at this date. Sure there are bugs, but I do not agree with those who claim there are more in this game than in fallout 4, and this time they try to fix them, slowly yes, but it was not the case for 4.
---
If settlement building was your thing in 4, be aware there are less building possibilities (I mean walls, floors, shapes and  appearances) and the stupid clipping mechanic  is much more restrictive than in 4, but there are more cosmetics and decoratives items.
---
I would say if you find a copy for 20$ or less, it is really worth it, and you'll have the time to finish main quests before the release of wastelanders to be ready for it.
---
That's the British interpretation lol
---
Our current calendar is perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
If they lowered the prices, they would also get rid of being able to farm atoms or at the very least, throttle how much you can make. Honestly I'm surprised they haven't done this cause it would make the only feasible way to get atom shop items would be to buy them or sign up for FO1st for tge monthly stipend.
---
Try Nuclear Winter in stead it's more fun
---
i have played for the last 4 months power cycled many times nothing is in the workbench woke up this morning to check to see if anything apears in the atom store nothing atall totally dispointed have to refund
---
I paid for it around a month or so ago so I'm not sure I'll be checking though I doubt I got it
---
I wants free loot
---
Just do the heart emote to say thanks
---
When was this bug fixed?
---
Mankind is lazy and not smart. It is not bizarre, it is natural.
---
It's a bug. I believe if you server hop you can find one you can enter.
---
This is what we love, bold statements about the bad things Bethesda are doing.
---
We don't care that those bold statements are wrong, we'll upvote the people that make them and feel the burn of righteous outrage.
---
See if you can Reject the quest and then try again.
---
I very recently tested this. Bloody mess is not the cause of the immortality respawn. I have triggered it during pvp without bloody mess.
---
Strapped to its head of course.
---
I do not have the quest yet. You get it inside the building. Good idea tho!
---
No it is not. On my BE I use the prime mod (personal preference) and i don't use bloody mess because I was told that's how to fix the immortality bug. It still happens.
---
So what does fanny mean in America
---
Hope was never an option when they started asking for more a month than an Xbox Live subscription for a single game still filled with many of the same bugs it launched with.
---
Chances are Wastelanders is an unpolishable turd and they delayed it while launching Fallout 1st with 28 day month payment periods to milk what's left dry before the entire game totally collapses.
---
Took me 3 hops! I was about say this doesn't work, but that last one did!
---
Appreciated man!
---
Next time just walk around the block and it should appear
---
also have to bring in a rashguard DLC
---
Agreed they sure as hell shouldn't charge for stuff they need just to get the game in a playable state
---
It appears just fine after a couple seconds. Everything loads in, the door is there. its just inaccessible.
---
Welp, there it is, the dumbest shit I'll see all day.
---
Almost there ... in the "Issue" line it still says Officer Uniform. And I personally wear the forest underarmor but I'd guess the clipping is the same for forest and urban underarmor. And sry if I start to annoy you.
---
My guy, you have been able to skip the mainframe section for a long time now, just walk over to the boxes across the hall from the door that opens after the reactor override.
---
Drop your power armor on the other side of the stack of boxes and hop in like you are jumping through a window. Bam, you just went from the reactor to launch prep, no mainframe cores required.
---
If it's useless why do you care how much it costs?
---
Oh, wrong post
---
I've seen him near Charleston Station &amp;  Converted Munitions Factory.
---
Except trapper armor.
---
I miss the days when TSE wasnt shit.. yet we still got melee and sneak builds one shotting everything.. Bethesda btw
---
Some night maps wouldn't go a miss, it'd also help if nights were darker too.
---
Imagine not only camo gear but darker clothing helping too, it'd make for a more stealthier gaming experience
---
Lol amazing
---
I think the 25th Oct.
---
Bro you can skip that entire section of the silo by dropping your power armor on the other side of the wall of boxes after the reactor room. The silos have been incredibly easy for a very long time. You can still power armor into the ceiling after you do biometrics too.
---
I may make a return if such fanny packs are A. available in a wide range of colors that fit with any outfit, and B. can hold some snacks for the road.
---
&gt; Then they started to fail by introducing the fridge and the scrap collector as AS-exclusive
---
Yeah, but unlike fo1st you can get stuff from the AS without paying any money.
---
People paying 100$
---
This is a great game with a great community.
---
I would recommend immediate purchase.
---
Also be an idea to get it sooner rather than later so you are up to speed with the game prior to Wastelanders being released in a couple of months.
---
Literally the day before I paid -.-
---
Oh look, another great minmal effort, stupid solution for a simple problem... good job bethesda!
---
Weird
---
I say buy now IF 
---
1. you played fallout 4 ALOT and far after youve already completed the story. 76 is that end game. 
---
2. you have played fallout 4 and are ok with the amount of bugs and glitches you had to deal with in 4 76 is about the same only with internet connection issues added. being patient at times is a must.
---
Btw if you haven’t done so already, head to the hotel in the mire where boomer is and look for a note on one of the tables out front. 
---
You’re welcome.
---
I did
---
Didn't say the game focuses on niceness. The niceness of the community reflects to cooperative nature of the game.  It’s a post-apocalyptic wasteland, lest rebuild it, together.
---
I've played 890 hours of 4 and I've never finished the story. Mods are what keep it going, I'm just apprehensive about not having any mods. But thanks for the advice!
---
Just leave the sub, or go to the place for casuals..
---
The only weapon I have that effect on is on a faster fire rate, 2 shot mini gun 
---
I go through a full mag In like 5 seconds
---
This, this and this again 👍
---
Alright, thanks for the insight! I'll have a look around and see what kind of price I can get.
---
I only use my handmade when i need it with higher level enemies and pvp. Otherwise i carry a auto pipe rifle or a high level melee weapon for low level areas. Don't feel like i need to be doing max damage at all times.
---
Ever been hit with a radiated minigun by a high level legendary gunner? I have and found that pure red equals dead.
---
Make sure you buy a used copy, and dont get FO1st.
---
Other than that yeah its a fun game, mainly because of the awesome community
---
I'll put all my stims there.
---
If you wanted changes &amp; improvements you wouldn't be complaining all of the time on here. Where has that got any of you?
---
Log tickets for the bugs you find
---
Play solo when you're following questlines.  Play in groups when you're doing events.
---
somebody give this gentleman a medal
---
Algood, it happens to me as well but sometimes I manage to successfully pick up the weapon making it seem kinda 50/50 when it happens. Let's just hope your Tesla was a 1* 🙏.
---
There are community managers passing along our suggestions/complaints constantly, there are more than just bugs holding this game back.
---
Again if it’s too much for you, go to the other sub, people like it there, and it’s honestly pretty cool how everyone there is friendly with each other.
---
Because more dps.
---
That's literally the problem.
---
It's mostly a pvp or bloodied aspect. In pvp there's a damage cap so you'd rather indulge in rate of fire.     With bloodied you still deal mega damage,even without explosive.
---
I personally would choose explosive everytime,even in slower guns like the fixer.
---
No can do on the used. I've got a PC with no disc tray. 
---
What's wrong with fallout 1st? Just an overpriced sub?
---
Well, this isn't one of them. XDDD
---
Wow, we have come a long way. A few years before monetizing mods was seen as greedy be many people. Now it's perfectly ok in comparison with Fallout 76...
---
Yep, overpriced and scummy tactics imo. Oc everyone can decide for themselfs but id rather not support these disgusting schemes.
---
You don't have the plans because you don't want, so technically, yes, you still win.
---
il send it over with a bramin and a mini nuke...
---
Yeah that's totally fair. Cheers for the heads up my guy.
---
I understand that, but for 85% or more of the game, its not required.
---
Is that the same as snickering? If so, I’ll stick with my spelling, because I don’t have the hood pass.
---
But PvP is currently dead, so I'm surprised it hasn't shifted back
---
EL GANSO CON LA RINHONERA
---
I agree. just to let you know dude. i have started a reddit page for NW that i will try and keep up to date. FO76_NuclearWinter would appreciate the support and talking about things like this in the sub.
---
I don't think you should think of FFR as something that drains your weapon durability and ammo. Just think of it as something that kills stuff 25% faster. If you think of it this way I'll give an example, say you are comparing your FFR Handmade to a Non FFR Handmade on a behemoth, when you kill it, you would've used the same amount of ammo, and durability on both guns but the FFR Handmade killed the behemoth in 25% less time. So when compared to explosive the DPS compared to FFR is higher when demo expert is at least rank 3 however a lot of creatures have hidden explosive resistance such as scorchbeast. Players can also run fireproof to reduce explosive damage if you're in pvp. That's how I think of it anyway.
---
You asked why is it better - I answered.
---
The original Liberty Prime were 2 different skins for 1800 atoms. I insta regret spending them but okay, is Liberty Prime. But ONE skin, damn.
---
There are times I absolutely love the game and then there are times where I want to throw the game out of a window but it's digital so I can't..
---
I'd say get the game, but not at full price.
---
&gt;I would recommend immediate purchase.
---
Found Todd.
---
Also immersion. Gonna be 1800 atoms but I am thinking too much about to make a Communist Excavator. Ores to everyone.
---
It's good to know I'm not crazy. I've think about this too and fire rate doesn't actually increase damage, so I also dont see the use.
---
Yeah I've been looking at the game for around the $29aud mark. 
---
Thanks for the advice M8.
---
Welcome to Fallout '86.
---
Multi-colour shell tracksuits and sweat headbands would complete the look.
---
Every 1st in the wave of event will receive the compensation, whether they lost their junk or not because they won't verify.
---
Would be so great to be able to re-colorize any skin?
---
A week after it was reported? It occurred due to low asset loaded or something anyway they made so it only loaded with you needed to access the box rather then on load up. Which made things lagger but lag is better than loosing scrap.
---
True and I'm trying to work out if I'm able to get the free scrap or not
---
Or not. Just put an option like the fill team in NW. Find free CAMP spot or not.
---
I think that now that a server could have 2 people in it, they could try to shrink the map size based on the number of people in a server.
---
You hit the nail on the head. I like the game, bethasda not anymore. And people cant' seem to make that distinction.
---
I recently made a similar post. The main reply was, "Its your fault you're an idiot" so yea it sucks and ain't no change coming anytime soon
---
They gonna mess this legendary. I've spoken.
---
I already read about it a year ago. Still like the idea.
---
That happened to me one time, the door didn't load and there was a wooden board in it's place, fast travelling away then walking back worked
---
Just roll a new character and do workshop pvp. My level 30 is an absolute beast with just a standard fixer. Nobody wants to pvp harder than the lv188 that just got smoked by a lv30. If they bring friends, I switch to my primary character and continue the fight.
---
Yeah same meaning, different spelling...
---
Why do they change the small things that benefit players but not the big ass game-breaking bugs?? I still see the PA glitch from F4 , wtf Bethesda!?!
---
That happens to me a lot! But no, the door was there. It loaded in just fine, and I could click on it. But it said inaccessible and that it would be available at a later date
---
No... it “literally “is not. The service still spans a month and you get 12 charges in a year.
---
A Vault Tec Raider.
---
I think the answer is obvious. It's a  psychotic, chem addicted raider, desperately in search of his next shot while simultaneously experimenting on the Vault 76 dwellers and executing his ruthless, sinister plan.
---
Yeah dude, I can start a clothing shop with field scribe outfits, but I don’t waaaaant it 😂
---
It's literally any weapon. I like to pvp on a lv30 character with a standard fixer and I absolutely wreck people who aren't very practiced at fallout pvp mechanics. You can drop anyone in just a split second with automatic fire from any gun.
---
If u are a stealth build , Explosive is too bad :(
---
Yes, it's sniggering here in the UK. Never really been a racial element to the word and that only occurred to me when I recently found out americans say snickering and asked about it. Which also got me heavily downvoted for some reason.
---
I think this and the pvp damage cap is why FFR has been the highest valued second effect for quite a while now.
---
Definitely Vault-Tec.
---
I don't believe they're alienating their Fanbase on purpose, or that it's just for shits and giggles.
---
I do believe that the company is their priority, and that we are nothing but an experiment at this point.
---
Although, the main difference between them and Vault-Tec is that Vault-Tec actually have helped some people.
---
Bethesda have done nothing but increase their profits and divided the Fallout Fans against each other in the names of MTX, when we were already divided enough by Game, Company or Setting.
---
First you ask what we think and immediately, in the first sentence, you instruct how we shouldn't think about it ;)
---
Like everything it depends of how you use it and on which build - both affixes has their pro and cons. FFR is for sure no-brainer for auto weapons. Semi auto or non-auto will usually benefit more with explosive. FFR weapons are also more silent and can be use everywhere, without risk of killing yourself. Explosive allow you to save some ammo and allow for crowd control, but require additional perk cards to raise damage, might be dangerous in close quarters and some enemies indeed has high explosion resistance.
---
I believe Todd Howard is the CEO of Vault-Tec and Appalachia is an experiment with all the bots monitoring us.
---
If they can do it for PA users...
---
I *think* US calls a bum a fanny (correct me if I'm wrong US peeps). That was a confusing sentence.
---
So basically we kinda call it the same thing but have different slang for the arse. It's an arse bag. Although they say ass. Oh bollocks I give up.
---
wait around for 10-15 min and then go see if there's a meat pile where it died, then you can loot it, sometimes the corpse/meat pile is back where the mob originally spawned.
---
I've spent many hours searching for vanished corpses, but usually they can always be found
---
Yes. Yours is the only way to play. Agreed.
---
Whatever troll.
---
been wandering west virginia since beta. my main is level 360 ish. I have long had all weapons and armor etc I need. I still cant wait to go home and log in after work today. people complain that there's nothing to do but I run into the problem of having so much to do and experiment with I just dont have the time. 
---
my most recent project was converting my vamp heavy gunner to junkie heavy gunner. it was a success over all. the build was very playable very high damage very tanky. I then reverted my character back to my vampires build because its much lower maintainance for less damage. granted the damage for vamp is still enough to easily rule the wasteland but its not junkies damage by a long shot. the ease of play and less inventory micromanagement make the damage reduction a perfectly fine cost for me though. I main an untracite vamp laser gat so I still rip things up pretty darn good. 
---
I recently ran a water farm in order to see how viable it was as a secondary income and it is indeed viable but I feel mutation serum manufacturing is more lucrative for the time invested. 
---
I tried running a vendor with nuke launch codes on them semi successfully. it worked out pretty good. so far the best money maker has been mutation serums though. 
---
my character began as a stealth sniper then pa sniper then pa heavy gunner, then vamp laser gat, then junkie laser gat , then back to vamp ultracite laser gatling. 
---
daily activitys include chilling at monongah collecting fusion cores to fuel my laser gatling, cruising player vendors to look at their camps and vendors, jumping in on the random nuke, helping randos out, jumping in on occasional public events, I sat and watched a guy build a bridge for an hour. I even helped him with supplies halfway through lol. it was a really cool camp by the time he finished. I accomplished nothing but got to watch a fellow player make something cool and did not feel my time was wasted. 
---
I built a working bathhaus with anti rad shower, toilet, and toilet paper plunger display. that thing gets lots of compliments. everyone seems to like my bathroom. 
---
oh my wife started playing and I have been running with her alot. she is pretty darn good already at nuke launching queen killing and she excells at finding teddy bears for her adoptabear agency.
---
I thought I'd seen this before :)
---
just did testing, my non ffr handmade can one shot ghouls &amp; super mutants of all types. The ffr can't as you can't just fire one bullet. It's impossible.
---
But tankier enemies, ffr is beneficial.
---
Explosive can be dangerous, especially indoors.
---
They still charge you 2 days early.
---
Pro: fun game, big world to explore, free expansions to core game, interesting lore. 
---
Cons: people who never played the game telling you how it is a “broken unfinished mess” because of some YouTube video they saw 12 months ago by another person who never played the game.
---
But a bum in the US is a tramp yes? Why can't they just speak English!
---
Only in a Solar Calendar.
---
 If they use a lunar one, then there is 13 months a year.
---
And considering the state of things lately, Bethesda being a bunch of Moon Worshipping Lunatics kinda makes sense.
---
For that price you would be crazy not to pick it up.
---
Buying used doesn’t help pay developers to continue to support game. I understand you are angry with the take but this is counter productive. If they stop getting revenue, game stops being supported, which hurts users.
---
A bum is a tramp, yes.
---
I wonder what a 'tramp' is in the US...
---
It turned into an ash pile and there wasn't anything in it.
---
So? Most subscriptions do that. What’s the problem? They won’t charge you again for a month from that date.
---
So what?
---
Group of camping tents at the eastern edge of the Ash heap, north of big bend tunnel entrance. In the Ash heap again, Murgle's house. The most "famous" one, the gas station north of gorge junkyard . The house south of Nuka cola plant. A cabin in the hills east of the behemoth, a Nukashine stop. The visitors center sw of West Tech.
---
Doing the lord's work again my friend.
---
Also shout out to source control, @Bethesda
---
Very cool.
---
We got the drugs all we need now is a pimp outfit and 'walking with limp emote' 😂
---
Thank you:)
---
Missing the point much?
---
Both have MTX, so they're comparing the 2, like a Bruised Apple and a Rotten one.
---
If CC stuff was free, that's like comparing Apples and Oranges.
---
And that is your problem they do make good games like the elder scrolls and fo3
---
Forgive my ignorance but aren't they all automated now so it'd take a fraction of a second to process thousands of transactions at once? Why would processing time even be a factor?
---
The whole thing is Bethesda fighting a fire they created themselves. They've proven time and again that the game lacks both the tools and capabilities to track items and rectify issues when things go wrong. 
---
On the basis that this email went to EVERY Fallout 1st subscriber who built a scrapbox on day 1, it shows that they have absolutely no idea who lost scrap and who didn't.
---
GT is high0utput, the 0 is a zero. Let me know, thx
---
Yeah well some people still try to bother you untill you fire back. Other are such ammo waster they'd rather waste 15 ammo in a second instead of a well placed headshot.
---
Fire rate can be really good with some heavy guns like gatling gun or laser gatling.
---
It's the wasteland what ya expect? Put a bounty tells Merc group about a greifer giving you a hard time lol y'all complained about no role playing now you don't want it?
---
🙋‍♂️

Mhhm so when we lose our shit because bethesda its FUCK YOU BETHESDA LOST MY JUNK ALL MY PREVIOUS VAULT STEEL FUCK YOU WITH YOUR STUPID FIRST I PAYED TO LOSE MY JUNK

A woman who puts it about a bit I think..

AsazyCat 
---
I also have a friend who can help.
---
Ffr is just better dps, queen is immune to explosion msg and everything else in the game u can 1 shot or maybe for a scorchbeast  for example explosive maybe but I still prefer ffr since it's burstier. Plus explosive can damage you and kill you (as low hp build), even with fire proof and dense torso.
---
That's okay. Welcome. And you're not late. It was datamined so we know it's coming at some point in the near future :)
---
Do you have acid to smelt it with?
---
Oh you don't have to worry about that; it will never be.
---
Incorrect. Banks are super inefficient. Just look at when you buy something at a store with your credit card, most times it takes a day or two to show up on your account. Payment processing is one of those industries that is in the middle of a transformation. There are now starting to be new companies entering the market as intermediaries to START to offer faster processing but also alternative modes that could take longer to process at reduced fees.
---
probably right lol.
---
They know, and they addressed it in the inside the vault article from yesterday. It will be fixed in a future patch.
---
Yes.  I want games that work
---
Yeah this is exactly why I want to try it for myself.
---
Remember that one guy who got banned for crafting tons of ultracite ammo? Now Bethesda is handing out hundreds of flux for people to craft thousands of ultracite ammo like it's going out of style. LMAO.
---
i would love to a dark map. nighttime would be so immersive and cool. the harper’s ferry map is going to be awesome and a lot darker anyway. Flat woods at night on rotation would be good.
---
That might have been with Adrenaline + Psychotats...
---
3 Stars Mutant Hound with a Two shot missile Laucher? You got it!
---
Good cause I have no idea wtf to do with the green house section
---
Guessing you never played Nuclear Winter if you think not having VATs is a bad thing. Removing VATs for PVP would make the game a million times better.
---
A lot of what people complain about are not bugs. An $18 dollar power armor paint is something a lot of people complain about but why would anyone report that as a ticket?
---
Also how do you know the people who complain on here arent doing that for the things that make sense? Id bet you most of them are.
---
I would equate them more to the institute.
---
they have an over all vision they are going for.
---
they have some questionable tactics in getting there. 
---
they have a pressing issue of needing a  resource (ie power for the institute money for beth) 
---
whether or not they are the faction you stick with ultimately lies with the player.
---
I can do that part.
---
Beautiful whatd you need me to do? Can we do it with three??
---
I purchased at my local Redbox for a measly 9.99, I would suggest checking that out before you buy anywhere else👍
---
day two silo bug remains my faith has wavered.
---
That doesn't work for private worlds. To join you must know the owner.
---
You know just cause we were colonised by you and have your queen as the head of state doesn't mean we r not our own country and correspondingly have our own coloquialisms. So as we saying in the great southern land bite me you pom. Lol
---
No, we need 4 and I need kill anything and collect key cards
---
Okay I have one guy that can help. Competent and lvl 472
---
Are you on Xbox or Playstation because I'd love to check it out (I'm on Xbox)
---
That'll do
---
Throwing a tantrum because someone else got something nice as compensation for a mistake is jealousy-fueled greed. That’s not understandable. This has no real impact on OP. This isn’t about someone getting a JCB. It’s about OP being pissed he doesn’t have one and trying to make sure no one else can get one until he does.
---
ah I assumed if they could bridge to you on public they could bridge to you on private as well. thank you for clairifying sir o7.
---
Look out the yank is off on 1 !!!
---
As a stealthy full health non auto rifle build i prefer explosive or +10% damage while aiming.
---
I have 4 different rifles that can hit for 2k up to 4k damage.
---
I one shot everything in the game except for the big guys like squatches and SB.
---
I'm fanning my fanny as I type. Feels good man.
---
When are you available and do you work with mics
---
It is 100% possible but would make it so everyone gets same legendary weapon though which I see as a good thing.
---
Thanks for answering my question.
---
Sorry bruce
---
If I'm not mistaken, another post similar to this, Beth responded and said they were looking into rotation on NW.
---
Image the game without duping. So many people would suck ass at PVP due to the rarity of OP weapons and armor. 
---
The Purveyor has changed that a bit as I've gotten some god armor and weapons from her. It only took 10 million scrip but hey.
---
I only use SB because of vats and strangler heart
---
Really bad excuse
---
No actually g'day mate is often used. Country folk are often less concerned about ennunciation than those in the city. I will say this I have never heard the phrase throw another shrimp on the barbie anywhere but tv. We eat prawns not shrimp
---
I think the dmg caps in Survival were what really started driving the FFR weapons. Since anyone who can afford the meta PvP weapons, is probably also going to have fireproof/dense, explosive weapons are useless against them.
---
The FFR also gives a boost in dmg vs the SBQ, which the explosive doesn't due to her resistance.
---
\*mic drop\*
---
Are you pvp or pve?
---
You don't have to put in a ticket, just have been a fo1st member before the glitch was fixed then you get all this scrap:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dzvnhp/did_any_fallout_1st_player_who_did_not_lose_junk/
---
Sounds like you've had a great time in the game. I'm keen to check it out. 
---
I've got a question though. Is power armour required if you want to be competitive/useful in the end game?
---
I think there is a positive community about fallout 76, made for people with intentions like yours. I don't remember which subreddit but hopefully someone is gonna help you with a link.
---
They are giving these items to every one who was a member of fo1st when the bug existed, no need to have sent in a ticket or anything:
---
Technically you can do chores in game for the currency :P
---
I'll second that.
---
These 4 man premades consisting of lvl 200+ is getting tiresome, lets test our skills 1on1
---
Is it still the slight jump drains all your ap and occasionally it throws you waaaay high up broken?
---
Would be nice
---
FO76Filthycasuals
---
You absolutely can trade the Strangler heart PA you just put it on a chassis and then set the chassis down, not place it. People have been trading the PA for multiple legacy weapons each.
---
Never said that lol nor did I think expanding the budget is a fully good idea as the edits show, I'd prefer reduction in some of the items and wouldn't mind paying to expand my budget under certain circumstances as in they aren't like 20$ for an expansion.
---
There is a Mr. Fuzzy costume, it just looks like shit, because Bethesda decided it would be the only reward tampered by the raiders.
---
Or better yet, how about removing the cap limit?
---
Keep looking, and consider second hand copy's - I saw a perfectly fine hard copy in my town for £4
---
That’s how it was for me. You can remove scrap but you can’t put anything back in. I don’t know if I’ll continue the subscription or not. That scrap box sure was handy.
---
Yep. Camps should have priority - if there's a tent in the way it should be despawned and the owner notified. I have a tent btw, and I wouldn't mind this. Setting up a tent costs me nothing.
---
This. If you want to ignore all the problems to the game, this is where you go. They actually have a rule against negative comments there.
---
dont shoot the messenger.. I dont make the rules..
---
I just lol when dimwits get their posts deleted...
---
&gt; I meant to not yo 
---
But absolutely meant "beast".
---
1. No
---
2. I believe so, yes.
---
I bought it on Nov 2nd so...? Was that during the glitch?
---
I was pretty excited for the Wastelanders DLC but now...
---
Bethesda gettin mean out here
---
Congrats!  The only thing worse than having a job is looking for one.
---
Thanks for the reply - Can you advise what platform you're on?
---
Except its clearly not...
---
The time frame is 5 minutes. My camp is next to a train station so I just place the item in a suitcase, log off, log back in with my alt, and retrieve the item.
---
Workshops are a different issue. When the alt logs on, you won’t own the workshops the primary took over. All the things built by the primary will be there, but the alt will have to retake the workshop. At least that’s how it was for me.
---
I am completely destroyed by most encounters
---
Skins are not mods. Same thing happens with crossbow. There is only one mod: prime receiver. 
---
Are you going to trust the wiki or the 2845857388273 shotguns most of us have scrapped?
---
They told us private servers would be a separate service back in August 2018. Being upset up that today is a little late. 
---
And that isn’t exactly what they said about stash if we want to be clear. They would test and expand stash in future dependent on server stability (remember they already doubled stash size for normal players). I agree scrap box should not be behind a paywall. Honestly I don’t think it should exist at all, but that is a topic for another day.
---
If this is the most disgusting level you have personally experienced, you must be pretty new to gaming. These are pretty tame compared to what other developers are doing these days. Having to pay extra for certain game modes (private worlds isn’t really a different game mode in how I am using this term), characters, etc is way worse than what we see here. For your specific collectron example, I bought with atoms I saved in game pretty easily. 500 atoms is pretty cheap. You can that amount in a week or two easily in game. Not many publishers have their premium currency as easy to earn.
---
3. Can you advise what platform you're on?
---
Off the top of my head, I can't remember ever submitting a support ticket to Bethesda.
---
No other reason comes to mind, except that I did buy a subscription.  I was active during the time of the glitch, although I did not experience the glitch.
---
Ah! “Diseased.” That was a totally missed opportunity. :)
---
The armor sells for multiple legacy weapons each, and with 600 steel they can make nearly 10 sets of the PA. So basically bethesda just handed them 20+ legacy weapons.
---
Also, it isn't just people who lost stuff getting this scrap bundle, it is every fo1st member who had membership during the bugs existence, regardless of if they submitted a ticket or even lost anything:
---
Yeah, havent been able to smelt for a while now
---
It isn't just those that lost stuff getting this scrap though, it is every early adopter of fo1st who had membership during this bug:
---
And what's crazy is he's gonna go tell all his friends that it's true.
---
They could at least meet the prices halfway. 
---
Side note opinion: I think they should port all items from creation club to 76, even if lore breaking. Might as well at this point.
---
Nobody had 600 vault steel, and you could count on one hand the people who had 300 of each flux. People who didn't lose anything got it. I raided for a month and a half for my vault suit, and these fucks get it for free.
---
No clue, don't do the raids as I was concerned about them eating your entire character. I believe so, yes. It is why they go for multiple legacy weapons each.
---
Your clip is great! Thanks for visiting! Haha
---
I convinced my teammate to try out 1 month. She could use that month to stockpile a ton of scrap &amp; even if she doesn't renew she'll have a pretty good store of stuff built up.
---
I think I’d shut it off by then haha. Next time!
---
Id say tesla then plasma everything else os script
---
And personally id sell the plasma cause I'm not a fan
---
I'll settle for Offline mode... and a fanny pack.
---
You have to find the plan, I usually find the robot arm and leg plans in watoga
---
Thats very false
---
It's little bugs like this that can be ok, in my opinion.
---
It's nothing game-breaking, and it's rare enough that it doesn't become an annoyance.
---
They are more rare than other plans, but obtainable in the wild. You should thankful you don't have to craft raider armor pieces ;)
---
[Yeah, I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/dm01tn/comment/f4wex32).  But, thanks for pushing the false narrative that all First subscribers got free junk for nothing.
---
PVP community, sorry about this.
---
I’m glad that there is no point to PVP anymore. I never wanted it in the first place. PVE, co-op Fallout 4 was the original desire from the fan base, as far as a potential multiplayer fallout would go.
---
*looks to the right of the subreddit
---
If the perk isn't related to combat effectiveness get rid of it. Thats my advice for building characters
---
Think of the children!  Sure they can blow heads, arms and legs off, but don't let them see undies!!!
---
“login” +50% damage for logging in
---
Bethesda is aware of the issue, still no fix though. 100 % sure method to avoid this issue is to not be in NW during the change. And don't logout from during maintenance.
---
The tesla range nerf from NW needs to go to adventure when shooting players. Tesla also needs to break stealth on the user.
---
you still win because you’re given ~2 months of steel if you are doing the raids constantly
---
New colors at no extra cost would be nice.
---
Omg the “this game isn’t so bad” posts are officially as annoying as “this game sucks” posts. Just go play outer worlds.
---
Known bug, you can't do anything about it, you just lost the ability to get points for those challenges, better luck next week (last part is more or less information you'll get from support ;)
---
Well you’ve won me
---
I didn't say all, I specified those who had membership during the time this glitch existed. Way to try to twist what I said to fit your narrative.
---
What source is this info from
---
You have to do the side quest in charleston where you investigate the Garahan Mining HQ.
---
It gives you an executive ID card which lets you open those pods.
---
this makes 0 sense
---
I had something similar happen in west tech the other night.  Super mutant stood off to the side from the ones pouring through the door stuck in the animation with his hands in the air.  Never attacked me just stood there blinking, hands held high. Must be getting soft in my high levels cause I let him live. 🤷‍♂️
---
lol x lol = lol²
---
Well I submitted four tickets and got my atoms back in all four of them. In the last (weekly+daily) ticket I had to be more persistent, but still managed to get the atoms back.
---
So you're lucky, I've send a ticket and apart from generic answer, nothing have been done and ticket closed.
---
🙏🏼
---
Can't do hard copy. I don't want to sacrifice a sata slot for a disc drive.
---
Hum... there's a trading section there... good... But there's nothing focused on Vault Raid, I think. But I will try after-work. Thanks!
---
Had this problem too friend. You can find the plans at Harper's Ferry. If you start down by the train. At the beginning of the street that has the armory, there is a building with a hole in the side. A lot of display cases inside. The plans will spawn in that building. May take a few server hops, but that's where I picked it up when I was grinding that badge. Spawned on the bottom floor display after about 4 server hops. Robo legs. Good luck!
---
some people did from what i’m seeing
---
Lfg. It's not raid specific but if you're looking for a group to play with, that's where you go
---
I bought Fallout 1st before the servers even came back up on launch day. The first thing I did was log on my scrap alt and throw everything into the scrap box. Freed up several hundred lbs of space. Didn't think about losing anything and kept putting some scrap on the character, along with some scrip legendary stuff. Fast forward to yesterday and I start to wonder how much I had a month ago vs now, as my steel reserves on that character were vastly depleted.
---
I did not submit a ticket previously as I didn't think I was affected. Now that I believe I may have been, I submitted one last night, along with proof of purchase.
---
It annoys you that you’re not allowed to be an asshole to other people who bought the game? Stop fucking crying.
---
If you ask me, the best way to level up is to take and defend workshops. Start with the ones in the forest, then savage divide, then just go from there
---
Oh s***. I didn't even notice that was me! Hahaha
---
Yeah I'm sorry. It's early in the morning and I'm just not feeling it today. I came to edit in hopes that you hadn't responded and I was too late. My message was way more hostile than it needed to be, I apologise.
---
Where is this from?
---
Filthy Casuals!!! Stay filthy!
---
You need the Hornwright id card which I think you can get at the Headquarters in Charleston or at the Hornwright estate.
---
I knew the Responders would help
---
I think an RNG roll is always going to be the grind over the guaranteed reward. I've only done a standard raid 3 times. No plans any time I've done it. It's one of the reasons I stopped doing them
---
Wait, power armor can use ultracite fusion cores? I thought it couldn't?
---
I have the same issue :( I got disconnected whilst in there then spawned into another server and it spawned me outside and I haven’t been able to get back in and finish it.
---
But I want Preston 😱
---
I don't care if he isn't even born yet
---
/s
---
Weren't the liberators only designed by the Chinese but released by the enclave? I always assumed that was why they didn't actually speak Chinese.
---
And more of this!
---
I am not talking about importing specific companions from fallout 4. I am talking about the companion system of fallout 4. It's buggy and it would break the game if it was put like that without fixing.
---
I thought it was the perk but someone pointed out that its any gun that has multiple hits in a short period, like any auto rifle and the shotgun falls in that category too with the buck shot but, I only really notice it on the shotgun.  I'll have to experiment this weekend
---
They'll add moustaches to all of them, so it won't be copy / paste
---
A lot of the end game happens in highly radiated areas, where your typical options are either a hazmat suit with 0 armor, a power armor, or perhaps sacrificing your whole build into just surviving the radiation. When I last played, power armor was also much cheaper to maintain than high level body armor, even fully specced. I'm not a fan of using power armor in Fallout games, never use one in F4, and ended up using one in 76 basically all the time because the game is pretty obviously intended to be played using a power armor.
---
Yea as much as I would LOVE this I could see how it could be a problem. People are forced to spend when they get close to the limit, if there’s no limit people might horde off caps to no end. Or people might start charging 50k for a weapon or something!
---
Don't say that.  It's still early.  Keep your hopes up.
---
It should only be cosmetic
---
Good to see I'm not alone &amp; at least it's a known glitch. Hopefully it gets fixed. As I said I just make sure to never be in NW when the challenges reset &amp; always go to Adventure mode first.
---
So a handful of people who lost everything are going to sell power armor that they still have to grind for to some people who will give them legacy weapons. How does that affect me or you?
---
do you have any sets learned? because that affects the drop rate as a whole, its also not "rng" otherwise you would get dupe plans.
---
that said out of 18 people, we have had everyone get full plans by the 140 steel mark
---
Could have at least formatted it right 
---
r/FO76Filthycasuals
---
Yea technically it is my fault but I should be able to have multiple items in my vendor that don’t all add up to the limit. But if someone like that guy shows up and wants to spend every cal he has there is no stopping him. I guess I should of made everything more expensive:p
---
Yes.  Search for "let's go whaling" on Youtube.
---
I always try to pay it forward of sorts. I wanted a piece of armor for 3000 caps from a vendor and asked if you he would entertain a trade instead of sale. He grabbed the armor from his machine and gave it to me for 1000. Such a nice gesture, I gifted him almost 20 cores at 75%.
---
-Fun?  How is it fun shooting at someone that didn't shoot back? 90% of people you run into have no interest in PvP.
---
-Caps? There's faster and more efficient ways to get caps, if that's what you're looking for.
---
-Junk? Same as caps.
---
How the game advertised? The game didn't advertise PvP, except to say it existed. There were literally zero incentives to PvP and there still aren't any.
---
I know (3) others that also got an email notification, but over 18 that didn't (other fallout 1st members who got it to try it out)..   
---
will be interesting to see exactly how many got this notification..
---
:)
---
Very very annoying! Server hopping did end up working, but it took a few tries
---
It isn't just people who lost things, it is literally every fo1st member who had membership during the time of this glitch is getting this bundle of scrap.
---
Still trying to find that armor record, but they share the same *.Nif.   
---
I'll track it down :)
---
Oof! Damn, you feel the pain then huh!?
---
I'd applaud that, honestly, but I doubt it will happen
---
That sounds awful
---
I won't admit how hard I laughed at this.
---
I was thinking adding in more legendary effects would be cool.
---
I think "Silenced" would be good, same effect as a suppressor but for heavy weapons/laser weapons. I don't think that would be particularly OP. 
---
"Integrated", 5% extra damage only in VATS but at an increased AP or weapon degredation cost.
---
The fanny pack might get Ms. Nanny back... to your camp if you’re not careful.
---
I doubt companions will be able to pick up anything
---
In that case, I dont know, sorry. I pre ordered the tricentennial edition and i vaguely remember having similar problems but I dont remember what I did. I guess the only thing you can do is ask Bethesda Support. Also, make sure you avoid power cycling your console multiple times in succession because it could break your xbox, I just wanna make sure you know that in case you try power cycling again
---
Alright. I appreciate this information.  However, the only thing I see coming out of this is a massive drop in the price of Strangler Heart PA.
---
I would say "Famine" instead of "Anorexic".
---
Already got it for cheaper two weeks after launch. $12 on eBay.
---
Odds are better in watoga. Harpers ferry will be more marine plans than anything.
---
Time is money. Grinding for hours with only the purpose of getting in-game currency or loot isn't that different from paying for it. I guarantee you if they take it out of the shop, it'll end up taking more time grinding for it than it would working a minimum wage job until you can buy it
---
I guess they made sure the billing happened early. 😋
---
Given that the service started on the 23rd, I wouldn't expect the Atoms to appear before then.
---
yeah that would be cool. instead I'm over here picking up legendary boards when the guy has a gat in my face.
---
Did the new subscription start? I think earliest date can be Oct 23
---
Less "events" and "sales" and more actual game content would be a good start.
---
Don't do raids...will never do raids....will never have plans.....will never need the steel I have....wish I could give it to you so you would feel better...Really, I would gladly hand it right to you because it is not going to anything for me
---
Mine is fixed now...not sue why.....
---
Most of the accounts on FO76 are the account name by design. It absolutely is a security problem.
---
And, I realize everytime I see it, all the soldiers of the Brotherhood of Steel are still in chassis. Damn, you kinda get used to the bugs and bad done stuff.
---
Nice.
---
microsoft issued me a refund so its all good now im not going to pay for somthing i dont get its clearly bugged and needs to be fixed by them good luck to the other 2 dudes getting your items if it doesnt work just go on the microsoft website- recent transactions from there u can issue a refund i got mine under 24hr
---
Oh shit does it auto bill?
---
Cheers!
---
FFR does mean more damage, from a DPS standpoint. Explosive is a 20% bonus, FFR is a 25% bonus, so FFR is just better. Then you factor in explosive resistance, close quarter combat, etc and it just gets better.
---
As for demo expert, that only buffs the explosive part of the damage, not all of the damage. So even on the higher damage guns, you're still only talking about maybe an extra 20 points of damage with demo expert maxed out.
---
So companions are 1sts. Interesting.
---
Doesn't change the fact it is a shitty overreaction. As someone already did the math and to get 600 vault steel you'd have to grind every day since the raid came out on all 3 difficulties to even get close to that much. 
---
So the problem is they are way over compensating while they did nothing to all the people who lost their entire characters to the raid bug.
---
So it seems really really suspicious when they won't do shit for people who lost their gear in the raid but for those who pay for the membership they give out extra shit to literally everyone who paid, regardless of if they lost anything or not.
---
Sorry to break it to you, but that's literally what the business world is about. Making marginal decisions to maximize their wealth. That includes stupid shit like fallout 1st, and innocent things like an edgy advertisement. Everything in between that and more. Game design became a business more than a passion project a long time ago. The people who make decisions on what the game will have and the people who actually make the game have not been the same for AAA companies for years now
---
Thousands of posts and direct emails from their customer support. You really havent been paying attention
---
From what people are saying in the link some are getting the stuff without even getting the email.
---
Hope I don’t get it. I smelted fine last night. I’ve got a lot of ammo to make.
---
Not from what I have seen.
---
Why would you have the backpack and want to hide it? That's just stupid.  
---
I love my Corvega backpack, although I would love to see a Fallout 1st skin on it though.
---
&gt;you'll join the same world, so you could transfer stuff this way from char to char via any standard world container.
---
You can, but I certainly wouldn't rely on it for anything important.
---
You can build on the train trestles (bridges) east of Harper's Ferry, and the only mob spawns are on the ground, far beneath you.
---
Great video and an awesome camp!
---
i prefer explosive because it's cool. nah
---
The community bought more of it than they expected, why would they need to make a comment addressing anything else?
---
which really sucks cause alt has very nice chest piece with 20% weapon weight reduction (he uses rifles) would help alot.
---
What he said: because DPS, and as far as ammo goes, once you figure out how to farm the components to make ammo, wasting it is a non-issue.
---
A hide helmet option for power armor would be great also
---
Right. I was trying to stay in the same vein (no pun intended) as “junkie’s,” which might be insensitive to people with a substance abuse problem. The game designers are pretty unapologetic about stuff like this. They have a dark sense of humor and I appreciate that. :)
---
XD
---
Haven't received any extra scrap in my Scrap Box, then again I haven't noticed any issues with it personally.
---
Because that’s what a good company would do
---
PvP. Pve the difference is minimal. With pvp cap FFR is superior because you won’t get a lot of the damage from the explosive rounds because it will surpass the cap.
---
Beast xp for beast mode!
---
Ammo is also so abundant, it's really a non issue
---
And if you choose not to play, you don't get to whine.
---
Day 1er here. Power armor is not needed for anything, but nuke zones. Even then there’s ways around that.
---
I still somewhat actively play, but was just trying to make a joke. sorry
---
and the garbage fire just keeps burning, i'm amazed there there is new fuel for it every week :)
---
Hornwright ID, Garahan are the "nice" people who developed the ExPA, Hornwight the cheating scumbags that use Autominers.
---
I once got a 1 Star Hunter’s Sledgehammer from a legendary bloatfly. Imagine the bloatfly wielding that.
---
Chally week, gather corn carrots razorgrain and tatos or whatevers in Challys feed, and feed chally.
---
Perhaps you haven't yet dealt it.
---
haha good story, but I would still like some of the roughness smoothed out!
---
I've been playing buggy half finished Bethesda games for years and enjoyed it the whole while BUT it doesn't imply I can't complain for it. 
---
FFS, have some ethic. Don't be a puppet.
---
Yeah then I fight these people with my strangler PA and they call me a trash cheater for using that armor and to fight them like a man? Like I’m in PA, non invisible, not spamming quantum’s and not using a gun where I don’t even need to aim and you’re calling me trash because I can cause your game to lag?
---
I’ve played the game, it’s definitely still broken in many ways
---
These rageposts just get dumber and dumber don’t they
---
I know the pain, I finally found one with rolls good enough to replace the marine armor I've had forever the other week for a reasonable price and realized I had just spent 2000 caps on 24 scrip when I put it on and it clipped right through my outfit and hid the backpack I had just dropped 500 Atoms on.
---
Not really, they accept that the game isn't perfect. They just don't want to hear endless moaning about it.
---
Thanks! Been away since August.
---
I think the fridge was added, but it's paid content? And I see the player tents (2ndary fast travel) and scrap box community recommendations have been slapped behind a paywall too.
---
That aside, have they done anything to increase camp budget/building? Display cases seem nice, but I can't see working without a budget increase unless they take 0 budget.
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
I thought you were going to say a brothel.  But fanny packs are cool!  😂😂
---
There should be something that gives you 10% bonus damage each minute you're playing 76.
---
It wouldn't be OP since the game is boring AF nowadays and no one has hope for it to get any better.
---
I always prefer ffr at this point. Explosive looks great on certain weapons but unless you are bloodied, the damage increase is negligible, even with demo expert. I find that explosive also makes the weapons break way faster than it does with ffr.
---
They don’t like to hear criticism
---
Wasn't this only given to those that actually lost stuff and reported losing items via scrap box?  People make it seem all FO 1st people got this steel.  I sure didn't.
---
You can get something out of the Tesla and .50. Tesla you should get maybe 20-25k .50 cal probably 10-15k.
---
I was not referring to you, apologies if that's how it came across.
---
if they got rid of all the magic powers (mutations, legendaries, etc) pvp might be  actual pvp and not meta gear (a weapon to surpass them all!)
---
I fully agree and think the best us players can do is suggest things that will make our lives better while being a marketing vector for Bethesda management, and yours is perfect.
---
But frankly, the community is quite judging things by their own interest, but instead, by how petted on the back they feel.
---
Updated :)
---
Very clever!
---
I don't think we'll ever have to worry about this possibility. 😋
---
Things that break the game functionally are awful.  But some of the goofy stuff that shows up every now and then like the headless Ghouls sliding around to attack you, or the Super Mutant who is just chilling on a crate and forgot to get involved in the fight, that's pretty endearing.
---
Can anyone confirm if the tent can be placed close to your CAMP now?
---
You mean the playerbase is mostly pve players.
---
Reddit is and will always be a minority
---
Not really forced.
---
Everyone I know mules caps. Max characters, all at max caps... It is a stupid system, but one they themselves created.
---
Diseased is the first thing I thought of.  Armors and Weapons, made like Junkie’s
---
No it’s not. It’s true. 2% damage is still more damage.
---
It's weird that these youngins are wearing them across their chest like a bandolier tho. Wear them on your hips like you're supposed to! Get off my lawn!
---
I do that all the time when I'm on my phone and Redditing!
---
Thanks!! &lt;3
---
Whatever you find for armor and a gun/melee weapon you're perked for.
---
Just a big 2 hander works well early on
---
Might be the minority but Bethesda community team members reside here not in big Facebook groups(to my knowledge)
---
The best weapon for leveling is actually armor, and it's called level 15 Raider Power Armor Chest with Tesla Coils.
---
Allows you to masstag opponents simply by getting nearby. Instead of exping alone, leech on high level players by teleporting after them and standing near bottlenecks. Let them kill the monsters and get the free exp.
---
You can make level 50 this way in few days mostly leaving your character AFK on events
---
 In my other comment I said I've only done a standard 3 times and have learned 0 plans those 3 times. And obviously no. I don't know the mechanics of the raid, because it's poorly explained every time I try to look stuff up. Meltdown and Washout can fuck right off and me and one other person can duo Dead in The Water on standard so at best I get 1 run a day but after those 3 days of doing it and not getting any plans I said "naaaaah"
---
I'd approach this from a different angle - the explosive effect on any gun makes it far more likely to trigger the obnoxious damage rubber banding if a server is lagging.
---
I carry a number of Bloodied Pistols on me, one of which is a Bloodied Explosive.  In practice, I almost never use that one because it feels completely unpredictable whether or not I'll kill an enemy in one shot, or if I'll get into the situation of halving their health with every shot instead.
---
they bill 2 days before the end of the cycle
---
So?
---
They shut down survival because no one played it not because of internet opinions. 
---
The game mode sucked and was rarely used and this thread is evidence of it. 
---
We just got weekly weapons and never played it again
---
Yes.
---
And if they billed before the 23rd, that kind of sucks.
---
It sucked because pve players bitched that they kept getting clapped
---
I’m saving my perks for a higher level so i can immediately have my build.
---
But now they fixed that problem, no more nexus, get your credit cards out.
---
That sounds sweet!
---
Bloatfly syringer will either attack unseen enemy and kill, or start aggro. Once found, either they can kill if low enough level or throw a few moltovs at the location of their fighting. Usually the easiest but once all others are killed you should have a very clear marker notification where the final enemy is and yes if you throw the grenades or especially moltovs or flamer in that area you will kill it. Might take a few but it absolutely  WILL work.
---
Get yourself a lever action, one of the most ammo efficient weapon in the game. Don’t worry about armor,  just use whatever you can loot from enemies you kill. i ran around nearly naked when i level up my mules to 50 lol 😂
---
It’s going to be too late no one will be playing. I’m on Xbox and when I play I literally see the same 25 people almost every match, most of theM really high levels 150+ and 250+. Their the only people that really keep the mode populated. I’m only working to lvl 100 and then I’m done, unless that have more unlocks after that I am not longer playing. I mean what’s the point so I can just keep fighting the same people who grind at this all day for no reason like it’s a marathon race?
---
idk if i agree with this statement.  with the inspiring words of president Ron Perelman to the hectoring admonishments of the Overseer, we're s'posed to work together to rebuild appalachia -- rebuild america.
---
knock-down, drag out, fist fight in the parking lot was not a major theme in the [advertisement](https://youtu.be/N-Xs1tm-9-U?t=15).  besides, pvp will always be 'broken' in a game like this (either b/c of the clunky movement, unbalanced weapons/armor, and straight up bugs)
---
It would be nice of them to offer us half price at murmrgh’s as a thank you gift 🎁
---
That's not what I said, but if that's what you took from my post, I can't help you.
---
That sucks. I was gonna do the year. There goes $5 down the drain.
---
Ahhh, thanks!
---
The only way they can push the creation club in those games is if somehow they outlaw nexus.
---
That doesn't work.
---
You have to spend the points to unlock higher level ones.
---
Np and good luck!
---
I didn't even receive the scrap and I'm currently subscribed for November :shrug:
---
My bad, Hornwright Industrial HQ. I always get those two confused.
---
How much money u think they are going to charge for that oh wait it's also exclusive to fallout 1st lol
---
The negativity is here for a reason. Same with the positivity. Both sides must tolerate each other if you want to speak freely about this game. You can’t pick and choose. This isn’t a new concept.
---
I didn't, at least not as of last evening. I didn't get any emails either...I don't *think* I lost anything to the glitch either, so, fair cop. Can't really be sure tho, in the days following the start of the sub I was in my own little private world gleefully picking up and scrapping literally everything that wasn't nailed down to satisfy a year of repressed hoarder tendencies, sooooo...if it did eat any of my scrap, I was dumping too much in there to notice it
---
dont know how this is not pinned or is not at the top fully golded and upvoted.. it toke me 18 days of farming and doing all raids when they comeout to ge tthe pa.. legit way ..
---
As the other one mentioned, I got the company wrong. It's Hornwright Industrial HQ, not Garrahan. Garrahan is who gives you the Excavator PA.
---
I think that enemies have gotten a little stuffer recently.
---
Went through Wes tec this morning and the mutants were taking a few extra bullet's to kill.
---
Brotherhood Recon rifle with 50 cal receiver. Hits hard, cheap ammo to craft has a level 1,5,10-50 variant. I would use it till 30 and then try to get an AA, TS 1 or 2 star legendary.
---
Not everyone admit they use duped shit. Many will tell you ‘maybe maybe not i don’t know’ lol
---
your perk cards are level locked until after you spend your level 50 one.
---
Buy the game as cheap as you can then never come back to this reddit. The game has crashes and bugs yes but if you buy cheap, you will not be too angry about that.   
---
Me personally, I love the game, but all the s\*\*t Bethesda has done, really dampens your enjoyment of the game. The less you know about all that, the better you'll be able to enjoy the game. At least, that is how I feel. So far, all the noobs (real ones, not alts) I encounter love the game.
---
It’d only be worth it if there were special fanny packs that were unlocked at certain numbers of fanny packs owned (50 packs, 100, 1000) to flex upon peasants your immeasurable wealth and superiority.
---
The levels really seem to bee off like something 30 levels below me is a decent opponent (usually a pack of dogs)
---
Yeah I’m with this guy. I didn’t think they could and if they do, does the Ultracite cores last significantly longer?
---
There will be 25 percent off on legendaries next week.
---
Exactly. I get the same feeling when I put on something over the robot armor and take it off. It's so ridiculous.
---
Frequently requested, and specific outfits should automatically hide the backpacks (like Engineer Scribes).

bethesda breaks scrap box
---
players get angry
---
bethesda tries to fix it by handing them replacement scrap 
---
different players get angry 
---
wow they really can't win
---
I was using a singular 'they' to refer to the person you were replying to, dude. They never even approached an implication that they think it's okay that people are losing their items and then not getting them back. I doubt anyone's a fan of that.
---
Yeah, inflation control is a real problem when player-run vendors enter game economies.  There have been a few doctoral theses and other scholarly works on the topic, as a microcosm of RL with simplified rules.  I guess cap sinks like camp placement fees, fast travel fees, player vendor sales taxes and widely unbalanced robot vendors (buy low, sell high) aren't enough to reliably keep cap supply at current levels by themselves. Makes me wonder if we're going to see more "buy a ticket" quest-related cap sinks, like the Assaultron Recall Keycard for Encryptid, will show up at some point.  
---
In any case, I'd also like to see some kind of vendor shutdown when a sale runs over caps max, in lieu of the hard cap limit.  Seems like they could handle it like the max character weight limit: further caps additions are forbidden until the character drops below the caps limit.  But that's ripe for abuse: Get a mule character to 29,999 caps. A confederate buys something from a vendor for 30K.  Mule now has 56,999 caps (after B's 10% cut)- unable to accept more, but now carrying much more than the limit.  eBay caps farmers would love that!  I'm sure someone more devious than I am could use/abuse it even further.  Net result is the caps supply increases, followed by inflation. Tricky issue!
---
I don't know if B. has one, but some MMOs actually employ economists to keep up with money supply and similar issues.  May be more common where purchasing of in-game currency with real-world funds is allowed, though.  Maybe if someone clever comes up with better caps sinks, they could relax the caps limit or remove the hard cap vendor losses.  Guess we'll see!
---
I fid a couple of restarts and nothing changed.  Got a reply from Beth and cleared the cached profile copy and pulled a fresh one frombthe server, its fixed now.
---
My reason is clearly stated in the post. So maybe dont throw around that word so easy. 
---
That's cool you like your backpack. I'm talking about hiding it so it doesnt show on your armor/outfit. Looks like about 100 people also think it's a good idea.
---
There also seems to be more enemies in a pack now, got stormed an stomped on this morning. it was fun though it's been awhile since I've been smashed like that lol
---
Na, it sucked because it was a lazy half ass mode that didn't belong in the fallout series.
---
DayZ says hi
---
That would be nifty but I get why that's not a thing. Same as the hazmat suit unequipping all your armor.
---
Yea I personally have all my characters at max now so on my main I camp hop and buy dumb shit just because I really like the player vending aspect and I like my machines to be open. I have a full set of unyielding wwr so I have an ignorant amount of weapons on me so I’m constantly cycling them thru my machines.
---
Preach.  
---
This has been requested since Vending machines launched, or let them have a separate cap stash the players can withdraw from.

I'mma be honest, when I read the title I was conflicted.  While I wouldn't want Cait running around with me, ruining lore consistency even more - I would love to hear Katy talk to me while I run around Appalachia.  Her voice acting is why I put up with Cait and why I pursued Suvi as a romantic option in Andromeda.
---
 Admittedly I listen to the raider radio a lot just to hear Alex's voice.
---
But as for your actual concern, plz no Fo4 bugs or exploits.
---
In some places. Not others
---
Yeah, you can't run a vendor that way!  All you can do is dive for the log-out button and hope for the best.  Oh, and don't have your vendor platform hanging over a cliff when you do that!
---
&gt;I was lucky enough to find the dense combat torso plan
---
Reveal your magic, witch!
---
If I want survival PvP I’ll play DayZ or any number of games that do PvP better.
---
curious myself if we can get some confirmation and this was submitted as a bug...
---
Nah I dont mind.
---
I like that certain outfits hide the backpack. It's a nice option for someone who doesn't like any of the available skins.
---
Where did people get the free junk like just in their inventory?
---
\*Slow clap\* Well played sir.
---
getting lots of lag in the US today too.  placing items in the camp brings up a server not responding error almost every time
---
There is no source, because it's not true, as of right now.
---
Use a combat knife and throwing knives until like level 25, then switch to using pipe guns
---
Agreed man. I’ve found this game to be very polarizing. Either people love it and accept it for what it is or just continually bash it like a beaten child. 🤭 excuse the lovely metaphor. But go check out r/market76 it’s very capitalistic but even through that I’ve seen kindness and generosity thrive. I’m hosting a secret Santa gift exchange over there and like other members of the community I do regular giveaways or even just have fun negotiating and sometimes even talk people down - like the reverse of a normal persons negotiating, I ask for less then what I’m offered sometimes 😂
---
This. The rifle is strong and accurate even with no perks.
---
Same with me. If I lost some, I didn't know at first.
---
Shoot I’m 28 and when I was going to school you literally got laughed at and made fun of until you graduated. I still laugh at people wearing those.
---
They made people drop basically no caps, they removed the bounty system, then they removed the leaderboards, then added damage caps, then just removed the mode. RIP Survival
---
get scout badges all you need is three tadpole badges.
---
Yea I’m actually surprised there is only 1 event that costs caps to access. Yea anytime there is an opportunity people will exploit it every time! Sometimes it boggles my mind how these guys figure all these stupid things out! I just wish there was an option like when the robots run out of caps it gives you a prompt that they don’t have anymore. Maybe something like that idk
---
Yeah buut 50 off would be even better
---
Apparently! Although I'm worried they're just gonna be randomly-generated nobodies, or won't be able to travel with the player and just stay at CAMPs. We'll see, I suppose
---
I haven't played since February and am looking to get back into it, this is very helpful! I've started the tadpole quests but I see I need the camera to get many of the badges; how do I get the camera questline started?
---
I dont think I'd trade my primed, instigating, +10 aim, -25% vats lever action for just about anything. Probably 90%+ of my kills are ones shots from that gun. One ammo run lasts for a month.
---
I have plenty of guns that do more damage faster, especially in events, but that lmg just eats ammo.
---
If on Ps4 I have a Preston account. I can mark your map for you if you would like to help some wastelanders in trouble?
---
Now what do you play on because that would probably help?
---
I’m in Aus, but feel free to add me on PC. I haven’t completed a vault raid yet because I only play solo and I’ve found it too difficult to do on my own. My username is shiimmy. This goes out to anyone else who plays PC and would be happy to do slam vault raids with me
---
😱 oops I am on Xbox one
---
Its very easy to counter both teslas and stealth boys, if you make your build right you can only take like 6 damage from teslas, ans berry mentats counters stealth boys. I do not want them to make stealth boys like nw, then vats builds would become dominant and that is not fun.
---
Yep, also keep getting the "Server is not responding" too. Maybe they are getting DDoS attack, or just they fucked something up in the last patch. I made the mistake of making a new camp, I gave up after 5 minutes as it's been impossible to build anything.
---
Dude they have major positive feedback from the community already.
---
Like deadpool. "Whoa! Whoa! Im just getting something out of my utility belt!"
---
"That's a fanny pack and you know it!"
---
Have you ever tried it? Also, id like to ask how many shots can you take from a quad tesla?
---
PVP in NW is more fun because the entire game mode is balanced around PVP, including weapon stats.  PVP doesn't work in adventure mode because they have to take into consideration PVE.
---
I solo’ed her yesterday with my AAE gat plasma and strangler armor. Mine took a bit longer because when I spammed her with poison the game needed a while to figure all of that out before it worked again lol
---
That's the private server thing right? I remember somebody said something about mods being available in it someday which interests me. Not really to be OP but just because there's always been some pretty funny or stupid mods
---
They could leave the 30k cap limit in place, but add-in a "bank" tied to your vendors that stores...let's say 5k.
---
Example: You have 29k in your possession. Your bank is at 0 (obviously). Someone buys a 6k item from your vendor. You get 1k instantly, and 5k goes to you bank AND you vendors automatically shut off.
---
Someone buys a 2k item under the same circumstances. You get 1k, bank gets 1k....vendors auto turn off. 
---
Same deal, someone buys a 9k item. You get 1k, 5k goes to bank, you lose 3k forever, vendors auto shut off.
---
Vendors cannot be turned back on (even if destroyed and remade) until you empty your bank. It would still limit caps, but give people some wiggle room on their vending to not be punished as much.
---
Good for them, I stand by my comment.
---
I hope you get the chance to hide it, but it if is ever possible to do so, I wont, as I like the look of it.
---
Thatd be awesome but disappointing
---
For only $20
---
Update on my comment: I'm not sure how they decided which character gets these early Christmas gifts but you only get 4 per account - **not** 4 per character. I.e - if you for whatever reason lost scrap on multiple characters, you're being compensated exactly the same as somebody who lost (almost) nothing on just 1 character.
---
My "main" character isn't actually my oldest character, nor did I use it to build a scrapbox first, but it's the one that got the 4 packaged scrap things. I'm guessing they were either account-wide, or given to whichever character you had set as active at the time of this thing being distributed.
---
...which is unfortunate, because if I did lose any scrap, it would have actually been on an alt character I was working on this time last month. Still, I'm not going to complain about getting 80k caps worth of junk for nothing.
---
Thanks! I love the song :)
---
Harpers is where I got mine, though as others have mentioned, they can be found elsewhere.
---
The hazmat suit has utility to it though. I just want to be like Paladin Danse or Sahara Lions and look badass without loosing precious stats or mods 😅
---
True but I'll take 25 off over full price too, lol. Stay filthy!
---
There is already too many poor prefixes that make the RNG super hard to get the ones you want.
---
Problem is you have one nice moment for every 45 infuriating bugs. Some aspects need to be taken care of. You wouldn't have laughed if he had been an immortal bugged regenerating assaultron and your heavy guns had lost their ammo during fast travel.
---
shut up and take my money!
---
I don't see you on xbox,  so hahah.
---
i would pay anything tbh
---
Maybe a skin for a popular weapon or some cool C.A.M.P. stuff idk. I'm still waiting for the desert ranger skin.
---
Well I mean they are using valid mechanics of the game while you are using armor that can cause them lag which in small amounts is normal to a cast majority but the amount the SHPA can make people experience is different....... not saying they are any better people for the way they play but just pointing that out
---
Hey dude. GG’s on your first win. I have started a Nuclear Winter sub called FO76_NuclearWinter, feel free to join and add your success. Also will happily give support to you through PS4
---
I call BS on the whole, “Berry Mentats counters stealthboys” that’s just a bunch of bull!
---
They do not
---
They are more like three dozens of insultbots trapped inside Sugar Grove.
---
I'll resub if they unfix the ranger outfit
---
And your opinion is different *how*?
---
You need a safe space there, little guy?
---
Yup same here, on Xbox, I have to restart the game.
---
Sweet, that's good, I'll also share to PKOA as many as active NW players kinda the reason I got into it lol 
---
r/FO76_NuclearWinter
---
Yea this last dude must of not even looked at prices! Idk how he even read all the freaking stats on the weapons before he bought them for crying out loud! When he bought the .50 cal I was at west tek and i was fighting a 3* mutant, so I thought I’ll kill him and loot him and log out just in case. So within the time I killed that guy he spent time over 15k! I was salty to say the least!
---
I realise this may just be a post to incite attention or simply discussion, but it's kinda pointless.
---
I paid for exclusive content, a flashy incentive like with any other company attempting to gain membership. We will also be receiving atoms to spend, which I paid to have along with my membership, and will continue to.
---
Not sure why the scorn, we're getting the benefits we were promised, and I'm sure more perks along the way. If it's not enough to sway people, that's fine, but it's exactly why we pay for it so whatever the motive, I'm happy to continue for this very reason.
---
Go to The Crosshair, and to an unmarked shed south of Crashed Space Station for two locations where level 15 raider PA spawns
---
You scum!
---
Right? Bethesda is throwing their core fan-base into a genre of gaming they most certainly did not look for in making Fo76 an MMO. There are distinct differences in a single player open world experience compared to a multiplayer open world experience.
---
It was cute watching the bit of outrage people on the sub displayed when they found out people had found a way to keep multiple workshops hidden like its astounding part of the playerbase doesn't want any type of pvp contact.
---
what’s PKOA sorry? i’m still a reddit noob. i appreciate that dude. i have a thread started of bugs and i will try to upload game footage over the next few weeks. appreciate the support 😊

I'm going to captain Kirk my way through wastelanders if they add the ability to love NPCs
---
Would sex addiction boost junkies?
---
Since the scorch are a hive mind...would sex with one be considered an orgy?
---
Would sex with a ghoul be considered necrophillia?
---
Yea this is a good idea! A one time over flow. Yea wether it’s 1 cap or 5k it would only work for that one transaction. 5k seems fair tbh. I would like to see this. A true game changer for us people who enjoy the player vending aspect of the game. It’s honesty my favorite thing about the game so I would definitely like to see improvements in tat aspect.
---
apparently it's done that for a good while now. and it's been reported tons but no fix for it. sigh
---
They highlight them, to make them much easier to shoot lol, or are you a vats build and mad you can't use aimbot?
---
Yes,... But it's still, to say the least, suspicious that their money-box does the one thing it's absolutely not supposed to do.  
---
I've seen several posts in here alone, about regretting not buying the subscription, because of the free scrap.
---
Also makes it look like they care about you, if you're a 1st-member.
---
I generaly keep it up for normal stuff then switch out for other perks on harder level raids, events, etc. And just use my repair kits from sqb and imposter to fix on fly.
---
I mean if Netflix stops adding new shows and movies every month and you watch them all what’s the point of keep paying for Netflix? Yes you still have instant access to all the movies and tv shows on their list, but if you seen them all what’s the incentive to pay them again? Yes I have access to unlimited scrap and 1600 atoms, but what’s the point if I don’t get anything else, because those two features are not really subscription quality selling points month after month.
---
Reminds me of playing a Chinese Heavy Blade build in Silkroad. The only thing that really killed me through potion spam was a 1 shot from a mage.

---
I started off using it but then I’ve dropped it down to three.  Seem to be coping quite well with it tbh.
---
Its definitely worth having.
---
So broken unbalanced mechanics vs broken game lag makes me trash?
---
I've been on first since day one, I don't think I lost any scrap (at least I didn't notice it), and I haven't received either an e-mail or any additional junk in my stash.
---
What did they ‘fix’ with it? Did I miss reading a patch note on it?
---
Dude, if you’re a full health build, in a stealthboy, with good gear, with aid on you, you’re impossible to kill.
---
We all have speed demon and marsupial, add on top of that full permanent invisibility, it’s impossible without a Tesla.
---
The gunplay is not that slick in this game. 
---
I end up just spamming Gamma Gun all over the place chasing after a pink cloud with mentats on
---
It depends on why you are using it. Do you have an explosive weapon or a two-shot, or god forbid a tse? If so it could be more beneficial to keep. If not you could probably get by just using weapon artisan or the advanced repair kits from queen to repair it.
---
Ok lol but just because you dont like or agree with something doesnt make it stupid. That is a stupid way of looking at things. If you dont have anything meaningful to add to the conversation you are just wasting both our time.
---
it's an item restore, its quite the opposite to be frank. People loosing items should get them restored, asap. Due to the customer service being unable to do so ingame, this was the compromise they reached.
---
While im happy for the people who got their junk restored, i do strongly dislike that people got 600 vault steel aswell. Then it hit me that you could store those too, which left me with the following mental dilemma:
---
If multiple people lost 100's of vault steel, would it be fine if they didnt get them restored but got the rest of the junk? No, not really.
---
Would it be fair if everyone got the same bulk scrap as a compromise? Well, yes, but also no not really, since it came from the vault.
---
Then it hit me that since i wasnt involved in the issue, it didnt effect me at all. That Steel would never have been in my inventory to begin with, since i didnt loose anything.
---
It's a bummer, but in this case i'd say Bethesda handled it properly - They went with the more the merrier for once, something i hope they do in the future when it comes to lost items.
---
Be happy for others, don't let it get you down, Its not a competition. Let's be happy Bethesda did something right for once instead of being jelous and turning against eachother.
---
i’m just as pissed at this ok
---
I like both situationally.  I have a BE Handmade for going loud vs groups and a BFFR Fixer for stealth.  For the queen I have a primed B33.
---
With yeah there.   
---
I think its just a reddit thing, everyone just has to tell everyone about their issues when something doesn't go their way. Boarderlands 3 and Modern Warefare subs have a lot of complaining posts too. This was far worse though.
---
The people who paid for the game when it came out aren't going to be very happy. Not unless you give them some sort of ingame equivelant like $60 worth of atoms or something.
---
I agree that you get 8% more damage for points 2 to 5 in Demolition Expert, but there are much better perks to get.   2% damage per point compared to Bloodied Mess, weapon specific perks, etc. offers horrible returns for the points.
---
This squad of gutsies is dispatched randomly when someone destroys a large number of the local robot population. Four legendary defenders is very cool, never seen more than one myself.
---
As a child of the 80s, I say yesssss.
---
The Fallout series is known as the "wastelander sims" game dude, you create your daily grind and go from there. It can be quests, money, exploration, etc etc.
---
I'm particularly enjoying Skyrim right now, I have a fun loop to raise my smithing, alteration, enchanting, and get a ton of money from it too. As an example.
---
Bethesda has pretty much always produced games rich in non-combat gameplay options.
---
Wow all at max? Thats insane.
---
I got one at 219, one at 157. Rest are all under 20
---
It is indeed more damage, but you are getting pretty poor returns for points 2 to 5 in Demolition Expert compared to other perk card choices.
---
FE handmade / IE Lever / I Lever
---
Basically the 3 guns I use.
---
PC.
---
Raiders, boom
---
Pretty sure there was a seperate download pack for this version. If I'm remebering correctly. Try to see if you downloaded the extra pack as well as the basegame
---
~~Skynet~~ the institute can maybe send back ~~inflitrators~~ gen 3 synths so it could be lore friendly.
---
And a vendor that wears and only sells fanny packs.
---
That's what I was wondering... Could I drop it to 3 or 2 and still not be repairing every play session.
---
So you call my use of "stupid" stupid. OK. And time is only wasted IF you choose to reply.
---
Your being spiteful it was a great way to get some fun in a otherwise boring farming simulator, they should've kept base destruction like it was in the beginning in that mode and bumped up player count in the survival servers, and kept cap gains where it was from the start
---
I get the annoyance or whatever you want to call it but go to your local golf course with a rifle, backpack, some armor and run/sprint up the fairway from hole 1 through hole 3....After you are done let me know if you are thirsty...My bet is that you are....This aspect is really no different than real life....
---
I have had the base game installed since last December. I downloaded the file off the microsoft store site and it shows its downloaded. I just can't seem to get the base game to recognize the file.
---
Probably require 10 challenges to complete out of 12 but 3 don’t work.
---
I'm sure that sometime within the next month they will rollout some 1st exclusive skins at the least.
---
That’s also dependent on how your build is set up. Meta builds don’t work for everyone.
---
so tldr of rewards: every time you roll a "no plan" you are rolling a dupe of a plan from a set you learned all the plans to.
---
long: so plans have a "100%" drop rate. solar has a 33% chance, thorns has a 33% chance, and strangler has a 33% chance to be rolled.  the game rolls one of the 3 types, then gives you a plan you have not learned from the set it chose.  once you learn a full set and the game selects that set of three to give you, there is no unknown plan, which causes the game to not reward one.
---
im not sure if you saw it or not as well (post is a month old now), but someone posted a "2 man expert guide" if you search if.  has a ton of great tips for running all 3 missions
---
I would not be happy with fanny packs as they came to the forefront in the 80s, not the late 50s/early 60s. 
---
This would be one more bullet in the fallout aesthetic
---
I get you feel like you've gotten all you're gonna from your first month, but not sure why you don't feel there will be any other perks along the way. I think this falls into one of two camps. For me, spending $10/month is a good average amount of what I'll pay for some extra atoms. So to me, and I think most 1st members, we feel like the rest is icing.
---
The way that I play with many others, we share materials and give to each other when necessary. For example, the friend that makes ammo in our group goes through steel like it's purified water. Me and several others throw as many mats at him when he needs it and buy ammo from him when he uses it. He doesn't have the sub, but it's a really good trade off.
---
The emergency camp is awesome for how we play, I'd miss that a LOT if I stopped the sub. And the private worlds have become a safe haven for those of us who want to friendly pvp, take over our own Whitespring nuke, etc.
---
You say you've gotten all you can get from it and cite storage space as now pointless. I feel like maybe you're just not getting everything you could from it because of how you play. If so, then yeah, you really shouldn't pay for it again.
---
It really is battshittery. The people who decided on the amounts do not understand their own game at all
---
Did you try to collect the items from the atom store? Might just be that they are now free. I cant remember if i had to with my version though. As it was a quite awhile ago
---
FFR for business
---
Explosive for pleasure
---
Yea its gross
---
Both UK and France (I use a Shadow to log an alt) quite laggy.
---
Loading the CAMP takes its sweet time and I get plenty of melee hits that connect, show the damage numbers and make the corresponding sound but have fuck all effect on the enemies' health.
---
I personally think they should put the new colors in the game for us to find and just hint that it's there; the stuff gets datamined anyway.
---
Then we can work together to discover where the stuff is, and unearth it and throw it into the markets and/or collect them like it was with the asylum uniforms.
---
Well do the math.  Exploding damage is 20% of the weapon base damage.  Demolition Expert adds 10% more exploding damage for points 2 to 5 in the perk.  So 0.10 x 0.20  = 0.02 or a net of 2% additional damage.  
---
Yes, it’s pretty bad.  That’s why I post it here, yet people downvote me because they don’t understand how it works.
---
I have mentioned this before and totally agree.  I don't even care if the challenge is super grindy.  My only real complaint was that 3/4's of the items were absolute garbage.  If they made new weapons that were actually useful, even situation-ally useful it would be fine. I also would like to see armor sets.  Maybe a new challenge each week that awards a piece of armor for a set.  After 5 weeks you get the set.
---
I kust got a mental image of a scorchbeast with a minigun going brrrrrrrt
---
That's the one I'm referring to, and there's only the one color of him. He has a bunch of different times, but he could also come in different colors. 
---
It's be cool/funny to see a faction dedicated only to these costumes, like a makeshift kids park.
---
they coulda won if they didn't include v.steel, that is the only item in there that is pissing people off
---
ahhh awesome. i have joined that group and learnt how to properly promote the page. i appreciate it my dude
---
Can we please get an option toggle the backpack on and off while still wearing it? It would be one thing if there were myriad backpack options, but since there aren't, I'd rather just have the ability to take it off while still maintaining the carry capacity.
---
I'd absolutely love that so much. The thought of all the possible creations people could come up with...
---
Stupid post gets stupid down vote from stupid user. All is stupid.
---
it also nullifies all the work people put in, 50 days worth of steel given out.
---
thanks
---
I didn't check the atom shop.  I will try that when I get home later.  I guess I never thought to check that since I didn't think those were atom shop items.
---
Its worked for me both weeks. 
---
Actually, I have that on pretty much all the time and I've never once seen it not work
---
That’s so cringe! That’s math that requires some effort and proving is the problem. Me I know that there’s a lot idk so when u said it I immediately went to go check the math behind it. I now have new perks increasing my vats crit shot damage and sneak ability. Great improvements to my build so thank u
---
I wonder if CAMP budget increases will ever be a thing.
---
Don't Axe me what i was doing https://imgur.com/Fi4zRbY
---
No worries my friend, introduce yourself to the group, mate, we've got people on all 3 platforms so there's a bonus there lol
---
I hate to break it to you but the pvp in this game has always been terrible due to legendaries.
---
So brave
---
It is good to hear things like this, lets me know that not everyone you meet does not just attack you for no flipping reason (also the reason I don't have any defensive mutation with the character I am using now).
---
I just wish people would use their mics more, it could be a greater experience.
---
Wrong
---
My dude wears a bathrobe everywhere and the backpack is definitely out of place
---
^This 
---
And replace it with a fixer as soon as possible.
---
I would argue that the existence of full loot pvp fallout mmos prior to this one says something other than what you are selling here.
---
You wanted these things, but many others wanted something else as well.
---
There are some awesome people in the game.  I use my mic and always try to say hi or to barter when we are trading things.  I found a plan for robot armor just by asking someone yesterday.  The vast majority of people in this game are pretty nice.
---
Haha! I almost made it out the window!
---
And George getting shanked and looking back like 'wtf?'
---
Don't call it a comeback!
---
you can 1-2 tap full hp builds with it... bloodied are an easy 1 tap
---
Sorry,no. ~~I will have been did killed them all in the future~~ they ded
---
would be nice!
---
I loved the fun names and I am only missing the mini nuke one!
---
You will need rank 5 gunsmith if you want to work on your own weapons but there is no need to have it equipped if you arent crafting.  It's a crutch.  Place a forceful or precise stock on your weapon. Ie one that increases bashing damage.  It will up the durability substantially. Then repair with 3/3 weapon artisian.  I haven't run with gunsmith equipped in several hundred levels.
---
Are you on XBOX?  I have 2 bloodied western revolvers....I ran this build for a while...as someone said I was also doing 700 base damage....If you are interested in one let me know
---
Please! I would love to rock an all dark red jumpsuit with Old Man Summer mask
---
They need to get off their greedy, lazy behinds and start making decent games again.
---
that would be great! Maybe WS robotics attack on sight like the chinese robots do right now!
---
I'm gonna be super disappointed if it doesn't say "Better RED THEN DEAD".
---
It works as long as the other player isnt hitting at damage cap with every shot (which they shouldnt be unless they have a bloodied tesla) field surgeon +first aid helps heal 66% faster and 45% more, you heal stupidly fast if you only have super stimpaks left, just test the healing yourself and you will see it is fast, havent tried using a medicine bobblehead yet
---
You're making an ignorant comment on my post and expecting me not to reply? That is more naive than stupid, but still.
---
And yes I can objectively say someone calling something stupid just because they dont like it is in itself a stupid thing to do.
---
You mean.. *another settlement needs my help*?
---
Now I remember I hate Preston
---
yeah they released them to make the defcon go higher
---
A stash box where you can transfer you stuff on your account from one toon to another on your account so you don't have to give to someone else to switch toons
---
The Dude Abides
---
I use a powered garage door and then I depower the store and door and store the switch when I get close to max caps
---
No junk for me either. So I didn't lose or profit. I did find that I lost all my hardened mass when I junked my stuff too quickly! Grrr I have to concentrate more when I use this box.
---
IIRC, the (PS4) version had a secondary code in the package which unlocked the tricentennial items.
---
again IIRC, you have to craft them at the appropriate workbench.
---
This skin is so lore breaking
---
Well I’m not sure how “meta” and demolition expert are related.  The point is that you get very little returns from this perk. If the goal is just to just pick perks that are ineffective compared to others, then I guess Demolition Expert 5/5 is the way to go.  
---
5/5 gets you 12% total additional damage.
---
If people are picking these perks for a character theme or role play reasons, then I guess it does make sense.
---
The first 2 are the best melee I’ve taken. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/caKtQdq
---
&gt;Place a forceful or precise stock on your weapon. Ie one that increases bashing damage.
---
Forcefully give a lengthy condition bar.
---
OP, in addition to this, with the three weapons you've mentioned, what are the repair costs like? can you afford to repair them more frequently?
---
To others, Gunsmith 5 is very much needed if using Gatlins/ Miniguns. 3000 shots with UGL will take a weapon down from 200% to 70-80% and thats WITH Gunsmith 5
---
Nick and Dogmeat. You know you want them. 
---
Piper too^(if you wanna mess with everyone retconing her as a syn)
---
I didn't get a damned thing out of them.
---
The timing on that was too good haha
---
I can say I officially received my replacement junk.
---
This game has been an absolute disaster, I'm extremely dissapointed yet again.
---
*Boooohoooo, I can’t be a bully!*
---
Well this is odd because my main can't make any raid armor and I've only done standard 3 times with no plans. So if each plan has a 33% drop rate and I'm not getting any the game thinks I have plans?
---
Just go and play on a f''king highway.
---
Good thing the Atomic Shop isn’t canon
---
Sorry I just had to make this joke because of the title :p
---
I guess, if this still is a thing when companions are implemented, Bethesda would change it with a later update. If people complain.
---
But at first, I want a companion, even if they can carry as much as superman xD
---
Since I got 1st, I don't really care much about carry weight at all.
---
You would notice if you had the bug. Every single piece of junk would have been removed.  This is what happened to me.
---
BYE!!  and please don't post anymore....8 accounts?  another duper bites the dust
---
Group with other people ffs
---
Field surgeon + First Aid + Super stimpaks =insanely fast heals
---
If you"re still playing fo76 you already won the survival challenge
---
Wait level or caps? I just made my fifth character the other day and I should of moved that 15k off my main to the new guy!!! I just hate not having caps in case I come across a good deal. I’m going to just keep 10k on me from now on. My other 3 guys are all between 26-30k. I only use one of the other guys so 3 of the 5 are just for storage. I took advantage of that double xp and leveled up my alt from 32 to 56 in a day and a half!
---
Just doing my coded job. Happy gaming lol
---
If your on xbox
---
I'm looking for a shotgun like that.
---
And the hunting rifle is not to bad as well.
---
If you want to sell them let me know.
---
The gat is rare just for being ultrasite (ei. I have found 2 ultrasite weapons and I started playing during the beta.)
---
This is my work around until Bethesda addresses this problem.  I have 5 characters all at max caps like most of us.  On my main high level character I turn the vending machines off while I'm shopping at other players vending machines until I've spent enough to turn my vending machines back on.  Just like your stash limit, you have to manage your vending items and only place lower cap items if your running near your max caps.  I have a trophy room that I use to display my high end weapons with messages to PM with trade offers.  So, basically don't place more than 30k cap worth of items in your vending machines, or if say you currently have 20k caps, don't have more that 10k worth of items for sell.
---
That's not in the spirit of gaming though, rewards in game are valuable because you play the game to earn them, if your income dictates how far you get in the game then you might as well not play and spend your money on something that you actually find fun.
---
What about Legendary weapon effect of +250 DR while reloading?  I heard it's bugged and if you remain crouched that the effect persists.
---
Yea that’s what I normally do but every once and a while someone shows up and dumps 20k and fucks up everything! When I get to 26 normally I log off then go lock my door and kill the power. I have a separate barn for my vending machines.
---
Hmm I’ll look into it, would push the DR over 1000 so that may be it.
---
I keep forgetting to message to make sure of this lol there have been a couple times where I've messaged someone saying they've got an amazing camp and they reply with thanks etc and I'll even ask how to get X item and they tell me its really nice to see more of this  and it's actually got me to open up my messages just in case
---
After around 500 I don't think DR counts for much anyway though, right?
---
This happened in every one of my workshops yesterday and even caused my game to crash due to some weird audio distortion
---
Yeah, I've got a mic but never have it on nor do I want to lol
---
They need to look at mini guns and Gatlings again then cause I get 4 queens minimally out of my bffr 50cal and that's with no gunsmith and I still have about 40% on it when I repair.
---
Not really sure, is there somewhere you know you may have heard that? Or is that just your thought?
---
Yeah, I've had that and so far its winding down potential vendors that sell that elusive neon signs lol
---
I once rage-uninstalled :D because of something similar. Back when most enemies would become immortal if you had powerful weapons.
---
No, the playerbase just isn't that interested in PvP in this game. So they got rid of the mode.
---
I've seen it said a few times here on reddit, that after around... 470-500 DR the mitigation takes a steep nose dive. Some other people did all the data mining and math, I've just always gone by those numbers and it served me well 🤷‍♂️
---
Yes, walked in from the Flooded Trainyard, got the little window saying I was joining the event.  Was picking flux until SBQ landed right in front of me.
---
Well thank you, I was just playing around with something to keep me not bored in the game haha
---
Whitesprings hordes were awesome
---
No worries
---
Pevert's Rolling Pin
---
Given the new Creation Club thing for Fallout 4, the ability to play with the colors of vault suits would be cool.
---
Take a trip to any train station and  there are posters on the pegboard for various quests. One is a house party, one is for pioneer scouts and one is for the lying Lowe quest. My personal favorites are the house party quest and the lying Lowe quests cause they're REAL funny, pay attention to terminals and holotapes. I'm not gonna spoiled much for you :p the scouts quest is a bit lengthy and a few parts are a tad glitched but the challenges will take lots of time.what system are you on?
---
Only if they impact me directly. I could care less about the in game economy.
---
And it being an online game that runs servers, constant updates and dlcs it needs funding. So expecting them to keep up live services and shelling out free dlcs you’d come to the obvious conclusion that it needs player support. If they didn’t sell anything then they’d be screwed and the game as a whole would just shut down. So complaining you have to buy things to keep the game going is a little redundant. You can either support it or don’t. If you survived old games that didn’t have shops and not having to buy things then you can survive ignoring the atom shop. I want this game to continue to evolve ergo it gets my support financially. That’s the choice we all have but complaining doesn’t keep the lights on.
---
OH oof. I thought you meant max level lol.
---
But yeah, max caps is easy. Running raids and just selling shit I hit max in a few days. So need to mule.
---
We need a way bigger cap limit.
---
On the last patch, Beth stated that they added a build radius to the Survival Tents when you are placing one -   *A build radius will now appear when attempting to place a C.A.M.P. or Survival Tent new another player’s existing Survival Tent.*
---
It looks like when they added the build radius it also reduced the distance between tents.
---
Fuck yea man, zax doesn't help with him making snarky remarks about you
---
Can craft backward facing ones for free. 
---
The proper forward-facing ones will be an Atom Shop exclusive, and it'll include a belt-clipped pager you can use instead of a Pip-Boy.
---
How is dropping a set of power armor an exploit?
---
Do you think the Scrapbox and tent should be given to non-payers?
---
Awesome people in-game doesn't make the game awesome. It makes those players awesome. They can and probably are just as nice in other games that they play.
---
But yes, Bethesda should absolutely appreciate the playerbase that have kept this game going, despite Bethesda not deserving it.
---
Xbox.
---
I agree with everything but the cap limit. I didn't get any stronger after ~80 on my main because I had just about every piece of gear on my wish list, but once he was a few hundred levels over other people it wouldn't matter if I killed them 5 times to their one, they'd come out ahead on caps, which wasn't a huge deal but was still kinda retarded.
---
Thanks! I had just gotten a set. I put a jetpack on the arm :P
---
A legendary fixer, bearclaw, or sheepsquatch staff/club would be nice, but to compensate for such awesomeness, the challenge should be really difficult/grindy.
---
Minus 2 points. Either there is no sense of sarcasm left here or the shills are more in numbers than ghuls....
---
Yea It’s just an ordeal for me to price and unprocessed all my weapons. Since fall out first I have all that extra space so I keep 20-30 weapons in my stash and 10-15 pieces of armor. I like to have a huge variety in my vendors but I guess I’m going to have to stop. I like to offer all types of mid tier explosive weapons for 2-3k and they seem to sell really good. I didn’t think someone would buy that damn Tesla for 10k  10 minutes after I put it in there! I bought a new one (two shot 25/25)  off of a random guy (which never happens) so I sold my old one (two shot double vats). Maybe I’ll mark them at 25k and put a note to message offers or something.
---
because it is supposed to be untradeable? like the regular armor sets? and the steel? and the plans? and the mask? and the jumpsuit?
---
If you want you can add me and I can help you out with getting back into the game
---
So Stadia is a terrible console?
---
No, but Sword/Shield will be
---
it should, the explosive prefix is the one that prevents the arching effect, since it changes the projectiles.
---
I'm sticking with it because the private world is still worth it alone IMO.
---
yes, YES
---
I tried to tell y'all and get Bethesda's attention but got downvoted to hell for having the audacity to say I had FO1st, so I got what on by FO1st players trying to get their junk and non 1st players because I had the subscription and was going to get it.
---
I'd love to run them with people. Level 105. I've never ran it before though. Id imagine I'm semi competent and have a mic
---
I kinda wish clothing auto-hid undergarments. It's seriously "trailer trash chic" that my character wears the "Harness" underarmor, and her bra is poking out through the sides.
---
I mean, c'mon girl - you aren't that top heavy, and you wear enough armor on top that those things aren't going anywhere when you run.
---
This is what ive always heard as well. As well as observed to a certain point. I generally run with 430 Dr/er and have made the push to 550 and didnt really notice all that large of a difference. 
---
Could just be that a lot of my damage mitigation perks are based on a % chance.
---
I wouldn't be mad, but it would get hairy because if there's an EC set somewhere that someone else loading in needs to set their camp, it won't happen. There'd have to be some sort of way to pick it back up when you were through, or it would have to have less propriety.
---
Currently the exclusivity of it is what makes it possible without a real issue.
---
As to scrapbox, I don't know how that would work, but as the OP stated, it would become pointless for some after a while. Again, I wouldn't be mad at all if it was available to everyone. It's literally a cake item to me.
---
Yea my main is lvl 260 and my alt is almost 60. And I agree it happens fast, I mean you get 25k on your guy so you move it to an alt or a mule...soon enough ( a week!) all your characters are at max caps!
---
I launched one at level 100 as a celebration, I guess. I will eventually because possum badge. lol Or was it a tadpole badge? Either way, I like completing achievements/challenges. It was a pain in the ass the first time but I'll probably have an easier time this go around. Maybe I'll do it when I hit 200? XD I'm 180 atm. I did solo first time around. Maybe I can bring my fiance with me this time since he's of a good level. But he probably won't want to xD
---
I would be fine with it and I bought it at launch. It is no different from Destiny or any other game on the Epic launcher. Although, I do agree the common consumer would probably not be very happy with this change. I think losing that exclusivity that my initial purchase of the game gave me in order to have a healthier overall state of the game and future overview would be a good trade off. Plus frankly I enjoy Fallout 76 but none of my friends would dare pay for it currently. Going F2P could help give me some more friends to play with...
---
lol, here we go... Again...
---
I havnt said it before but in my book THIS is p2w.
---
You need it to craft your own mods but not keep it up at all times. Max out weapon artisan and repair your guns to 200% condition.
---
Can you back it up with any official comment anywhere to back that up?
---
lmao. My fiance is like that too. He has so many of the low level quests I told him he'd probably level 10 levels just by finishing all of them. And he's level 92 now.
---
Yes true, I earned the gatling gun one (forgot the name) in adventure mode.
---
I used to wear Nuka Cola armor and hand sodas out to people I met.  Hard part was getting anyone to look in my paper bag, even with a mic
---
If I truly were wrong you would see legendaries in NW.
---
Do you realize that the link you shared completely contradicts what you wrote? There are clearly people in that thread reporting they are 1st members and aren't getting the compensation... and I'm also a 1st member and got no email or compensation.
---
Come on man, you can do better than this...
---
You. I like you.
---
I guess you haven't been keeping up with current events?
---
It’s super tight and no longer flows as well when running and jumping, makes it look bad
---
We were always likely to have to pay to use mods for this game, because it's online. It comes as no surprise to me as I have never played a persistent online game that had free mods (not say none exist, I've just never seen it).
---
Nerd rage, all commando perks ,demo expert, bloody mess. Main ones I can think of.
---
You think Stadia is awesome? I have been having a lot of issues with it.
---
BOTH of my Chromecast Ultra's are overheating and shutting down.
---
Thankfully support has been amazing.
---
They told me they will ship me TWO new ones at no extra cost.
---
Still waiting on them though.
---
Also not sure about you, but even now I am having a shit ton of problems with Destiny 2. Problems I never had on my Xbone. 
---
I also notice the lag and performance issues vs my Xbox One X on the two games I tried.
---
It is not my internet. I have fiber in my area, and my network is Google's own mesh.
---
GG’s on your first win! Carry on getting that overseer XP. I have just started a reddit page for solely NW. Would love to see your wins and opinions on there. r/FO76_NuclearWinter
---
and the vault steel people lost? that just doesn't matter?
---
no lets be honest no matter what they did if it was free and on time 30% of this reddit would hate it - if they sent everyone pizza and a soda for free people would find a issue - pretty much no matter what they did it was doomed to have someone spending hours to find out what was wrong with it
---
Play DEATH STRANDING.
---
For whatever reason they thought it flared out to much when you moved 
---
As a guy who has worn long coats....that's what they do
---
Now it stays way to close to your legs looking like it even pulls in where the knee bends
---
I've went back the drifter since it still acts normal
---
Yep.
---
Ridiculous that we have to keep doing this.
---
I gave you a gold XD

Another wonderful murder-funhouse brought to us by some fucked up, demented, wasteland version of P.T. Barnum. If this video series had a title, it would probably be [“This Way to the Egress”](https://books.google.com/books?id=0QR6hjRMOeQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22to+the+egress%22+american+museum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvhvGVoPPeAhWCMd8KHQtRDyg4ChDoAQhdMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=%22to%20the%20egress%22%20&amp;f=false)
---
You just never know
---
*Whoosh*
---
Stick the mod in your vending machine for 25k
---
Not in the mood to watch a movie right now.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Sure we can do that.
---
Did you lose anything when you put it into a scrap box?  Maybe, like me, you joined Fallout 1st AFTER they already fixed that particularly nasty bug?    If they targeted people affected by this bug, I don't feel bad for not being included.   If they somehow left you out, then maybe put in a support ticket and ask to be included.   I know their support leaves a lot to be desired, but that would be a lot more relatable than "I want some free stuff too because I'm a Fallout 1st subscriber."   That misses the point of why they are doing this.
---
This is probably the best thing I"ll read today
---
Break some ghouls noses in the Whitespring for a warm up, then head to upgrade your backpack &amp; earn Atoms to by your own robot &amp; Build your own trade shop etc
---
The robot chest piece looks good with the raider backpack
---
Just saw this thread and was going to link it, no need now lol
---
&gt;and the vault steel people lost? that just doesn't matter?
---
realistically 50 per pack (200) would cover enough if they saved every steel they got between raid launch and the bug, but im willing to bet pretty much everyone who was running was crafting as they earned, so average loss would be around the ~30 total mark. i have done raids near daily and ended out with ~400
---
&gt;replacement meaning boom argument gone
---
replacement is replacing the missing items, not throwing in a 2 month bonus of material for something most people never touched
---
I've seen a number of players with 25k on every weapon or armor with a message on the vending machine to PM them with offers.  So, that can work on the really rare stuff.  But, this is a problem that needs to be addressed by Bethesda.  Just a couple of days ago, I forgot I had over 25 serums at 235 caps each in my vending machine and someone bought everyone plus 2 weapons both over 2k each and before I could get back to my camp, they had hit my max caps several times.  So, I just gave away 5k or more of my stuff.  LOL
---
All aligned mods on the handmade. Prime auto receiver if your okay with making prime ammo. I run nerd rage, bloody mess 3, serendipity 3, sneak 3, escape artist, covert ops 3, tank killer 3, commando 1 in each, concentrated fire 2
---
Exactly!
---
 I have an instigating plus 10% lever action as well, that gun rocks!
---
My favorite gun though is my IE .45 pipe rifle.
---
 When I have gunslinger and rifleman perks it absolutely destroys stuff.
---
 I usually keep my AAE hand made as my secondary gun when I run with the pipe.
---
 I have a slew of other amazing weapons as well.
---
Fireproof is nice at close range.
---
Yes for sure. Radicool is another.
---
i hear tell, the modern child-men who use them call them "waist wallets" now...
---
Yes!
---
I do agree to this post. Also would like to say, i have started a NW page that i hope to keep regular and up to date. Would love to hear opinions like this on there as i’m collecting a big/glitch report type thing of my own. r/FO_76 
---
on a side note, I want to apologise as there has been times myself i have been guilty of this. Sometimes when i have been waiting 10mins+ to get into a NW match, I might pop away from my PS4 to make a coffee and have a cigarette not realising in the mean time the count down timer has slipped down or i have been connected quicker than expected. I agree with you that having a timer like adventure mode would discourage any dodgy XP gain or people just being dead weights in the team. Upvote from me dude.
---
I’m saying that 76 is just as awesome as the stadia.
---
Netflix doesn't really compare well. 
---
Regular 76 is more like watching a free movie at the community park. You're welcome to come, but you can't control the movie or the other people there and you should be mindful not to ruin it for others, so keep your pants on (no one shotting at Uranium Fever).
---
Fallout 1st is more like Netflix. Yeah it's $13/mo but you're the only one there so you can do whatever you want at your own pace and there's nobody there to ruin it for you and you can take your pants off without feeling bad (take an explosive handmade to Uranium Fever, you know you want to).
---
Don’t take the b8
---
Show us 5 bugs, first thing they say after ”As stated above, we are looking to move as many of these fixes as we can into an earlier patch”
---
So they are going to try and fix the 5 or most of the reported ones? LoL
---
I quit playing FPS games with my kids because, frankly, I'm getting old and their reaction times are far superior.  Vats is an old-man's crutch, when used by kids, its OP.
---
Giving one free month of 1st to anyone who buys a new copy of the game at the launch of Wastelanders could make sense. That would help draw in more people who previously avoided 76 because of it being online with no living NPCs, as would a free weekend. That way, it would be possible to try the game for free, no matter the negative publicity, but it is not enough time to complete the story.
---
If I remember correctly there is also a limb damage perk card in luck.
---
omg what platform are you? i used to run into this guy in Flatwoods that would just literally place 30+ vault boy cardboard cut outs. would be a refreshing change from being a straight boring gun fight. Super entertaining to sit back and just watch em place all these flat strange things in NW. gg’s
---
I do... So if I don't run it at all... What INT perks should I run all time?
---
How is the Strangler better than the Ultracite? I thought that their stats were very similar.
---
thank
---
Roger that
---
Wait, did the original NW map has changed (the one with the bridge)?
---
I haven’t played FO76 in a while
---
Roger roger
---
I didn't look yet for myself, but apparently they made it weird looking with the way the bottom looks. They were trying to fix it but made it worse I guess.
---
Thank
---
Nope, got it.
---
Build Purifiers.
---
Sell water.
---
Profit.
---
Or run through blackwater mine and sell everything you pick up.  This may be faster, but can be dangerous.
---
Waist wallet
---
The classic daily "I know how to fix this game" post.
---
Honestly Bethesda should put it down, it would be a favor for everyone and spare you the trouble of wasting caps.
---
RIP fallout 76
---
I guess it didnt "just work"
---
&lt;3
---
Golf club used to get you to 50 in a day. Now it takes a few days but is still the best place with team mates imo
---
Only the prime receivers use ultracite ammo.  That's just an ultracite laser.
---
Trap shooting, then? Do I need to take a shotgun?
---
Ah! Gotcha. Thanks.
---
Only Prime weapons use Ultracite ammo. Ultracite Laser uses normal Fusion Cells, just like the Standard Laser. The difference between the two guns is Ultracite has a faster firing rate, but deals lower damage.
---
Oooooh....
---
/whoosh.
---
Got it.
---
Serums are my goto. 500 a piece and ive got my next 20 days of sales already crafted and just sitting in my stash. 
---
Kinda depends on where you are in the game and if running nuked zones for hours on end sounds fun to you. With my loadout for pa I can run the silo, drop the nuke and run ws in about an hour.
---
What's stadia? Sounds like a STD or it's antidote.
---
Cool, my game name is SharpbladeB feel free to add me
---
I've got an AAE handmade and I don't have to repair it every session. Weapon artisan for repairs and rank 3 gunsmith. I do have a point in lucky break and it does proc often. Where I have an issue is usually when I've done something like cleared out Harper's Ferry by myself, and someone starts scorched earth. If I run down there and do it, yeah, I'll probably need to throw a repair kit on it during the fight, but I just get those from the event itself. Plus, I run two rifles with different ammo types. Repairing was more of an issue when I was in my 40s-60s with similar weapons, and I wasn't flush with screws, springs, aluminum, etc. But once I learned all the mods for my rifles, it's not much of an issue.
---
AGREED. My poor ADV mode characters perks are screwed. Just to add started a new NW group on here. Trying to make it so us NW players have a non toxic area to vent grumbles like this. r/FO_76NuclearWinter
---
Cards make it tough. I spec to rifle and heavy normally because of where the cards are I can do both. Prime mutants ffr lmg, troubleshooters exp .50 cal, or tse gatling depending on situation. 
---
If I know stealth is out, I go commando with an executioner explosive hand made and qffr tesla.
---
Thank god for weapon weight gear.
---
 *Whoosh*
---
There's no connection between an inactive character profile and server performance. Try this: take your biggest, laggiest character into Nuclear Winter. You don't need to play Nuclear Winter, just hang out in the lobby. Open your Pip-Boy. Notice how rapid the response is. The server is only loading a fraction of a single character. This shows how Bethesda isolates characters. The server only loads in the minimum character information required, not all of the information for all of your characters.
---
He's a pay to win shill.
---
I'm not really worried about it. I've been a subscriber since the beginning, but I don't know that I ever lost anything in the scrap box. Never really paid any attention to it, I just stopped adding until they hot fixed it.
---
Oh, you're saying you want all of your SPECIAL points pooled, rather than a 15 point limit per SPECIAL?
---
Here come the other cooler variants of the ranger armor
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f445f9&amp;d=sb0s01pg2ph2pi2p01ek1c72s70a04a30ar2l71lt2lu0pp2a80e00p10s11ic2la2an2ao0eu0&amp;w=pa0p80po2p90i61if0iq0i50at1lm2a51&amp;m=c2fe5&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
I run this build and I trade some perks depending on what I am doing. I was able to beat the scorchedqueen by myself with the prime bloodied handmade and some drugs buffs but I usually run this because it covers a little of everything. Like food/water, chems, ammo (batteries included since I run a tesla gun as well)
---
&gt;  A years worth of junk gone. 
---
You can't keep a years worth of junk. Hell, you can't keep a weeks worth. 
---
Man, so many p2w shills here. Enjoy your aids game.
---
There is a power connector in some workshops. Cant remember if there is on at the airport. I do know they are at some of the workshops though
---
One of these days I'll try the heavy weapons. I've have an AAE Gatling laser collecting dust in my stash for months and months now.  Just a legacy collectors item at this point for me.
---
Go buy some serums from a player vendor for 180-220 each....Pop a grape mentat and put in the hard bargain card and sell them to vendorbots for 500 plus....get 1400 caps in 5 minutes
---
Same, I ran the vaults everyday for 2 months on novice, standard and expert on DITW only and  probably was in the 400s.  600 is insane
---
Like a backpack, but you should be able to wear both at once lol. Carry weight +500....”what all do you have in there sir”
---
You mean there is a sub that is more "Bethesda can do nothing wrong" than this one? Holy shit.
---
I have a zealots explosive Tesla I pull out when I get scared. But it is so dangerous.
---
Nice!
---
I’ve actually got 5 of those (one for community water and four on the side of my camp) how much do those sell for and to vendors or to players?
---
I'd like to see a video of this. There have been 2 indicators of God Mode: affected player is on fire constantly or affected player's body is broken (Bloody Mess style). The common factor I've seen across the board was explosive energy weapons (not exclusively lasers with burn damage) AND bloody mess.
---
Or just drop the ones that arent 100%. Except for the one you are currently draining. With power user I hardly have to look for more cores.
---
Believe it or not I found it stock in a vendor for 3k caps!
---
This.
---
It's really bizarre how they've been dealing with it. If you're launching a new subscription service, you want to make at least the first three months killer to get people hooked. If the first month is lackluster, then you're going to get a ton of drop off.
---
It really seems like their original plan was to have the skins for the ranger outfit be 500 atoms for subscribers as if that would be enough, then they got all the public outcry and had to do damage control between that and stash boxes eating materials. So, they decided to give away that one skin at the last minute and then pulled all of the future ones until they figure out what to do instead. 
---
It's stupid too, all they need to do is take some popular old items, stick a 20% off for them into the atom store section for first subscribers and call it good. Release the rest of the ranger outfit skins for free for a limited time for subscribers, then charge for them after. That way a person that subscribes for three months will get them all, but a person who subscribes for one month only gets some of them, but can buy the others if they want.
---
Yeah....this one is for real....I can carry 10 full fusion cores at 3 lbs each, 30 total or 10 fusion cores with 10% left at 3 lbs each, 30 total.....It would be fine if the less the percentage the less they weighed also...But yes, take 4 fusion cores at 25% and make one full fusion core....Nice idea!!
---
IIRC, the black box with the yellow rectangles is the main power connector (at posiedon)  It is next to the fusion core generator.  Attach a wire there, then to the fusion generator.  
---
From there, use the standard wire connectors etc to run wire to the other extractors in the area.
---
You're confused about who the troll is here, mr. 400 lost steel.
---
I've had it happen with Scorch Beasts and  been cursing and fuming then a few minutes later the SB  corpse falls out of the sky in front of me with the loot on it.
---
The workshop will have a square transformer type Box.
---
 Sometimes it's hidden sometimes it's not.
---
I believe there is a map in the power plant's control Room that shows where they all are.
---
Agreed, but I don't think Bethesda will ever give away the Scrap Box like people are asking. These guys need to start using corporate logic if they're going to convince Bethesda.
---
It doesn't matter much in most of the game; in pvp though you generally want to kill your opponent faster than he does, hence its utility.
---
76 is multi-player. You can do daily events and trade with friends. There's an extremely active market. The market is what keeps most of the everyday players playing. There's also has a very fun battle royal that's still in beta. 
---
Outer worlds has none of that and the game is pretty much dead after you complete the story.
---
What happens to the scrap box if you subscribe to Fallout 1st and then stop subscribing?
---
I was doing just that last night. It's great to have 50-60 level ups available at any time haha
---
You should have been here for the lowsodium days, it was hilariously bad.
---
If anything, I love to prove that little shit wrong
---
Lmaoooo wow
---
Um. What's a couts as transponrers dress?
---
Pretty sure I know what you mean though, and yes. It does. So does the paramedic and police uniform.
---
I have a Vampire .50 cal. with ffr and it eats everything and keeps me alive and healthy against everything but mobs of Bloated Ones at WS or, last night , the SBQ, a Mirelurk Queen and a Mirelurk Deep King at the same time.
---
I haven’t done the raids once lol
---
I've read some reviews; people are generally not happy with it, but that overheating is something new. How bad it is?
---
Also, what motivated you to buy into it?
---
I subscribed to first a couple weeks in once it was patched, so I had no problem. I did not get any free junk nor did I get an email. It sounds like they are giving them to people who subscribed in that first week when it was a problem, since they have no way to tell who actually had the problem. Which honestly, would be the only reasonable way to do it even though it may mean some people got free junk, it's better than not giving junk to people who had the problem but didn't file a ticket.
---
You're right, vault steel will probably be used. My point wasn't meant to be damning, just poking the yao guai. Was my point useless? Are any of these points useful? I thought it was funny so at least I have that. :)
---
I mean is it effective as transponder dress for the challenge?
---
They're basically batteries. Batteries don't get lighter as the lose charge. Combining them or recharging them with some nuke waste and some other ingredients at a tinker bench would be a nice option though
---
If your gonna use explosive rounds, Stick dense mod on your chest armour. I use it and don't need to use fireproof.
---
--close
---
The whole game is a spin-off so...
---
I would add Tenderizer and Suppressor under charisma, if you have Action Boy/Girl maxed out. Also I would add Tormentor lvl 2-3 under luck, works great for crowds, just vats or aim for the legs, crippling a sheepsquatch is a bonus.
---
also with  bloodied you want an unyielding set, cavalier or sentinel. you will need to start making diluted stimpacks and radaways and keep a couple diluted rad-x's, the regular ones take away your mutations for 5 minutes. If your on a team always carry some regular stimpacks to revive teammates. Go to Westek and collect some toxic goo, each one gives you 150+ rads, there will be times you will need these, trust me.
---
with a decent CHA you can get 5 per.
---
I didn't lose any scrap in the scrap box and I didn't get the "sorry we lost your scrap" package. And I don't plan on doing the raids to get the plans. So I guess I lost. :(
---
Nerd rage is powerful, 20% more damage. After you get the mods you want for your guns move a couple points to another stat of you want. Maybe first aid for more stimpak healing, power user if you use fusion cores. All in all just depends on what kind of build you are doing.
---
Do Uranium Fever and/or West Tek and pick up everything. Hobble to a vendor and sell it all with grape mentats and hard bargain perk. You can max your vendor caps pretty easy this way. Also, selling ammo or bulk junk in your camp vendor is still a reliable way to make easy caps. Legendaries can also net you a lot of caps if you get lucky and get stuff that's in demand, but it can be sort of a crapshoot if you don't camp in a highly trafficked area.
---
A lot of the problems would require loading plugins which isn't supported by this game. That's how a lot of the fallout 4 bugs were fixed.
---
Mesh and texture and hud bugs can be fixed though, and on PC many mods have fixed them.
---
There's also script extenders that have allowed people on PC to fix a few issues with the game like adding text chat and perk card presets.
---
Consoles are SOL till Bethesda adds official mod support though.
---
when the current one reaches 0 PA automatically switches to the next core and the old one disappears. Jus use them and they go away
---
Same. I didn't get anything, nor did I lose anything. I also don't need Vault Steel to win. Or a Scrap Box. Or dance emotes. Or a private world. Or fancy clothing.
---
Pretty sure they said they won't be following you around the map at all and will be only available to leave your camp for their personal quests and that sounded like the old "I'll see you there" line so sounds like they are instanced and dont even travel there with you.  Doubt we will be able to do diddly beyond changing their outfit and maybe giving them a weapon/armor set.
---
It's Responder* not transponder. Yes, any responder themed clothing counts towards the challenge. Fire Breather, Paramedic outfit w/Responder logo, Responder Police uniform. Even the super rare Fireman Uniform counts.
---
It's fine. I didn't get the "sorry we lost your scrap" package and I still feel like a winner. Does that say more about me or more about you?
---
While I would be interested in playing Cyberpunk 2077 myself, I somehow suspect that game is going to be delayed. Delays seem to be common in the industry lately, CD Projekt's other recent releases were pushed back more often than not, and they announced an exact date for CP2077 almost a year in advance. Again, as much as I would prefer being able to play the game soon, I would not bet too much on it coming in April.
---
Same with the hard copy on pc, but it sound like this guy downloaded a Microsoft store version
---
You should be alright with Gunsmith 2/3, but you will definitely feel it when shooting a lot with none. Also Forceful stock helps.
---
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
---
Then I guess I lost. I'll try to find a way to keep on living. Thanks!
---
thanks mate and sorry for my tyiping mistakes
---
I got the robot armor plans from top of the world, the run of abandoned merchant shops behind the lodges.  Took like 5 server hops, just resist the urge to pick up any other plan/recipe till you get the ones you need.  It's harder than it sounds lol.
---
Insert yo dawg meme about wanting lag with your lag...
---
I hope they add new variant of the Ranger Armor (advanced or elite) for Fallout 1st members  latest on tuesday. It would be dumb if there was no new  exclusive outfit (not skin) every month
---
Can you please point to where I in anyway shape or form alluded to such?
---
Curie with a moustache would be my top pick. Not gunna lie
---
I use both, I can literally stand on a car while it explodes and not take any damage. Helps a lot for those legendary robots that like to explode, for example.
---
2 gold and a negative kharma post. Fascinating.
---
It was already in my machine. Even in the machine the game wants to apply it instead of using the known plan. Being in the machine protects it from being scrapped, but not from being applied to the armor.
---
Right. I am going to check the atom shop to see if they are sitting in there.
---
you are pathetic
---
Yes they are first responders. Ull notice the logo on the arm of the uniform :)
---
Truly
---
I agree 100%. Every time I say this, I get down voted by the people who complained until everything in existence was nerfed.
---
Bethesda just needs to have designated Safe Spaces where these players can sit in an empty room and be safe. Nothing else. Once they're ready to walk into the post-apocalyptic Appalachia and sign a waiver stating they understand that death is everywhere, they can play the game.
---
This shouldn’t be surprising to anyone.  If you’re not paying them, you’re not worth anything to them.  You’re a second class citizen.
---
You are wrong, they are getting lighter but very little - science.
---
defense is similar, SH has a slight rad resist boost
---
the big difference that sets it apart is SH is the __only__ offensive PA.  it has a 4dmg/second aura for anything within x distance, and on hit it applies 1 stack of acid damage.  you can add multiple stacks and each stack you add just keeps ramping up the acid damage.  (similar to fo4 bleed weapons)
---
Only to protect yourself ;) haha
---
I want to see NW move to the Mire. At night time. Center it around Harper's Ferry and let us Bush Wookies have some actual jungle warfare.
---
I currently have 1500 Atoms that I got from dailies and weeklies alone. That being said, the AS offers last way too short to gather such an amount in time to get it for free.
---
Yea that’s all it takes! One person who wants to blow all their caps and sees some stuff they like.
---
I really feel like you're missing the point here. As someone who has no opinion on this game (But loved Fallout 3 and NV), you can still be upset with Bethesda and Fallout 76 AND have things go wrong in your life. 
---
Fallout is one of those franchises that people truly love. So it's understandable when people are upset at Bethesda or upset Fallout 76 didn't live up to expectations. It's okay for people to not like it just as it's okay for you to love it. However, it isn't okay for you to tell people to move on to something else. There are a lot of players out there who want this game to be as good as Fallout 3 or New Vegas, but Bethesda hasn't really shown they are interested in making this game better. 
---
My love for Fallout New Vegas isn't because it was a great game in my eyes. It was because it came out during a time when my father was really sick and my family was going through a lot. It was something that was there for me when I had a few minutes to break away from work and family stuff that gave me pure enjoyment when otherwise life wasn't going as well as I'd have like. Are there people out there who are mad just to be mad? Yes. But a vast majority of people love Fallout and want this to be a game that Bethesda can build upon in the future.
---
That’s how this region’s events are:  if you win, you win big!
---
Responders? Yes
---
Yeah! Nuclear Winter!
---
No, Reddit just isn’t that interesting in PvP in this game. So they got rid of the mode.
---
I really should make a circus haha
---
Why would I want unyielding if I’m not melee? I have a full set of bolstering armor
---
It's not just a one weapon or the other issue. It's about your entire build. Mine is Bloodied.
---
Explosive requires a 5\* and if you want to also use Nerd Rage that would be 8 points of Intelligence.
---
Or, you can use those 5 points elsewhere and just run Nerd Rage on Faster Fire. But you prob have 5 Intelligence for those 5\* cards like Gunsmith, so 3\* Nerd Rage for +20% Damage, and then two more stars for things like Batteries Included or Power User. So you can save 3 perk points by going faster fire.
---
On my Commando I run a B2525 Handmade, a B25 10mm SMG, a B2515 Laser Rifle, a B1015 Plasma Flamer, and a Q25 Handmade.
---
Most enemies get the Q25 Handmade, or the B25 10mm SMG. Large creatures get the B2525 Handmade including solo SBQ. The plasma flamer isn't faster fire, but it absolutely reks at Whitespring runs. The B2515 Laser is sort of back up, but it does good. Fires really fast tho so you reload often. Those are the main weapons I use for those purposes, but I also have a B25250 Tesla just in case. But that damn +250DR bug...
---
Long story short, perk points are more valuable than armor or weapon effects (generally) so I'd rather have 3 points to use elsewhere than running explosive guns. But I do have some in my stash still.
---
Ya no worries, I was pretty sure I knew what you meant, I just wasn't 100% and didn't want to tell you wrong.
---
Reddit is an incredibly small portion of the playerbase. They wouldn't make a huge change like that, based on Reddit. They have their own data, they saw the mode was unpopular, they removed it. Simple.
---
Sounds like you're looking for a game mode where no one has VATS and everyone has a fair chance at equal gear... Hmmm...
---
Yes your official Bethesda dildos will arrive soon.
---
Downvotes on the wat, but it was worth it 😎
---
Spin-off doesn't equate non canon
---
wow.  that is terrible! lololol!  the costume u picked was just perfect haha!
---
btw, what did u use for video editing?  looks like u were ps4?
---
Why would you run bandolier and travelling pharmacy and not Barbarian in Strength?
---
You should run Glowsights in perception instead of green thumb
---
Your endurance needs to be higher so you can use Lifegiver and/or Adamantium Skeleton 
---
You should be running Nerd Rage in Intelligence, not batteries included
---
You need to move points from agility (thru hiker/escape artist) and Charisma (go 3 points on lone wanderer) and have Class freak at max)
---
you are missing out on a ton of damage resist and HP on your current build....you can mitigate things in your build....for example, class freak will make your mutations less, so your strength may be higher and thus carry more and eliminating cards such as bandolier.....  take my suggestions for what they are worth.....I just think that you can do a lot of improvement and are missing out on some major benefits...
---
It was already confirmed that companions cannot freely travel with the player. They might have personal quests like in FO4, but otherwise generally stay at the player's camp.
---
Sold
---
You're going to have to wait until next year.
---
At most you'll get a new event for the holidays.
---
In b4 "Coming to FO1st ++ Premium for only $999.99/day!"
---
But yea, some sort of fusion core merging/recharging type of crafting option would be dope AF
---
Drop it in a bag next to you, mod the gear, pick it up. Or hand it to a friend.
---
Thanks! I’ll make sure to do that! &lt;3

For an extra 5 dollars a month, a Bethesday employee will come to your house and spit in your face directly.
---
I dig it too.  What's the song?
---
theres usually one w/ the group at abandoned bogtown
---
Unyielding does provide a perception stat boost
---
That is exactly what I do. But I shouldn't have to do that.
---
It sucked because as he said, PvErs sucked and kept dying while getting those weapons, but instead of ignoring the people that were only in it for the reward, oppose to the part that frequently played survival mode, essentially making, I believe the term would be, the worst of both worlds? The mode was terrible, because they nerfed stuff that people who don’t PvP said were OP, cause they couldn’t use an all rise and excavator and they lost 3k lbs of shit, because they they don’t know what a stashbox is.
---
Yep, I got the same haul from that event once. Was super confused, but it didn't stop me from raking in the caps on the rare gear in my vendor \*shrug\*
---
Haha thanks! I kept a Camp on this character for months, so it was nice using her again :) I just use iMovie, it’s mediocre but does the job. The audio tools work surprisingly well
---
damn nightkin!
---
Remember how bad  New Vegas was on ps4 at launch? 
---
Imagine Bethesda's D team trying to port this mess to a brand new system.  I wonder if they've even figured out the dev kit for it yet?
---
I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
It's all about DPS and nothing else. If you feel its too ammo costly for most of the game, likely a lot of people do. But its only DPS and cost of use isn't factored.
---
Didn't receive compensation. I also wasn't a Day 1 purchaser.
---
&gt;frightening to have a sheepsquatch come drilling
---
Truth!
---
That is a dumb take, PVE players did not join survival servers.  There are tons of hardcore PVP games on the market, go play one.  This fan base is clearly overall not very interested in that mode.
---
Got the exact same haul from either Fly Swatter or Battle Bot the other day.
---
A full set will boost everything by 15 points, except endurance. plus, plus.
---
KHAAAAANNNNN!
---
NO. If you are thinking about failing no nut november, don't. I believe in you. You must stand strong and push through. Think about how good you will feel on December 1st after you completed the challenge, think about how embarassing it will be when you tell your friends that you failed NNN. You must stay strong, I believe in you. Now, good luck on your mission, soldier. ^(I am a bot, and this action was preformed automatically.)
---
give me that on a t-shirt, that's metal as hell!
---
Shouldn't say that to out pals in the UK lol
---
I wish they would give us a text chat. I don't have a mic and I don't want to use one. I also find it difficult to hear what people are saying in game.
---
20% exp gets the pve idiots a boner
---
Miracles.
---
happy cake day!
---
yeh -- i love/hate it when u kill the supermutant wielding the minigun only to have the next brute run over and "equip" it
---
Transponder.....
---
It’s Blind Willie Johnson - God Moves on the Water
---
Yeah its brilliant if you rely on a VATS build
---
The only thing I change when I'm in like a battle it's Nerd Rage but I usually run both, I changed the perk cards because I posted the wrong one. And idk it's been working for me and haven't die in a long time. Full set of unyielding marine armor 3\* and 120 extra carry with my backpack it's working great I have have a shit ton of ammo like 20k 5.56 and 20k ultracite 5.56. I could probably improve but I'm ok with this build. Thanks for your observations tho :)
---
I thought about it last night. Had something like 7 or 8 with different loads. Then I used my PA for an hour and suddenly it wasn't an issue anymore... XD
---
Honestly I just feel bad for you guys. Bethesda has been a company leeching off modders for decades to keep their half made games alive. Now that they put on their big boy pants, everyone is surprised that one very old rich dude is a criminal that just wants more money. And believes his customers are total morons with too much money.
---
"... they are ill-tempered, sir..."
---
No, you lose 180-220 caps per serum cause that's what you paid for it so it's more like 800 caps profit.  Only way selling serums is really profitable is if you make them yourself with your own mats.
---
Sometimes. In power armor.
---
Heavy Weapons have been glitched for months. Sometimes they expel properly, sometimes you reload and you're left with cores with 1-10 charge left in them.
---
First of all ever since they put the world wide match making finding a match doesn't take 15 minutes,  if you alone  juts disconnected it could possibly be ur internet connection
---
*boo hoo my virtual base getting destroyed is the hardest thing that's happened to me all year. this game hurts my feelings*
---
I understand that a functional Chinese stealth suit would be a bit game breakingly OP, but why not a cosmetic version? I miss my Chinese stealth suit
---
I always love the confidence of an idiot.
---
It does not.  Unfortunately.
---
It lasts longer I’m not sure by how much
---
Cook all the meat you pick up.  Glowing steaks for example are worth 10-11 caps each.  If you run say uranium fever and pop in Super Duper before you cook you will come away with around 50 steaks or 500ish caps for just running a single event.  Sell all the mole miners guns from this event too and you will easily hit your daily cap or be damned near close to it.
---
Mssg me on xbox:soprano 307
---
It's more like $12 if you're going month-to-month...?
---
No i can't see 500 lbs fitting in that small thing lol
---
Lol, no one ever said that. You just came in here crying about not being able to bother people. What a fucking baby....
---
all 9 pts of Commando, Tank Killer, Concentrated Fire.
---
Fireproof
---
Tenderizer
---
Nerd Rage, Demo Expert
---
Mr Sandman, Covert Ops, Escape Artist, Gun FU.  Some people like Adrenaline too
---
Bloody Mess
---
These are your must have perks.  Use what you have left over for defensive stuff.
---
Do you happen to know which ones are the easiest to get materials for?
---
I just reached the point where I can do nuke zone comfortably.
---
If you think the "only" bad thing about this game is the community, then I don't even know what to say.
---
Not enough time, money &amp; care was put into the game. Might also be that they lack the skills &amp; experience within their team to fix it. I imagine that it's a very complex problem to solve.
---
100% unagreed .... bring back survival mode ... that's what we should ask
---
To Start off if you go to Morgantown Airport you can get the Small Backpack.
---
Next read a Scout Poster at a Train Station to start you on the Scout quest. To progress you will need to do a few things - Complete Two events, Stings and Things and Operation Tidy. Revive a player. And complete 3 Tadpole badges. (Athletics, Archery are pretty easy. Mammalogist and Code Breaker can be done fairly quickly as well depending on your level and experience). After doing all those things you will become a Possum Scout and unlock the full Backpack. This Backpack will allow for Mods and Skins (Unlike the Small Backpack). If you complete Possum Badges those badges can be used to buy Backpack Mods. The two quests you did as a tadpole, Stings and Things and Operation Tidy, can be repeated daily and can reward Possum badges. There is also a Global Event Camp Fire Tales which also can reward Possum Badges. Badges from events are fairly rare though and still up to RNG.
---
The Level 50 Standard backpack add +60 Carry Weight. High Capacity Mod (Cost 8 Badges) adds +120 Carry Weight but lowers your Radiation Resistance and Energy Resistance by -60. That means you take twice as much radiation from sources and take double damage from energy weapons. I recommend the Armor Plated Mod It gives +30 carry weight but adds +90 Damage Resistance.
---
maybe
---
Err....
---
I think you must take into account ALL characters data stored, not for each character.
---
Delete half of ALL FO76 characters and the data storage will operate faster. That's what I meant.
---
Agreed. Heavy weapons dont always auto reload for me. I hate having to jump around for half a minute while reloading, only to have a partial core with 45 shots left on it get loaded in..
---
Do you have a video of this?
---
I used Experian credit reporting for a while, and it was a monthly subscription. Wouldn't hear/email from them all month, and then the day before I was charged again I would get an email "a change to your credit was reported". It was always just a point up or down, but the focus of the company was always to make it seem essential right around charging time. Bethesda will more than likely incorporate a similar strategy. People stop paying if they don't see the immediate benefit.
---
Its really just what extra mats you have to burn. I normally mass craft marsupial. But you can get 20+ violet fulx for bird bones in the cranberry bog too
---
Try saying that to a british woman
---
Funny how you accuse me of things I've never said. Go play animal crossing if the fake wasteland scares you. You're probably one of those people who log when someone walks in their camp.
---
Did it drop a 1star?
---
FISTO would like to speak with you
---
I mean, no, but it happens so frequently it would be pretty easy to obtain one and I *have* to assume I'm not the only one who notices this.
---
First of all dont first of all me.
---
Secondly, my internet connect is strong and stable. It must be the world wide matching then. Yes, it used to take me a very very long time to connect to a match so I quit trying.
---
thats what i was thinking!
---
Ups? What ups?
---
Arw you aiming down the sights or hip firing? If you are hip firing how many mods that effect hip fire do you have on?
---
There are also locations with power boxes that you can connect to your camp for power. The easiest I Can remember is south of sunshine meadows food factory across the bridge.
---
Yep, its a legit strategy
---

---
Really though, I change out some of the luck and agility perks depending on what I'm doing. Sometimes in agility I'll swap the 3 points for Action Boy and Marathoner for 3\* Covert Op. And in luck I swap around the 4 one star cards with various cards of varying stars lol but when you're level 150+ you start making 1\* 2\* and 3\* versions of perks to swap around.
---
Their data is Reddit. It became unpopular because of Reddit, Reddit suggested all of the nerfs, Reddit suggested they remove the mode. The nerfs killed the mode, and if you don’t think that, let me provide you with the types of people who played survival.
---
Griefers: The entire mode was developed, purely for griefers, you could destroy bases, kill people, harass them. It was great for these players. Then, I believe it was the last survival mode update, ruined that, by making it so you couldn’t destroy bases. You also couldn’t kill turrets and all the damage nerfs ruined the actual PvP element. This caused them to move to adventure
---
PvPers: When I say that, I mean the people who wanted a fair duel between two or more people. This mode wasn’t designed to be played that way, however it could. So, with this play style, you’d usually get someone using vats or stealthboys, which somehow piss these guys off extremely bad, causing them to quit the mode.
---
Role-players: This is the most uncommon play style for the mode, however it was there. It created actual content, and since they only needed the “kill people” aspect of the mode, they tried to stay with it to the end. These people quit the game after the deletion of survival.
---
PvErs: These are the people who specialize on killing ghouls and farming ammo. Ofc they despise this mode, for the extreme cap and aid loss. This play style is boring as fuck and you completely ignore all player interaction and only get the legendary weapons. These people could care less for survival, but they don’t think that PvP is fair since they cannot kill everyone with an All Rise and Excavator. These people would go to survival, solely to get the legendary weapons, then leave. The play style is incredibly popular for its ability to be easy as fuck to create. When survival mode went down these players did what they always did, and went to cry on Reddit, because they couldn’t get their weekly scrip.
---
I hope you can see how mentally brain dead Bethesda is for listening to the last group of people for info on how to fix the mode they play solely for the reward, oppose to actual fun.
---
I have something like this happen every so often. I mark it up to lag, sometimes on my end, or sometimes when there's a big event going on somewhere on the map. Looks like everything is going smoothly, but only one in three shots connecting.
---
Nothing else has worked. Lets try this.
---
Amen brother.  I will never buy another game or piece of merch from them if this game doesn't come out of beta with wastelanders lol (even though 1 person is a grain of sand but hey, this grain put a lot of money into them)
---
I get the frustration but imagine going to someones shop finding the one item/plan/legendary you have been scouring for and not being able to buy it because the seller is max caps. How if that fair to the patrons? They have no control over that.
---
"so you keep your pants on"
---
This explains why I keep getting kicked out of parks.
---
Have my favorite clip on my Xbox of a scorched doing the "Thriller", hands in the air stuck and rotating back and forth.
---
*"It's close to midnight, and something evil's lurking in the dark..."*
---
There is one of those hats on a pedestal in the shop in Berkley Springs next to the Red Rocket but it can't be taken.
---
I don't use lone wanderer or any DR perks. Wearing Marine or Combat armor should get your resistances past 250. A combination of leather and raider armor can also do it. After 250 it's diminishing returns on the resistance.
---
Eh. It's easier and cheaper to just buy the year. I'd the game has continued to get better after reboot ala No Man's Sky or Destiny 2 or even ESO than probably. 
---
I would usually buy one of the atom packs per month, this gives me that and along with it no more being overweight due to carrying junk since the weight reduction perks didn't affect stash and my options were running around everywhere capable of losing all the junk collected for a month or dump a bunch of legendaries or spend entire game encumbered, this fixed that, gave me a second camp free travel and for me personally the best addition was the private world. 
---
If I want to sell things I hop on public but otherwise it means the only people I'm likely to see in game are the people I know or have interacted with. This completely gets rid of the random troll asshole factor and I'm able to do whatever I want to in the open world without having to worry about all the good farms being picked over or unexpected issues. 
---
🤷‍♂️ That may not hold value to others but for me, seemed like a pretty good and reasonable deal.
---
Ohh dark blue with the witch mask...
---
Yes on PC in the UK
---
That coupled with different paints for armor sets would be so cool!
---
While it won't help console folks, there is a mod for it for those who prefer their outfits clean on PC called Invisible Backpacks.
---
&gt;calling people crybabies for complaining whilst complaining
---
No worries! haha the government aid box has stalked me a few times in the past but it resolved itself somehow! So annoying! I DO also still love the game...
---
I use bolstering on my bloodied commando
---
I've experienced the exact same problem. It's no where in the atom shop, workbenches or anything but the store says downloaded/purchased. Put in a support ticket but haven't heard anything back.
---
Is the Whitespring jumpsuit rare? I see it in every single vending machine, price range from 3k to 25k. I mean if everyone has it, likely more than one, why is it rare and expensive? 🤔
---
I will not be renewing. It became painfully obvious playing on my private server that the game is mired in mediocrity at this stage. The game is boring. I assumed being free of the ingrates would somehow reenergize the game, but it didn't. All the server did was amplify the lonely boredom of the game. Sure, you complete events alone, but it's the same garbage rolling pins and wood armor. Sure, you can loot to your heart's content,  but finding any rare loot is still impossible. Grinding the same boring locations for one star legendary drops is not incentive for 12.95. Having the same recurring bugs over and over, is not worth 12.95. Maybe Wastelanders inspires a membership renewal, but for now it's back to Adventure, if at all.
---
Oh, I agree with you there...just saying the fastest way for me to get the 1400 caps done for the day... I am am max caps or close on 4 characters so usually just want to go grab them and be done....Also, run Uranium Fever and go grossly overweight back to WS Station and sell all the weapons...that takes about 20 minutes including the event.....
---
Fantastically done! Nice that you have some buddies willing to help you out with the pic. 😋
---
It slows down the degradation of your weapons. If I leave it off, I find myself repairing my weapons more frequently, I'd say yes worth it just for that.
---
The number of people who dismiss the criticism and complaints is astonishing.
---
Clearly not that many or Survival mode would have survived.
---
Get plans for Marine Helmet, Civil War Coat or Civil War Hat.
---
- craft with Super Duper
---
- sell all vendors (with Hard Bargain + beer)
---
Marine Helmet 25-32 caps
---
Civil War Coat 15-20 caps
---
Civil War Hat 10-12 caps
---
Crafting serums is faster (sell for 400-500 caps each) but you gave to save up for a recipe
---
It was more rare then it is now, the Halloween event handed out alot of rare outfits
---
Most of it can be crafted from the armor bench under outfits or the stuff that act as skins for leather armor weapons etc. 
---
Which specific piece are you not being able to access?
---

---
Okay, gave Ricochet a try (level 3) and I'm impressed at how often it procs! Very nice perk indeed.
---
Thank you for the input on this, I'll be rebalancing a couple of other toons to use this as well.
---
This is so cute. I love that sort of companionship &lt;3 hearts been warmed. 
---
I like the moments like that. 
---
I actually was in Whitespring and I was looting a Little guard post when about 8 much higher level Mutants went out and started killing all the guards. Four of them literary surrounded me in the guard post but I punched and used my double barrel to take em all down. Three were already killed by the guards who eventually failed entirely. And the last one tried running away. I went after him and made him learn his lesson.
---
U wot?
---
Sentinel does work in sneak. It also works as long as you don't move laterally; you can jump all you want. I always take my thumb of the movement analog stick and just jump up and down, VATSing other players. Works pretty well.
---
VATS crits negate it, simply targeting the head does not.
---
You most certainly can, especially if you use mules.
---
Hit vendor cap thru either bulk mass quantities of scrap (if you have some to get rid of) or more expensive crafts that sell better. 
---
Create a vending machine at your camp and sell at low prices. For instance if you made a salvage run of a place with a lot of lead or meds, just sell it for cheap in your vending. This can boost your caps beyond your vendor limit if you are willing to let go of useful stuff at low prices.
---
I personally save up bulk scrap to sell on weekdays when i cannot play the game, my character is too low level for serum crafting and I do not have high value loot. Also I buy other peoples junk because I do not always find enough to hit the cap limit (and even if I do on a weekend, I always run out of everything to sell by Tuesday so far).
---
I only had a few people sell to me because I am so cheap and most hoard their stash, but I think across my two characters I ran I bought about 2000-3000 caps worth from folks. The meds and some of my junk sell at my vendor, I bulked the rest (or use up a bundle of 38 I convinced someone to sell on my scavenge runs) and generate overall about 4000 caps, supplied my runs thru some low level areas, and built a small camp up.
---
If you have large amount of supplies watch market76 forum and if you have the quantities you can make large deals for caps at a time.
---
There is probably too much difference by now between the two branches of the game ("legacy" and overhaul), it would be a duplication of effort to implement the same fixes in both. It would not be impossible, obviously, but it would be resources taken from the more important update, so I expect only minor fixes for the next few months.
---
Yeah, that makes sense, never really looked at it that way....  I guess I was thinking that the fusion materials would dissipate over time and get lighter
---
I've got a party of three ready to do if you're on rn
---
I received that once early on before I knew they were rare and sold it all super cheap.  Oh well.
---
Oh i see, thanks
---
And if you actually read anything you'd know they CAN'T tell who lost what or who lost anything at all.  So their option here was either to give everyone a bit of everything or give no one anything.
---
Unyielding is far more efficient for sneaking, vats and strength 
---
Also, unyielding will provide 12-15 additional INT - which is a bonus 25-30% XP
---
Ya I saw the build radius feature in action, I like it.
---
That's not how Bethesda's system works. 
---
Fallout 76 doesn't use one single server. Everything is compartmentalized. When you load your character into a game server, the information for THAT character is likely pulled in from a separate data storage system and loaded into the specific game server that you are using. Deleting character profiles on a separate data storage system wouldn't improve game performance.
---
Agreed
---
*Lady pointing and yelling* "Toxic ass pve players!"
---
*Confused cat at table, building CAMPS, and planting tatos* "?"
---
I highly recommend carnivore for food needs. Kill a glowing enemy and the glowing meat gives 40% food. I really only get food necessary to increase my melee damage. Otherwise just kill something that drops meat and eat.
---
I think the one thing we can all agree on is that for the most part the community is pretty awesome.
---
Bethesda has stated before that you can withdraw from the Scrapbox if you cancel you subscription, but you can not deposit. Most games that I have played that allow an increased inventory with subscription work the same way. You are able to withdraw but you can not deposit.
---
Just saw this in the  76settlements subreddit — I absolutely love it! So creative!
---
You keep the scrap but can't add anything to it or your stash until you're back below weight again. So if you're doing this to consolidate all your mules to one account that does all your crafting that could work but you'd be locked in at that point.
---
They don't get shit "for free" because they still have to get the actual plans.  Do you think everyone out there has a full set of plans from raiding just sitting around so they can start pushing out armor?  I'm more willing to wager that the VAST majority of players looked at the shit show the raid is week one and never looked back.  This steel is going to be sitting in peoples scrap boxes gathering rust.
---
OP had a stroke while typing.
---
That is dumb. Critical hits exist to counter tanky builds and assassins/sentinel builds. You also make it impossible for pistols to kill said set users. Pistols cannot stagger, they have shit damage; their only redeeming quality is low AP cost and thus critical hit spam.
---
Removing vats only makes duped legacy weapons viable. Thanks to vats, I can actually stand toe to toe with these kinds of PVPers.
---
Really good job! You even have the cheshire cat
---
 Have that tattooed on my drones 'we're all mad here'.
---
Quick charger coming to the atom store? 🤩
---
Yes!! They definitely helped make this, and patiently waited for daylight in the game :)
---
No problem...I am really in to the builds and like to try and help if I find something that works well for me that people may not know about...I really think the higher class freak would help if you are mutated....for example if you have Eagle Eyes (-4 str) and using card 1 you still have -3 str....if you use card 3 then it is -1 str....that is a net of 2 str multiplied by each unyielding armor piece.....that can increase your carry weight quite a bit, making a lower level of bandolier possible and moving that point.....again, just trying to help out...
---
Don’t joke, you know they will do it. You heard it here first folks
---
Thanks so much!! Someone suggested I post it here also, so here it is.
---
But you are not profiting 1400 caps when you spend 4-600 for the serums.
---
I can confirm with First your camp does not take precedence in anyway. I have not been able to place my camp in the admittedly crowded area around flatwoods a few times.
---
I found out that people who pvp other players gain roughly 40000 caps. I'm a female who just started gaming to bond with my husband and it ruins the game for me when some jerk comes to kill me when I'm just trying to play the game. NW is for pvp, but I feel like Bethesda's promotes these jerks. They dont even become wanted in some of these situations. This group ganged up on us for a workshop we were done with and about to leave but they started shooting us. I was getting ready to launch my first nuke. When I was in the bunker about to launch my nuke that same asshole showed up and made my experience launching my first nuke not what it could have been. This kind of deal makes me and a lot of other players not play this game. It seems pathetic to me if you go around destroying camps, even while someone's building it to boot and that's what is fun for you. I am just not wired that way. If you're level 400 or whatever, I dont get it if you're bored PLAY A DIFFERENT GAME or perhaps do something else with this life that provides multitudes of activities. I find that helping lower level guys is more fun personally or meeting people who also just want to play the game. Just because it's a game and you think you can act like however you want- wow, that's an atrocious sense of evil seething out and I think someone needs therapy. If you get joy out of ruining someone's experience, plain and simple, fcck off and go get help.
---
Bethesda's needs to stop promoting this behavior.
---
cap limits would gonaway if there was something meaningful to use them on - like 1000 caps -&gt; 1 atom
---
Haha, those are some good peeps you have. 👍
---
Combat medic build is trash. The boost your giving compared to the low damage your dealing out is not worth it
---
&gt;had a stroke while typing.
---
LOL, sorry mate :D
---
see other response...was just my way of getting the 1400 from vendor easily
---
I just discard the lower charge ones - but I also don't use the gatling laser where I go through them that frequently, I really only use it for Power Armor.
---
*Surrounded by a field of tatos and razorgrain, a brahmin, a red barn, hay bales, while sitting in a rocking chair wearing farmhand clothes and a prospectors hat* "I'm going to disagree with you"
---
Honestly, it makes me want to switch to the .50 cal machine gun. Just have to deal with it I suppose!
---
wabi sabi amigo!
---
a medics shotgun build is probably the closest thing i have seen that would probably hit the results you desire.  its damage and heals are virtually all from crit chaining though.
---
Survival was very popular then they started nerfing it patch after patch until everyone left. A lot of us enjoy pvp because the only threat in this game are other players, not super mutants.
---
It does it with melee too. You can be right next to them aiming right at them with a two handed and miss
---
If you honestly think Bethesda removed an entire game mode, because of Reddit, then this conversation is over. Have a nice day.
---
I don't think it has an effect on sneak, one of those myths. I have full sets of Marine Bolstering and Unyielding. I don't wear the Unyielding now because 5 Bolstering pieces makes me basically invincible. Also have a set of Bolstering Scout that I'm testing against the Marine. 
---
You are right though about the intelligence netting more xp
---
I thought the Forest Scout mask was removed from the game??  If it is back then there will be some pissed off people...I had 2 on my alt character from early on and sold them for 15k and 20k......  People were buying them up because they were super rare...
---
I said it’s coming months ago, still just cosmetics  🤮
---
It would be fun to be able to use a Fatman again without everyone being able to walk away from a small thermonuclear detonation like they are a T-800.
---
You should be able to make dense mod then. Switch it with lighter build mod or some other learned mod and have a dense mod in your inventory
---
Looks an awful lot like the captains hat available at White Spring, but prob slightly different (right?)
---
Funny how you accuse me of things I’ve never done... and see no reason to do, lol. Like, who the fuck does that?
---
Go play an actual PvP game if you want to fight. Stop bitching and crying because people like something different. Fallout 76, a game about people emerging from a vault to rebuild society doesn’t let you ruin things?? Awwwwwwwww, I’m sorryyyyyyyy! Ask your mom to cook you a nice chocolate chicken pot pie and get over it.

After a trip to Universal Studios carrying a backpack everywhere and trying to shove it into the small ass lockers there- I decided to take a risk- I’m wearing a MFIng Fanny Pack next time.

BEST DECISION EVER- it held everything I needed, I didn’t have to carry other people’s shit, it could fit into lockers(I didn’t have to use lockers on some rides).
---
Yea but at least you would know who has it so you could locate it I guess. Or maybe  it could gray out or not show any items that would exceed the owners cap limit.  Idk but they need to do something. Someone else had a good idea about a n overflow ability of 5k. I like that idea.
---
I hate Preston.
---
Depending on your penchant for PVP, you could also try taking one of the Power Plants - you get 3 cores at 100% power each.
---
That’s what I’ve been talking about. I’m not buying atoms until they fix this. Complete waste of time.
---
Can I wear mine in front? Can I call it a tummy pack?
---
The community **is** the game.  
---
The ironic part is that the community has become so deeply invested in saving society, that we're now actively trying to save the game from the producers of the very game we're trying to play.
---
This is the absolute catch-22 of the fallout 76 community. We love it because we need to save it. Reclamation day is attempting to reclaim what it could be from what it is, and that's every day we play.
---
Yea that’s definitely true. I try to go out and buy something every few days but I have so many weapons already it’s nuts. And the real god tier shit isn’t sold for caps either way. They also need to make some sort of trade option to prevent people from getting ripped off. Idk what they could do but I don’t trust anyone that’s not on reddit with a good karma rating in the trading sub!
---
lol x lol = hella downvotes
---
Wouldn't bolstering (higher DR with lower health) and Vanguard (higher DR with higher health) work against each other?  Maybe have all Vanguard would improve the total DR?
---
I am a sucker for founder packages. Plus it was Google, and I have no issues playing games with my Steam Link. Finally, being able to easily carry just the Chromecast with me anywhere seemed like a dream come true.
---
Imagine playing games anywhere while traveling without the need for physical games or a heavy console! I like the Switch, but I wanted games like Destiny 2, Borderlands 3, and Diablo 4 on the go. The Switch isn't exactly ideal for those.
---
I thought it would be at least as good as my Steam Link. I was wrong.
---
As for the overheating, it is bad enough to where it just shuts down.
---
I can be playing something and then nothing, like someone just hit the power button on a console.
---
It is pretty annoying.
---
That was an either/or, not running both at the same time.
---
Can you add me?
---
Can't access any of the pack. Not the power armor skins, laser weapon skins, or the uncle sam looking clothing in the armor workbench, it's just not there. It's also not showing up in the atom shop under purchased items like rest of my gear. I've hard restarted, logged in and out and its just missing.
---
Got ya...make sense...thought you had a mixed bag...LOL
---
I experience it, but infrequently - been trying to figure out what conditions exist that cause it to happen.
---
They could easily do it with those who sent in tickets about it, instead of everyone. LOL
---
Seems to work every time since I started just clicking the destination and hit enter twice
---
There's a problem with rotating maps that doesn't have an easy solution. While players like you and I run with hardcore death squads and don't need to adjust our builds based on environments, that isn't true for many NW players.
---
For example, let's say that Player X, a stealthy bush camper, loves to perch himself on the highest cliff on the Morgantown map and snipe down at all of the peasants beneath him. If someone ever gets the drop on him, he can simply jump off the cliff. He might have Master Rifleman, Goat Legs, and other long-range sniper perks.
---
Now throw in rotating maps. That build would be much less effective in Flatwoods. Goat legs only really helps in 2 areas of the map: the bridge, which is highly coveted and definitely a death trap for someone like Player X, and a cliffside by the Flatwoods Lookout. Additionally, the Flatwoods map isn't all that great for a sniper. The sight lines are limited, as are safe "high ground" perches. Player X would need to completely change his build depending on the map. Changing your build on the fly in NW isn't usually practical. Depending on your SPECIAL points, you might even need to use different characters for each map. There's no way to switch characters on the fly either.
---
As it stands right now, rotating maps aren't practical. Bethesda would need to implement some major changes first. I do fully support the idea of rotating maps, but there are some problems that need to be solved first.
---
This and the unable to respawn anywhere if you die at the end of an event are my top two bugs that drive me nuts.
---
I honestly thought about buying one the other day.  They were cool when I was a kid, but now I just kinda want a pouch to store my every day work shit in.  :P
---
No it doesn't, did you even read it correctly? They are giving it to every fo1st member who had membership during the gltich. You must not have had it during the cut off of before the oct 25th.
---
This is amazing, well done
---
Single player content that is actually feasible for one person, the vault raids as they are, are boring and tedious as a single player
---
When you equip Junkies weapon the buff applies to all weapons
---
It's in the atom shop. You don't even need the extra Tricentennial Download. I recently wiped out all of my expansion downloads, deleted my games several times, completely formatted my Xbox, switched to a new Xbox, and anything else that might screw up my Tricentennial, Elder Battlecoat, and  Pint-sized Slasher purchases. The last 2 don't even have a download option anymore, but all of them show up in the Atom Shop anyway.
---
Most of the time my Junkie's weapons don't show the boosted damage, occasionally they do.
---
You guys down vote him but I've tried a charisma built team focused build and hes right theres no place in the current game state for anything other than dps
---
Everyone either has enough survivability built on their own or is purposefully running a 10-20% health build(go ahead and equip radsponge and see how quick they kick you) and they have all the support they need either worked into their build or in the form of chems they carry around 
---
Tenderizer and suppressor are worthless when most people one shot everything in the game and builds are soloing sbq in 2-3minutes
---
Stimpak diffuser looks amazing...except again people either run a bloodied built or have enough stims they dont need you
---
You'll do the group 100x more support by running an optimized dps build with it's own chems/survivability
---
Dont forget adrenaline, tormentor, tenderizer, gun fu, and tank killer
---
The secondary code package isn't necessary. After unlocking once, it's all tied to your account via the Atom Shop.
---
There is “no point” to pvp in this game for many reasons, but stealth boys are just the tip of the iceberg.
---
- Stealth boys are required because VATS is enabled in pvp, which means farming for copious amounts of a rare item is the only way to pvp  VATS really should not work at all in pvp, it’s literally an aimbot.
---
- Perk card balance is screwed up. A SPECIAL build with roughly equal amounts of each stat gets you access to all the defensive perks and offensive perks you need. There’s no benefit to building for a specific playstyle around 2-3 SPECIALs with pros and cons. You get % modifiers to dealing damage, but only flat DR/ER upgrades to reduce damage, sabe for Fireproof, Blocker and Adamantium Skeleton which render many builds and weapons useless. This is why TTK is sooooo low when it should be more similar to how it is in Nuclear Winter.
---
- Weapon balance is screwed up. Legacies, only Bloodied Junkies and Anti-armor being useful (leads to high prices and duping), Commando being required for the staggers and to maximize DPS due to 110 damage cap, every other weapon being utterly useless.
---
- Armor balance is screwed up. Power Armor is trash tier when body armor and a hybrid special build let’s you get MORE DR/ER and legendary benefits on top of it, too much armor penetration from perks anyway, assassin’s is too strong, sentinel should only work standing STILL not jumping in place, unyielding gives you way too many SPECIAL stats and is the primary reason Bloodied pve and pvp builds are overpowered, Strangler Heart effect is overpowered as it bypasses armor and is high damage (and crashes games).
---
Survival was great because you actually felt scared to move around the post-apocalyptic wasteland. It was underwhelming because instead of being a survival horror game mode it was often, but not always, a griefer’s deathmatch. if they could bring that sense of fear and dread with the above balance fixes, the game’s pvp could be absolutely amazing.
---
Bought 1st on the day it launched, didn't lose any scrap (saw the bug reports and was careful to do other things so I was less likely to lose it).
---
No email, checked on all three characters and found no free steel or anything else. I didn't log any tickets since I didn't lose anything.
---
Fine with me, means it's not going to everyone, I assume they either prioritized those that logged a ticket or ran a script to see who was affected.
---
Agreed, shame the F4's core dump is not a thing anymore, that would be a fun way of disposing the near exhausted ones
---
Last one really made me laugh. Nice ideas!
---
What platform are you on? Can you explain exactly what happened leading up to this?
---
Ok. I will check that when I get home. Thanks!
---
They're a rare drop from Enclave events. I think they used to just sell them at Modus so making it rare drop only is what made them valuable.
---
Really? I had not noticed this before. Will need to double check my numbers when I'm back in game again. Thanks for the heads up!
---
How many roleplayers seriously want to roleplay over a mic?
---
I usually have 5 to 10 Nukashines in my vending machines.  I sell so much of it, that I make it a point to whip some up whenever I logon.
---
Hmmmm. Keep me posted and I will do the same. How do we tag the community managers??
---
Lol who you coming at like that ? Just bcuz I don’t know about a random country doesn’t mean I game to much are you serious ?🤣
---
Interesting... The Gatling Plasma was the only one that caught my attention, but I'll need to have a closer look at my hoard of Junkie stuff and compare it to the regular versions again. I'm on PS4, so not sure if there is any platform influence as to whether it's an issue or not.
---
Came across a post by MidRoad a little while ago
---
“Discussion of vangaurds vs -15% damage legendary armor” (sorry don’t know how to post a link).  It made me rethink the benefits of Vanguards and Bolstering.
---
Recommend highly to read through.
---
Thank you for the heads up! We've shared this.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Take your upvote.

Nerd rage requires a kind of bloodied build, right?
---
Use almost empty ones to make ultracite fusion cores and sell. For me only when have lots of stable fluxes, which is often lol. They work in PA too...
---
Amazing work.  There is a Bioshock Infinite meets Fallout vibe.
---
Sorry to hear about that :(, we have a fix implemented for disappearing bodies [coming soon](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1KMNMgbLCfaHQVKby5zqVx/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-november-updates).
---
Awesome job!
---
Wow!! Super lucky drops there! Good job!
---
That's interesting, so everything else wasn't worth it for you?
---
I've had a Behemoth spawn on the east side of Bog Town twice in 3 months, though I also don't visit there too often.
---
I really think they get that there's something at the foundation of the game itself not working. I don't want to be one of the wastlanders cheerleaders, but I think delaying it and saying that it's going to include major fixes is good news.
---
You hit enter twice right away or only if the 1st enter doesnt register?
---
Xbox, was in game and pressed the purchase atoms button to see if they had the bundles where you get clothing and atoms for a discount, haven't had a new one since summer but I still check. Saw the Tricentenial pack was 40% percent off, so I purchased it. Closed out the game, as I have to close out about once an hour or it crashes to main Xbox screen anyways. Got back into the game and it wasnt in the atom store purchased section, which I thought was weird, but I'm no stranger to bugs in here, so I shrugged it off. Then I try to apply a skin to my laser weapon, but its not there. Try to build the uncle sam head at armor workbench not there. I go back to Microsoft store, and it says it was purchased. Go to F076 data storage on HD and it says it was downloaded. Ive hard restarted, logged in and out, I dont know what else to do
---
I'm not sure how common that bug is.  I'm guessing your playing on PC or Xbox?  I haven't had the issue come up once on PS4.
---
I used a level 5 Somerset special, level 10 instigating bolt action rifle, then a handmade at 25.. probably not the best, but unless you encounter a sheepsquatch then you should be able to kill it
---
If you are on PC it seems to be a UI bug. If I hit enter to confirm it works almost all the time. Then you might get the other bug of fast traveling to a random spot instead of where you clicked lol.
---
Right away, it always has that confirmation popup unless you're going somewhere that costs 0 caps
---
&gt; been working on some bugs for months. No need to hold off on fixing them till Wastelanders.
---
I think the idea is to make sure when those fixes are released they are fully integrated and tested with wastelanders...from a resourcing stand point, it makes sense. They'll have them as a base testing cycle and regression tests. To individually release them now its double the testing cycles
---
Lol first time I saw a "Slider" in game it was a pair of scorched doing it, sliding on their knees with their hands in the air, both of them holding death tambos.  Only thing I could think of is those 80s rock videos where the guitarist slides across the stage and plays his guitar aggressively at the camera and couldnt stop laughing at the thought of doing that with a tambourine.
---
On an unrelated note by phone vehemently refuses to type in the word tambos and keeps replacing it with tampons and now I not only want to know how much damage a death tampon does but if it is available with legendary prefixes...
---
I’ve never seen on Xbox eithwr
---
Take my money
---
Nope - I had 1st since the day it launched - literally bought it within the first hour. I had no issues with the scrap box and didn't file a ticket, and I have NOT received any freebies.
---
Which is fine with me - I lost nothing, I don't deserve compensation.
---
I found it. The thing is, he's not actually comparing bolstering. But anyway, my DR is like 575 and my ER is about 500 (don't remember exact rn) and in my actually walking around the map killing things tests I found that the bolstering was better than unyielding on my commando. Vanguard is, um, lame lol. If you take a tiny amount of damage the bouns is greatly reduced. Now, full sentinel unyielding is a set I don't have access to to test...
---
If you're out of caps, find some low-level super mutant spawn points (such as the lumber mill at the NW corner of the map).  Almost all of them have some sort of caps on them, and you can use low end weapons/ammo to take them out.
---
I play on pc. It's been reported multiple times already, and I was told that team is already aware of it.
---
Does look like it, but that name description is different.
---
I had a Legendary Scorchbeast land up in a tree lastnight lol
---
3* legendary fanny pack bonus effects
---
25% increased max cap capacity
---
25% increased max scrip capacity
---
Every super mutant including gram will try to murder you on sight.
---
😂😂
---
I imagine that a "bloodied" prefix legendary tampon could deal some serious damage in a proper melee build, I know I wouldn't want to be hit
---
I put on excavator, do the WS cottage loop, Pick up everything that isnt nailed down, then hit outside blackwater, hardbargain 3, grape mentats at WS station.
---
Twice through that, lots of XP, and max caps.
---
bonus - likely Pick up a couple of legendaries, too.
---
8,000*
---
Why so many stimpaks? Do you use fireproof?
---
They've complained about everything and have gotten their way, y'all complain about Tesla's killing you sentinel assassin would've helped but you bitched about that and they nerfed it 😂😂
---
So they can be assured Bethesda are still fucking them.
---
So it seems to only be impacting PC players though, as I haven't seen any PS4 players report that.
---
The 23rd is not a banking day, so it gets processed today. If you get paid on the 15th but the 15th is a Sunday, you will be paid on Friday the 13th. This is how grown-up stuff works.
---
Again you've never played it so you wouldn't understand that the changes based on "community feedback" changed survival for the worse, survival was amazing the first month or two
---
Is this for ps2?
---
&gt; Fanny packs.
---
Only if they're made of genuine canvas.
---
How is it possible to get 4 rare rolls on one event completion? I need someone/dataminer to explain it to me, because I've played about 2,000 hours and never heard of it.
---
Ore you sure?
---
This is brilliant! Looks like a wild wasteland encounter
---
Bro fucking thank you, absolutely nailed it
---
I'm a first day subscriber. Didn't lost junk, didn't get the free junk.
---
 it's exactly what happened, get your excavator armor and shove your all rise up your ass bitch
---
People are complaining about stash box color, main menu themes and ranger armor coat change... It'll never be acceptable to some people.
---
Hey, I get it, I really do. I don't yell for nerf, I yell for boost. The way to balance certain items is to make the shitty things better, not the good things shitty. 
---
You don't make the fast cars slower if they win races, you make the slow cars faster.
---
Danke.  Just grabbed The Complete Blind Willie Johnson.
---
I haven't heard any music of his except for this song and the one on the game's soundtrack.  I guess that's (ahem) nobody's fault but mine.
---
Yeah i know its a bummer, i miss killing shit with the guys
---
as a guy that regularly attends NA, I felt like I wouldn't be doing the irony gods any justice if i used any build besides junkies. it's my jam. when I nonchalantly mentioned I needed to "readjust my addictions" once to the guys I play with, I think they missed the hilarity I saw
---
Works for me, assuming OP didn't edit.
---
https://i.imgur.com/w0llWq2.png
---
Does this work?
---
Pretty cool
---
You have two 1\* cards right lol just gotta check the obvious first
---
Whoa, whoa, whoa....we don't want to be employing mechanics that we've used in [games that came out 14 years](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Generic_Magic_Apparel#Magic_Boots) ago from the same studio. 
---
It would be great to occasionally find an item like this in one of the myriad of level 3 or level 2 locks in this game, instead of just screwdrivers and wrenches.
---
Which link did you use?
---
Since it’s been reported repeatedly, don’t psycho when fighting sb 👌
---
So glad you posted it here. This is THEE coolest camp I’ve seen!
---
While some of the information in these responses is factual, survival is dead for no other reason than to repurpose the free server space to charge money for them.
---
**Bug** (first time for me): Invisible and invulnerable enemy: [https://youtu.be/RvjZyY4GAmY](https://youtu.be/RvjZyY4GAmY)
---
That too
---
Have to click pad a and b within 4 seconds of each other. Then have to click the master switch inside
---
Run to the first pad, then it's on a timer. Run to the second pad outside and it opens the door inside. It used to be you could run to the button inside and forget the 2 gutsy there. Ran it the other day, I had to kill one of the marked gutsy inside and loot it, the quest updated then I could press the button on the inside to finish.
---
I found a very cool clean miners helmet the other when I finally decided to actually use my lockpick cards.  It took a minute though......
---
You are committing to that being a thing when you take the mutations. Maybe Bethesda should add the [Breatharian](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=Breathatarian) Mutation where you get sustenance from the air. /s
---
Delete it and trade in the game for a burger?
---
It's a bug. You have to be real quick between the two panels &amp; the quest messages update can be delayed. Don't wait for it before heading to other keypad.
---
I feel like I’ve already seen this? Maybe someone else who did this already.
---
Perfect explanation of what should happen, however half the Reddit posts directly say “nerf x cause my all rise can’t beat it”
---
Yes, they will initiate it. I’ve had it happen
---
I waited a couple weeks til the scrap box fiasco was over (kinda regret that now since I could’ve had 600 vault steel) and bought a month. Spent most of the time feeding my scrap box because I’ll probably just pick up a month every few months when I want the atoms or need to stock up more junk.
---
So it's too much work then?  I hadn't even thought of that.
---
Not sure I can explain it, but I recall posts about this drop starting months &amp; months ago.
---
Personally I'd implement it as a feature
---
I think its supposed to actually encourage multiple people to do it.
---
Alright I'm gonna have to divert from your bitch-fest and ask wtf you're talking about chocolate chicken pot pies for?
---
Question is this the American Fanny or British cause it matters in the context XD
---
That’s a great feeling. Was ur adrenaline pumping or was it an easy win?
---
If ps4 and you'll be on soon yes. Lol
---
Only good thing I've found lately after picking a lvl 3 lock was a Marksmans Handmade with a long scope and a bayonet. I find short handmades in them in Watoga sometimes, but most of the time, it's screwdrivers and wrenches. Why are the denizens of Appalachia so keen to put screwdrivers and wrenches inside of a safe?
---
It’s lag.
---
I would buddy but ps4 here :/
---
So something that happened to me that I didn't realize initially because I must have created it during initial Oblivion days but if your Xbox live account and your Bethesda emails are different there's a possibility that you might have a second Bethesda account on the original email and never noticed. When you view "linked accounts" does it show your Xbox or just social media stuff? 
---
If you don't see Xbox, try doing a reset password on your email associated with your Xbox account. This might pull up an entirely different user name. If this is the case you can contact support to have products moved to the appropriate account (don't think they can merge them sadly) .
---
U just gotta perfect your build dude
---
There is the Alice in wonderland easter egg nuka shine location with the mad hatters tea party in the game currently. Can't recall it location but drink enough nuka shine and you'll find it
---
No worries, I got it on Xbox to play with my brother and my gf but they both quit along time ago lol and my other 6 friends who played stopped around a month after release.
---
Under other tips for staying alive lol.... blocker perk is only way in game to passively reduce melee damage as far as I know, and fireproof perk, padded or dense mods on whatever chest you end up using for explosions.
---
That is where it is most effective.
---
With Pacifist enabled?  I have yet to see it happen.  Passive prevents you from dealing any damage to another player who is not **mutually** hostile.  
---
*However* if a wanted player attacks you and triggers the mutation while you're **not** in passive you will turn hostile.  I have yet to see this happen with a player who is in Pacifist. That said, you can still die if it's repeatedly triggered as the mutations deal damage to yourself as well.
---
This is how I see,
---
When I am gathering supplies in the forest, ash hep and low level places, I use a melee weapon or my 10 mm.
---
But when I am hunting scorchbeast, fighting high level mobs of super mutants, robots or mirelurk Kong’s, I will use my faster fore rate or two shot explosive handmade. 
---
I change what I am using to fit the situation. That is most likely what you are seeing as well. Wasters looking for the best weapons for situations they foresee being in. 
---
Hope this helped. If you need a weapon, plans or a scavenger for hire, my PSN: Almightypain69
---
I'm referring to how your explanation was needlessly complicated. Everyone understands the point of 28 days; your explanation was just excessive.
---
It’s not pay to win if you didn’t pay for it, ask for it, or expect to receive it. 
---
It is jealousy to complain when someone else receives generosity.  And honestly, what’s your source because 600 Vault 94 Steel sounds insane. 
---
Might it be that it’s ammo bundles which contain 600 steel scrap? That seems more likely.
---
I would make a separate post I'm sure someone can spare 10m or so. I used a mine for the down when I did it.
---
And now you're the confusing one. Congratulations
---
Impossible, it’s closed source code.
---
I have 2 gunsmiths..
---
the one I run with is ranked to 3.. I find with weapons repaired 200% it's enough.. the other is ranked to 5 for crafting
---
first I ranked up the 3 and then whenever I didn't have another perk to pick I grabbed a gunsmith until I had enough to push the 3 to 5 and then make another 3.. so eight gunsmiths in total
---
Thats very true and great idea.
---
Last time someone checked it wasnt in the loot table, so dont get your hopes up.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Interesting....
---
They both work for me.  Whatever the one you had before your edit is the one I tried first though.
---
Seems to be a server issue. I've got a few friends with fallout 1st and the issue is drastically reduced when there are fewer players in the world.
---
killer
---
There's a perk to rez with alcohol, maybe a better way to go. Foley has a good idea with the shotgun, make it exploding too- it has 8 pellets for 8 procs +8 explosions for another 8. Luck based cards will almost always proc then and fast crit meter fills.
---
I have no idea if the medics works though, never ran it. It could be op but you'd have to be right in the mix unlike a classic healer to keep it up.
---
It's not, I know someone in my group who literally got this stuff who has first. I've lost stuff before and I didn't file a ticket. I didn't get limp d**k.
---
It is true, someone looked at the file and it can't roll unyielding.
---
Oh yeah I do all that already, but seems once I'm poisoned, i just press stimpak repeatedly! But is there any food buffs that help? Chris? I know medex used to work but not any More
---
I saw a video pop up on youtube - "why people play fallout 76" or something to that effect. The youtuber opens by talking about a time he was in a store and was confused to see a kid actually excitedly talking about fallout 76. He got to talking to the kid and explained to him in seemingly great detail why he thought the game was a betrayal of the franchise etc. This kind of summed the whole thing up to me. A grown ass man lecturing some kid in a store about why he's wrong to like something. There's nothing wrong with being critical where necessary and positive where possible but at a certain point you're just THAT guy.
---
All I said was that your explanation was excessive but okay... is English not your native language?
---
What platform?
---
I've seen it happen to a couple of my friends that run pasivist all the time. It CAN trigger it. It doesn't always though.
---
Feel better being a dick for no reason? No shit that you'd be thirsty in real life too, but the point is the hunger and thirst are a negative effect from the mutation. Class freak reduces negative effects by 75% at level 3, but doesn't work with speed demon because of coding. That is a bug, which is completely understandable for people to complain about. I wasn't complaining about them in general, just about a mechanic that isn't working the way it should.
---
It's a bug/mistake, same thing as with the 50% limb damage on melee weapons, If you can, Please do report it. The more people that reports it the better
---
Get level three hack and hack the turrets to attack the robots. Bring a minigun to get you out of any binds. Get the launch code of the internetz.
---
You can do both though, just click sprint click. I run it solo all the time.
---
Ps4 - psn is Bmain905
---
Do you have unused perk points? You have to use the perk points before things unlock. You cant save them and just use them on good perks later. Its annoying.
---
IIRC it released on the 22nd, so you probably have the rest of today assuming you signed up the first day it was out.
---
I have seen a player on xbox one complaining about this when I reported this the last time. At the same time I have heard about other pc players that don't have this issue. It's so messed up. I won't play again with the risk or, maybe I should say the certainty, that this will happen again.
---
Fallout 3 wasn't true Fallout according to fans of Fallout 1 and 2.
---
Fallout 4 wasn't true Fallout according to fans of 1, 2, 3, and NV.
---
Fallout 5 won't be true Fallout according to fans of 1,2,3,NV, &amp; 76.  Bank on it.
---
The use of the Mr. Fuzzy Ride is pretty damn clever
---
As I've said to others who claim this, I'll believe it when I see video proof. I've triggered hundreds of players and have never seen it happen. 
---
I have used the mutation to get pacifists killed though. Once was the mutation draining his health, a few others were triggered at WS next to a bot. When it triggers and hits a bot, they become hostile to the mutant. Hilarity ensues.
---
The two aren't tied together. Cosmetic skins like what we have in the atom shop are there to improve your overall experience. You don't need it, it's only there for people who value them enough to spend the extra on it. Some people want it but also don't have the time to grind for it. Call of duty has been doing this very well for years. You have gold, diamond, and dark matter/chrome/whatever camos to show off your skills and how much effort/time you put into the game. You can also buy a bunch of flashy rainbow, nebula, or whatever other camos for real money or get them through grinding loot crates. The two are distinctly different and serve different purposes, but both are there because most people will want at least one. This game is slowly starting to actually introduce rewards for dedicated players, once they flesh that out more the two systems should work nicely together
---
Survival mode was done perfectly for the first month IMO, however as for your role playing story, I have a few friends who do the same thing, but it’s fully original and incredibly hard to do. We’d have to have people play several characters at a time and I usually played 2-3. I wasn’t the hardest working, but it’s whatever now that they quit and stopped doing it, because PvP was a main part of the “quests” which meant we had to change a bunch of the locations of battles. I would’ve sent a link, but they took down the videos.
---
It doesn't happen with psycho in particular. It happens with literally any item used in the AID section. It's worse than you think.
---
I don't know exactly, or if any of the dataminers mentioned it, but it seems like the acid attack ignores armor rating. Could be why strangler armor melts SB with damage, and mirelurk queens melt you and SB too. But it's just an observation on my part
---
Just proves your more of a pussy
---
I don't raid so I'm not a great person to report. You would think just one such report regarding their long awaited endgame raid content would be enough to get them to at least try to look into it. That's a weird thing to break unless it was intentional to exclude some of the best and one of the worst effects from the table.
---
I run unstable isotope and electrically charged. It hasn't been triggering PvP for me recently but that was something that was bug fixed so they issue could possibly return with each patch like many others have. Even if it doesn't trigger PvP it can still kill you if they attack you long enough.
---
No I don’t run speed demon and it’s no problem. You just have to sprint to each point.
---
Must be nice to have friends :')
---
So is this PC only? Only during SB fights?
---
I always run the Responder Fireman Uniform and Helmet, keeps me from suffering environmental damage.
---
Off the internet? Howww, where do people find this info im so in the dark 🤦‍♂️
---
I have a 2 star gunsmith card, so it will let you make one, if it won't maybe it's a new bug or maybe you have a mod installed that's interfering (if you're on PC).
---
I'm sad I didn't get the easter mask, I was on every day of the week during the event and they must have released one of the eggs prior to the event because I'm only missing one and I know I started paying attention the moment the event started.
---
I have a screenshot of two super mutants attacking me while stuck in a sitting pose. It is my favorite photo in my collection 😂

I usually keep this one on display but today I’m not forkin around
---
Nukacrypt. They update the codes every week
---
Excavator as well?
---
Is it the sea captains hat?
---
I'm aware it's possible as I've farmed the event solo.  I was only stating what the intent of the design was.
---
And they work every time? Im not going to get to the end and put in a wrong code lol?
---
You'll never get that sweet Plasma grenade plan, nearly 100 tries here and nothing, it's hard to keep motivated.
---
Oh Bethesda's FO76, you national lottery of a game 🤷‍♂️
---
You will probably be able to use the 1st stuff until tomorrow as subscriptions usually expire at the end of the last day, not the beginning of the last day.
---
So fill that box up with scrap all day today, because you wont be able to put anything in it tomorrow.
---
Are you online now?
---
Radicool only increases strength, which won't have any effect on weapon damage other than maybe increasing the bash damage.
---
I can’t. It’s just one big pixel.
---
The only thing childish was you’re response, douchebag. I’ll turn my upvote into a downvote for being a condescending prick.
---
The TES games had those and FO4 and by extension FO76 are using the same engine as skyrum so im pretty sure it wouldn't be "too much work" for Bethesda.
---
I have a screenshot of a junk bot standing on the shoulders of another junk bot.  Makes me smile every time it comes up.
---
Not being a dick and just discussing things in general....You are going to be thirsty after running and possibly hungry also....I run speed demon and class freak....I make about 20 corn soup that lasts me about 4-5 hours of gaming....If that is too much for you to handle then maybe this is not the game for you....It is really not that hard....20 corn soup/4-5 hours of play!!!  Like I said in the beginning of this thread....Just people complaining about stuff that is not a big deal....You might as well have some out and said "Why do I have to eat and drink....It's a video game...Why should i t be so hard!!!!"
---
I’m down! At least make it better though. It did die out after all and was basically only used for leveling alts.
---
I just figured this out last night.
---
On PS4, hit O to modify the wall. At the top you will see "Edit" and if you hit R1 it will switch over to the "Wallpaper" menu.
---
You get to keep all things in your inventory across platforms. Expecting that there wasnt some type of data loss from the previous server.
---
&gt;power armor can 2 tap a full hp build.
---
this one depending on weapon, i can normally 1-2 tap a full hp build with a shotgun or a QE pump because of the acid stacks
---
Right now I'd say we're saturated with prefixes, and suffixes can be used to indicate pain and suffering.
---
For example, "76"
---
Well I tend to use non automatic weapons so I guess there’s less wear and tear on them.  Perhaps if used automatics I might be fixing them more often.
---
You’re entire comment was sarcasm. And you’re upset because you were met with an equal response...? You provided a lot to this thread, thank you friend lol. Have a wonderful day!
---
I want something that rewards players for not being a mutated abomination.
---
I found out about them around level 60ish.. don't feel too bad :P (Only level 75 now btw)
---
The steel doesn’t make it pay to win. It’s compensation for an unforeseen bug. Someone buying the sub now won’t get that steel, it’s only for people who lost their scrap.
---
And also, I am going to check that out later....I don't see it on my end...I top off with corn soup and at least 15 minutes before it starts to significantly affect anything such as Rejuvenated.  I will let you know my results.
---
It won't trigger PvP, but griefers can still use it to kill you if you're AFK because every time one of the AOE mutations trigger it causes you to take a small amount of damage.
---
I did not lose junk from my scrapbox, and I have not received any free junk from Bethesda.
---
No, it wasn’t. I was agreeing with you. I guess you’re not just an asshole, but a stupid asshole at that.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if true. There was a rare apparel that was made into a static spawn when "Wasted On Nukashine" started and then the ever elusive Whitesprings Jumpsuit was a moderately frequent drop from "Mischief Night".
---
Thank you, I appreciate the response.
---
Dude you’re comment could very easily be read as sarcasm. No one wants all the weapons to be like unstoppable monster because that’s horribly unbalanced. Then you further made it sound like sarcasm by saying it would reduce the value of in-game items which literally no one wants cause that’s hurting the in-game economy. I apologize for misinterpreting you original comment. I like the sauce though, Blaine. Keep that same energy lol.
---
Did you run out of pixels or something?  
---
And yeah, the Gauss does quite well at SBQ when you pile on sneak, crits, drugs, etc.
---
Tissue defibrillators
---
I have a Furious FFR primed Gatling Plasma and I don't think I could have a better weapon for SBQ fights, at least one that fits my play style. I got an Explosive Gatling Laser and the first time I tried to use it on a SBQ fight, I took more damage from my own gun than I took from the trash mobs. There's just too many things going on such as mobs appearing right in front of me while I was shooting other things and stuff, and on the heat of the moment (and the usual lag on these events), it's hard to not take a good amount of 'self-damage'.
---
I'd rather spend 25% ammo than have to heal myself or even to respawn, especially after they reduced the materials to make ultracite plasma cores...
---
Don't forget the -2 CHA penalty for wearing one!
---
Easy enough to verify if you know where to look. There are a bunch of rare Plans in the festive event reward loot pool, including Metal, Robot and Raider Armor, DCG Extra Claw, Plasma Grenade and a bunch of Wall Mounted Creatures to name a few. The drop rates for individual items look to be fairly low but if the game files are anything to go by, it should be a very rewarding and fun holiday period
---
I always thought the friendly fire perk seemed cool. Hitting teammates with fire (flamer or shishkabab) heals them. Try a pyro healer build!
---
You can not spend a dime on anything after purchase and it will have 0 affect on your experience.
---
It already is P2W, so nothing new here.
---
That's because a large portion, nay a majority, don't delve into holotapes, computers, etc to find the full story. 
---
For example, New Vegas was my first FO game. I completed the storyline as a level 13.  I was so disheartened at how brief the game had been and how lackluster the story was. Then I replayed it and took my time. What I discovered was all the stuff I had missed:  the entire game.  The lack of NPCs would only exacerbate that with a player new to the FO franchise.
---
If you haven't already, make sure to prime your LMG. With ammo smith 2 you get 86 rounds of ultracite 308 for 1 fluorescent flux and the same quantity of regular mats that you'd need to get 20 rounds of regular.
---
Not my video. 
---
Pretty impressive 💪
---
No, you are very much being a dick. I am not complaining about hunger and thirst being a thing. As stated in the title if you can actually read, I complain that there still hasn't been a fix for the combination being bugged. In the comments I am only expressing that the bug shouldn't still be a thing. I don't want the game to be easier, and I don't want the hunger/thirst being removed, I just want the game to be fixed like many others here. I also said in another comment that obviously it isn't game breaking, just a minor annoying inconvenience. Get your head out of your ass if you think you can tell people what games are or aren't for them.
---
lmao this is similar to something that had happened to me !:
---
https://twitter.com/JerseysGhost/status/1177984371015458816?s=20
---
From the high of what knowledge does he  says that?
---
So in the UK when you say tramp it is like when we in the USA say ass..
---
As someone else mentioned, the 23rd is a Sunday, which isn't a "banking day", and therefore they charge you on the Friday before. It's the same as if you get paid on the 1st and 15th of the month. If one of those dates falls on a weekend you get paid on Friday instead.
---
Farm farm farm... hoping for that God drop/roll and that's about it
---
I primed the lmg, and the lever. Building up some stock to prime the hand made next! I wish more people sold flux.  Haven't been to a whitesprings in too long, and no one bothers hitting the bog when doing the queen.
---
We did it :)
---
Give it some time, it looks like they are rolling these out in groups, not all the people who put tickets in have gotten the stuff yet either. It seems they are doing it in small groups and they started with the xbox players.
---
It's either that, or they spawned at survey camp alpha, got involved in a skirmish with a SB, and followed it into town.
---
And when we use the word tramp yes that is a woman that has sex freely...
---
Ditto
---
Yeah I had just read about the issues, was removing the junk from my scrap box when the game crashed.  When I got back in everything was gone. I had just consolidated the junk from 13 characters the day prior too.  
---
It was a bad day, but they made up for it yeaterday
---
Brilliant!!! It seems as though EVERYONE made it on TIME!!? 😂🤣😜🤪
---
PVP should have never been implemented in a Fallout game. It will always be broken. I'm sure many people will disagree but Fallout PVP has always been bad and now its just people riding waves of playing the same PVP class. People running bloodied builds with thousands of stealth boys and teslas are virtually un-killable. And unless you want to be a part of the problem you are boned. Or you can sit around in a half hour long stealth boy tesla fight with some other invisible person aiming at a red arrow above their head or just ya know..the ground SO much skill! Wow. Cool. Then theyll nerf that too and every weapon will be useless. I remember when it used to be explosive shotguns. Same shit different gun and build. Fallout PVP is wack with a cape, cause its super wack.
---
Oh thanks. That sucks.
---
But I didn't doubt it was a common issue considering support offered freebies right away.
---
It was hard to tell but I really did not see anything special....As far as I know and please correct me if I am wrong but the damage YOU are doing comes off at grayscale on the red health bar for the SBQ...I did not see any grayscaling for his shots....I saw the health bar drop but that was just total damage being put out by all of the player that were there....  If you have never seen it or know what I mean is that her health bar is red, when it gets knocked down from YOUR damage her health goes down but your damage output shows in grey on the bar....I am going to look for a video of what i mean
---
Events, quests, events.
---
Yes. Codes change on Tuesday and I can tell you that there was one Tuesday where I tested all 3 and it worked just fine.
---
I have 50 poison damage resistance with my armor and now the king 👑 is no more the mireluck with his one shot BUT me.
---
Launch nukes and Try to get good legendary and flux etc.
---
It may not be enough time to complete the story over the weekend, but it may be just enough of a push to convince people to purchase the game, maybe. It would make sense for them to do another free weekend, they did it just after E3 this year for Nuclear Winter's intitial release, but we shall see I guess.
---
You'll also notice that not all the people who submitted tickets have gotten it yet. They are doing it in groups, not all at once. If you look it seems they started with xbox players, and that link has multiple people verifying they got it without putting in a ticket or losing anything.
---
Hell, there is a person in there that said he got FOUR of these bundles one on each character. so 2400 vault steel. Which is way beyond what is possible to get in the game even with grinding the raid from launch.
---
I say it will work both ways call them fanny packs .. the US based characters can wear them in the back and the UK characters can wear them in the front... Sounds like a win-win
---
Ok? As I said I have never seen on Xbox before. I’ve played for over 600 hours.
---
I don't understand your question (I do but...)
---
If you're not motivated to play a game any longer, just play something else.
---
Not only was it unnecessary, but grossly uninformed on gaming economies in general. Yes, we do want prices to drop. 
---
Right now caps are worthless to get end game weapons unless you have 3-5 characters at max caps. A healthy economy would have at least “usable” (not god rolled) endgame weapons available at a price all players can afford by grinding a reasonable amount. It’s worse because legacy weapons are not obtainable from grinding at all. And now paypal is becoming more and more the only way to get those items.
---
I use magic the gathering as an example for explaining this because it has an exact same problem of necessity-cards that are unable to be reprinted, and the 4-8 land cards you need to play legacy or vintage formats are on the reserve list: a contractual agreement made between wizards of the coast and the old-school players to preserve the value of those cards for collectors by not reprinting them. 
---
The long-term result of that practice has made tournament-playable copies of those cards cost $100-300each with an average competitive legacy deck costing 2-5 thousand dollars. Recently, the world’s largest organizer of sanctioned tournaments, SCG, has discontinued all future legacy events, replacing them with the recently-announced pioneer format.
---
The short-sightedness of the practice has allowed the have’s to be as greedy as they wish, and subsequently destroyed the very format they claimed to want to preserve and grow. inaccessibility is an inevitable consequence of driving those prices through the roof.
---
Separate perk card
---
Aw if you have it on PlayStation I could play with ya
---
So are you saying that the poison resist armor works really well?
---
Been competent and fixing bugs before releasing content
---
Yeah, i almost completed a set when i realized this, i just gave up at that point.
---
Wish tbh is a good thing because even tho not having to spend any perks on reducing the weight on your ammo and been able to spend those perks on damage for different types of weapons is something amazing ends up falling apart as soon as you get into power armor for a nuke zone.
---
People treat it like there are no other games on the planet it seems. I only play with a friend, when nobody is online i play other games. It's not that hard 😂
---
I can see adding or not adding DR to helmets. But give them something like how some glasses added perception while some added charisma. Same more for clothing. The red dress should add 1-3 charisma as should suits. Idk how a gun can add +1 Perception but glasses do not or how some have -2 perception...
---
I'm not the only one that has complained about it not working, there have been posts for the last few months if I remember correctly. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong with it, aside from anytime I take radaway it adds thirst, but that isn't a constant effect (as far as I know).
---
The reason I came here and made this comment is because I would like to hear from you, much more experienced players than me, about how to get the most out of this game. Maybe they have other ways of playing, other gaming experiences that I don't know about, because I don't interact with anyone during the game.  
---
I see no problem asking for help from the most experienced.
---
That's how I do it. The majority of what I sell is water. I've maxed the vendor with just water several times. If I could just play all day, that's what I would do every day.
---
Your anecdotal evidence is worthless. Go find a friend, start recording, and show pacifist mode mutations triggering PVP.
---
You could easily get what GTAV online had. If you don't wear a full face helmet you're open to headshots by other players. So fedoras, beanies, hooded jackets, all technically worse to wear. So you get a bunch of sweaty tryhards flying their flying rocket shooting motorcycles across the island wearing full face motorcycle helmets so they can't be sniped easier (I'm in this camp). And people who shoot anyone wearing a full face helmet on sight for fear they're about to go on a rampage (I try not to be this type).
---
Personally I like not having a disadvantage just because I choose to wear a hat or mask for cosmetic reasons. If they want to make a cosmetic and an armor helmet slot distinction so we can have both, that'd be fine. But otherwise, I like people not being punished for wearing normal clothes to go with their normal outfit because their armor is hidden under.
---
Make a break before to be fed up and wait the DLC. It's a no sense to play a game if you don't enjoy it.
---
For some reason the one I have did  not set up auto renew. I thought this was for everyone as well. Maybe the first day folks had this problem? I can not be the only one.
---
I wouldn't expect an articulate explanation of anything coherent or resemble proof of play to win.
---
Sometimes it will tell u to keep going back to those paired buttons but if ur sure u got it then on the inside of the bunker is a master switch. Hit that and it completes the event
---
I play on PS4 and haven’t seen this first hand.
---
Niiiice!
---
I dont think you should have to complete the first quest first, it might turn people off from playing wastelanders.
---
While i personally like the story in fallout 76, some people really dont like the way it was told and might not want to go through it for whatever reason.
---
Other ammunition types are affected by both perks and the armor.
---
It's mostly a myth. Turn on pacifist in your settings menu &amp; Don't take any workshops in adventure mode and griefers are harmless. They're mostly non-existent anyways. I encounter one every month or two at the most and I run around sporting my ranger icon so they know I'm a subscriber.
---
Come back when those NPCs work without issues or the boat load of more bugs the dlc adds or rebreaks
---
Official calculation is it takes 37 hours to get 600.
---
Troll better noob, or got good. No other reply for you.
---
At level 55 you are a piece of junk in terms of character strength, perfect your build.
---
If you want to take a workshop and farm it that's what the private world is best for because no one can initiate PVP because there's no one there
---
The poster was talking about the legendary armor reduction not working for explosive ammo.
---
I can pretty much kill anyone with my cache of auto AAE or BE handmades (or vampire or bloodied autos with FFR) but there’s no solution when facing the glitched out auto FFR Tesla stealthboys.  I mean, it’s not even fun.  To a lesser extent, the explosive Gatling lasers and plasmas are glitched as well just not as bad.
---
I'm aware
---
Or they could really mess up Wastelanders and make it even bigger. 
---
I think it's better to release Wastelanders on top of a solid product instead of chancing it. 
---
But I also see your point.
---
Go into the Atom Shop under Apparel and check for the Tricentennial clothing. You can also check Weapon and Power Armor skins.
---
Not my downvote, I just seen you replied and I'll answer
---
It was fun for a moment the scrap box...for a lot of hoarders oh yea, personally, I dont need 9k screws, gears, and what nots. I'm also not a collector but I can see for the people that want to collect sets or armor, weapons, teddy bears, nukaeverythings, and etc ever bit of scrap not taking up space is more room for things
---
The private server I've used less then five times
---
But if you had a set group of friends or are a complete xenophobe your going to find more use then i did
---
The coat was a major selling point, the atoms was icing on the cake. As is I'm disappointed they changed the coat but not enough to bitch and scream on several support tickets...it did dent my faith a bit in the way that whatever the next free outfit is...they can change it at any time *shrug* so I may not be as happy about it
---
Awesome, glad to hear it. Imo it's been one of the most overlooked perks since release.
---
Thank you very much!  I think I'll still practice until level 5, but good to know.
---
Scrap box. Theeeee one and only item that should have been in the game from start. Or not limited storage. FO3, NV, and 4 had unlimited storage. For a person who likes to play and collect all the unique items in those fallouts. This one, they had to boost the stash a few times. Still sucks since weight reduction perks dont cary over to storage, and one nice legendary heavy gun or rifle is 20+lbs. Not counting ammo.
---
I’m on Xbox and have been waiting for the plebs to grief me... no luck yet
---
Yep, my thoughts exactly!
---
This... you can bank as many perk points as you want, but you must choose an available card at every level in order to open up the next level. 
---
Nukes and Dragons character builder is good at mapping out the holes you have in your build if you aren't sure. You might have to just choose something non-optimal for your build in order to get to the next level of cards.
---
A little sensitive, no? The best weapons in game should be the most expensive and not everyone should have them. This is why there is only (or used to be at least) a small percentage of players running around with legendaries in World of Warcraft. If you wanted to buy Illidans Blades from the market it would cost you thousands of dollars worth of gold. Legacies should be absurdly expensive. Yes, you want these prices to drop but through natural means such as caps sinks (just going to assume you know what that is since you claim to be more intelligent). Not by introducing “near-god-roll legendaries” thus highly over saturating the market forever ruining the price of end-game gear until 4/5 stars are introduced. It’s basically a dupe wave is what your asking for lol... didn’t even read your whole post you wrote me a book and went on about collectible card games and competitive tournaments. Moving on, have a good one Blaine.
---
Still doesn't win you anything. Allows you to be a hoarder sure but that's about it. I know tons of players without F1st and they can beat me at every aspect of the game.
---
I purchased/traded for a quad auto FFR Tesla from a player in game like 8 months ago before it was even a thing.  I started the game with a Tesla and at that time that was my primary weapon until I started acquiring and modding legendary handmades.  
---
I rarely use it (Tesla) now because it’s basically a cheater weapon and you are a LOSER if you engage PvP with someone.
---
Kinda wish they added the variations of the ranger armor every week for that month than a new outfit and new variations, but I can't complain I like what I've gotten so far and in my opinion is a really good deal if you plan on playing a lot of 76.
---
Lmao 😂
---
Your right. I agree. I love fallout, and still enjoy this one. It is different for sure, but fails in comparison to the others. FO4 didnt resemble 3 or NV but was good in it's own ways. This one has poor story delivery. Few ppl want to just listen to holo tapes, especially when playing with others, where events are times. Enemies wont respawn if some other person just ran the area. Static drops dont respawn if someone grabs them for a while... etc. The only true failure in regards to pay to win is the scrap box. Theee one thing that should have been in base game.
---
no lag, my first vats hit on certain things never hits, lots of things do, grenades and lots of heads don’t, lots of torsos do, its like a 100% of the time thing too
---
Wow that would be an interesting twist. The plasma grenade plan was previously so rare that it would usually trade for top tier weapons including legacy ones and full armor sets or more.
---
If this is true I guess people should cash in their plans before this becomes public knowledge.
---
I've never encountered a single one and I've been playing for almost a year now. Most I've come across have been pretty friendly. The day I started when I left 76 there was a high level standing there and he dropped a collection of recipes and plans for me.
---
Do the possum badge challenges.  They get you travelling all over the map doing things you maybe have never tried. Crafting, cooking, makings chems, etc. The backpack mods are great as well.
---
Very cool!... though I'm guessing there might be issues if you instance to a server that had it claimed by another?
---
There are some missing Enclave locations... I think it's time that I post a very long, deep dive into some Enclave lore in the game that no one else seems to have noticed... I'll link it soon.
---
Yeah something does not seem normal to get all those drops
---
Hey, would you play with me? I’m only level 50 but I promise I’m okay, no mic but I can listen
---
Video he put up at the end, has values from the files. Wish they'd throw in the empty pumpkin rack into the pool.
---
I did, it's not there. My pint sized slasher is that I bought through Xbox, and the rest of stuff I've bought in game but Tricentenial stuff isn't. In any of the sections.
---
Why you linking us to this scamming wordpress page?
---
Yeah i usually meet liquid players and all of them are pretty much running away...
---
Meltdown. My crew finished it in standard 30 min ago
---
I've had pipboy freezes and im on ps4, its not a system problem, ITS the games problem
---
How many Xbox accounts do you have tied to your Xbox?
---
It adds a lot of inventory space for just 1 perk point. It's usually worth it in most bloody builds.
---
I'm level 187 and just started running the queen more regularly using LFG in Social Clubs on Xbox. I've also just modified my build slightly so when I do the queen I can run a Furious Gatling Plasma with appropriate perks, its a beast.  
---
Beyond that I like to farm materials for 556, legendaries, and do events. Between these things 3-4 hours can go by real fast.
---
It ails you in many ways. Cant store legendaries as much to farm the limited script due to weight. Cant store as many meds as need be or ammo due to same reason. Equally same for limited scrap collection for production of everything. Flora, scrap to build repair etc. You are at a "win" due to those things.
---
Deal would only come from murmrgh
---
You don't *need* it, but it definitely helps. I've run it a few times with and without and SD for sure takes away the stress of it. Speed Demon and Marsupial are two mutations I don't know that I can ever play without anymore...
---
The mechanics aren't balanced enough to support this. PC vs AI is fine, because they can gimp the way an AI behaves.  PvP in this game has little to do with skill, and is more about how much somebody has min-maxed their build specifically for PvP, and if they've hunted for the perfect legendary weapons for PvP.
---
Then there is everybody else just playing the game, not trying to dominate another human.
---
I actually like the idea of designated spaces, but I'd invert it and make them PvP spaces.  There is a TON of space on the map, just pick a section somewhere with a variety of terrain, make some sort of boundary (hedges/terrain), and drop two workshops in it on each end.
---
Consider this... what if it was Abandoned Bog Town? Put a workshop on the other side, and just entering the town boundaries shifted your play mode to be hostile to all players, with a warning.
---
Now you are playing with fire -- and I like that it'd be integrated with the main map, rather than a completely separate game like NW.
---
I just picked Bog Town at random, but it could be good for this.  It's kindof a stale location right now.
---
Regardless. It boils down to perspective. Some ppl love 76. Some hate it. Doesnt matter really. It's all perspective. Original post voiced his concerns. We are doing the same.
---
Unless you have some way to prove that it doesn't, your opinion is equally worthless.
---
I mean i bought it just under 2 months ago
---
I still haven't ran outer worlds.. Star wars looks fun.
---
If they attack your camp don’t return fire. Also there are a lot of cool people out there looking for griefers. If they are in the area they will help out against them. There are some dicks and pricks out there but also some really cool people.
---
I agree!
---
I find it so funny that everybody just goes by word-of-mouth until someone disagrees with them, then all of a sudden  You ask for a video.
---
I carry 2000 40mm grenades, 300 missiles, 3000 5mm and 5000 shotgun shells with me. Are you sure?
---
Ok I'll have to get looking for some then!
---
No I think the backwards thinking is the UK..🤣🤣
---
All my friends who are FO1st subs are griefed every time they come into the public server. Some people are just pricks.
---
Mac out luck and take all the VATs perks you can. Critical meter fill and ap fill on kill is necessary!
---
This has ended or reduced a lot already...
---
You might be right lol
---
as has been stated if you dont want any negativity, no opinion that contradicts your own, then head to r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Like I said I'm glad they hooked you up with the other resources but the vault steel makes me sour.
---
Dope af! Real OG :)
---
That perk lineup is pretty much what I run as well.   Action Boy is a must and I have Tenderizer and Suppressor (2 out of 3) and Tormentor (2 out of 3).  Obviously Bloody Mess maxed out and Covert Ops maxed out are also important as are all 9 Commando cards.  I have a couple under Adrenaline and run full Tank Killer, Fireproof, and Demo Expert as my two main handmades are AAE and BE autos.  When I run my vampire or bloodied non explosive FFR versions I adjust a bit.
---
I don't think being a subscriber makes much difference. Usually if you don't have the FO 1st icon equipped people won't even know if you are a subscriber. Otherwise keep pacifist on. If you do take a workshop in a public server, stay crouched and stash your junk asap. If someone does attack your workshop either change servers or just avoid the workshop.
---
Your more likely to be hassled by being a lower level. Just turn pacifist on and dont engage. Ive had more problems with a newer character than ive had with my main.
---
Very good to know!   Thing is... I'm... kinda likely to try to fight back.   XD And I'd also help against griefers as well.    I'm just too low a level atm.
---
Doesn’t make it wrong either
---
Oh... You can do a new character. I don't do all the quest in my first playthrough. And I started another character with a different build only to farm and leveling fast. I'm curious, what languages do you speak?
---
Shit, can you explain how to win this game? Im closing in on level 200 and thought i would have won by now.
---
Thank you! May I ask what level you are and how hard it would be to obtain the legendaries? (And where?)
---
Of course there was issu s all they needed to do was fix those, and yeah pvpers need caps to buy stealthboys ammo, guns, and other consumables. Farm like a bitch or kill for caps
---
Would anyone have plans for a crafting recipe? If you give me about 4 hours I should be able to be online and have some junk to sell and caps to spend for just one plan? 
---
Anything would help, I’m just looking for anyone sellin em cheap or discounted. &lt;3
---
It's not only during SB fights. It can happen anytime, regardless if you are in a fight or not. And people have reported the bug on xbox too.
---
Yeah i hate it for that, the Chinese never had power armour, that was the whole edge that the US had over them and got back Alaska etc with.  
---
Unfortunately one of my team mates is in love with it so i just know when its out i'm going to be seeing the damn thing all the time :(
---
Lucky you then.
---
&gt;no mic but I can listen
---
You would make a great boyfriend
---
I’m not sure if I should take this as a compliment
---
Lol...
---
MTG is a perfect example of why you DON’T want near-god roll legendaries as challenges. Wizards literally reprints shit like crazy to make money. My buddy pulled a foil Tarmogoyf from a pack of modern masters years back and it flipped it for $600 on eBay because that was one of the hot reprint at the time. Absurd. That’s worth $40 non-foil now because it’s been...you guessed it, reprinted. They control what cards come out when and literally analyze data of which sets sell how much to figure out how to make the most profits each quarter. Releasing a near-God-roll legacy as an adventure mode challenge will essentially have the same effect. Everyone will have a legacy that’s worth 1.5k caps. Yippie!
---
A cap sink would solve the issue you were referring to where players have 5 toons with max caps. It reduces the caps floating around in the economy and is a natural way of lowering the value of not only that expensive legacy, but every item in the game. That’s why they’re used so frequently in MMO’s (mounts, class trainers, profession trainers, guild/social rewards such as housing, etc).
---
I run a heavy-weapons, team based healing/buffing build that works very well! Here is how it works;
---
1) Friendly fire and Team medic perks, maxed out. For friendly fire, only flamers will work. With these two perks you can keep a team alive. 
---
2) Heavy weapon damage perks. You will be using your flamer a lot, but it isn't ideal for DPS. Use the flamer primarily for healing teammates and other heavy weapons for raw damage.
---
3) EMT perk. No brainer, this one ensures teammates you revive dont immediately go back down and enables you to heal them more. Can also grab the other revive-related perks to help keep yourself alive when making a run for a dying teammate.
---
4)Hear me out; Empath mutation. By itself, your teammates take only 25% less damage while you take 33% more. It isn't worth it on its own, but if you stack Empath with the Strange in numbers perk and lv3 Class Freak perk, the positive greatly outweighs the negative. (Granted, this is just for if you actually play with teammates alot like I do.) 
---
5) You have to keep yourself alive in order to heal. You can do a variety of things for this, but what I do is keep my characters health as high as possible, using full vanguard armor. I also primarily use vampire weapons to constabtly regen my own health to make up for the empath mutation. I rarely ever go down at all, and a few of my teammates are practically unkillable when I'm on the team. (Bloodied teammates always go down the quickest).
---
This is all if you wanna focus on being a team player over raw DPS. However, if you find the right weapons and use the right perk cards, you should still be able to a decent amount of damage. You just won't be able to solo a SBQ lol.
---
Nah that was all just made up stories or a few isolated incidents.
---
 I've had the 1st subscription since day one and have never been bothered once.
---
Come to public servers sheep and take your punishment! Joking aside mostly no issues for Fallout 1st players as most people still playing it have it and the griefing you are getting more then likely is just regular griefing.
---
West Tek is Enclave? I only ask cause I would extend fractions to include Super Mutants. The Devils backbone region is full of Super Mutants I.e. in and around West Tek and Huntersville
---
I deleted in comment because I misinterpreted your original comment. But okay...
---
TY hadn't even noticed heh
---
That happens regularly at dyer chemical. The protectrons will start walking backwards to where they came from if you snipe them ans they don't detect you
---
I would definitely get the outer worlds as it is a short fun little game. I finished it twice and came back to fall out 76. 
---
It was a much needed break.
---
I read this and the OPs posts together and MGS 4's best fight scene played in my head.
---
The Fallout First player harassment was never really a big thing. A few good stories that made things sound crazy, but not much to actually find in the wild.
---
Basically that big screen that pops-up once you hit level 5 is your reminder to make sure that Pacifist Mode is enabled.
---
Once enabled, you are free to Robot and Mothman dance naked in the streets and no one can do anything to your toon.
---
There are a few caveats though:
---
- Avoid claiming/contesting workshops if you don't want the possibility of PVP. Honestly being PVP killed isn't a big deal, you lose some junk, some caps, life goes on.
---
- Avoid the Mutations that have automatic defensive actions. You can accidentally agro others in certain scenarios if your mutation defense procs and hits another player.
---
- Avoid interacting with Wanted players as you become a fair target once you attempt to damage them.
---
You also have a Mute and Block for session option to further isolate yourself from the few bad apples that may want to verbally harass.
---
When there is a consensus, yes word of mouth is fine. When you go against the consensus, the burden of proof is on you.
---
Bring us empirical evidence. Anecdotal evidence is worthless and experiences prove nothing.
---
Honestly i think it’s pretty rare. I would love to see a video of this happening.
---
I’ve put off using speed demon because I hate the hunger and thirst mechanic. 
---
I might give it a shot though everyone seems to love it.
---
The thing is is that people love the fallout theme and world. People need new things.
---
\+10 Carry Capacity +50 Style
---
My personal experience proves to me that it is a possibility. It's not a 100% of the time this always happens, but I have seen it happen personally. Honestly not really that compelled to prove it to you if you don't want to believe it don't. I don't care.
---
Dude...I love it!
---
Outer Worlds is fun and very character driven, like it better than Fallout 76.
---
Then it sounds like you have a reasonable reason to request it through their support system.   I waited a couple weeks before getting FO 1st, so I certainly don't have any reason to request it.
---
I read about this happening on here before, but I was doubtful.  Last month I met a player who I trust who actually did get 3 jumpsuits from Uranium Fever, so I am convinced this is indeed a thing.
---
It was a 20K+ item prior to the Halloween event.
---
Very excellent tips, thank you! 
---
... though you've now given me some perverse ideas during the next events.   :D
---
That it does though.
---
When did this start? Ive never had this issue. On xb1 s
---
It’s neither moral nor immoral
---
Where abouts?
---
I've said this since the beginning. Weapons too. 
---
If I find a can of green paint in the wasteland, why can't I slap some on my Handmade?
---
Adding this in wouldn't detract from the current cosmetics currently in the Atom Store.
---
I tried the first part and it did not work but what I am doing now is everytime I get the "vault tec engineers etc" warning I quit and then try again sometimes I have to do it 2 or 3 times but it lets me in eventually, but I have not tried the second part of the solution "destrux125 "suggested yet.
---
No idea why this has suddenly started to happen, crazy thing is the warning for me says it does not have a region ping this is the reason I am getting a warning but as I said all I do now is quit but not out of the game totally, press play and it goes through the loading screens but then lets me in so it cant be a region ping as I stopped restarting my computer, which I was doing previously.
---
Dirty pool. I love it.
---
&gt; it does remove the use of a lot of cosmetic apparel
---
It doesn't need to tho. Make them 'under' whatever cosmetic piece you wear. Also make them visually selectable like numerous other games have done in the past.
---
I read your other posts and I am no trying to be a dick just everyone seems to want it all for free or just easier....I honestly have no abnormal problems with hunger or thirst running speed demon and class freak....Also, you have to remember something about this game....The day night cycles are also going to affect your hunger and thirst as they are much faster than a regular cycle so everything you are doing is faster and quicker than real life....I am not sure how accurate but someone said that in total days from launch until now that this game has now advanced 20 years into the future...Again, I am going to test some tonight and will let you know what my outcome is.
---
I have a quad FFR auto combat rifle and with an 80 shot magazine it’s pretty ridiculous.   
---
I’m always partial to my AAE (auto) handmade and BE (auto primed) handmade but don’t forget about combat rifles.
---
Turn on pacifist (so you don't accidentally shoot someone), and enjoy worrying about a situation that will likely never happen.  I haven't seen anything like that either.
---
Also remember, if someone is bothering you (for whatever reason), you can always hit the logout button, wait a couple minutes (to e safe), and log into a whole 'nother world.  Place the people on ignore if they were more than just annoying, and you shouldn't see them again.
---
... a lovely thing about leaving retail... I honestly forgot black Friday was a thing... and I just got the game.
---
I was extremely disappointed in Bethesda for putting the scrap box behind a paywall, and a recurring monthly one at that. I can afford it but I will not subscribe. It's pissed me off, but I, and I'm guessing the majority of folks who hold similar views, don't really hold any ill will to those who do subscribe. In fact, if you put down your tent during scorched earth, I may even deign to stand on it.
---
Im 500 hours in more or less at level 128 being casual and not trying to go hard or go home. You come up with little challenges.
---
1. I became a deathclaw/wendigo hunter in the mire region so I know where they all can spawn at and I make runs going up and down the mire and treat buildings like mini quests. Also kill anything level 40 and above. I either scrap two hundred pounds worth of gear or sell it. I run a bloodied stealth sniper build so I usually one shot them.
---
2. I became a vendor where my spawn camp is at the boltons and my turrets kill all the low level scorched so I get easy free steal(I had too much traffic so I have my vendor turned off)
---
3. I plan on being a scorched beast hunter next by going down the bog because I have too many cores and plasma cores too. Normally I run away from them because I prefer the thrill of evasion with low health.
---
Alternatively, you can just run up and down the map to figure out where you haven't gone to to check it out again. Most people "grind". But I prefer to have fun instead of grinding. So quests like I am become death or waste management feel tedious and annoying
---
Do a quick server on google regarding this issue, and you will see multiple reddit threads about it. Rare or not, it's happening.
---
Are you talking about it missing every shot in VATS when it's showing 95%? I've never experienced a hit detection problem outside of VATS.
---
Some handmade builds have inherent terrible accuracy, like a two shot with the shortest barrel will miss stuff at almost point blank range.
---
this
---
Besides what others have commented, I also got the plans from savage divide treasure maps
---
I drop things there all the time.  Plans that aren't worth much, extra ammo I don't use (and can't sell), stuff I'm carrying that I want gone, etc.  I just drop it there whenever I'm in the area because I know a low-level can use it (or maybe sell it).
---
Outerworlds is bland bland bland. Its a decent enough game but there is nothing super compelling. I like the FO76 gameplay loop and base building and world.
---
I already reported the issue and the team knows about it. This is a rant not a report. This issue has been report on reddit since february if you check some old threads, and yet it's still there.
---
Wow so that event basically ruined its scarcity. Hope there won’t be a future event that rains handmades on participants.
---
It’s mainly used in the quest and they talk about how they had influences in the area
---
The issue with supermutants being included is they would basically take up the whole map and replace most of the areas. Another issue is that they aren’t a guaranteed spawn in most parts
---
Your post says it’s a common problem. A few reddit posts with only a handful of responses is hardly what I would call common. I hope your issue gets resolved but I think you are overestimating how many people this impacts.
---
If you’d elaborate I’ll be sure to look into it and add them
---
You can run very low strength and make up for it with the radicool card to recoup the lost carry weight.
---
On PS4 atm the crash happens when I browse content of stash or vending machines. It’s as if the graphic data suddenly choked the CPU and it just freezes and die.
---
You know how skin tight jeans looked dumb AF back in the 2000’s, even though they were super trendy, or gigantic clown pants in the 90’s, or neon parachute clothing in the 80’s?  Same thing.
---
Yeah, I think I found 8 during the event.
---
How did you know the Tesla was 3*?
---
Few days ago I was asking myself how this was handled... now I know it doesn't. Thanks.
---
\+10 Additional Weight Capacity
---
1600 damage per shot I think. Video quality is so poor.
---
Yup... posted this last week and even after patch its still broken. I emailed support.. No response of course but at least I took action.
---
Hmmm. Mine doesn't. (No explosive prefix)
---
Yeah, well thankfully no breaking happened today, what I wrote was more or less sad ironic comment, something like you are what you eat, well better yet you became something you eat too much... well my point is bethesda was good, bought fallout licence, that is licence for world where vault tec makes experiments beyond humanity, human rights etc and people are like ok with that (some don't know, some have to be ok with that and rest is running that show) and well now bethesda is like that in real life (maybe not only bethesda and not only recently but that is beyond my point now)
---
Valve sent over the entire TF2 team to help Bethesda with 76.
---
I’m sure the potted plant will do great things!
---
Sometimes just wondering the main roads can lead to some great encounters too! Some Legendary in fact... ;)
---
All I really wanted was the private world... so I would have continued this sub just for that.  But scrap box and tent are nice perks to keep.
---
Yeah I know and mostly they say that it is in our best interest, though that is not what I meant by that comment...
---
I'd love a boxing headgear, shorts and shoes to make Little Mac.
---
The special boosts really boost your sneak ability, hit chance, and AP for VATS and sprinting. You will also get legendary items with a better condition bar from having higher luck.
---
I only run 3 pieces right now but that's the least unyielding I would consider.
---
IMO it improves your combat survivability better than bolstering does because you are that much more effective at staying hidden and clearing more enemies using VATS before they can damage you.
---
That fallout one thing. They give you a private server, you gather supplies and loot, go back into multiplayer, and sell all the valuable loot. You get crap tons of caps and end up at a huge advantage to every other player. Pay - to - win.
---
1 of my toons is shotgun Medic. Dps is weak with shotguns as compared with most other weapons. I get around this by being a junkie, which fits my sense of RP, a doc addicted to his own supply. Using a legendary medics is fine for low level stuff, but you just aren't helpful enough. As previous comment mentions, everybody basically has thier own health under control. The only time they need help is in the endgame, where you won't be doing enough damage. If you run with 2 bloodied, you stay close so heals work, you CAN be effective. This is all very situational though. At the SBQ people tend to spread out enough to miss the heals, and  without a God roll medic ( something like medic ffr fr) combat shotgun you can't keep up in really hectic situations. AP is what you have to have to make it work well, which makes for a strange specials spread- str for shotguns, agi for AP, luck for vats, then some charisma to share and heal more, a difficult balance I am still toying with.
---
As long as it's not paid dlc which it probably will be.
---
When I was lower level I would get a couple shots on SQB and then just take out the little guys while overpowered players killed her
---
There are a few different groups that do this. I've been debating on doing it myself for my bloodied melee character. I have seen a few different spots for placement. I had issues with one that was close to Drop Site because scorched still spawned on the elevated platform.
---
Minigun does pretty well for me. You might also try equipping the luck card for auto repair weapon chance. A high level mr handy blade is pretty nice too. Basically, fast attack weapons are all I seem to have luck with
---
Nice win
---
Yeah I’m debating too but I spent so much time on building my darn Appalachian mansion  😃
---
Coming soon as exclusive for fallout 1st subscribers!!!   You wanted it we listened!!
---
Negativity aside, the game have some other problem that doesn't need negativity to be discussed healthy.
---
Most would be summarized in:
---
-Random people experiencing random bugs that limit significantly their experience.
---
-Suspicious reasons to ask money for a feature that solves a fake problem (limit weight/scrap box).
---
-Too long response time to take actions to solve important problems.
---
-Not talking more with player base (that one I understand... haters are too fierce to dialog most of times).

---
Here's some older threads reporting the exact same issues. In the comments on these threads you can find people who say that they also got the same freezes as op. 
---
So consider the guys making the threads, all the guys answering the threads saying they have the same issues, and all the others that encountered said issue and didn't make a reddit thread about it or just sent a ticket without talking about it in public. 
---
This freeze is odd because it doesn't happen to anyone, but it does happen to a good amount of people as you can see in here. Some of these threads are 7 months old, which means that this has been around for a year and maybe even more. 
---
From now on I am gonna have to play with the paranoia of getting a freeze anytime I use an aid item, or use my aid items on the wheel(some people said this doesn't cause the freeze). Though I am still gonna have to use the pipboy for using plans.
---
That's not entirely true to debit purchases. Ach transactions? Yes. But not entirely true to online remittance payments or preauthorized online payments. My phone bill can be processed on weekends reoccuring. They did that on purpose to people who planned on canceling today.
---
Im saying that the fallout one thing that is a paid service gives those players a huge advantage. In loot and xp.
---
I'm about half way through Outer World's, I keep playing this instead haha. It's okay, average game, but, the gunplay is dire.
---
BTW if you do add me. psn: delsquest. Would love to help you nuke etc.
---
My personal experience is that the earth is flat. If you aren't willing to believe me then I'm not compelled to prove it to you.
---
Yes it's the wasteland, but it's not like anybody's struggling to survive right? All you really need is a camp with a water purifier and food then you're set.
---
I've never complained about roleplaying, you're talking about a specific group of people. 
---
Bounty's don't necessarily stop people, who's gonna try and stop a level 300, sure they may be as strong as a level 50 but they have a higher chance at having better gear to kill.
---
Talking about fallout first, did anyone else get some weird package for the scrapping station ? I forgot to ss but some of my lost scrap got placed back with extra stuff like ultracite and fluxes.
---
Talk about going out in left field 🙄
---
Walking back from the bathroom and realizing you never even fast traveled smh
---
Killing the super mutants at Westtek. Youll need a high level friend for it. You tag the supermutants while the high level finished them off. You can get crazy xp.
---
Lol RIP
---
Just saw this now and thought I was hacked or something when I saw all the fluxes and vault steel 😅
---
It doesn't though.
---
 The only advantage is holding more scrap and it has little affect on anything. Before fallout 1st I had 60k 556 and 40,000 caps. My stash weight was always at 800 as I cycled legendary though the purveyor. Now I'm still around 60k 556 and 40,000 caps. The only difference is my stash weight is at 700 and I've got like 6 more weapons in my inventory.   
---
I'm not getting more XP. I have a little more scrap saved up but it hasn't done anything for me as I always kept bulks of 5 or more of everything and could repair or build anything whenever i wanted.   
---
To say its a "huge advantage" is ignorant. Its a very very  small advantage and that's a reach.
---
Have you done the enclave quest line? You shouldn’t be having that issue. I never did with my alt at those levels.  Just sounds like you’re unable to be allowed in that event.
---
Sounds like a particularly crappy server, try server hopping.
---
Is this on PS4? If so I know these guys, it is a nice tactic.
---
Take a bath, all that scorched killing is making you becone identified by robotic scents. No but seriously juat server hop. Robots and turrets have been acting up since the update. My camp is trying to shoot itself.
---
I was doing damage and getting loot from the SBQ at level 20.
---
Maxing out class freak along with one rank in each dromedary and slow metabolizer will basically eliminate that problem. Plus, carrot soup is godsend.
---
Yeah it's pretty boring ain't it? Gunplay is awful too. Did you tryout Rage2? Zero story and nothing else to do in the "open world" but enemy camps. But! The gunplay was absolutely incredible! ID all over it, Doom style with powers.
---
Oh nice. Yeah ps4. Would they take a friend request so I can join the clan? Like I said level 302 and did my fair share.
---
God no! I only ever had 200 creation points ever. They came with the game. I got a handful of free items and spent 100 points once. 100 left and I got no more **because no money spent**.
---
76? I've spent thousands **despite no money spent**.
---
Beth don't change it back please.
---
I’ll forward this post for ya. Could be them could not be. See where it goes bud.
---
So no Fisto?
---
Do you have your damage numbers on? You’ll always do at least 1 damage so something isn’t right. I know there’s a bug where you randomly don’t do damage unless you’re almost within melee distance.
---
And by the way, this is not "my issue"
---
That is how ridiculous you sound to me.
---
My friend primed a 50cal and then made a bunch of ammo for it today.  Is this happening to you on more than 1 server? I have that type of problem on laggy servers.
---
To be fair most are angry about food and thirst going down so fast because it feels shoehorned in. For fshakes you can't even die from being hungry or thirty and its literally all over the map. TDLR Forcing "Survival Mechanics" does not make the game good unless done right.
---
My only complaint during the first month was the amount of caps you would lose when you died.  They needed to have some sort of cap in place that prevented people from losing so much.  That's really the only reason I didn't play.  I got tired of getting rocked and losing 3-400 caps every time.  I wanted them to have a double cap reward based on your level maxed out at level 76.  This would have maxed everyone at 152 caps which is a nice amount but not too crazy on either end of the scale.   A level 10 player would lose 20 caps, level 50 100 caps, etc. 
---
I had zero problem with the way the combat worked aside from people spawn camping the train stations.  They just needed a bigger radius around them and it was fine.  Survival was a lot of fun.  I feel like the Devs gave up on it as soon as NW came out.
---
In my experience I’ve seen no one do this at all
---
Yes I have received free stuff yesterday and received the email the day before. 
---
1. Never opened a support ticket 
---
2. I did buy it the day it came out. 
---
3. I log in every day and did buy atoms in the pas so maybe thats an attribute?
---
Calculations have nothing to do with it. You didn't have 400 steel in your stash and for whatever reason you wanna lie about it on the internet and call people names. Take care.
---
Why are you so belligerent? Are you just hoping it doesn't get fixed? Are you one of "those" guys?
---
Savage divide i think near the cliff looking over lake gad
---
I'd much rather them charge for useless stuff, than stuff that is needed in game.
---
The same happened with MG Phantom Pain. Cassettes and holotapes.
---
Thanks man. Much appreciated.

The truth is, The game was rigged from the start.
---
I would be okay with that.
---
Always upvote positive solutions!
---
Nice work. Good job
---
I think you missed the whoosh
---
I just searched there. All I found was a small raider base.
---
Why are people still playing this shit?
---
I'm a little confused what you mean by my other posts, do you mean my comments? I don't want things to be easier, I want them to work (class freak/speed demon). The game is easy enough as it is. I forgot that there are perks to help with hunger and thirst, besides happy camper.
---
The spawn immunity was honestly the only fix that was halfway decent
---
Good games that aren’t 10 years old ;)
---
So Bethesda is Evil and it's totally intelligent practice to wait until day 30 to cancel a monthly recurring membership. Cool post
---
I’ve won once..still have zero kills.
---
Its not a stretch that china could have captured power armor, but failes to replicate it so instead slapped some armor on top of the USA frame.
---
I have a character with poison resistance armor to the max, like 125/150. 
---
Some enemies still melt you down.
---
You have to do a certain amount of total damage to complete the event and loot the SBQ....I am not sure what that level is but I have seen a post before about this.....You do not need to complete Enclave to participate(I have a level 160 alt Character that is not Envclave and run SBQs all night long)....I have also in the past died during the fight and logged back in but not done enough damage after logging back in to loot her, still got the event completion though.  My guess would be that  your weapon is not doing enough overall damage to her.   When I was level 50ish I would get in PA with and explosive shotty and just blast her as much as I could and that seemed to work.....I then changed to a 50 cal that definitely worked and now a Mutant Explosive Ultracite 50 cal that is a monster against her.....With PA and all the heavy perk cards you could technically have a very powerful heavy gunner build by level 50-60 and the right weapon.....Peace!!
---
That doesnt happen. Also a myth. Private servers are fresh instances.
---
The rest of the stuff they just went too crazy with.  I didn't really like the leader board that much but I never could come up with a reasonable way to change it.  It just seemed dumb that you rose up the board for doing regular stuff.
---
If nothing else, build a platform and people will use it.

This is my usual run. Still searching for a bloodied handmade and fixer. but my bloodied Tesla...
---
the other posts/messages you sent...again just trying to help...I will let you know my results tomorrow or Monday...have a great weekend!!
---
Iirc another fallout game mentions that China was trying to / close to replicating the technology, but obviously never did.
---
In the game it works because its just chinese armor slapped on top of a made-in-USA power armor frame.
---
We have a lot of trolls here. One the other day posted on a thread saying they had fallout 1st and making claims. They then said in another thread they didn't even have the game.
---
Dunno why people bother but there you go.
---
(And no obviously I'm not saying everybody with complaints is a troll - to the twats that wanted to argue a out something)
---
I'd also go for a duffle bag slug over my shoulder or on my back. Maybe even one with a skin making it look like some kind of bank bag from the Lucky 38. I say Lucky 38 because of a datamined story element for the upcoming Wastelander's story.
---
I think you did too.  ✌️
---
Look at the reply counts. Is pretty small. Have you submitted a ticket?
---
The leaderboard should’ve been kill based, and sentinel assassins shouldn’t have been nerfed.
---
That looks amazing good job 😍😍❤
---
That sounds about right....all the rifle perks plus bloody mess and tank killer  my TSE Gauss does about 850 base damage....take some chems and meats and sneak at 2.25 and it gets that or higher....just the base with sneak would be 1900
---
Hmm no idea been months since i have been near it
---
Fuck
---
The Burrows, while not unique, is a solid uncommon option. You can get the spoils from the ghouls above, in Harper's Ferry...then chill in the tunnels and hope for some 3* Legendaries.
---
The only time I get griefed is when I claim workshops. Now I only claim them in private servers. lol
---
Where was the platform setup. V9? Somewhere else?
---
pay to win means advantages you pay for that otherwise others dont get. It doesnt mean literally "winning".
---
That's what she said
---
That’s fantastic ❤️
---
It is missing the cult of the interloper.
---
Snake? Snake?? Snaaaaaaaake!!!
---
I am on PC sadly. Hope you find who you are looking for.
---
I don't even care about downvotes, It's probably just someone who doesn't like having to explain themselves so they downvote all inquiries lol.
---
So based on what you said, I think we're just wildly opposite. Personally, I made the outfits and never put them on (I do love outfits, though). I hoard tons of junk and as I have 4 characters (255, 157, 117, 57), It is immensely helpful to be able to move stuff between characters with the private 'server' (and yeah, I'm a xenophobe or xenophile depending on my mood). Plus freeing up all the stash space allows me to hold onto and sell some great gear that I won't use (normally I would have scrapped great gear I don't have a use for). I think I'll get a year sub though, as you basically get twice the Atoms you would if you purchased them in the shop. So it's just an amazing deal because I like the major additions (I think everyone should have access to a Scrap Box and implement a FT Tent in as a Squirrel Scout reward or something), I couldn't care less about the icons or the dance emotes though.
---
Anyhow, thanks for the insight
---
Whattt? Nuke the steakhouse get like 200+ of the stuff
---
What's your perk setup and weapon of choice?
---
Same here. Not gonna lie that stash box is killer, but it's not a feature I'm willing to pay a monthly fee for and while the private server is nice, I find myself on public servers more often because the social side of the game is what makes it fun anyway.
---
I love absolutely everything about this!
---
Glad to see you read the post before commenting.
---
I noticed this as well, hitting Enter to confirm instead of clicking seems to make it work. I really haven't documented the frequency or anything but I click where I want to go and hit Enter twice and rarely experience an issue other than the 15 second countdown if theres mobs nearby lol
---
I made 154 earlier today.  been doing WS  since about L27.
---
granted, just the for caps runs only in the last 50 levels or so.  WS usually spawns several legendaries at least : 1 along the cottages, one in the laundry builing, and usually one in the golf clubhouse.  Takes longer, but theres lots of stuff inside the resort proper that can be picked u and sold - phones, vases, clipboards, whatever you ind in the trash cans, plastic in the theater....
---
If uranium fever pops, go for it.  It can be solo’d, and At least one legendary in there, lots of steel and black titanium drops.
---
If thats not a viable option for you, try Morgantown airport.  THeres lots of stuff in the hangars.  Also make sure to do the event And loot all the bodies.  Never seen a legendary here
---
The prison is good for ghouls, mutants, and materials. no legendaries here, either
---
Jesus... Do you people even read the post?!? This is such a garbage comment.!
---
I love to grief people, its honestly fun
---
And I already agreed that it seems excessive... as compensation. 
---
It's still not P2W and nobody is making a rational argument otherwise. xD
---
So, the problem is, the general consensus here is that pacifist mutations will not trigger PVP on wanted players. You are arguing the opposite. Because you are against the consensus, the burden of proof is on you. You refuse to give us any empirical evidence supporting your claim. You ridicule us for not simply trusting your experiences and disregarding our own.
---
If you need some ideas on how to gather empirical evidence to support your claims, simply look through some of my top posts where I use videos and numbers testing to back up my claims.
---
If that is too difficult for you to do, you can take your anecdotal experiences and shove them up your own ass.
---
Try priming the weapon of choice.  Use an endangerol syringer or rad scorpion syringer. Get some adrenaline going on before you attack her.  Armour penetration is important too.
---
Holy mother of god... READ THE POST BEFORE COMMENTING!!!
---
I've cut it down to mostly two tries by moving a few feet forward and crouching before trying again but yeah this is some bullshit with this bug already. I preferred the bug where it wouldn't let you fast travel because "enemies are present" because it was so much less prevalent.
---
Yeah I know the one you speak of but don't know the location but if no one knows we will go find it for you ..
---
Same with just north of the burrows, 200+ easy
---
No I’m pretty sure it was always supposed to be a table but the photos are misleading just like on the Bar table.
---
Look at the Editor ID - it’s an ATX (Atom Shop) item.
---
Not all unmarked locations are tied to Nukashine. And Nukashine breaks your game and gives you the infinite blurry eye animation.
---
Oh thank u!
---
The only thing I know is that its on the edge of a cliff on the east side of the savage divide, apparently overlooking the mire and cranberry bog.
---
What he probably means this is a spawn location for nukashine and someone probably right here when they drank it.
---
I think it's west-south-west of camp venture
---
I've never received that, what format do you play on? Pretty sure I've came across OP's location during a trip though.
---
You really are a bit of a dick aren't you. 
---
People are just trying to be helpful, maybe instead of deriding them for an easy mistake you can chime in with something helpful, you know what this sub is really for. A quick look at your profile seems to back this up as it's all you seem to do.
---
Head to east mountain lookout , follow the cliff edge from north east towards harpers ferry. 
---
It’s around there somewhere 👍
---
Troubleshooter Armor. Laugh at the Colonel and Assaultron. Also, open the storage room door in the mainframe room. Makes for an easy return if you die.
---
Hmm that’s not a whole lot to go off of. Sadly I don’t know, not off the top of my head anyways. Why do u two want to revisit it so badly?
---
Cheers quickpee ;)
---
I had this happen with the punchbowl, I couldn't put in alcohol because it said camp budget exceeded.  I deleted a floor decoration, put in the alcohol then replaced the item.
---
No I mean it can be done solo but even when you get it right it can bug out &amp; either not register or just starts over again.
---
It's NEVER happened first go with me. Requires at least 3-4 tries.
---
Happens at the table setting quest too. At least the jumpsuits
---
Never knew about this. 
---
Tbh just commented so I can keep checking back for the location.
---
Yes I have the same problem I'm in a ticket war with Bethesda support atm trying to get half or full refund.. Something because when I bought worked great as advertised.. Took a month or 2 break from the game come back and I can't use my fridge... Paid 700atoms for a fridge decoration...
---
Good point, especially in a world where a cup of coffee is something like $29.00.
---
you might getting staggered.  try adamantium skeleton and pneumatic torso mod.  also consider just not fighting against players with tesla rifles.  They're the worst part of 76 PVP.
---
Laughed real hard at this!  Very creative!
---
If you build it, they will come.
---
Simply logging in and out fixed it for me and it hasn't done it again since
---
+100 couldn't agree more.  Just adjusting the workshop for a little choice would be awesome.
---
Although, I love the idea of two workshops right next to each other, so you can do a player + workshop vs Player + workshop.  Ohh, possibly even allow for part of it to be shared build space.  You could have a blast with teams on that, I think.
---
Well, since they haven't openly allowed nodding yet, it's the only option.
---
I'm offended. I'll have you know I'm an equal opportunity griefer, damn it!
---
Cool
---
Friend didn’t lose anything but was on private server with another friend that did lost their scrap box inventory and they both got the free stuff including that 600 vault steel lol (Xbox)
---
Fusion cores and energy ammo are affected by the armor's effect. Only logical that explosive ammo would be as well.
---
If they’re payment processor doesn’t do it - they can’t do it.
---
Because 9 times out of 10 the people who attack me never claim the workshop for themselves, they just kill me because they can. It's especially frustrating when you go through the entire Powering Up quests to get Fusion Cores and then some squad of level 200-300s just come and reap your rewards.
---
Did you lose your scrap? Everyone else got compensation if that's the case. If it's like a legendary though there's nothing they can do.
---
From bethesda - I made an inquiry about scrap loss etc.
---
Yes I understand, you are absolutely right.  Thanks for commenting.  My intention with posts like this is to give BGS some insight into what is causing players to get so bored with their game that they quit.
---
I already said that they know about it.
---
You can get a submachine gun and equip a Scorched Killer's Receiver - it increases the rate of fire by a huge amount and does the equivalent of a Hardened reciever's worth of damage, but it's all about the dps. When the Queen la d's try to hit it in the head or just to empty a few clips into it's wings and side - even if you can't equip the Tank Killer perk you'll be doing enough damage to see the health drop slowly
---
Same thing i annoyed with. In the past i have provided video evidence of losing lead after trading and fast traveling to my camp, got same message as you did. What really gets me is my friend lost a little over 200lbs of scrap and in return he gets a ton more mats than he ever had, including vault steel even though hes never ran the raid. Happy for him annoyed because he gave me the heads up about losing stuff and i didn't use my scrap box for a couple days
---
Weird. Is this a reported bug? Maybe I've missed it cause I'm on Xbox.
---
Lost scrap and I lost legendaries, filled tickets in both cases. Literally got nothing, wheres my sympathy package?
---
Nice thank you bother.
---
Yep.. same here. I have a friend who literally got enough for 6 suits of armor and hasn't run the raid once.
---
Ha nice
---
Did you lose the scrap in the scrap box?
---
I know exactly who you’re talking about, I enjoy tagging along the fringes of this group - all really positive guys, very friendly and supportive/cooperative.   I like just playing ground support, as a bloody rifleman also I’m much more supportive working on the spawn. 
---
PSN me BrianRIvy and I’ll let you know who they are, I don’t know if they want to get blasted on Reddit. 
---
(The platform is damn smart, isn’t it?  There’s a story behind it apparently)
---
fridge
---
No I’m not 100% sure, but everyone I knew lost everything
---
Mr Pebbles runs the show I think
---
Geez, what's wrong with playing the game. I want my 600 vault steel! No one gives a fack, and we have to believe you on this forum, that's a stretch =\]
---
Is Fallout chill in China? Either it definitely wouldn't be, or it fits into the "all in good fun" wishy washy timeline fantasy pass category.
---
There is indeed a story about it.
---
That's what I just told my wife, it's just a decoration. I did delete a small item from my camp, and it let me put 5 items in it. But I don't understand why it has anything to do with camp budget, when it is under stash budget in the fridge.
---
tbh i dunno haha. my parents are British but i was born in NA. I'll let the professionals at Bethesda decide what to call it 🤣
---
I completely understand how they could see this as a violation (already explained below).. so why not find a better game where you thoroughly enjoy and doesn't make you feel like you have to do exploitive type things to have a good time? Find something that has true experiences and good loot for accomplishing something.. like raids, hoards, trials, etc. This comment isn't intended to be negative but rather the complete opposite. I played this game... and moved on to much better games from much better developers. Just imagine world without constant buggy shit, shittiass judgemental community, or power-happy $8/hr customer service just waiting to hit a "ban" button with sticky chili-cheese frito dust crusted fingers. \*caveat: all games have issues, but not all games have the atrouis amount of bullshit that this game offers day in and day out\*
---
I played the Outer Worlds when it came out, ended up going back to 76 and made a new character. But Outer Worlds is a fun story-driven RPG with decent replay value, I would recommend it. 
---
However, level 55 is not "high level" at all, not even close. I would recommend just go exploring, especially the Mire area, sneaking through the cranberry bog, pick up notes and shit. I often run into a lot of legendaries off the beaten path. Too many people just hit the regular Whitespring and WestTek bullshit, I say go run around and make your own fun.
---
But if you don’t report it when it happens they don’t know the frequency or under which conditions it happens.
---
I see that uranium fever is kicking in
---
Meant to bring this up the other day when people were talking about the absence of high-radiation fluids, I happened to be on servers where someone nuked Morgantown on two separate occasions. Well, by the time I got there there were still a lot of enemies - but there were quite a few enemies that were dropping high radiation fluids. I don't know if that's a regular thing for that location, but for those two occasions it was. I had about 17 HRF after I left there, the scorched that are around the airport where dropping them pretty often.
---
The shills deliberately try to act smart by saying "hOw dO i wIN?" when they clearly know what it means.
---
Dude $12 is a steal. Just buy it for that price.
---
Well done wastelander.
---
also an increase in item wheel slots (due to extra accessibility) and another +50 style
---
700 atom fridge? Or is there a bundle for $7 you can buy one directly?
---
According to your other posts earlier today, you didn't loose anything from the Fallout 1st scrap box issue and at that time, just three hours ago, you claimed you did not file any tickets for items you lost before Fallout 1st.  Based on your other posts in this sub, I don't think you're being very honest here making it sound like you got ef'd over from Fallout 1st, when that is apparently not the case.
---
Rage chronicles on you tube has a video about it and so does the face book group who called themselves the beach boys
---
That’s great man. Love this group. I’m a good guy here as well.
---
you dont need a private server to make 1400 caps in loot in 30 minutes.
---
Run Westtek, loot everything.  Walk to vendor.  Profit.
---
Funny because I was thinking the same thing about Stash space. I thought the posts about it being too small we're strange considering it's a whopping 800lbs, but a month in and I completely understand. 
---
Out of curiosity what do you like taking pictures of? Or is it strictly for the challenges? I like taking pictures of things that look like loading screen images.
---
What exactly happened to you? Did you lose all of your scrap like those players?
---
I forgot I filed tickets. I searched my email and found them.
---
Look around trashcans, you mat find a few copies.
---
So the people that pvp in adventure mode need therapy? WRONG! Fanny pack for them, fanny pack for YOU!
---
That is under the power tower at the northern edge of Camp McClintock.  No mannequins there.
---
Stealth boys are the only counter to vats, and vats is op in pvp.
---
So yeah, i agree stealth boys need a nerf but do does vats. Imo vats shoul just highlight players and build up the crit bar but no aimbot.
---
Is being a snivelling crybaby helping to get it back? lol
---
Re: Chocolate chicken pot pies: You sound like Eric Cartman.
---
Btw, I never played back in whatever good old shitheads hay day you're talking about. I joined after all that and like the game's PvP settings as they are. So, you're bitching at the wrong person about bitching. Still, if you want to fight people, play a different game. It's that goddamned simple. PvP in this game is idiotic anyway. And it changed because **most people don't agree with you**. Deal with it.
---
Probably around your level I used a lv50 plain handmade/fixer and did enough for sometimes
---
Ooooo detective Zilch3raven has blown this case wide open!
---
Its a very well known bug where if you drink nukashine your character will be permanently stuck in the blurry-eye opening effect and infinitely teleport to nukashine locations. Its gamebreaking and the only fix is to quit and restart.
---
But you can do the same thing in a non private server....
---
Its been happening since before meat week its why I took a break off the game after meat week ended yet finally I went in the game again and its still happening
---
Especially considering that this is local storage to the console/PC and does not effect the server at all... Makes no sense to be 50, just seems arbitrarily low.
---
Haven’t seen this but the idea is awesome.
---
No more having to constantly watch your back for mobs appearing out of the brush.
---
Same issue.  
---
Couldn’t be bothered deleting anything to make it work because I shouldn’t have to.
---
As aforementioned, yes. I also lost legendaries in the regular box.
---
Ha. That’s cool. Thank you.
---
You can do the same thing In a non private server tho...
---
FALSE: on Xbox I have had fo1st since the day it came out and I did not get any vault steel! 
---
I’ve done the raid once successfully on standard with a good team I was lucky enough to be invited to join for a raid.  600 vault steel is insane.  That’s all the vault steel I have and I checked just 4 or whatever it is from that standard run...
---
I have an Xbox friend that did get the 600 VS but did not lose any items to the scrap box.  he had a friend on his private server that did lose all items in scrap box on his server and they both got the make up goods from BS.  From my understanding they were teamed at the time it happened.
---
Do I feel left out, yes.  I don’t think ppl that didn’t lose stuff should get anything.  Their tools are amateur.  It is what it is, but I’m gonna guess we will start seeing a lot of raid armor and PA now for the lucky ones.  600 VS is a big deal to me as a paying subscriber and I’m not sure I’m going to continue because of it as it feels unfair and I can vote with my wallet.
---
Yea, I meant the 700 atom
---
Where is the terminal to hack the robots?
---
Its been really bad lately
---
It’s the greatest thing I’ve ever seen. 😃 even at level 302 I still get whacked here and there cause I’m a bloody build. And then I get dropped in the middle of the nukes zone. so annoying 😃
---
Makes a huge difference when you are with an “A” team of players and not a bunch off N00bs who dont know their own ass from a hole in the ground!
---
there is no survival anymore.. do you mean nuclear winter?
---
Yeah, but you left those details out of your original post making sound like at least to me, that you lost scrap in Fallout 1st and were somehow screwed over, when in fact, you lost items *before* Fallout 1st.  Three hours ago you claimed in another post that you never filed a ticket for those items and now you "forgot" you submitted tickets and they just now showed up in your email.  Sorry, but I'm calling this BS.
---
I pay and still think the scrapbox should have been for everyone. It would take a huge thorn out of people's sides. People can spin it however they want but every single person i play with hates their storage limitation. That shouldn't be resolved with money. If its 100lbs or 600lbs of freed up space like me. That's a huge change up. I can now store cooking supplies spare weapons and tons of chems for selling. 
---
 I think the tent and server should stay to the paid players as an incentive to continue paying. It is an advantage for scrapping but honestly that's the one thing i haven't complained about doing in the  year i played the game without the tent.
---
I use a BE prime laser rifle. 2 weeks ago I swapped out bloody mess for luck of the draw and since then ive seen god mode pop up twice. it is not triggered by bloody mess or burning damage
---
THIS SO MUCH THIS! it's even worse on my crafting character (my old main) as I have to try and work out if I know a mod or it's just taking some random hard to find one I collected many moons ago. Then you drop it and heaven forbid the game crashes and you didn't know the mod...
---
I could spend a day listing all of the issues I have with this game, the developer, and publisher. That said, $12 for the current state of the game is a steal. But if you want to try your luck, check online retailers like amazon, walmart, best buy, and such until the monday after thanksgiving. The monday after thanksgiving was nicknamed Cyber Monday and is the online shopping equivilant without people trying to kill you for a busted flatscreen.
---
Lol I see you found buddy who has the camp. We will be doing it tonight
---
People blew their anger load over a scrap bot and a fridge. I've been saying this entire time the atom shop is fine and they aren't paid *unless you pay* but ooohhh no I'm downvoted for being a FaNbOi and a ShIlL.
---
Fallout 1st? I can't get that for free. *That* is different. But hey it feels too late because most the community flipped their shit over some costumes getting very slight bonuses for 1 week 8 months ago.
---
Beware the Scorched Jabberwocky
---
very well put! and my sincerest thanks! may all future kicks in your appalachian jewels be absorbed by the contents of your fanny pack!
---
"Yeah, but you left out those". I have a real life dude lol. I forgot things about the game.
---
What do you play on? If ps4 I’ll help
---
Ps4 - Bmain905
---
It should just be any and all food items in your stash
---
I saw a guy with a mail man outfit the other day! Where the hell has that been? It’s even got the cool bag!
---
I’d go for that rather than the royal battle thing
---
I didn’t get anything or lose anything, but I know hard it is to earn vault steel.
---
Friend got all the free stuff that DID NOT lose anything to scrapbox. 
---
He had another friend on his private server that lost all their scrap due to the glitch.  Both got compensated. 
---
Do I feel left out? Yes.
---
I’m considering stopping subscription due to this.  VS is super hard to earn and getting 600 free for doing nothing and losing nothing is a monsterous slap in the face to me as a subscriber.  Thanks Bethesda for dissing me as a paying customer, I can vote with my wallet and return the favor.
---
Getting both of these 'features' on PC, going nowhere and gone to somewhere else.
---
Had a similar thought for a PvP game on private servers. Basically 3v3 (world owner and a third party remain out of the fight). 
---
A specific junk item  is placed in a centrally located container that both sides are made aware of.  Teams spawn in at assigned locations. Once it starts they rush to get the "flag". When an opponent kills them, they drop the "flag" for another to pick up. 
---
Whichever team gets to the final destination with the "flag" wins.
---
I have never experienced this and I was running around with 1st player icon and ranger armour on my level 8-30 character for a week or two before I changed the icon and ditched the outfit.
---
I’m sure it happens, but griefers don’t need a reason to grief someone.
---
...or maybe extra helmets can be flipped over and turned into aquariums, then buy the little fishies
---
Shit. That's a dull yin like. So it affects PC only then?

I've been lucky enough to load in with this group (or a copy or) twice now. Absolute blast to run with. At the time, my build was all over the place as I had no idea what I was doing. Now I'm a 190 bloodied melee build dealing damage in the 1ks to queenie. Still looking for the perfect armor peices. Lol. I wish I could have caught the names of said runners but alas, I had the same luck amd crashed somewhere into the 3rd run.
---
Looks "fine" to me. The front wheels are obviously damaged, so it has to "walk" to keep moving.
---
Yes, i meant NW perks do work
---
Lol using wheels to walk! Pretty funny
---
I use corn soup for the AP bonus. Not necessarily better, but another option.
---
Holy crap man! Kudos for having the time/patience/attention to detail to ferret all of this out. If I ever need an IRL mystery solved I'm coming to you!
---
Amazing !!!
---
Cdkeys.com possibly?

It’s not great, but it’s really only worth a sigh of mild irritation.  I’m sure they have a list of bugs rated from FML to LOL, and this one is somewhere in the middle.
---
It seems to be related to enemy proximity to some degree.  If you move a few yards and try again, it’ll work after 1-3 tries.
---
I can do it for you, my GT is the same as my username.
---
Doing it for the same reason my dog drags it's ass across the carpet...
---
Nuclear Fallout Raider Nation... look me up my GT is: Raider OverBoss

Did he lose anything during the stashbox bug? The one that cleared inventories, if so then that could be it
---
This is why we need a server chat box better to chat with randos

Why are you speaking for others that you have no authority to speak for?

I enjoy pvp and came to fallout 76 specifically because PVP was promised. And I know i wasn't the only one. Also pvp was consensual.  For those who didn't want to participate they could just ignore my aggressive advances. Sexual innuendo intended. 
---
You're claiming 90% of people wanted nothing to do with pvp. Besides the fact that is an extreme exaggeration to back up your own confirmation bias, I literally was able to get about 70ish% of anybody i challenged to a fight to engage in pvp with me.  And i did this hundreds of times. 
---
And i enjoyed every single second of it.  So yes. It was fun. People like me had fun engaging in pvp. 
---
You're just straight ass wrong about caps. On release caps rewards were absolutely fantastic.  I funded my entire mutations with full price serums from the bunker off pvp in a single day.  For pvpers the cap limit was a real problem. 
---
As for junk you could not be MORE wrong.  Remember those weight exploiters who would carry around tens of thousands of pounds of junk?  Get one of them to foolishly engage in pvp with you and you literally had more junk than you could ever handle. Take what you wanted and dump the rest and do a good deed for the day by improving server stability.  I still have 7000+ screws i have been whittling down slowly.
---
And i encountered these weight exploiters and stole their hoards of junk easily dozens of times.  I literally threw away hundreds of thousands of pounds of junk because I just couldn't handle it all, and i sure as hell wasn't going to use the weight exploit myself. 
---
And finally to really show case that literally every single thing you said was wrong the Live action Fallout 76 Trailer showcased what was obviously a pvp stand off.  Not to mention the most talked about feature in ALL the dev talks  prior to release was how pvp functioned.
---
Fantastic!
---
It’s a fun group. There’s definitely a place for snipers to post up and watch the backs of the heavy guns that take the SBQ down. We should team up and post up on top of the forward camps too - message me and we’ll team snipe from different sides.  😎👍🏻
---
Nice sleuthing!! Nick would be proud!!
---
The problem with the whole theory is that there isn't really any resolution.  Remember the pics they teased of the burrows?? It showed a diving suit no one discovered as of yet. It made me think there was an underwater tunnel somewhere inside the burrows. I searched high and low and never discovered anything like this.
---
What is your theory about what happens next?
---
Same here King_of_Flames5 and I play very often.
---
He says in the video that he did not lose anything at all in his Scrap Box.

Right? The wife and I dropped a nuke the other night and the first one, queenie took the group maybe 4 minutes to kill. No one fired a shot while she was in the air, save one or two to antagonize her, and no one clambored ontop of V9. Fastest I've seen her done in yet. We logged off and then later on dropped another one. Total group of noobs. 22 min in she had landed once and i was starting to think we'd fail this one. 4 minutes to go she landed and we finished her off with under a minute on the clock... Funny how different an experience it can be.

Please; don’t use inmortal glitch on PvP
---
If you're being griefed be a Wanted player it can trigger PVP. Seems to count as an attack on the Wanted player and opens you up to retaliation. Unsure if that has changed during the last patch.
---
I had this happen to me during Meat Week. I run Unstoppable Isotope and was getting griefed by a team after the event. My toon got naked and started doing the finger gun dance at them. One of them decided to get a Wanted status and came back. Once my defense proc'd on him I wasn't finger gun dancing anymore...
---
How do we know where to find you so we can kill you and your raider scum friends? :)
---
What were you doing when you lost those things?
---
Suppressors middle launcher.... thanks Todd
---
pass the nukashine
---
O.o
---
Only way is too take all junk you want to keep out of stash and drop it while youre crafting. Verry annoying
---
Yes I've been there. I forgot about it till I started building this one and someone reminded me about it and I almost moved my camp over there.
---
And please allow them to be stored server side (Xbox One). 
---
I uninstalled/later reinstalled the game and lost all 50 memories of mine and my pal's adventures. 
---
I reinstalled to an external HDD when initially the game was on the internal HDD -- could that be why? Is there any chance of me getting those photos back?
---
Thank you! That sucks but it’s what I’m gonna have to do to keep all my stuff.
