Also, don't forget to bulk your aluminum and lead -- they weigh less afterwards.

sorry to necro, but did you ever get this to work?

Excavator PA plus Lucky Hope mine is the best way to get lead ore, and crickets spawn there sometimes for acid. Breach and Clear also yields a ton of ore.

Screws are what I run out of more than anything else. (And ballistic fiber once I got to the higher levels)

You need a ledg handmade

It's possible if you want to do it.  It's just about impossible to get into pvp accidentally (as long as you're aware that workshops are pvp)

That's just the answer I was looking for. I "Googled" it but there is so much BS to ferret through it's exhausting. Thank y'all for the concise info. Cheers, raf1

Are you on PC and do you have decor/furniture plans or just all recipes? I get so excited to travel to camps that have tons of plans only to find out they're all recipes.

i farmed whatever i could to get a full set of chameleon armor not caring what kind it is and used a vampires rolling pin and whatever was the best rifle for me. still use chameleon armor just upgrade it to better pieces when i find em.

If you're on PC, I'd GLADY have some of my screws be taken out a my stash!

I like combat armor. Depending on when you were last on you can trade in Legendary items for Scrip that buys a random legendary item and there is a sale on now. A good way to catch up quick.

How are you going to keep our known hackers? Is there a system in place for that?

Thankyou for that warm nostalgia.i completely forgot about

U on PS4? I have some level 45 gear to help ya out

I’m aware.  And it clearly lists which creatures you have to chose from and most of them, when killed, do not complete.  Such as Scorched Tick and Scorched Yao Gaui.

Take a look at the discord, we have rules in place in order to participate. We are doing everything we can.

Always go back to my rifleman running a lever as primary weapon. She's evolved over time and is now stealth + bloodied. Bloodied lever, bloodied railway, quad explosive handmade. Assortment of Tesla rifles to swap in and out depending on the situation.

I've got one of every meta build I think and rifleman seems to be the one I enjoy the most for casual play.

Honestly man, if you can make marine armor or combat armor those both work fine. As far as actual DR, armor is only somewhat effective. Perks however, are generally more efficient at giving you damage reduction.  Power armor by far gives the most of these stats, so withought legendary effects Id say that you're better of using that than actual armor. Here are some perks to look out for that give you damage resistance/mitigation in general, stacking these cards will reward you with a ton of survivability

Once you start looking at legendarys things get complicated. Generally your build is centered around a legendary weapon/weapon type. So if you're bloodied, the effects Unyielding and bolstering both work very well, however if you're not using a bloodied build Vanguards/sentinels is probably your best bet. Sentinel gives you a 75% chance to reduce damage by 15%, stack those pieces as well as some perks and you'll find you're really tough. Sentinel only works when you're standing still, however jumping does not count as moving.
---
75% knew before they came, the rest were randoms :)
---
I would like it if it was xbox and ps4, pc has the ability to easily mod and cheat which is an unfair advantage and would prefer to have a level playing field. Just my opinion.
---
Nice QE Assault Rifle!

I always stand in line, but at a point where I can interact with the vendor as I don't know how many times someone else would not wait for everyone else to take their turn. Now I spam that shit if there are more than 2 waiting.
---
No never heard of them. My son plays as well he’s 20 and we both try and help the lower lvls as much as we can rather it be giving them stuff, helping with events or just answering questions. I’ve played since beta and wish I would have had help sometimes lol would have made picking cards and getting through some events easier and less time consuming. Is your group on PS4? If so maybe we’ll cross paths one day and kick some but together. Our focus now is stopping the bullies that came from survival and keeping them from bullying lower lvls, seems to be happing a lot since it was shut down.
---
High INT missile/grenade launcher. the only way to make it viable is all armor gives int and weight reduction, 2 shot or anti armor launcher, and dense armor for danger close protection
---
That seems like a dick move you jerk, you stole their stuff, try not to fuck with people unless they know you.
---
Only time I shoot at people in my camp is if I'm trying to log off and don't want them to die from the fall of my Seneca Rocks camp and they aren't paying attention to my mic.   
---
 
---
I wish there was a "I gotta go!" emote for the people that have area chat turned off.
---
I’m quite happy for those people. They never played this mess of a game
---
No one had power armour then, besides one dude. We were at an event and about 20 people were there with a dude in a chasis and everyone else were in awe
---
Ooohhhh...color me intrigued.

Just getting around to the possum challenges but electrician still seems to be broken.
---
I just started a couple months ago and I'm a lvl 125 just hit today. That is really cool tried getting my son to play but he plays other games so now I use his account as my mule. But yeah they are a good group of players who do what u do. They have groups on all platforms and are on reddit. Yeah no doubt without survival they all now bother low lvl, had one try starting with me and I pulled out my AAE plasma gatling and fired off a few rounds and they headed for the hills...lol I also carry a tesla for those hard to find stealth players lol if ur on. It will be interspersed  to see if they find an outlet for players like that.
---
My armor nothing over 1000, weapons nothing over 3500. I realize it’s a game and not real life, some don’t. I’m not going to give grind hard stuff away (stable flux) but will help a lower lvl with out thinking because I don’t forget where I started. When i see a common 3* going for 15k I just laugh and roll on. The biggest thing to remember is you have to somewhat buy if you want, nobody’s making you spend anything you don’t want. If you feel someone’s to high, just don’t buy!

---
I first played in december and things were surprisingly similar. I don't think that's the launch so i was quite surprised.
---
To be fair, there are some good reasons to dislike this community.
---
Man i do NOT have that problem. There has been many a time where I'm taking everything from the Whitespring that isn't nailed down just for ammo. 50 plus flower vases...don't mind if i do!
---
The only thing shotguns seem to excel at with the right perk cards is crippling mobs
---
November was the launch, so still kind of new.
---
I read what you said and responded but you keep passing over it. And again, they’re doing that. They were doing that when you chastised them for participating in the community. They do that when someone reports a bug. It has been a lot more frequent than once a week. They have a slew of CMs on here. Again, they’re not the dev team, they can’t troubleshoot code in front of us all and find what the cause for each problem is. They can only report and participate in the community and try to be as helpful as they can. They’re not going to hover over the devs while they’re working with cameras.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
They’re not doing a poor job. Management knew this game was not ready to release and put pressure on the devs to get it to where it was when it released and now they’re likely putting the pressure on the devs to fix what they boldly released. Everyone in this industry knows damn well that game should have had more dev time. It was a cash grab that didn’t payoff that well. Things are about 50% better now but if you want to yell at someone, write the chiefs. The community team did not choose to release this game. The devs did not choose to release this game. Again we’re at the “would you yell at the cashier for being out of a stocked item?” No, you wouldn’t, because they’re not in charge of inventory.
---
We both paid $60 because that’s the risk we took on buying a Day 1 game. It sucks, it’s not fair, but the issue isn’t in the lower departments, it’s in the upper management.
---
The only thing it's worth bulking (unless you're selling) is Lead and Aluminum. Everything else is same weight or more bulked. [Here's a great resource guide] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/edit?usp=sharing) from u/Descendent1784

---
With the bullies I usually ignore but there’s some who persist and I’ll suppress my mutations quickly, then I play the aggravation game unless I’m busy. I’ve found if you stay in their face following them and allow them to waste ammo it drives them nuts. I literally stay up on them following them until they leave. Never been cussed so bad in 46 years then buy a bully who can’t do nothing but either keep shooting or run trying to get me to leave them alone. Hopefully they think twice before trying someone else. I was told by one that I was no better then him for what I was doing. He tried for 30 min to PvP and then I followed him for an hour. He hopped servers but he got the point. Gaming is one thing my son and I use to bond. He plays a lot of other games as well but me, for now 76. He makes a lot of time to play as dad being his partner in good lol. He brought home FO3 as a kid and we fell in love with all the FO and ES series. ES online not so much. I raised a gamer cause I was at his age and it kept me outta trouble lol.
---
That's fun?
---
some people do i guess, personally i have not played it much as i wasn't a fan
---
I once ended up helping a high level (well, 200+?) player with an event (or much more likely, he was helping ME with it). He was in power armor and it looked like he was skating around. His power armor even looked like it was some weird ... unicycle? as he moved around. I have no idea how he was doing that it didn't seem like a bug or a glitch.
---
Griefers and PvP bullies make me dislike some of the community but all in all it’s pretty great. If I emote no, I don’t want to PvP then move on.
---
Will definitely check it out, thanks!
---
FYI chameleon stacks at three. Meaning the last two pieces of you're set arnt effecting anything

Legit the first time I came to Flatwoods where like 7 guys Just T-baging bc reasons. What a lovely day it was.

Thanks! Got both of those at 3 points, they are very nice :)
---
Death is inconsequential really in this game, don't like it as you gain over 20% health, but not carrying anything I like to run right down to a hair of health and take a brahmin milk if I have to. Keeps me on my toes so to speak.

Sounds like a awesome play style

I used to be in the “more stash, horde everything” camp.  I wasn’t playing a ton (hour or so a day max) and felt like I needed to pick up everything to be sure I got my 1400 caps per day.
---
Then I got a Marine Tactical Helmet plan (Civil War Era Hat would also work) and I realized I could have my 1400 from very minimal junk and I could focus collection on what it should be:
---
1 - items I would personally use
---
2 - items others would consistently and quickly purchase
---
3 - delicious delicious scrip
---
This new way of thinking changed my limiting resource from being junk/caps to being playtime (not unlike my real life - time is worth so much more than stuff or money).   It’s actually made the game much more fun - I am no longer spending half my playtime trying to figure out which items are worth saving, I’m just enjoying the game, killing things, exploring.
---
Fallout 4 taught us to save every last bit of stuff, but unlearning that philosophy is very freeing.
---
Yea condition rate is a little iffy but still good
---
I feel like the launch of wastelanders will be similar
---
Seen then been sold for 3k
---
We will launch a whole volley at them, free of charge
---
I would like to see both

The keypad door has two connection points. One for the keypad and another closer to the actual door.

The one connected closer to the door has to have a pressure plate in the middle otherwise it'll keep the door open.

What makes you think he stole their stuff? He just said 75% of them wanted to be flung, there’s no harm in this if they were able to retrieve their junk you fool
---
That is a very nice roll.
---
Ah.. thanks for the tip.
---
They were bugged then fixed, not nurfed. The explosive legendary effect was doing damage PER PELLET. It was WAY over powered and needed to be fixed.   
---
Asking maybe for a damage increase would be okay I guess, but the damage is in line with other weapons atm so I don't see it happening.
---
Thank you for not being a dick and pricing it at 5,000 or something. People like you make the vending experience worthwhile 👍
---
Try and find one. I've seen many scorched gulpers during the SBQ event and around the more, and none of them say "scorched" even though they clearly are.
---
Also the keypad goes on the outside
---
Its not to bad but you will notice it
---
Ok,that would explain it.
---
Then how do I get out? I am curious cause I wanted to lock a room and avoid the use of lockpicking perk so nobody can steal my stuff
---
Yes it does.

Bloodied melee with Unyielding armor is very viable against SB and SBQ once they are on the ground
---
I'm still playing around with my [bloodied melee build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1346de&amp;d=eu0s92ss2sg2sj0s50si0se2c72ir2i42a00a12ao0ar2aj2l71lu2lt2la2ld0l10eh1lk0am1p00&amp;w=&amp;m=2hgfc1e8493&amp;nw=&amp;n=Bloodied%20Melee), but my toon does quite well as spec'd. Easily deliver 5k+ damage per hit once modifiers are calculated in, and generally have enough stealth to keep from being discovered. It's a glass cannon though, so there is risk/reward trade offs to this style of build.
---
I use a bloodied meat hook which currently benefits from both Iron Fist and Gladiator (bug) and 5 pcs of Unyielding armor. I could optimize by moving some of my sneak stats into other things, or re-tuning my Luck distributions... time will tell.
---
May I buy it from you? I'll give you 30k plus some weapons armor
---
I don’t know the names of them
---
Bulking doesn't save you any weight. Only aluminum and used to be lead but I think that's just normal when bulked.
---
Yep, officially jealous... congrats!
---
Screw that I would have not given that shithead any of my caps and or left him anything but a flaming bag of shit...You are a better man than I!
---
Back when you could find legendary enemies frequently and they would always drop at the same star the enemy was.
---
Back when the legendary drop chances were actually random and not heavily weighted toward shit. 
---
People dropping good legendaries on the ground for random people after every nuke.
---
Good times. Now it's just "H: Nocturnal rolling pin 1* W: BE Gat Plasma RW" lmao
---
I know the pain as well... +250 dmg resist, bloodied, 25% Faster fire rate. Gotta love sitting in pip-boy unequipping it and equipping it.. send help.
---
had people say that many times before with even more saying to use all the pieces i can so i dont risk it and use all that i can
---
How to turn on pacifist my man if you don't mind telling me
---
[](/ajshrug)The broadsider doesn't display it's actual damage in the damage numbers, that 4 you're seeing is a splash damage effect that does so little damage I don't know why they added it.
---
I enjoy NW but there simply isn't enough time in the day to play it that often.
---
That was such a exciting time. I remember logging in the first time during the beta and thinking I was going to get just bombarded by people but everyone was so nice and helpful.
---
God roll
---
People back in 76markets buy random 3* legos for at least 800 caps man, you had an amazing deal!
---
Same man what's their endgame here?
---
I went much tankier and bulldozerish with a legendary supersledge. But I'm happy that melee seems more possible than it used to be. It always was fun not bothering with ammo.
---
I remember this like it was yesterday
---
wow. Both this and the Atomic Rollers video in the comments are beyond Fn EPIC.
---
Great offer but i'll most likely stick to it as i have the perks for rifleman and commando i will test it a bit and and see where it fit best in my build.
---
Oh dang it thanks man no prob
---
That's funny I named my combat knife stabby 😅

There was a bloodied laser pistol.
---
Hey gemini great content as always! So a couple of questions about hopping;
---
Is there a timer on hopping? For example i loot non-container stuff such as military grade duct tape and hop, can i still find it? I think containers have a time limit but I'm not sure about it either:( is there a source I can look into about hopping if you don't want to explain, which is understandable!
---
ZAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA man this is the best comment i've ever seen on this sub i'm literally laughing out loud ahahahahhahahahahha never change my man
---
I never go for the head, because it just makes them angrier. Always for the legs. Always the legs.
---
Yeah I dont know what it's worth dont really care for the first time I dont shoot from roof tops now I start at the cottages and work my way around just hacken and a wacken chopping that meat..lol
---
Where did you find cows? All i ever see are Brahmins.
---
Took on a lvl 68 super mutant and the 4 seems legit as I did almost no damage
---
I've pretty much explored all the locations. Before I stopped playing I used a guide to make sure I found all the locations
---
Number 2 already happened to me. Not to spoil whatever little fun people might have. But on one quest where robots are deemed friendly by being overridden, they were switching between enemies and friendly simultaneously lol. 
---
Number 8. I doubt they'll place npc characters into the world space and not just loaded cells
---
I found one first time I went there. Sold it to a vendor because i had no clue they were desired
---
You are right.  I guess I am just mad spending all those hours and have to change it up. We pvp a lot
---
Yeah, last night it was buggy for me too. Two crashes toward the end of the event. The third time, a bunch of us were protecting the Snallygaster so I decided to go defend the tick, which me and another guy successfully did but then I noticed the Snallygaster was just about dead. I ran over, popped a few shots into the Grafton Monster, and went back to the tick. But the Sheepsquatch never spawned. Time just kept ticking away so I ran back to B and everyone just seemed to be standing around and the Grafton Monster was chilling in the center. I sprayed it with my Junkie's LMG until it was dead and we completed the event with just the tick alive.
---
I really want to figure out a way to get a decent group together to complete this event a few times with all three animals alive.
---
But yeah, it would be nice if the rewards could be granted even if only 1 animal is alive.
---
I took the time to do the story and all the side missions. After playthrough I had about 60% of the achievements. Then did all the other achievements with a friend to make it go by easier.
---
Almost no damage is around what the Broadsider does. It's programmed like a grenade launcher with a little tiny hitbox wherever it hits. The only way to make it deal it's small amount of damage is to hit the enemy in the feet with it, and even then it's still pretty bad like the other launchers.  
---
  
---
It's a damn shame since it's such a cool weapon.
---
And it lands on people's heads. Good times
---
Well... I think it would make sense for people to use Rocket launchers against big bad enemies, but people use meathooks and cause five hundred times More damage. I hate that. Rockets and nukes and grenade launchers should be awesome, but a baseball bat is better.
---
I can bear-ly make out the picture.
---
But still, that leaves 25%, so he fucking stole their junk without their permission, he’s a dick
---
That would be really cool
---
Yea   I agree, anything over 150 would be ridiculous!
---
I have over 1000 hours in game. I still need to kill like 5000 robots and Scorched with a variety of weapons. And that's just the Combat tab...
---

I too enjoyed the server instability, not being able to do certain things because they were broken, plasma weapons being useless, etc.
---
for Halloween I would prefer a legendary chainsaw
---
What is it about the legacy stuff that kills? My Explosive Tesla still eats right through dense and fireproof.
---
I really enjoy playing with my gunslinger who is also a 2h instigating melee. I carry a revolver, a silenced 10mm and an instigating faster swing baseball bat. I am not that fragile, but one-shoot most average enemies and go cowboy on their asses. And if shit gets real, the baseball bat hits HEAVY. The silenced pistol headshots and doubletaps high level enemies and Is awesome for cleaning buildings and caves. 
---
Not the best, not the greatest (I have a strong rifleman, a ninja unarmed who kills everything and Is invisible and the perfect commando who shreds enemies, they are all better) but the one I enjoy the most. Fun, fun, fun.
---
Haha thank you :)
---
Put a dense mod on your chest piece
---
If you're on xbox. I can craft you a bunch of them tomorrow
---
I wish I could get those toxic valley dailies to repeat like that would make getting the western outfit easier
---
I don't get why you keep talking about code when all im talking about is engagement with the community. A response once a week isn't engagement.
---
&gt; It has been a lot more frequent than once a week.
---
Not really.
---
Now read again what I said about GGG and tell me again they're doing exactly that.
---
Again, im asking them to throw a bone our way, do something with the community, anything. Killing scorched and scorchedbeasts ain't it. Answering to the cutesy posts made here ain't it either. Engage the community in a meaningful way. Give us teasers, a video tour, some inside information, idk, anything.
---
I wasn't asking them to record the devs working. I was simply asking for a post where for example, they explain why they felt the need to change the events the way they did, and what did they learn from it.
---
What is the point of having CM's when all they do amounts to basically nothing.
---
If you pick every paint can, pencils, toys, tin cans and rat poison you find while playing normally, you can keep a nice stock of lead. No need to go crazy. 
---
Only commando suffers from lack of ammo, but you can remedy that by using dif. calibers. 
---
Ballistic fiber Is the greatest bitch of them all unless you farm it or equip perks to need less of it.
---
Don't ever try to hit your target with a launcher type. The splash is all the damage. But it was nerfed with the demo card so need perfect legendary effects to make them usable. Broadsider would be a quad or two shot. Two shot works like the old two shot on launchers.
---
The stupidity of some players amazes me. They try and provoke PvP then you give the NO emote or just keep moving and they don’t get the picture. They wanna keep trying showing their stupidity. It’s the worse part about the game. It just tells me if they we’re truly that good at it, they’d be in NW instead of wasting time in Adventure mode. Mommy’s little losers.
---
Red is worth way more than 25
---
I was thinking about that. Fertile Soil 24/7.
---
Pink 10-12. Forest 15-20. Red 50+  I wouldn't even bother with the others unless you're trying to build a full collection.
---
I see red sell for 25 on Xbox a lot, and how much for yellow
---
I’m sure there will be more. They’re a solid value and give guaranteed revenue immediately. I’d bet they made more $ on the Battlecoat one than they made on the entire Atom Shop when it came out. No way they stop doing them. 
---
It’ll be interesting when they inevitably push out the NCR Ranger outfit and every single player is wearing it.
---
Works and shows up. Look at your armor starts not effects
---
The fact that the game is more-or-less successful despite its problems makes those people concerned that we're going to see more and more games being released in unpolished state in the future, and that more and more full-price games will be filled with microtransactions that are ridiculously overpriced.  People who hate the game then hate the players for playing the game, because they basically enable the game to exist.
---
They basically fear that if fallout 76 is successful, then it means Bethesda will not release a "true" fallout game ever again, because multiplayer "games as a service" can be more lucrative. And personally I don't blame them: just look at what EA did to battlefront a couple years back. Removing the campaign altogether, making the game pay-to-win and ruining it with abusive microtransactions, all because they thought they could get away with it. Fortunately enough, they couldn't.
---
I actually enjoy playing Fallout76, but we need to at least acknowledge that by playing it and supporting it, we're kind of supporting bad business practices.
---
change it to Saint Abbie. or St. Abbie for short.
---
I got one you can have for free. Seems like you really want it lol. MidRoad- is my psn. If you would like to donate screw s and oil I would gladly accept
---
That's my wife how dare you /s
---
Thanks so much. I am on XB1. But, at this point, it's become an obsession. I'll find it soon;P
---
Damn do you really.  I'm actually not sure about yellow.
---
Also if you’re fighting scorchbeasts, use explosive bait to force them to land!
---
I think it’s time to get rid of rule number 6. 
---
Not the clickbait part, but the title has to be descriptive enough 90% of the time that so many messages start with “as the title says.”
---
They need to get the wastelanders started. The 2nd meat meet was a flop and the other quests are getting old. Collecting legendaries and scripting is even getting boring for me. Vault 94 wasnt that good either.
---
K give me minute
---
Thanks a lot
---
Well, i think they should just fix the spawn rate on the animals there, because sometimes only a few mobs will spawn. Also increase the amount of plants that spawns in middle area, because its very rare to get rank 3 there.
---
Other than that, i don't think the place is too challenging. It will just be too hard for normal geared players if they have no way to spawn rank 3 animals because of spawn rng.
---
Oh I think we may be talking about 2 different things. I'm talking about the achievements (aka trophies for PS4) not the in-game challenges.
---
I had no idea!  Thanks

They’re extremely active on all the above platforms, especially Twitter where the show BTS content. They’re promoting several new games currently as well but still actively discuss Fallout. This subreddit does not really belong to Bethesda, so all they can really do is interact. Their social media presence is actually way better than I expected.
---
I think Scruffy the janitor is the guy in charge of testing.
---
I would suggest junkies melee. Junkies is +50% dmg for 5 addicitions, you will be at full health n melee needs cav to survive to reach enemies thru the gunfire. Between vanguard n dodgy in agi, the damage you take will be minimal. You wont hit like a truck but still put up decent numbers with high survivability.
---
Again, nothing of the sort that i mentioned.
---
For sure. Even the following weeks, being a high level and building a help camp en route to flatwoods. Offering water, better weapons, armor. Helping the little bunnies along. 
---
I miss that
---
I have a yellow and I just put it in my machine for 14k so we’ll see
---
Lucky, the problem is I cant play that much any more. Thanks though.
---
I imagine it's a random number generator that then refers to a loot table to determine what your generated number will mean.
---
But yeah 25-30 for the red, people don’t really seem to care enough to pay anymore lmao
---
Hands down my fav is my junkies sneak rifleman. I got a je pipebolt, have 5 mare damage cards to take but still sneak crit headshot for over 1300.
---
Okay, so you’re just bitching to bitch then. Got it. Everything I have shared is the opposite of everything you’re complaining they don’t have. I hate to even defend Bethesda but you got this one wrong. Everything you mentioned is on their social media. They can’t do what they’re doing there on Reddit.
---
Survival would have been way more lit with separate inventories and no legendary weapons and armor.
---
That’s why I have my Bloodied shovel. That and well it’s a Bloodied shovel perfect for burying bodies.
---
I really like fury since a got my mole miners gauntlet it hits like a truck, 234damage alone add fury and no melee perk cards and it's up to 264. So I could only image with right perk cards how hard it could hit. I'm going to look into that.
---
Well good luck! I still check for the plans too, so if I find em I'll give you a holler, and see if you haven't found em yet.
---
This is absolutely fantastic. A coworker and I were in hysterics watching this
---
I think you can just open the door again. Dont need to do the whole quest.
---
I remember combat armor from FO4. Any idea where I can get the plans? 
---
Also thanks, I'll check into trading in legendary items. Where do I do that?
---
I ran into the lemonade stand in that spot today.   With Mr. Squeeze
---
Once you have the key, you can open the dome infinitely. Just server hop, and save your caps.
---
Bethesda’s programmers wet dream, probably.
---
I sold one today for 3k.  I have another in my vending machine
---
Rule 6 has NEVER been enforced since I've been a part of this community. So your backhanded attempt to throw shade has failed.
---
Dont sell it
---
But, that doesn't support the narrative of the squishy players, who just want to reap all the rewards, with no risk whatsoever. 
---
I've never raided anyone's workshop, and with survival gone, waiting for someone to try to take mine is the only excitement I can get.
---
;)
---
Ive only done it once no reason to even bother with it
---
Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Be friendly! Some of the coolest people I have met are from random PvP. I usually will send them a “Good Fight” message after (Assuming they dont ragequit).
---
I have built different monks. You can go punching, and Will need strength AND agility for that. That goes well with a Stealth build, and you become a ninja who kills level 70 deathclaws and scorchedbeasts with a single punch. Throwing knives are fun with this build. 
---
 You can also be a 2h melee staff wielder (free range Quest gives you one, you can craft them, buy them too) with high endurance and high strength. Tanky if you focus on being able to take damage. No Stealth here: you'll fight a lot. 
---
You can be a true monk, with no armor. That means you need a well-rounded character and invest in survival perks, boosting your defenses with perks like Barbarian, Evasive and similar ones. 
---
You can be a drunken monk, with high charisma, benefiting from alcohol and good food. 
---
Tell me how can I help you. I even tried to start an order of unarmed, poor monks, but failed.
---
They removed it
---
Idk my build must suck my handmade is average on mobs useless in pvp
---
Scary accurate. Also:
---
15. NPC voiceover from the end of a quest will play at the beginning of a quest, spoiling any suspense.
---
16. They will keep all of the scorched quest content and just add human NPCs on top without reconciling the storyline at all.
---
17. All quest rewards will be one star legendaries, or a hat.
---
18. Half the new content will be locked behind intelligence and charisma checks that most players can't make.
---
19. New faction clothing in the atom shop will give you a reputation boost with that faction of NPCs, igniting another giant shitstorm in this sub.
---
20. Exiting your power armor while NPC dialog is playing causes your client to crash, your inventory to be deleted, your dog to run away, and your boss to fire you by text message.
---
Radium Rifles are a pain. I have been chasing all of the mods for a couple months now. I have junked probably close to 150 and only have about half the mods. It is notoriously the hardest weapon to get mods for.
---
Yes, it's normal. The radium rifle is one of the most difficult guns to unlock all the mods for. I scrapped 100 one day and didn't learn any. Still don't know all of them.
---
I remember being constantly angry at the other people at launch because i was under the false impression that the reason all the enemies kept respawning before i finished looting a place was a new person showing up and triggering it. 
---
I didn't learn that was not what was happening until i took my first break from the game to wait for some of the jank to get sorted.
---
Beth removed it because the food builds are louder
---
I’m really hoping for an eventual 3000 word Kotaku article on the development of this game like they did with Anthem and Destiny 1....
---
and they just proved my point
---
No idea who you’re referring to
---
One trick I use is to server hop WS. The Raider vendor there will sometimes have about 8ish weapons to sell in 2 flavors. It's a good way to get the other weapon mods as well. Way cheaper than building them.
---
As it says I was goin for a junk/scrap aspect. Punching and grenades are what i have gone for atm. Also a two handed would be cool. But I JUST got done with a Grognak build and I didn’t want to feel too repetitive. 
---
The ambient track “Metallic Monks” from Fallout 1 was the inspiration to make this build. But mostly so I could have a more personal build. 
---

---
Kinda has a orb throwing thing going on. 
---
I’d prefer to go more defense monk but as with any game some damage is needed.
---
Edit: an order of monks would be cool.
---
Any advice on not bein squishy i die in 2 shots
---
God those were the days
---
Pointing them out isn't going to do anything. They obviously don't care. Bethesda won't do anything because to acknowledge a systemic issue like that means they have to acknowledge that their programming is shit and easily manipulated.
---
I am way too lazy for that horse poop.
---
Idk man just seems like your trash to me.. :) JK, man I haven’t had any problems or seen any problems with level scaling but to each your own
---
It's not a bug sadly. They are RnG based,3* can drop a 1*,2* or 3* at random :(  It al depends on how lucky you are
---
I actually am on PC and would love to unburden you of as many of those terrible screws as you're willing to spare. Lol I've only been playing since the free weekend and have no friends that play so i have no clue how i would go about finding you in-game, I've been playing solo the whole time so i'm oblivious to any of the social side of fo76 other than emotes.
---
Me too.
---
Didn't see that one! Could you buy/sell anything?
---
I drop all three of those ammo types at a train station. Along with the missiles and mini nukes.  I don't have storage space for all that useless ammo.
---
I've heard so many bad things about this event that I have never even tried it once.
---
I sure am! That would be sweet thank you!! On PS4 my handle is thatoneguyaz88.
---
Interesting, okay thanks! I'll check into the Chameleon Armor. Any specific place/mobs to farm for that?
---
any legendary lol what i did was just farmed the leader of the pack for a very very long time to get a full set of chameleon took way too long lol
---
If it was an SMG, most likely it had some killer effects, he probably had his char perked for damage, and I can guarantee he shot you more than twice. Sometimes server lag doesn't show all the shots fired but they are there and do the damage.
---
They removed it to avoid breaking it badly when they release wastelanders, too many moving parts. IMO I think they'll bring it back when the get wastelanders semi stable 😁
---
I actually missed out on this, because my first play session in beta I just picked a direction and ran for a while. Ended up at Monongah power plant at level 6 at the end of that first session. Lots of sneaking and running away from things before I got a few more levels and decent gear. But what a thrill.
---
You have a low health build. I know because I have the same perks.
---
The Pipe Rifle is a special weapon. If it is converted from a pistol to a rifle, it can double dip into both pistol and rifle perks simultaneously. Similarly to the way a Meat Hook doubles as a one-hand and a melee weapon.
---
So what he is doing makes sense. 
---
In my opinion, Bethesda should remove the damage cap, raise everyone's health, and raise NPC enemy damage. Thus eliminating the need for two damage systems, and damage caps.
---
That's just par for the course. Each legendary monster had to win 4 separate off screen rolls to make it to a 3 star, and the weapon is rolled separately and can be 1-3 with any effects.
---
Proper perks and gear and you wont have a problem in pve or pvp.
---
You should have seen it everyone on the server in the same spot. It felt so right.
---
Feeling under-equipped at level 40 is normal, I think. Max level is 45 or 50 depending on the item, so it's not worth farming too hard for legendaries before you hit 50.
---
That being said, if you do Uranium Fever you're pretty much guaranteed several level 40 legendaries. Use them now, cash them in for scrip later.
---
Also, if you do have/get one outstanding weapon, it's fine to build out your special and perks around that. Changing stuff later is not that hard.
---
Ah, here we have the salty try hard in his natural habitat. Shitposting on reddit.
---
It was available with a bundle I believe. It was mistakenly given to everyone. Then that glitch was fixed. Not sure if the bundle is currently available anymore.
---
Honestly, I wasn’t trying to throw shade. I don’t post much myself, but a couple times I have, they cited a #6 rule for removal.
---
Just commenting on “as the title says” as the first line because everyone already had to be so descriptive.  :/
---
Where’d you get that borg eyepiece?
---
Does that make you feel better?
---
Should be a single target monster, with a very small splash. Just my opinion
---
I sell them to the vendor. 😁
---
With hard bargain x3 I get 450 caps each.
---
I didn't feel bad in the first place 😂 I could just tell you're salty because you over generalized and called people who don't like to PvP food builds, when most of us are still perked for damage and survivability. We aren't the reason Survival is gone. Survival is gone because no one actually used it, you guys were too busy trolling people trying to quest and grind legendaries in adventure mode.
---
Ugh so bummed. I miss survival ☹️
---
Chameleon armor or mutation, and stay crouched anytime you're in the workshop. Keep berry mentats active, stealthboys on your quickmenu for tense moments, and always chem before an engagement, psychotats/med-x are my personal go-to's.
---
Bank crits for initial engagements, take un-PA guys with auto weapons first, because they're the ones who play crit/vats/stealth builds. PA guys are clean up. Don't stay still when firing, strafe and jump, anything to break their line of fire.
---
I can successfully defend vs 2-3 players with my handmade, especially if they're not coordinated. Teams of 4, I use a crap ton of mines, crit snipe with the lever, and consider it a win when I can trade more kills than they get.
---
I just saw him today.
---
&gt;So next time you see a AAE handmade or bloodied Faster swing speed +1 strength meat hook, for 5,000 caps in game at a vendor, consider yourself lucky! 
---
Geez. I want to be on your server more often. That *is* lucky.
---
I got really lucky in the beta and stumbled across so many sets of Power Armour then I was just giving them away. I'd check for any parts I needed, leave the rest and call a friend over to collect them.
---
I also hoarded all the power cores so my friends couldn't use them.....
---
Ive actually seen a couple like that. Cool concept
---
Armorer needs three points of int if you want to use armor (you can have 200-220 resistance with nothing on, if you choose the right perks).
---
Someone left me an insult note after coming into my beautiful camp
---
No, it's a systemic issue on PC, because PCs are easier to finesse. It's easier to influence the game. It's not a "deep issue", it's a PR issue.
---
Also, there's very limited evidence of it. If there was more evidence showing people doing things that could ONLY be explained by "hacking" (which I think is a misnomer here, hacking a server based game is incredibly difficult, and almost always leads to instant instability and a crash, not to mention it's easily traceable) then they might do something. Until then, good luck.
---
Two things though, A) this game has a player base that has become notorious for crying "hax" when they come across someone better than them. Have you SEEN what some 10 year olds are capable of? They can pull of things I'm game that make your head spin. B) of they are running a program, it's just modifying the client, so by definition it's not hacking. MAYBE it's an aimbot, maybe it's something that warns them of your location with an indicator, whatever. It's almost certainly not actual hacking though.
---
That's because you're a dipshit that thinks the intro is the entire game.
---
Armor mods do nothing, weapon mods are mislabeled, have the wrong weights and damages or are missing.
---
The game still hard crashes regularly.
---
Every time you log in you hear the same dialog from the mayor.
---
Hell they added a raid that can delete your character. 
---
New Vegas was made by real developers, to compare it to this shit is an insult.
---
Do some chems to boost your damage and resist, like psychotats. Start by hitting him from stealth with your highest damage weapon. You could do a stealth boy and melee him if needed. Grenades are an option if you don't have a heavy hitter weapon. Maybe lay out a couple mines, too. Be ready with the stims, or nuka cola if you use cola nut.
---
Exactly what I think when people complain about issues in the game. Back in my day, we were lucky to even play the game for 30 minutes without crashing.
---
Yes, I'm certain Bethesda is seeking out new ways to infuriate it's fan base. Beth isn't doing enough of that on accident anymore, and must create ways to make us mad, in order to validate the future results of the social experiment we have unwittingly signed up for.
---
I only use the weapons that make me look unarmed. Deathclaw gauntlets and powerfist looks are too big. I use the Knuckles, which are monkish. Using no weapons (absolutely unarmed) Is not possible. With 20 points of strength you hit for 39 damage.
---
discovering musical instruments, being attacked by a beaver. leaving the vault and going west instead of south, getting ruined by cryptids and scorchbeasts in the mire at level 16. finding a corpse, starting the order of mysteries. trying to get a sword from whitesprings, me at level 18 vs. level 65 bloated glowing ones. died until i lose all my stimpaks. lost all my black titanium, i was trying to save up to someday build excavator armor. 
---
a queen nuke! i don’t have a complete set of PA yet, but i run from watoga. i die in the radiation before i ever get to the battle. 
---
eventually find a legendary! a death tambo. get my order of mysteries blade of bastet. finish my excavator power armor. find my first gatling gun. discover how to make disease cures, finding more chems to deal with rads. my first whitesprings nuke zone. 
---
discover the BoS. the DMV. fighting a scorchbeast in a cave at level 46. settle down near the elevator, runs to watoga and finding cranberries in the sundew.
---
finding a group of people at whitesprings who support each other, bags of legendaries every day. too heavy to keep, we take turns vendoring them for a few caps at the end of each day. bags of chems, ammo. what you don’t need, you drop for others. 
---
figuring out how to really optimize perks, start ranking up. got a 3* pickaxe, start loading slugger perks. prototype PA and melee. becoming useful at the whitesprings nukes; i’ll run through and draw them out of the ghoul house and take damage, you snipe from the walls. we all tag, i finish them off and we all loot.
---
get a 3* hammer. learn some PA mods, rebuild a max level excavator. i. like. to. hit. things. 
---
get my first mutation. Marsupial! how have i played so long without it. get a legendary gatling. find a good handmade. 
---
get my 2nd mutation (speed demon) and my 3rd (healing factor). max starched genes and class freak. rank up heavy gun perks. discover glow sight! max rank glow sight. 
---
more mutations (eagle eyes, egg head). start thinking it’s overdue that i haven’t done a silo. watch some youtube videos. finally collect picklock and hacker perks. i’m ready. 
---
45 minutes, solo. 40 stimpaks. perfect targeting. fast travel, my friends join me.  we beat the queen with buzz blades (mine was furious). i jump around like a fool in the red storm of radiation.
---
(skip 100 levels)
---
i have excellent weapons. i have excellent armor. i grind for materials, i do public events. i try to find random events. i keep discovering locations. i still am! level 230 today, discovered new locations yesterday. i can make serums but they’re mostly for vendoring anymore. i know all the PA mods i want to build, and more i don’t use but others might. 
---
i fear nothing. scorchbeasts? inconvenience. sheepsquatch? tough, but i’ll take a legendary over some random ultracite. i find delight in helping newbies. someone buys a camp plan from my vendor? check their level. for newbs i drop everything and FT home, pull and drop stuff for them. i leave care packages at the vault. 
---
my group is still together, we still help each other. we still give away good legendaries, scrip the rest. give mats, coordinate raids and events and queens.  you find ways to have fun. you find ways to challenge yourself. do new events, build stuff and give it away. rebuild your camp again. and again. 
---
this weekend i decided to launch on the queen again, my 4th. 26 minutes in the silo.  (spent 3 trying to find the tinker bench) 2 stimpaks. we took the queen with cryos and gatlings and bloodied snipers. friends doing cleanup of the ground rabble, leaving the gunners on target. collect the flux, make more serums. line more underarmor. make more ammo. 
---
—
---
obviously your post made me nostalgic, i remember those beta windows. i was working for the first window and had to watch streamers emerge from the vault first. when i finally got to play myself, i. was. in. awe. there is no replacement for the feeling of entering a new world, assuming every other blue suit you see is a friend who needs something and has something to offer. 
---
we can’t go back there but we can try to foster and build relationships at our new, higher levels. i played a LOT of fallout 4 (1200 hours, all achievements) and i haven’t touched it since i played 76.
---
the difference is people. knowing that every other blue suit (or whatever you’re wearing now) might be a friend. might not be a friend? might need your help or might be A-OK on their own. but finding that out, that’s the real game.
---
Yeah. Spent 1750 caps on a recall card and get robbed. Luckily 2 legendary robots spawned during the event and it wasn’t a total loss.
---
One pr stunt backfiring horribly sure, but every single one of them? 
---
CONSPIRACY.
---
the only thing i hate about the community is the crybabies that want everything handed to them, such as making the vault raids so easy a level 1 can do them (a friend of mine was able to group and complete it at level 11 on expert).
---
You need plans for bear arm to get legendary version.
---
How did you make love in survival mode?
---
I wish I was on PSN *just* to see how Charades goes.
---
He is out there still slinging insults.
---
Oooo i dont want any prizes or care about placing. I just wanna share my camps because i think they are unique enough for people to be like WHHHHAAAT
---
if anything rule 10 can gtfo
---
Copy that. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
---
Vats Stealth Commando is really fun
---
It's fine, now we have a terrible battle royale mode that discourages teamwork due to the way experience in it is distributed.
---
True, but they've been banned plenty of times.  Permanently even.  They just buy new accounts.  You can get keys for as low as 2 dollars.  They're not hacking to gain an advantage, they're motivated by ideology.  They're going to keep doing it until they get bored or the game fizzles out.
---
I go to Defiance all the time for plastic, aluminum, cloth, etc., plus the loot from the ghouls.  Usually a Legendary or wendigo in there, too.  Never found better than a green uniform, though
---
if i see something that works for me i buy it because i don’t want to server hop and fast travel all day to find it. 
---
trading sites i think can get away with more because it’s exactly what you want without all the hassle. i’ve paid 5000c for an explosive lever, because it was two  months before i found another one. if a friend in game has a weapon i’m looking for, i’ll pay good caps because you saved me so much time.
---
But in this case I'm fine with continuing on making them spend money (even if it's a small amount). At least I know THEY are getting banned.
---

You got your shit together.  He’s proud of you, even though he’ll never say it out loud.
---
Wow. Between your verbage and poor understanding of how this all works, I can really tell that you just don't have the mental fortitude to fully grasp the situation. It's obvious to me that you lost. Terribly. Now you're on reddit doing the usual "blame everything but my skill level" grandstanding. It's cliche. The game is laggy. If you didn't see them move or grab the loot box, the game probably lagged and then caught up, and it's either because of the game itself, your connection to the server, your pc, or a combination of the three. Also, you don't get to just redefine hacking to fit your narrative, that's not how this works. They are not forcing their way into the server to change the state of the game, therefore is is not hacking. The people that might actually be "cheating" are using mods or programs to send input that they wouldn't be able to without assistance. That is still against the ToS, to use anything that gives one an unfair advantage, and it's still wrong to do so from a sportsmanship perspective, but it is NOT hacking. At all. No matter what you say.

No pa
---
Eh stash increase isnt really needed anymore, if you cant manage 800 + your character carry weight then you are either carrying far too much useless aid and junk or you need to mule legendaries to an alt.
---
Since when doesn’t serendipity not work in PA? The perk definitely doesn’t specify that.
---
This is a perfectly timed post. I was scrolling through my screenshot collection and found a pic I had from the first day of BETA at my very first camp (a humble 1x3 shack) with a few friends that I still play with to this day. It’s cool to see how far we’ve come.
---
Nuke Cola pinup girl.
---
It works now
---
I’ve seen a person pay 30K for Forest on the subreddit (PC) recently.
---
Ah yes, because accusations and witch hunts without proper evidence are the way to go, not reporting them to Bethesda.
---
Not like someone could accuse of cheating when it's actually just lag or a other issue.
---
I even have 5 Cav pieces and I was sprinting , I’m just a bit pissed that a level 28 can step on  a level 70 bloodied build in seconds
---
The artilery cannons work all u need to do is grab one of the artilery smoke gernades from ur stash box and it will be eqipt into ur invantory. Just tried it at my home in toxic valley.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.

40 scrip. Mutants is not popular. If it had Swing Speed or 40% power attack it may be worth sometging. 
---
I'd either vend it for 1K... maybe...1.5 because the 90% reduced weight makes it worth saving for a rainy day.
---
Could it be their build team/method is just a mess? What gets released as a live system is not the same as what QA were given to test in terms of the code and configuration. A lot can go wrong when building a release, I'm a QA btw.
---
Almost heaven...
---
t-baging is 9% water and 3% food
---
Outstanding! Thanknyou for the response! 
---
Off to get scrip i go
---
there are just sometimes empty nests that make the noise ..i have fought several today
---
That always devolves into bickering and needless drama. If it worked it wouldn't be worth it...but it doesn't even work. It never has.
---
Same here. I mean, I'm only lvl 103 but I get bored most of the time when playing this game lately, grind for legendaries is one of the last things that keeps me coming back and giving some purpose to play it, and that feel of accomplishment when I find something good is just way too addicting to just replace it with a plain and boring negotiation on a random sub or discord server. I don't judge who plays this (or any) game this way, but it's just not for me.
---
As I've stated before, there's a difference between lag and blatant cheating, but people like you (which are most likely the people that are cheating) wouldn't understand.
---
Yeah somtimes my entire gameplay is hopping to find someone selling somthing good to spend on
---
How many do you have and how much each?
---
Oh yes, because I claim witch hunts, Reddit's speciality, are bad, I must be an evil hacker
---
You're right it is somthing to invest in ..but it's a rather pointless investment ..I have hoards of serums for sale that i buy cheaply and flip ..knowing how to craft them is pretty much a waste
---
Miller you should go play ESO.  After every vet has there gear all done and has there new rotation ZOS witch is the parrent company that owns betheda.goes and nerfs everyone then were forced to start over from scrach.
---
You clearly aren’t a PvP player then as a result I denounce you for ever speaking for all Bloodied builds. Just don’t be dumb and allow yourself to be vats
---
He sells lemonade and the recipe for it. I think also the hard lemonade (and recipe?).
---
He's got a little lemonade stand with balloons on it.
---
I only saw the tail end of that, I spent the early days doing the Enclave questline before there were any guides for it.
---
Those were glorious times, Flatwoods was like Times Square.
---
Like 6-10 (I’m not sure though) weapons range from 1-3 stars, mainly one and two stars. And like 10ish armor pieces. I’d probably sell em for like 200-300 each depending on the stars. Most I price at 200 caps anyways
---
That little menace comes to me right in the middle of a fight with Sheepsqauch and gets himself killed.  Kind of upset i wanted to talk.
---
Welp I gues it's just me
---
That never happened before the last patch, it's still a bug
---
Xbox? If so ill buy them from you. If you decide to go that route.
---
Raids in games always aren’t done by majority of players
---
No they'll increase the drop rate for the trash no one uses on purpose
---
Yeah I’m on Xbox. I’ll be getting on soon, that works for you or another day?
---
Please don’t. This will be slap in the face of players who grinded the raids how they were supposed to
---
That's you, dude. I have killed at least four in the last two days.
---
Your choice of words and points of view shows me that you're not familiar with any kind of coding whatsoever. Maybe you're an alpha tester occasionally, but that's a far cry from a developer.
---
Yeah I mean I want to get all the plans for completions sake, not that there is that much point to it.
---
There could be a tab in your photo gallery titled "photos of you" and you could choose to have them appear in your loading screens.
---
Ill be on for a bit. Just hit me up.
---
I’m willing to sell them. I just want them out of my stash so I can get resources again.
---
This will be slap in the face to players who grinded the way the raids were intended. Don’t ever make a games’ endgame content easy. It will kill the game.

---
wat?  i am a solo player, just because i chose to team for the one thing designed from the ground up to be team content does not mean i always have a team.
---
if they ignore content, that is a choice they have made. 
---
 outside of not having a proper LFG feature i don't see how they are suffering.  if you read my other comments instead of going on a pointless mini rant you would of seen that im for a lfg feature to make it easier for other solo players to team and do the content.  *but lets ignore that right? /s*
---
congrats on playing mmos for 15 years, many other people have as well, and with the many other people, there are many different opinions on what content each user likes.  congrats on not liking team content, i like that i have to break out of my solo only comfort zone.  im sorry that __one single piece of content out of how many__ offended your great ancestors.
---
as you said Bethesda had the statistics.  so until it is released nobody knows how the raids are going.  yeah you can loom at the map and half dead discords, but none of that factors in to stats.  what if you just keep loading into bad servers the runners avoid?
---
Folks on the trading reddit are ripping people off in my experience. Selling for way over actual value. Like Two shot versions of the shotgun only add one pellet but they go for megabucks. Smh
---
Gt Grim Project
---
I hide offline so send me a message here or on xbox when you are ready.
---
Most fallout thing in 76 honestly
---
Alrighty
---
Yeah I think about that a lot too ..but it's like wanting McDonalds.. for me i dont really NEED that cheese burger and keep driving
---
I killed four today alone. What you describe has been happening all along at random encounter spots in the Forest region, as Sheepsquatches can't spawn there, yet their nests have been added to the list of spawns. Maybe that has been intentional, to frighten the newbies a bit. ;-)
---
What **is** bugged with random Sheepsquatches is that they don't spawn anymore with two or three stars, at least for me, and that has been the case for at least two months now. All I see is 1-star SQs (I haven't cross-checked with Free Range).
---
There's only like &lt;3% per scrapped rifle to unlock a mod. It took me 3 weeks of non stop farming/crafting/scrapping to unlock them all.
---
Just keep at it, or have someone mod them for you.
---
oh seeeee i upvoted the post and then i saw youre making assumptions already about this guy you dont even know
---
Well, why else would you be against clearing out the hackers in this game? It's stupid to think that games and players should just live with and allow these players to ruin the game for others that are trying to enjoy the game in a fair manner?
---
But I gave a solution, report to Bethesda. You just ignoring that. It's more effective than a Reddit thread.
---
I've used probably 30-50k worth of materials and I'm still missing two or three mods.
---
Yeah I was in the mire
---
You can't dox or publicly shame people even for doing something they shouldn't be doing. I'm sure those people you're talking about are cheaters. But if you make a thread where anyone can name cheaters, people will just name people they don't like to fuck with them, whether they cheated or not...
---
I don't think you know what you're talking about, most games have some kind of cheating that slips through, it is a constant battle between modders and developers.
---
Your saying that cheating is easy to stop and this is a black and white issue and bethesda is incompetent for not being able to fix it. This is much more nuanced than that, theres probably a team dedicated to NW whose job is to stop and catch cheaters, and theres just as many, if not more hackers working on probing and prodding every weakness they can find. Theres usually multiple generations of these cheat mods because they continually update them to skirt around the defenses. Its much easier to break a program than make one unbreakable from what I understand.
---
As far as I'm aware its still impossible to connect to xbox live or psn with a modded console, the serial number gets flagged instantly and shut down. I've heard people say that console modding is possible and I ask them where they've heard it but no one ever has any source. If you have evidence that its possible to use a modded console online I'd love to see it. People using game exploits or being high level doesnt mean consoles are modded. 
---
I'm sure its on their radar, and something will be done but I don't think its as cut and dry as you say. Nuclear winter is a smaller part of the game and has a smaller player base, not that its not important, I would just assume their focus is fixing the main part of the game and getting wastelanders working properly.
---
Just wait for The Outter worlds to come out so 76 can have the death it deserves. LONG LIVE OBSIDIAN!
---
1.5-2k possibly in your vendor or scrip
---
Back when completing Feed the People gave everyone in the server canned meat stew.
---
Wow, just waiting on the day I log in and my main being wiped, have not touched the Vault 94 content for fear of it, it would be the final nail in the coffin as far as playing goes. Lots of their screw ups are oddly convenient for themselves. 
---
When events like Meat Week are live, expect legendary Nerfs and other shinanigans from Bethesda. Just like the mystery pick with melees being all limb damage...that was intentional, not an accident...they got caught and had to throw down a purveyor sale to cover their asses
---
Should have never changed.
---
Still buggy and laggy as fuck but it's a fun game so I keep playin it :)
---
Yeah ill ask friends
---
You could alwase do the event in the devide were u lead and protect cows.at the end of it.a Legendary sheepsqach spawns.
---
i am honored that u think that about me. but i dont have a channel that has 1.8 million subs and a vid that has 10 million views  and a 1% dislike rate
---
just watch it its funny
---
i have found those empty nests since it was introduced to the game
---
 What you could do is store them in a mule in the future, if you have the characters at a high level then just scrip to get the max per day in all your characters. Otherwise just store and transfer back whenever you couldn’t max out your scrip on main character
---
I checked and my boost mode was already off :/
---
I havent touched valt94 eather.as 1 its not a real raid. 2 the stash missing bug when you crash.
---
I killed one this afternoon with Free Range on xb1
---
That was fast
---
It's part of the Raider Waster set!
---
Are you bloodied?
---
No. No real specific build.
---
Never thought of that! It would be amazing and add a whole new thing to do!
---
What also bugs me: crafting Diluted Rad-X doesn't count for the [Craft 5 Meds] challenge. Diluting Stims does, otoh, so diluting isn't the problem.
---
Incredibly buggy, laggy, broken gameplay. But damn it I can’t stop redesigning my camp over and over. Oh and I need another possum badge. Oh there’s a scorchbeast better kill it. Ooh duct tape! So ya play the game cus it’s awesome. Even if half the time I’m fighting lag or server connection issues it’s still Fallout.
---
I have a tin foil hat in my inventory I’d sell you
---
Rad x, Rad x diluded Radway Radway diluded u get from AVR Medical Quest.
---
There is battle royale and what Bethesda calls Vault Raids.
---
You probably actually missed out on survival mode altogether.
---
I honestly thought that may have been your problem. But I was wrong. I'm sorry it didn't help you like I thought it would.
---
We need a lot more information to figure of what you are doing wrong, then. Try using Blocker, Lone Wanderer, Fireproof, Dodgy or any of the other percentage-based damage reduction.
---
It's okay, they only missed what the game was supposed to be.
---
It's in the "Settings" -&gt; "Game"
---
Thanks for the suggestion though. I guess maybe it’s just the game.
---
That's free range
---
This just brings me back to Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  This has to be one of the greatest things to ever be filmed for Fallout 76.  So hilarious my eyes are watering 😂😂😂
---
Please tell me what info you need? Because like said above its dam near unplayable at the moment when I'm dying in almost every combat situation
---
First, when did I EVER say cheating was "easy" to stop. What I said, was that it wouldn't be a huge part of their budget. So, don't try to spin this around and put words in my mouth.  
---
I'm not talking about DOXing anyone, simply posting names of players that are suspected of cheating, of which, the same names come up almost every game in voice. If the same names come up by other users, then something must be up with said players.  
---
As for consoles, YES, there are ways of modding them without having the service find out most of the time. Why would anyone ever give you a source for something that can get them in trouble and brick their console? I also never said anything about players being high level...again, putting words in my mouth and just trying to justify your bullshit.  
---
You say that their main focus is to fix the main game, but we've seen how well that's gone so far eh? I love the game, but it's still a beta game and nothing more yet. With so many bugs and them just shoveling out half baked crap and running old events shows how worried they are, so why not, as players, take it into our hands?
---
I second this idea
---
The overseers journey continues into the dlc. There will be more possibly in wastelanders next month.
---
On XB1 sadly :/ thank you though!
---
Why did you keep spending when you saw 3 weapons with the same perks
---
I’m very interested
---
I’ve been in since beta, well over 1000 hours.  The game has gotten better, I’d call it a release candidate now.  It’s still got plenty of problems, but I think if Bethesda gave a damn about the game it’s got potential.  I just hope it comes near that before the plug is pulled.
---
The game play is still incredibly worn. It needs someone to give it some intrigue. Like needing some sort of skill instead of ok got my build sold point and click everything until it's dead
---
I did it a yesterday with some random and it spawned a legendary sheepsquach at the end.
---
Hi thanks for asking.  I’’ll be honest I just wanted to click quickly through all 3000 and care least of all about what melee i’m getting.  Would have checked at end for any swing speeds.
---
So theres still nothing to do other then vault raids?
---
Wish I could change the name to "Legendary armor/weapon system change suggestion". My goal was to lay out a system where you could take a crafted or vendor purchased armor/weapon and mod it to legendary or change the modifiers in an existing legendary through a crafting recipe.
---
You must have two massive grains of salt hanging below your belt. I commend your audacity.
---
All that math just to figure out your net loss. They say time is money, though, so consider that. What about the time lost collecting items to exchange for the wasted scrip? Or the atoms you spent/grinded to gain? Now Bethesda owes you a paycheck.
---
Realistically, however, you already accepted your recompense as a discount. It's unfortunate that this game turned out this way. Light a candle for possibilities or something.
---
Lets see...you got the burrows, Arkos Pharma and vault 94 for new end game content.  A legendaries merchant and Nuclear Winter, battle royal mode.
---
That was always one of my favorite parts of reach. Would love to see something like this!
---
and me?
---
Total health, total damage resistance, perk loadout. You can use [this website](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) to show us your build. Also, what is your damage per second output? The best way to not die is to quickly kill anything before it can hurt you.
---
I have around 300DR/200ER with Blocker, Fireproof and Lone Wanderer as my damage mitigation perks and I cannot remember the last time an NPC killed me.
---
Don't be so hard on OP.  He's right about the hackers being a legit problem, he's just upset about it and not using his words correctly.
---
A bunch of youtubers have video of these guys hacking if proof is something you need.  Sinisterhand, keloot, void, and clown daddy all have video of blatant hacking happening in adventure and survival mode.
---
I can post specific videos if you don't feel like searching for them, but I don't want to be banned for witch hunting.
---
Oh yeah, backpacks and a larger building cap on camps.
---
Make 24" cobalt or titanium drill bit mods too.
---
....for a shitty outfit?  A fool and his caps will soon part...
---
Well I hope you learned a lesson
---
The math was no trouble really and the scrip was acquired by trading.  So the inconvenience really is in having to wait each day to do 150 at a time.  Then only being able to save 1000 for a sale that gets fixed hours after it matters
---
You only lose junk when you die. If there was no bag where you died then you didn’t drop anything.
---
You seem weirdly salty, his sarcasm was obvious.
---
Yup just like I said
---
It's a beautiful world wrapped around a poorly thought out, designed, and implemented game; this has not changed as far as I can tell.
---
Maybe 1/10 of female avatars I’ve seen are this same  hot tan red head.  It’s a stock option for an avatar.  Shes kinda agitated and sweaty looking.
---
yep, but I did -- I had about 20 lbs of junk -- it doesn't even give me the quest "pick up your loot" it happened on my first character and I restarted around lvl 35 --  my second character I'm about LVL 63 and decided to start over -- it's not that's my loot is in the middle of the world -- it just doesn't show I dropped anything and I am 100% positive I did as I was just over encumbered -- I don't want to start for a 4th time but I will
---
You got the average age right.
---
I am hoping it is Bethesda that learns the lesson
---
Also curious about best ways to obtain fusion cores. Tried taking a power plant but some dick head level 82 came in and kept killing me. Seems like the only way to hold those is to be higher level. Annoying.....
---
I think they edited it after I commented to make it more obvious. Either way, I missed it and no salt was intended.
---
Sweet as, thank you!
---
Thank you!
---
Yes! I've taken lots of really cool photos that I wish I could send to those in them. Lots of random 'people in front of mushroom cloud' pics at Prime.
---
It's fine.
---
I don't mean to be so harsh, I've just seen so many people that just lost, and then rush on here to shitpost about it. It drives me insane. It's a game, you win some you lose some.
---
I still stand by it not being "hacking". That involves then breaking the encryption on the server, and then modifying the code to achieve their goals. It's more likely that they are using bots or other programs to influence what the engine does and how it reacts, which is still unethical, but it's not hacking.
---
Well, considering there's really only 2 reasons you'd be opposed to getting rid of cheaters. He's either one himself, or they don't understand the issue and are weighting in on something they shouldn't be.  
---
But you're right, partially, I don't know them and if they condone cheating, which their stance is obvious, then I don't need to know them.
---
I'd join ya but sadly I'm pc, plus I could use some work on my French, relearning it
---
I remember playing before the US had access (at full release), and the town was relatively empty except for a like 5-6 of us. Then when the US had access a few hours later, it became full on. Flatwoods was packed, and (as a new player also) I was worried that I was going to instantly get killed, but everyone was really kind and helpful. I'll never forget it
---
Scorched ticks, Yao guai, megasloths and wendigo are not counting for me.
---
It’s a missed 30 atoms, so no big deal.
---
On the plus side, I got two legendary ticks today. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a legendary tick in 1600 hours, and today I got two.
---
I've thought this as well and to have a portrait of your character as well.
---
God I remember doing this for like 1 hour. So glad I did though!
---
I’ve noticed the bags aren’t in the exact location. You may have to look around for it. If you don’t get there quick enough, someone else can also loot it. And if you change servers it won’t follow you. 
---
I know you know these things but just pointing them out.
---
I have also had bags seem to disappear and going looking for them and found them. 
---
Really strange - I killed a scorthbeast  at my camp and it disappeared. Then I fast travelled and there was a dead scorchbeast in front of me with loot. Like the one I killed at my camp had fast travelled with me.
---
What do you play on
---
agreed -- but I don't even get the quest to recover your loot -- I've walked and walked around -- looked at map and I'm on top of the skull and cross bones -- -thanks though
---
Very slightly but does show something different when swinging it
---
I never understood how high prices for digital goods can get until I got into the trading itself. I learned from CS:GO why some specific pixels can be worth hundreds or thousands of real dollars. The same thing with an in-game economy. The people who play every day, even for just an hour, are absolutely overflowing with caps, legendaries, plans, and other crap. With this game, where we have event rewards with &lt;.05% drop rates or one-in-a-million legendary combinations, people will happily spend 20k on something it would otherwise take hundreds of hours to grind for. With that in mind, that's a steal
---
I've killed three and avoided another in the last two days.
---
Every time i'm on Arktos is a disappointment. either no one shows up, or they don't know wtf they're doing. Last time I was the only one filling any station, we had 3 friendly spawns.  They ALL (4 people) huddled around one, so I had to solo protect another (friendly charred ghoul, so it could defend itself somewhat) and the last died.  The legendary spawned on me only (Grafton Monster) and I was luckily able to solo it and keep my monster alive.
---
I've been apart of 6 small game titles and 1 triple A game as a developer. Your point of view shows me that YOU have no idea what it means to actually code and most likely your only experience is from some humble bundle you purchased for cheap and decided to try it on the fly.  
---
You keep saying my "choice of words" like it's derogatory or something. I'm keeping it simple for people like you that want to seem smart, but obviously are just talking out their ass. So by all means, keep talking and making yourself look like a fool, but the issue still stands that this issue is present and needs to be dealt with by the players if Bethesda isn't going to do anything about it.
---
We both know it's a general term people use to describe someone who's using custom scripts or mods to gain an unfair advantage, but that's just semantic.
---
The "hacks" in question involve editing the esm files to allow weapons and effects that aren't obtainable in game, like the scorchbeast sonic attack, the flatwoods monster laser, the behemoth fire hydrant, as well as being able to break armor instantly and hit a player an inhuman amount of times within a millisecond to get around the damage cap.
---
Not only that, but there's aimbots, esp, and mango fanta hacks that adjust the size of other players on your screen to huge proportions in order to see them in cover, see if they have modified files, and teleportation.  Some can even teleport your character right in front of their weapon, which quite a few people including myself have experienced in nuclear winter.
---
The problem comes from a lack of a robust client side file verification.  (It exists, but it's severely underpowered.)
---
Hope that clears things up.
---
thanks for the update
---
I froze four times in the last couple hours
---
the mystery pick was broken so they subbed in 25% off rather than leave it broken
---
That would be amazing.
---
It's not hacking.  It's a combination of a really good gaming chair, mountain dew code red, and vaping gamer girl bathwater.
---
you know we could do this again. I propose a massive guild of people who are assigned blocks to occupy around certain towns and we build an actual community of close knit camps that can be coordinated by a friends list.
---
its not going to be a problem.. im not worried about hitting the goal
---
Update: Despite well-meaning words below to the contrary, I have not seen any vendors selling Ultracite armor MOD plans. I think these are being confused with plans for with either Ultimate armor pieces or Ultracite mods for weapons. 
---
The BOS vendors have a fixed list of armor mod plans which are always there, but in my many attempts, never include Ultracite armor mod plans.
---
So, in short, I'm back to joining in on SBQ kills.
---
Haha thanks :)
---
It's not a matter of clearing things up. In mythology, if you want to summon or control a demon you have to use it's true name. Same concept, if we don't focus on the cause and call it the right thing, it won't be addressed as effectively. Really, they just need to prevent all input that isn't explicitly from the game client, and if we are able to modify a file that influences what we're able to do on the server, then they need to set up something like what you said, if any essential files have been modified, then you aren't allowed to connect to the server at all.
---
I just killed a 2* outside the random purveyor spawn point, literally an hour ago.
---
I walked up to it and it was sleeping, so I shot it in the face with my be dragon haha.
---
You know, they may be allowing it to go this far so that they have a copout for not allowing user generated mods, and then market their own.

Yeah it does. It’s just really rare. I just did it though so it’s 100% still there

I've seen a couple of people selling things in their shops like that. Scorchbeast scream. Sloth rock attack. Stuff like that. But I'm on Xbox. Is that the same thing?
---
Your vocabulary is what makes you seem inept. You still haven't said anything that would make anyone believe you're a developer. I'm 95% certain you're bluffing to shore up your argument.
---
We players have 0 power. Name shaming someone won't make then stop, if anything you give them more power by giving them publicity and attention, and they will just continue and probably get worse. Not to mention that Bethesda has motive to allow these "modders" to run rampant for a while.
---
The free week in June was pretty fun too
---
I would apply this to everything in life tbh. I wish more people would. If people just agreed to disagree imagine how things could be. Just because I’m not gay doesn’t mean I hate gay people or go out of my way to make topics denouncing the things they do! It’s pretty weird to me the hate I get from enjoying this game. I don’t generally give a shit because I know it’s a good game and the couple friends I’ve made playing it know that as well. But the producer of the game has 0 effect on me, idk if that’s a thing I’m jut unaware of though, but a fun game is a fun game and to each their own etc.
---
Yes it does. The peppered one has tiny pepper grinders attached to it, for example. Throws about black powder when swung.
---
I'm just using the easiest vernacular given the context of the OP, but you're right, it's technically not hacking.  It's still cheating though.
---
Perhaps later on when they start to allow mods they can have a whitelist for bethesda approved mods that change cosmetic things, allow custom colors, highlight materials, simplify menus, etc.
---
Allowing cosmetic mods to apply to certain atom shop items could be a way to get around losing money to someone just modding all the outfits into their game.
---
Either way, they need a much more intense client side verification or the custom scripts and botting will keep happening.
---
I get the frustration but it's a perfectly reasonable and sensible rule.
---
What we SHOULD be doing is pushing Bethesda harder and consistently to get their act together enough to deal with these issues.
---
There will always be cheaters. However, it's not on us to name and shame them. Reverse bullying is still bullying and that's what naming and shaming is - bullying.
---
Deal with the problem properly by focusing on the people that aren't dealing with the problem properly - Bethesda.
---
Yea it's been changed. It looks really good now and I have a extra plan
---
My bad, PC
---
No, those are items you can get in game that don't actually do anything.
---
For example; you can collect snallygaster spit attacks by pressing E/X/A on the snallygaster spit as it's coming at you.  All those are under MISC. and don't actually effect the game.
---
Well that's good to know I guess. I've only been keeping an eye out for it the past two days but I hadn't seen it. 
---
These bottlenecks are not fun to deal with though.
---
Yep, I've done Scorched Earth quite a few times, killed well over 100 different scorched mobs, and am still 2/3
---
1600 hours?!
---
It's annoying that shoddy work causes so many issues in this game. If it was an indy crew, I could live with it. I started with the beta, stopped playing just before the vault raids, and haven't seen a reason to resume. It still sounds like a mess.
---
just wait till 50%off sale then try ur luck. I got to twittle my thumbs till the legendary vending resets so i can turn in the trash i got from the SBQ and a 3* deathclaw 1. 3* Medics Crylorator that gives. +250 damage resistance while reloading, +33% Vats hit chance, Vats Crits will heal you and your group.2. 3*Stalker's Machete 40% more power attack damage if not in combat, 100% vats accuracy at +50% the ap cost + 1 agilty
---
One of my characters has a red hat and a blue hat. 
---
When you examine the red one, it's blue. Examine the blue one... It's red. lol
---
Gulper did not work for me. Killed 3 at the Dyer Chemical spawn in location for Strangler Blooms, still no atoms.
---
I’ll be ready with another 3000
---
Yea but I think the downvote and upvote system is exactly that. If you like or dislike something someone says. Isn’t that the point? (I didn’t downvote your comments by the way :P)
---
Yes but I've only seen it once since the new public event changes
---
I preordered the game.
---
That’s 66 Daaaaayyyysssssaaaahhh!   Since this game came out, you’ve spent the equivalent of 2+ months... *straight* in the wasteland.   Impressive as much as it is... well let’s just leave it at impressive.  😉👍🤯
---
Oh. Well in that case...    😳😳😳😳
---
I wouldn’t call it failed. It’s just different. I know people that didn’t like fallout 3 but loved new Vegas. Different strokes for different folks I guess. I enjoy the game as it is (sometimes I grit my teeth at things) but in general I spend 1-4 hours of my day playing it. Next update should be a game changer imo.
---
Don’t be a dick, man. I’m trying to be civil and agree with your point.
---
It's good that this is getting some traction. I've said exactly the same thing with a similar background and been downvoted to hell for it.
---
Some people just won't want to acknowledge the truth that BGS Austin are terrible at managing the code for this game.
---
Whether it's due to absolute incompetence, or more realistically, lack of resources and poor management, whatever the case, we can at least agree that even the most seemingly simple things get screwed up on a fairly regular basis.
---
To be fair, the whole game needs a review top to bottom but I guess Arktos is as good of a place as any to start.
---
Well that is discouraging
---
I personally don't think they will ever allow mods as we are used to them, but that's just my opinion 🤷‍♂️
---
Well. Post the dickheads GT up. Bounty hunters will revenge for U n spoilt their game like the way they spoil yours
---
Yeah, a really fun time just fucking around lmao, man I need to get back to this game
---
Or you could use common sense
---
I've only received shit spending 800+ scrips
---
&gt; You can all downvote do what you like.. I am honestly ***bored*** of defending this game now.. we shouldn’t be defending this game anymore.. Bethesda are literally treating us like dog shit and I’m ***bored*** of it🤷‍♂️ 
---
Your post also ***bored*** me.
---
That's ridiculous lol why save a spit attack when there's no benefit?
---
The definitely need to revise the system they put in place. Or get rid of some of the shittier events
---
Prob will be 20-30 million to get all the rewards
---
I have to cut them some slack since I've been FO and ES enthusiast since Oblivion.  Unfortunately many of these issues are fundamental to the engine and probably very difficult to address.
---
I am a computational scientist myself and know the video game industry has taken a hit recently.  Whether Bethesda lacks the programming talent or if their sales team is driving an ATOM shop effort over a patching one is anyone's guess.
---
This is a series full of hoarders.  We've been trained to pick up every tin can for the last decade and we can't seem to break the conditioning.
---
I still donate to suitcases and overseer caches because the big Godd Howard in the sky is always watching. The RNGsus as well. So that’s why I dump purified water, low caliber ammo, non-perishable food and diluted chems in there when I can.
---
&gt; Time to taste the explosive power of my fist!
---
-Saxton Hale
---
Let us be clear, calling me a dick was the first act of incivility.  Being a dick wasn’t my intention. As I’ll assume you directly insulting me, wasn’t yours. If you’ve spent that much time in the wasteland, I’d figured you for slightly thicker skin. All that said, I’m not far behind you in hours but if you can’t take a little jab at spending something like 20% of the last year in this game... well then...  🤷‍♂️😂👍
---
I miss the biplane
---
Your ignorance and not knowing about my IRL job aside, naming the players and giving them the publicity will do just that and force Bethesda to look at this issue if enough players say they've had enough.
---
Also, my vocabulary has nothing to do with anything aside from you trying to make me look bad. I'd use more intelligent words for you, but I'd be afraid you wouldn't understand with you constantly berating me and this thread and saying that Bethesda has "motive" to keep the modders / cheaters. That's the most asinine thing I've seen you type all night, btw.
---
I think my skin has gotten TOO thick. I should turn off notifications for this sub. LOL
---
Dang! I wish I weren't on PC! Good luck with your event - sounds like fun! :D
---
Sure, let’s start witchhunts. Let’s harass them and while we’re at it. We could also dox them in the process.
---
Are you really that stupid?
---
It doesn’t matter if they hacked or not.
---
They’re humans and have their right for anonymity in the internet. 
---
If they hacked they should be banned BY Bethesda.
---
Ok ok.  Seriously meant no offense.  Just a little light hearted jab.  If it was misguided, for that,  you have my apology.  This sub is often rank, but I hope I didn’t sour it further for you.  🙏
---
Ok I'll look into that
---
More worried about shitty rolls... :p
---
Yes! They’ve sucked lately
---
This is the best thing I ever saw in this game
---
Launch 76 shits all over current 76
---
I dunno. I don't see how a level 50 toon with a level 50 shotgun with mods and several shotgun perks should have to burn through 15 rounds to the face of a level 20 mole miner to drop it.
---
Ah, there's the word. Bullying. Was waiting for someone to start spouting that bullshit. Bullying would be these players that are cheating and ruining the play time of other players if you want to use that bullshit term.   
---
Bullying in this sense is ignorant. You're telling me that we shouldn't "pick on the poor little people that are cheating" because it would be bullying them? Horse shit. Grow up and get thicker skin. They are the ones that should be shamed and to use your term, bullied.   
---
Bullying is a bullshit term that parents made up because they gave their kids everything they wanted and didn't teach them to stand up for themselves. Now, I'm not saying that there aren't people that need to be taught to respect other people and their things. But again, that comes back on the parents doing a piss poor job of teaching their kids to respect others and work hard for what they want instead of always getting a participation trophy.
---
Funny because I went through your reddit just now and all I see from the last 3 months is complaints, bickering, and temper tantrums. Oh I'm sorry, you RARELY say nice things to people - then you turn around and ruin it by being a grade A jerk the next moment to the same people! smh =_=
---
furthermore, what does karma have to do with my point, namely that you're CONSTANTLY whining about a game that -while flawed- is loads of fun with friends? :/ I gave you constructive criticism and you straight up flipped out ^_^' if anyone has BS to sort, it's you good sir.
---
Regardless, it's a moot point. This is a fallout 76 thread, and the whole conversation is getting derailed. Doubtful you will listen to my advice, which is unfortunate because ignoring it is just going to ensure you remain toxic and unpleasant to be around.
---
Truly was the height of this game, you still see it sometimes but starting up the game with a full server all in vault 76 was so much fun
---
I was going to say why don’t get gang up and start new characters. No vending, OG style.
---
Server crashes ;D
---
I think the BOS vendor in Whitesprings carries them and you can get them in the wild too. 
---
All train stations have a machine on the outside that takes legendary items and gives you scrip. You take the scrip to a Mole Miner in Berkely Springs station and they will sell you a chance at a weapon or armor item with 1, 2, or 3 Legendary effects. 
---
Good luck!
---
I figure more events means more chances. Plus they may balance which ones happen - we can hope anyway.
---
Mole miner gauntlets are probably my favorite looking melee weapon in the game. I love the Industrial/Kreuger look.
---
It just occurred to me that they might be broken power fists repurposed with knife blades.
---
what system are you on
---
PC
---
ah nvm have the plan on xbox
---
So what can I do about the fact that I half to eat and drink every 5 min in game and every time I 
---
get hit I contract something?
---
Seriously man go do some research I'm not gonna die on the "consoles have mods" hill, against someone whos willfully ignorant, or lying to sound like you know more than you do. I brought up levels because people(usually children) frequently say, lag, glitch exploits, and high level players are evidence of people modding. 
---
Idk how I put words in your mouth, your talking about releasing peoples names because bethesda isn't stopping hackers, I felt it was relevant. Neither of us know what their budget is for such things. So all we can do is speculate. I would rather them focus time and money on other stuff, and they probably do too.
---
Releasing peoples names is still a terrible idea, that makes them targets. I'm sure there are some people on the internet who are capable of getting email addresses from someones fallout 76 tag. If even one person got their shit doxxed on the dark web, then its not worth it. 
---
You have so much negativity in you young one, hate is the path to darkside. Honestly I shouldn't have even replied, your attitude and the way you conduct yourself is toxic, and this whole deal just feels like you wanted stroke your ego or something. The way you've conducted yourself makes me think your lying about working on any games, and you've just been using that as a "I work on Video games so I'm right."
---
Your desperately trying to "win" the discussion and its painfully obvious.
---
Fair enough
---
Same. I've killed SBQ and the gang a few times, I only have the same 2/3 as you do unlocked.  In Cranberry Swamp/Marsh whatever, I killed a scorched Megasloth and 2 scorched Snallygasters.  Remained at 2/3.
---
So it's the Fallout Anthology with an extra game and no badass Mini Nuke case?
---
can i get your psn name so i can come visit dude?
---
The real MVP.
---
Lol i did the grafton monster event about a hr ago no one even had a chance to get there..lol i used my BE Combat rifle.
---
I did it once last night 2 peeps meelee 4 with explosive rifles.. didnt last long
---
The tenderizer weapon is fantastic. Most bad comments about it are meant to drive the price down. But the tenderizer weapon can do heaps of damage.
---
Nope. If you're running speed demon for faster reload times, you can use perk cards instead, but otherwise you just have to decide whether the speed increase is worth the hassle until they fix it.
---
You saw people helping eachother?
---
Yeah, which weapon exactly?
---
I will join in on the fun
---
Edit: sent a friend request
---
Put a couple of gun turrets out the front, and don't repair your Windows or walls they will just come back.
---
Just fallow the scull and cross bones on ur cumpus unless some asshole comes along and steals it b4 u get there..  had it happen to me a few times.
---
Well, lots of stupid things in this world. Don't get too much into it. It ultimately means nothing.
---
No mods necessary. It’s an effect from excavator it self. And lucky hole mine is the best spot for it.
---
This is true. I just can't not pick it up lol
---
Its a bearcase
---
Why the hell would you even be posting this here? Call your local law enforcement.
---
Got rid of speed demon so one problem kinda solved
---
If only it worked like that nice joke but this ain’t really a laughing matter something needs to be done the guy is circling around my neighborhood with people with him and guns
---
I did they can’t do anything about it even tho we have video proof of him smashing my car window
---
Call the police again?
---
Lucky hole mine. Just make sure you're wearing the excavator armor when picking up the ore. No attachments needed. You'll need acid to smelt the ore.
---
We did 2nd time today after a couple of minutes after he shot up my sisters car and they can’t do anything
---
If on PS4 I can help set it up for ya
---
A shrek house is a great idea, hope someone does a proper one, that would be fun. Why do you try?
---
Stay away from the windows and doors. Get the fridge between you and the shooter. Keep the outside lights in and the inside lights off. Doors and windows locked. 
---
Stay on the phone with the police. Keep calling don’t give up!
---
Haven't seen it in ages, which is a total bummer
---
Yea we’re trying everything but police just seem to like handing out tickets not arresting criminals
---
This is boring now, can people just please search before posting? It's not hard.
---
call the cops again, get their badge numbers. go to the precinct and demand to talk to their captain. might want to get a lawyer involved, too.
---
Do you have to be in an event for the kills to count, or is it just any old random Scorched kill?
---
System uses specific image naming format. Get porn pic, rename as an existing photo/screenshot. Congrats you have Porn hanging in your CAMP.
---
The cops won’t come out to you when a guy is shooting your house up? I’m really confused as to why you posted here? I mean the responders are all dead and we haven’t seen the BoS for a long time, I mean we could ask modus but chance are he will want something in return.
---
Get a gun, shoot back. If that doesnt work. Try changing worlds. I know pvp is not everyone's cup of tea
---
So pc players ruining the prospect of any good idea again.
---
I call bs. If someone’s running around with a gun they can do something. Go troll another subreddit 🙄
---
I e always gone to the top of the world, grabbed all the can traps and you've got lead for days! (some server hopping required)
---
There is a random spawn where you can hear it yell, but it never shows up.
---
Dude no bullshit on my momma I’ll post a pic of the guy
---
Heres a tip, BAN any player that breaks the agreement you HAVE TO ok before installing and playing said game.  Nuff said, problem solved.
---
Please do not do this. This is the first challenging content we have. Don’t let the people that have played for a month change the game for the people that have been playing since launch.
---
Are you stupid? Why do you post this here?
---
I’m asking for help from the community cause the police don’t want to
---
Yea we have guns thing is the guy has multiple people with weapons
---
I kinda miss camp damage. What better way would there be to express my disgust at someone's severely overpriced vending machine. 5 caps a piece for fusion cells?  Take this!
---
Since it's an almost free repair I just don't see why the change, just increase the bounty and accompanying penalties of bankruptcy (example:  if your bounty is above your current caps you do no PvP damage, including to camps).
---
Make vendors indestructible and self powered with a toggle if someone doesn't want them on. Everything else is fair game, with a bounty commensurate to the repair cost. Break a wall?  That'll be 10 caps. Break an arch?  250.
---
&gt;For example i loot non-container stuff such as military grade duct tape and hop, can i still find it? 
---
No, not immediatey. However I and quite many are in belief that there is that 20 hour timer being mentioned on video.
---
But not too long ago I came across this.
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/edit#
---
Quite tedious for me to test, so I haven't bothered, but I've definetely seen things I know I've looted, and am able to loot again, during same long session. And only during release I did something like 20 hour session(actually I think it was even more, it was really amazingly long time to play without sleeping), normally my long sessions are maybe 6-12 hours.
---
So to me those 180/ 60 item/container limits seem to check out.
---
This is a game sub.
---
Go away with your bullshit
---
When Scorchbeasts were *scary*. Now they go down in 5 bodyshots.
---
Call everyone Nazi griefers and tell them you'll report them for how they play the game.  Next thing you know you'll be rollin' in friends.
---
Always checking the Whitespring bot in the workshop room &amp; the Watoga station for cheap legendaries was the best thing. Never seen a legendary in a vendor since. #Rip
---
What?
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/EKl3ZIk
---
Well personally I don’t want people griefing my camp so I’m happy with how it is
---
Not bullshit if you don’t got none good to say don’t say none
---
I finished the tadpole ones, I have 6 possum ones left. You don't really get much, I've just been doing them to have something to do.
---
Smh 1.i also call bs as any law enforcment even crooked cops would still show up and arrest them. 2. This is why every home owner needs to own atleast 1 firearm because at the end of the day we are our own first defence.
---
That's crazy how did u get that? What perk cards?
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/EKl3ZIk here’s a picture of the guy we showed the police officers who were 2 woman and they said that the crime had to be committed in a 2 hour span for them to arrest
---
I dont think the a.i. is that sophisticated.  Pretty sure they go for the closest non immortal object.   If im correct, the punji boards are most likely to go first.
---
You want this subreddit to be shut down?
---
I added the 3rd blade to mine and it's faster swing just tears it up, crazy how fast it swings. I wish I could use it while in PA i would be unstoppable..lol
---
You're a gentlemen, and a scholar
---
You're not good at reading up, are you? :)
---
/r/wooosh
---
Like the others said, go to the Lucky Hole Mine while wearing Excavator. You'll come out of there with hundred of lead ores. Also make sure to have plenty of acid.
---
But here's another tip. Make sure you have a full maxed out Super Duper perk while you craft. Can't stress enough how amazing this perk is. You'll be making shit tons of lead if that perk activates.
---
The thing is, the only way the griefers could afford to do what they did was to be capless while doing so.  You should be free to break stuff at will, but you'd never be able to skip out on the consequences like it used to be. 
---
The penalty used to only be applied after death and was a 50% debuff for 4 hours. I posit that it should instead be applied anytime the bounty is in excess of the wanted player's current caps and the debuff set to 100%. This means they'd never be able to rack up a bounty significantly higher than the penalty for doing so. 
---
All those griefers back in the day getting 5000 cap bounties were capless before they even got a 10c bounty.  Given how broken PvP was (and still is) the 50% debuff was essentially meaningless.
---
I miss seeing everyone running around. The church in Flatwoods always had a couple people there trying to level up. I am hoping Wastelanders brings that back.
---
&gt; So your retort about that is a mute point. 
---
Moot.
---
If you can’t find it build a bunch of them at the lowest level and scrap them- you’ll learn it eventually.
---
I heard about the scarecrow attracting enemies to it, but at my camp they attack whatever is closest to where they spawn in at.
---
&gt;People come to reddit looking for very specific pieces usually and are willing to pay more .. 
---
Not just. Willing &amp; capable. And the idea is, you are paying much higher, for the CONVENIENCE of not randomly hopping through a large pile of servers, though large amount of camps, to just randomly get a 1% chance find something worth buying, at decent price. It's worth paying more.
---
The price disparity is so strange. I see people asking for 100 caps for fusion cores on trade discord. And I wonder can anyone afford such prices. I don't wonder the same obsene prices on vending machines. Im pretty sure those players don't sell much.
---
If it’s not a laughing matter don’t post it on reddit you idiot. This will be seen as nothing but a joke. Call the police fool.
---
He won't be able to hurt you or your camp unless you shoot back and initiate PvP. 
---
Just ignore him and he'll eventually go away.
---
It branches to others besides charisma, so even with your current build you’ll be okay in dialogue using perception or strength or something. No need to spec to something else. 
---
There’s also drugs. Lots of drugs
---
Yeah a lot doesn’t make sense story wise but here we are
---
I would say launch the nuke, and then you get access to the escape launch pod, except you set your sights on fissure prime as the destination. So you can fast travel there.
---
I don’t know how you would know to launch there but oh well
---
I believe in the caverns on the BOS line it may be noted
---
You can actually get to power armor levels with Vanguard legendary effects. Scout, heavy combat and maybe marine will do it. Add in poisoner, stat and sentinel effects, and a vanguard suit can be considerably better than power armor. You could also go Bolstering or unyielding if your gauntlet is bloodied. The damage you can do with a bloodied gauntlet is unholy. One shot sheepsquatch and lvl 80 scorchbeasts all day long.
---
Ahh right. I haven't played Fallout 4,3, NV in a long time and forgot about the INT speech check. I just hope there is well written dialogue and  a story to keep me invested. I'm so over doing quests given to me by holotapes and gutsys.
---
I just don’t want griefers ok? I put hard work into my camp and I don’t want to return to see it in smoulders. So now that they can’t destroy my camp I’m much happier with that.
---
Yes! My zealots FFR Gatling plasma with prime does insane damage boost to scorchbeast queens
---
*defense
---
Thanks for the help 👌♥️
---
I will keep this in mind that might be my next build thanks
---
&gt;and selling a explosive pipe revolver for 11k
---
And you know why? Because the one for 2k, was already sold way before you got there.
---
Okay it depends on what kind of exposive pipe revolver but many are quite valuable, and if sold for less, they would sell quite fast.
---
And 100% reason to remember the game
---
Iron clad5, evasive3,barbarian3, mutations grounded and scaley skin 15 strength-14 agility 15 endurance, 1C, 1P and 4 or 5 luck. Metal chest piece puts out 111dmg resist alone.
---
After 20 hours it should spawn again, however if u have been continually hopping and not picking things up the the world they might not. This happened to me, for two solid days not dresses would spawn. I asked for help on Reddit and someone told me to pick up 180 junk items from the world and they would spawn again. So I just picked up all the junk from fort Defiance (the whole building lol) and it actually worked, they dresses were spawning again. I hope that askers your question lol
---
Any kill of any creature with "scorched" in the name.  (I.E. *not* scorchbeasts and SBQ's).
---
No problem! It’s how I got my extra blade on miner
---
It’s any random scorched kill
---
A post apocalyptic wasteland where criminals don't exist. Now I've heard everything. 
---
I'd even be in favor of people being able to steal junk/aid from display cases if the bounty applied for such theft is twice it's value. 
---
Again, free to do what you want, but still have to face the consequences of your misdeeds. It is a wasteland after all and this aspect of previous games missing is a huge disconnect for me.
---
Oh also, if you spawn into a world and someone is already in the asylum I would find I could pick up their world items. For example I would always pick up the straight jackets for a quick 50caps lol, and when I spawned and someone was already there I could pick it up again
---
Always thought combat armor was the best, now u have me rethinking that. Thanks going to keep that info
---
I get that but at the same time if I wanted griefing I’d just go to survival mode
---
They stack additively. Zealot is +30% damage to Scorched &amp; Scorchbeasts and Prime is +35% damage -&gt; 65% bonus damage.
---
Uhh...   it doesn't exist anymore.
---
Thank you very much, comments like this really make all that time in leadings screens worth it lol thank you 😊🙏
---
Welcome to the club.
---
It's been confirmed since like E3
---
Its something that desperately needs fixed. There are even people who either use teammates or just kill them self with a legacy weapon to trigger the effect. 
---
I've seen it multiple times, and even reported a player for exploiting it, but BGS did nothing about it as I saw said player a few weeks later attempting to bait me into a fight.
---
I mean, it is a lot of kills, but there are also Scorched everywhere. EVERYWHERE. They are the raiders of this game. I had to kill around three hundred just looking for the bathroom earlier.
---
But really. Say the game has roughly 100k regular players, for arguments sake, and kills ten each in a day. You have a million kills in a day. Or, say 150k players kill an average of 15-20 of the poor blighters. You arrive at roughly our current number of kills.
---
To be a little more cynical of the games health, though, how often do you get away with \*only\* killing 15-20 scorched in a day? You are fighting them, that many to a location, from the day you leave Flatwoods behind. They spawn in every time you fight a Scorchbeast. They spawn in at every Queen fight. They spawn for various events in large numbers such as Line in the Sand. Add to that the fact that any creature with 'Scorched' in its name, aside from Scorchbeasts, count towards the kills too. At risk of downvotes I put the game at around 40-50k players across all platforms combined at the high end. Which isn't bad; FO76 is now a year old with a very short story and little endgame to speak of.
---
Lol that’s so weird, I don’t think I’ve examined mine, I’ll need to go look now 😄
---
Well, you paid how much for F76? Highest price you could find, or lowest.
---
&gt;escape launch pod 
---
The what now? I've only ever launched two nukes, did I miss something?
---
Hm, thanks, I'll go back and take a look. I'm curious.
---
I kinda wanna see them detonate
---
Can you not read you shit
---
There’s an elevator back up to the surface that I call an escape pod. I guess it isn’t really but it (almost) instantly teleports you to the surface so you can fast travel so you can see where I’m coming from
---
It’s to the left of the launch console I think
---
--spoilers ahead, you've been warned--  
---
It's noted in a few terminals I think. FSP is also marked as a test site or something in the Enclave bunker. Look at the map in the military wing. 
---
I'm also certain it's mentioned in one of the BoS terminals or something with the overseer that nuking Prime could end the scourge of scorched.   I know if you *don't* nuke prime, you can return to the silo after launch and find a holotape of her bitching at you for "starting an arms race" and assuming you were a plant from Vault Tec intended to do exactly as you did.
---
Can you not be so fucking stupid? You dumb fuck.
---
She was but sometimes she dies for no apparent reason ahah
---
Does it not?
---
Junkies and bloodied with explosive or fire rate would be the most sought after
---
Yes! Please fix this so people can stop abusing it
---
Removed, effective Oct 1.
---
You're right I am assuming OP is a guy due to the fact that, IMO, only a guy would want to wear that suit he started the game with. Look around we (chicks) are stylin..lol I dropped that suit when I found the first outfit didn't matter what it was..
---
If you don't know how to counter VATS, it doesn't matter what your build is, you're probably going to get smoked.
---
&gt;ive wanted to get into serum selling, but i figure most everyone has the mutations they want by now... 
---
Nah it's really bad business. People do occasionally buy but mainly the better mutations and about 200-250c.
---
Serum recipes are only good for players who play a lot and just want something to spend a lot of caps, and to do with flux. The "return of investment" is really poor.
---
Yes but it only shows up at night. So if you have another public event late in the day the timer will often block Campfire tales or any other night based event for showing for another 24+ in game hours.
---
Hopefully when they reduce the timer between events it will lessen how often night events like Campfire Tales and One Violent Night get clockblocked.
---
There is a dupe glitch for throwable items at the moment, you just get to max weight (it needs to say MAX) Next to your weight, the throw and item (tomahawk, knife, meat clever, any mine) and then just spam the pick up button and it will just spawn one for every time you click/press the action
---
I killed a TON of players with my latest character while he was leveling.  Even at lvl 20 something he was able to hit the damage cap using a lvl 15 Bloodied handmade, utilizing proper tactics of course.
---
A full run of lead ore out of Lucky Hole Mine can get you over 1000 lead scrap if you do it right. For 100 lead you could just run Charleston Fire Dept and the weight rooms of each nuke silo and scrap their weights sets.
---
Has zealots been changed?  It used to not apply to Scorchbeasts.
---
Grape mentats and +cha armour might help
---
I stopped playing because of the missing text chat, and because mobs would respawn in buildings after you killed them while you loot the area. Did they fix any of that?
---
Edit: and because of sounds of shooting constantly getting stuck and looping while sounding close.
---
:D
---
Got the plasma ;)
---
It's amazing for acid farming.
---
Sounds fair!
---
I found it too
---
Oh yea.
---
The Small backpack was added last patch, it's got half the capacity of the standard one from the tadpole quest and can't be equipped with mods.
---
It definitely applies to Scorchbeasts and SBQ since Patch 8 and was confirmed by datamining. I don't know when Beth actually fixed it or if it was really broken before.
---
Never knew about the bugged 250dr
---
There were a lot of problems with it. I liked the fact that PvP restrictions were lessened. It made things more interesting, but at the same time PvP is ridiculously broken so you'd often find the Tesla bois pillaging.  These are the only PvPers I get upset with. 
---
Great. You're invisible, can't be VATSd, and don't have to aim cause your gun will bounce off the ground and hit me even if I'm invisible too.
---
Seconded
---
Don't really agree. Maybe he could get a total of 30k, though on xbox I suspect not even that.
---
You're not doing it right!  It's great for flux AND acid farmers. 
---
Run your farm in a nuke zone. You get the nuke zone drops off the spawns.
---
We do raids. Oh wait... 😂
---
Here's a quick tip for any, 
---
kill a (blank) with a (blank) challenge. 
---
Equip the weapon in question throw a grenade at enemy, challenge complete.
---
I wish I had known this before! Great for future reference though, thanks.
---
What happened?
---
I haven't played since the initial month.
---
Add in the option to be a filthy communist spy too!  Would dovetail nicely with an idea I had. 
---

I farm sentrybots in whitesprings for fusion cores.
---
&gt;They're bats, they see with echolocation.
---
They have just higher perception than most anything else. Game doesn't have any echolocation except in holotapes. 
---
Good sneaking ability allows hitting SBQ without it being able to detect you, or loosing off normal SB when you start sneaking, if they see you.
---
Hmm no.
---
I still feel like this could be solved by using a perma server instead of allowing to hop from one to the other. 
---
You could only go to a new server by creating a new character. Bam, everybody would wait the new servers opening to create character. 
---
It would also allow people to build effective guilds/factions because you'd know you'll always play with the same people.
---
Vendor shops
---
That's also like 1200 or so lead scrap for 200-250 acid.
---
Think some people have rose tinted glasses on for this.
---
PS4 too, I’ve had a whopping 31 crashes. I went back through error history and counted all the ones I had today and I can’t fix it. Nothing works for it ;(
---
I've yet to find the plasma grenade plan and res a player in water and that's me,if you need badges do the two daily challenge's as they do give badges I've now got 21 possam and 7 tadpole.
---
Grahm is coming to get you...........be afraid

But wait, there's tea time that repeats five times in a row on my server!

[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
I got mone from fachnate event.
---
Problem with that damage is its per pellet. Individual hits and their poor damage gets absorbed by high resistances of anything. Net result is very little damage done.
---
You killed Chally!
---
Found it, good work! I always had in mind to recreate a whole music video starting with something easy like Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear Us Apart".
---
What does a weapon being legacy have anything to do with this?
---
Not going to be enough. They need to categorize events. Campfire tales, violent night, and arktos should not be on the same timer as the other public events.
---
Shotguns never got never got nerfed, and why should laser rifles be nerfed?
---
Launch was so funn
---
i think at least 30% of my total playtime was during the beta and just after release. haven't felt motivated to do the grind alone since really.
---
Good thinking!
---
Camden park has plenty of basketballs.
---
Really nice of you.
---
 It's 100% impossible to have a level playing field unless everyone's on level 1s.
---
Yeah I sold a couple for 2500 caps. They went surprisingly quick. Once I knew they were more sought after than I thought, I still left the prices low. I dont want to make multiple characters and I am almost always pushing the cap limit. I might have 8-10 legendary weapons one day and the next day have 40 I need to sell. (I have about 50 right now) I find myself buying random rare outfits and shit just so I spend caps and can keep moving inventory without taking a loss. That and ammo.
---
Oh, I agree, the event thing needs work. I think the changes messed stuff up, in my opinion. I was just pointing out that they said they’re going to do something, at least. We’ll see how it goes.
---
You should submit a ticket to bethesda. You could get your stuff back. Always save a video if this kinda thigs happen.
---
&gt; hat b
---
wrong game pal. im sure carebear building games exist on steam as do walking sims etc etc
---
When I'm in a team sharing strange in numbers it goes up more also, I had it up to 800 and one point, if your on PS4 I can send you a pic of it
---
r/cringe
---
It's funny how Beth broke events by fixing them.
---
There were about a dozen people at the Overseer's camp chatting and teaming up. 
---
The free weekend flooded the forest with quite a few first timers.
---
I found a chasis in the Nuka Cola plant. I still have it!
---
*in Beta
---
I mean the tag line is literally ‘rebuild America’ and that’s what I’m doing. Making my camp open to people to help others. I’m sure your still sad that you can no longer grief and that was the only thing that you enjoyed making others suffer but hey you do you
---
U r lucky u got sucked. :p
---
I usually sell cheap. I am constantly pushing the cap limit. I dont want to mess with multiple characters and moving things between accounts. As low as Ive ever been is 8-10 Legendary weapons. I usually have 30+ to sell. Right now Im sitting on at least 50 and about half of them were accumulated just today and yesterday. I regularly go buy shit tons of ammo and rare outfits to spend caps and stay around 20k. A couple sales and I need to go spend again. Im fine with that. Three days ago I spent my entire cap stash which was about 27k on plans I found for X-01 armor and now today I was right back to 27k. Thats after buying a bunch of other stuff. Ill go buy shit tier legendary guns just to scrip if I dont have time to farm. Caps are easy to come by and I dont care if I sell dirt cheap.
---
I submitted a ticket. I was too pissed off to think straight and take a video. I gave them the exact time this happened. They could fix this but I doubt they will. Things like this continuing to happen almost a year after launch shows how little they care.
---
This is correct. There is a random spawn that features the sheepie’s nest. You hear him bellow as you approach the nest, but you never see him. This random event started appearing about a week before the actual flesh Sheepsquach was introduced in-game. 
---
There are a few other Sheep related random events. One includes the Sheepsquatch asleep in his nest. Another involves the Sheepsquatch fighting a herd of the Albino Radstags.
---
Ah good to know.  Thanks!
---
Hmm...daaaamn. That's...complex.
---
Someone steals from me, I don't care what it was, I just block them. 
---
There's few other reasons I block, too. I don't keep taps on what they did, when, where. It's fire and forget for me. Simple and probably pointless, but it gives me a fuzzy feeling inside I've handled the matter.
---
I think it would be kinda neat to see people you've blocked. I could review it, or maybe even reset it all like twice a year. But there's no list of blocked players. They are just blocked. Maybe.
---
Well, you know, instead of fixing things like the trade bug, it’s better to break things that don’t need fixing. Gotta keep the grind going!
---
😀
---
j/k (kind of)
---
Oh my gosh remember the strange in numbers glitch where you could run on air? I went to the top of the broken rail car, then ran in air all the way to Fort Defiance to see if there was anything on top. (There wasn't, also very easy to get stuck on top) 
---
Took foreeeeeever to fall down though 😂
---
It’s almost as if it’s part of the game
---
Fusion cells 1 cap. EM Cartridges? Nah son those dont just fall out of the sky. Same for Cryo Cells.
---
The amount of people running around punching each other before actually getting out of the vault was actually a lot of fun.
---
(Also the first time I got harassed for being a girl was in beta in the vault)
---
NW doesn't feel the same.
---
you carebears are not even aware that fallout76 was ruined even before launch because of YOU (the pvp opt-in system). Never will you carebears understand that because of YOU we didnt get RUST v2.0 set in a heart pounding hostile wasteland. this could have been a 90/100 game instead of a 54/100
---
You need to grow up
---
I get a LOT of traffic set up by Gad just west of Whitesprings. All levels of players too which was the point. I set up just down the road from the houses by the steel node. Looks nice, kind of blends in (especially if I have a neighbor a little further north at the flat spot in the grass) and generates a lot of traffic. Theres almost always someone at my base shopping.
---
Yeah because of us we made an amazing community who is willing to help each other. In my opinion it’s the other way round with all the griefing it was awful a definite 54/100 but now we can help each other it’s a 90/100
---
If you want a toxic cesspool of constant killing just keep playing rust
---
Wounding? I've completed around 80 runs and haven't seen this effect. Are you sure it exists in Fo76? Haven't seen it in the marketplace either.
---
The Thorn Scout armor set does have such an effect though... it causes melee attackers to bleed and adds extra bleed damage to your melee attacks
---
What's a carebear?
---
I usually see them for 10,000 minimum. 25,000 most of the time.
---
Besides from the free travel this sucks, events are popping up at an extremely slow pace compared to before...
---
That rating had nothing to do with the "carebears" as you put it, most players of fo76 are fallout fans, y know the ones that usually play the solo experience most fallout games are.
---
The rating is because of the half assed way Bethesda has stitched this game together, broken quests, glitches a plenty, the game is in a broken state and the reviews showed it.
---
If anything having it as a rust 2.0, pure PvP game would have put off more people from playing it
---
&gt;, but most of the time I would check the event status a few minutes after it popped and see zero participants.
---
Yeah well. Pretty sure I've said it before. 
---
Go there. Then it's 1. Can't be arsed? Well maybe other players are following the same logic. If you blame them for doing what you do?
---
It's difficult event, yes. Lets keep it that way. So many events are trivial and barely worth doing. Many are completely not worth doing.(oddly you see lots of high levels there)
---
I mean it is difficult. I wouldn't want anything to be changed about that. But, it does feel it's lacking something, to make players easier to learn what to do there. I don't know what.
---
Then there's another thing. You want stuff from the event. I kinda want too. But I've started to get impression not a lot do. They just want the legendary boss to spawn, and then kill it quickly. So it would require more coordinated team to actually do it.
---
It was shown in the game files as an upcoming effect that they were implementing into fo76, I was hoping they'd have put it in for the raids
---
I remember while playing the beta, petrified corpses would drop nuclear material when you interacted with them. I’m not sure when they got rid of that feature though.
---
Event poping up at a slow rate and looks like noone even joining.
---
Oh look the Ark kids are here
---
I think thats a kids show about jumping bears in the medieval
---
And maybe remove VATS from pvp? That low level player can straight up aimlock on your head and two-tap you lol
---
&gt;look at the output of the mystery pick and ask "why the hell are there only limb damage with agi or weight reduction melee weapons on this list of test results?"
---
Well why would anyone test that? I don't really see any logic. 
---
Though it is really odd bug. Is their RNG generator completely broken. Or the loot code so f*cked up they can't use it properly. That's really odd. There's bizarre bugs, but then there's that. The game has a lot of odd bugs.
---
Which is why they should up the player count
---
Why don't you make a lfg post instead, and just do the raid? I mean, you also needed to 'team' up with another player to beat revive challenges for the tadpole badge?
---
What platform r u on
---
Not a 100% but I think the new effects on weapons and armor arrive with wastelanders.
---
This is absolutely true. We also support the style of game we like to play though, which is a survival sandbox without pvp. Which is the important part in my opinion, because ONLY Fallout 76 does this. I love open world, building and playing with others while I detest open world survival full of screaming sociopaths - but I still dont call those who play them names and spit on them, regardless of business practice. Because if you want someone to come around to your point of view, you try to talk to them, not scream profanities at them. Everything else is just self gratification and has nothing to with "making games great again."
---
If there's no bag when you return to where you died usually means someone else picked up your lost loot which you should have gotten a notification telling you who picked it up.
---
I logged in the other day to find my power armor off its chassis. I tried to go make a trade with someone, but had the trade glitch that didn’t let me. Fixed it and finished the trade, then went to middleman for someone on my over weight mule that was parked at whitesprings. Logged in and I was at my camp in the middle of nowhere. 
---
As great as your idea might be, you are asking to much from a company that cares so little. I’ll give you the up vote bc I like this. But...pipe dreams man.
---
I don't know why but I'm a bit suspicious about the Outerworlds
---
Yeah I've not been able to find any fix either.  I also haven't been able to find a common thread between the crashes.
---
[Chubs loves you too](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/2/29/Comrade_Chubs.png/revision/latest?cb=20190129072104)
---
Its a cartoon about a group of bears that care n share and mostly about friendship with others.
---
The term "carebear" is a term PvP orientated players coin for people who do this in games instead of shooting each other in the face n nicking loot
---
God roll! If you ever plan to sell it, don't take anything less than multiple other god rolls lol. Maybe make it a week-long auction on the marketplace or something
---
Haha I originally ended the post with “dreams, right?” But decided not to. Cynicism is well placed based on the track record.
---
Stacked bear rug base; common sight (usually near Whitesprings) on PC
---
A mode no one would play and would get axed like Survival. GG.
---
Because, i do the raid, but :
---
\- I have one or two hour of playing by a day, generally, the time to make the V94 only one time. And there are days i dont find anybody for doing it ( actually really hard to persuade my friends to do it, because when we're disconnected in, we loss all our progression, ammos, aids used... and not be able to come back ) -&gt; It's actually, impossible to do it 10 times or more like the challenge want to in only 1 week ( and 3 times in hardcore mode... never find a group capable of doing it one time only! )
---
\- i ve also already doing the tadpole challenges, but it's not even similar it terms of difficulties, of feasibility i'll say.  
---
I'm not saying this challenge is impossible to do in the absolute...but in one week... i really dont know in my friends base on Fo76 anyone capable of doint it. No one.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And i'm on PC
---
Psychobuff provides a 10-15% increase in melee damage over Fury
---
All I know is karma is a b***h, and they will eventually get it straight back their way. Some with brain cells will learn, others will just get lost in society and become useless. Because if you naturally have a griefing attitude, you dont deserve anything to go your way.
---
I know we talk about people in the game.
---
But I'm talking about these people in general.
---
Go play DayZ
---
Oh, and i forget to say : When you say you 've not win the hardcore mod actually, many LFG group dont want to pick you. So, i really dont see how it's actually possible, exept for hardcore players with statics groups to achieve it.
---
1 and 2*'s ones I would scrip them or depending on the levels your stuff are, give them to lower level players if possible.
---
I agree that it was a bad idea for bethesda to add challenges that require a team, and I'm bummed I can't help you as I'm on Ps4 :(
---
Zenimax put profits before making a good game. Should have been delayed minimum a year.
---
Oh , I figured the vault raids would be better for it.
---
you are wrong. the opt in pvp removed all tension from the game
---
Also, if you use a bloodied build with an unyielding set, that mole miner gauntlet will hit casual 8000s (yes, eight thousand hehe)
---
And the tension stopped most people from playing survival
---
Which mode got taken off again?, remind me? Was it adventure or survival? Yeah it was survival y know the PvP orientated mode
---
you made me so happy LUL
---
too bad I'm on PC and can't get me some free milk and steaks delivered to my doorsteps by your delivery service :D
---
I hope we will get some funny ones. Latest semi-funny bug I've found, that you can't board a vertibot when using PA.
---
Most of the new stuff have been fairly working. But wastelanders is pretty big. NPCs and all that. So things are going to be broken, but all I hope is we got some lols out of it, too.
---
I'm currently farming them like crazy because I also do the challenges right now. Gets stale really fast tho. Especially when alone.
---
If you find anything out or manage to fix it, let me know. I’ve never had this many problems with it before. I’m at my wits end with the game lol
---
I am definitely a carebear, then. And long may this game be full of them. :-)
---
I was early access as well... Not played the game after the first month. I will get back to it again... But man, it'll be different
---
Atom shop item. 'Kill, laugh, love' neon sign. And I don't have a picture, I though I have, but nope.
---
your opinion is FACTUALLY flawed. you should be ashamed. You didnt consider amount of players per server on dayZ and just because a bad idea is used by someone does not make it good. apologize please
---
I sell everything i can but i sell dirt cheap i just play for the xp i got everything i want already in the game in my stash 
---
 20 to 30 caps for weapons all levels
---
1 to 10 caps meds and food 
---
20 to 30 caps for armor including power armor parts i dont use armor minus the power armor i have stored 
---
Ammo 1 to 10 caps
---
Depends on what you want it for, bloodied explosive is still top if you play that style
---
AAE, VE are also ok
---
furious explosive is good with an auto fixer
---
I know they're rare, but I've failed to see the allure of them..
---
Can someone make a case for them?
---
Oh, and Make Syringers Great Again! 
---
Give us trolly syringes. I want a radaway syringer to nerf bloodied guys, an addictol syringer to mess with the junkies, various drug syringes to nerf/buff/heal enemies or teammates. 
---
At WS watching someone struggle with ghouls. Nice guy shoots Stim syringes and heals him. Troll shoots the ghouls instead.
---
In a PvP fight!  Teammate is having trouble.  Quick!  Hit him with a psycho syringe!  Enemy is Bloodied?   Quick!  Radaway syringe!
---
The 8 million number is the first goal and just gets another 25% off deal. 50% off is the last goal, which there aren't numbers for, yet.
---
What is a 'carebear'?
---
It was great until a supply crate landed inside a building in flatwoods on xbox
---
F#$k you I ain't apologising for expressing my opinion neither should I be ashamed of it! , it may be flawed but so is your arguement tbh.
---
I have never played dayZ to know the player count per server, i only said that that game also uses that mechanic as an example
---
Oh you're right I meant the bears with the symbols on their bellys wo can shoot lasers, my mistake
---
I'd be happy with the base damage being brought back but have a far better fix to the bankrupt players griefing without consequence. 
---
Current bounty higher than current caps?  Congrats. You now have a 100% PvP debuff, including damage to camps and workshops.  You are also unable to pick locks or spend caps, including fast travel.  Want to do those things again?  Start earning scumbag. Bounties could also be paid off to eliminate them. 
---
Bounties accrued through damaging camp/shop items are commensurate with repair costs. Broke a wall?  10 caps. Broke an arch?  That'll cost you 250. 
---
I'd also say allow removing junk/aid items from displays. Unlocked displays would incur no bounty (a way to give away stuff) but locked cases would result in an added bounty equal to the item's value.
---
No matter what:  weapons and armor NEVER drop.
---
Using the same gun/gear......
---
waiting for the lag to be fixed is like waiting for Earth to enter another ice age.
---
Do you think it's game design or engine limitation issue?
---
Everyone will have different SPECIAL, perks, mutations.
---
Or just allow all atomic shop under armour just skins for existing under armour.
---
In addition to using another weapon first to reduce the bear's health as much as possible, you can upgrade the syringer to the bleedout or radscorpion venom barrel, which deal more damage. Some good places for hunting include Philippi Battlefield Cemetery (where Grafton's mayor wants you to bury soldiers), you can easily snipe there from a balcony, or the rooftop of the shack at Site Alpha.
---
Did you get loot from the queen?
---
Why does his race matter..
---
Lol fuck up
---
No i did get a armor piece for completing the event though and a few goodies from some of the minions i killed
---
I want this so badly and I wish I had been able to play earlier! Yesterday I had such an awesome rare moment like this though. I was in the wendigo cave looking for the key fragment (but also wearing a clown suit bc, well, kill a wendigo while wearing a clown suit) and after getting killed and respawning a couple of times I got disconnected from the server. As I spawned one last time, right before fast traveling somewhere less frustrating, 2 people in clown costumes near my level appeared by the cave entrance. I looked at them and drew my weapn, and we went and did it together and it was so much fun! I wish this is how the game was all the time. Usually it's just me trying to get a shot in at an event to get some xp while level 200+ players kill everything super easily.
---
What system are you on and what level are you?
---
Unless there is a major nerf to unyielding armor, these skill checks are going to be largely meaningless to many people. Other than that, you can use chems (grape mentats), alcohol, and apparel (casual underarmor gives up to +3 charisma, and you can get more with legendary armor pieces if you are lucky) to temporarily buff charisma or whatever other attribute that is needed.
---
That is, of course, unless the checks are all limited to the base value of the attribute so they cannot be passed too easily (especially with unyielding armor).
---
I’m about to start playing the game soon. I’m totally green. Any tips?
---
I’ll be happy if it means FO3 works properly on Windows 10 without all the messing about with GFWL. I’ll also roll my eyes when it becomes apparent that all the bugs in these games will also be carried over.
---
Ohh no. A week. Whatever will you do. I mean it’s not like they have other people to deal with right. It depends if the workload at the time, and depending what your ticket is about it goes to a separate department. So please, stop with the “OMG I DIDNT GET A REPLY INSTANTLY SO BETHESDA ARENT SUPPORTING THEIR GAME ANYMORE”
---
Oh wow, thanks.
---
I'm not talking about an instant reply. 1-3 days is fine. A week is not.
---
You don’t have to be strong at all. You literally jump on top the roof, shoot a few cars and the resulting chain reaction of explosions tend to kill a whole bunch of enemies. Don’t try and flex when there is nothing to flex about. Sentry bots having fusion cores is nothing new.
---
Crown Store?
---
Do you not realise the scale of the 76 player base and how many claims they have to go through. A week or two is perfectly

Understandable depending on what the issue itself is, what departments are involved, how much of a priority it is etc. Saying “they have not responded yet” is not equivalent to “Bethesda aren’t supporting their game”. It’s like a child saying “you don’t love me!” When their parents won’t buy them a toy
---
I would wait. You can always move them later once we know more.  And no need to rush through new main quests when they come out IMO.
---
What is crown store item?
---
I'm not sure what that means. The category was updated after I submitted the ticket.
---
Truth is, the game was rigged from the start.
---
Never played runescape then huh? Back around 2008 it would take people almost a month to get accounts back that were hacked.. if they ever got them back at all.. 
---
I think you can wait a week.
---
Or mayby just other people’s random pictures😬
---
I missed that thank u will check it out.
---
It’s pretty cool how people help each other out for the most part. So long as you don’t get one shot people are usually happy to help try and revive someone. I do wish it wouldn’t eject you out of power armour when trying to revive though. A few times I’ve been ejected to stim someone and I’ve just prayed  that all the spawns will leave me alone for a few seconds while I do it.
---
[A few months ago I measured](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cnn07a/loot_drop_chances_roundup_august_8/) this to be 37% with an overall 20% chance for 3\*. I've since stopped tracking because how each patch seem to bug the loot table or mess around the drop chances. 
---
That being said, I farmed on my usual path (i.e., super mutant places such as West Tek) and found 10 legendaries, half of them 3\* in about 5 hours, each of them dropped a 1\* item only. I think that particular server either bugged out or Beth "tweaked" numbers for the now-confirmed bugged "Mystery pick" week.
---
I'm under the impression Beth will eventually nerf world drops so you are bound to a daily 150 scrip and rolls with the Purveyor only.
---
First of all: 2008 is not 2019! If you purchased something on Amazon and there is no update on the shipping you would not wait for a week either. Just an example. I'm not bitching about the week in general but what really sucks is that if you have a payment issue you'll get a reply almost immediately because money money money!
---
Huh that's weird. Looking at the support page it should say "I need help with the atomic shop". Sorry I don't know what to suggest other than resubmitting and mentioning the original ticket number.
---
It's called Atomic Shop here but it's the same thing :p
---
K
---
How is crafting enhanced? There are weapons with basically the same mods but are more trouble to acquire, the ultracite laser pistol/rifle use the same as the normal laser but you can't just scrap them to learn for the ultracite version.
---
The portable camp is just a lite version of the building system in fo4 with less assets  and bigger size restrictions, the only good thing is we can build almost anywhere.
---
The scorch are pretty much reskinned draugr and SB's reskinned dragons.
---
The food mechanic is basically an advanced version of survival in fo4 and skyrim
---
Am I so wrong that a reply to a ticket should not take more than a few days? I'm not used to that. Might need to consider changing my attitude...
---
That's not correct. 3 star weapons and armour can only drop from 3 star enemies
---
Buddy..I salute you. I raised a post about low levels doing nothing at sbq fights but get in the way..dude you show the way..nice shooting tex
---
Great point. It's strange there aren't any games similar to this when as far as I can tell there isn't anything to suggest people wouldn't be interested them. I figured yeah competitive PvP oriented people are more likely to obsess and spend money, but take it to the other extreme and people have also been playing Sims and Second Life like it's their full time job yet nobody else wants to even dabble in the elements that made those games successful.
---
I flew from Whitesprings to 76! That was fun! Even took potshots to the super Mutants below!
---
Still am!
---
I just was doing what i do best in games and that is having fun i felt bad though one of the level 100 somethings tried to add me to their team but i didnt respond to the invitation in time it was just too heated i was trying to be bait for the scorched minions so the heavy hitters could do what they came to do
---
Back then we had tegrity. Tegrity farms remembers.
---
There are no criminals because everybody died or escaped after the scorchbeasts had taken over. The only people still alife are a bunch of vault dwellers that lived together for 25 years and know each other. Sure there would be some tensions here and there between the dwellers but I think they would mostly work together when realizing how dangerous nature has become.
---
I used shotgun all the time but got bored for crafting  ammo for it all the time. Now it's my secondary and plasma gatling is my main
---
😂😂😂😂 oversimplification makes it easy to conspiracy theory.
---
Yeah i agree, yeah i have seen it, crazy, i am at 50% atm
---
No. If you've got actual proof of someone cheating, send it in to Bethesda Support. They WILL take care of it.
---
Taggerdy's team was looking for the source of the Scorchbeasts and apparently found it in the Glassed Cavern, right below Fissure Site Prime, so the area should be the prime target (pun intended) if someone were to get their hands on a nuclear missile.
---
The Overseer talks about sealing the Fissure Sites using the nukes, but she doesn't mention "waking up" the Queen. I think she didn't know there was a queen to begin with, she thought preventing the beasts from reaching the surface would be enough. Which means you'd need to nuke all the Fissure Sites until you trigger the Queen battle by accident.
---
And if I'm not mistaken, the Enclave members wrote about experinenting on mutated bats in Glassed Cavern, turning them into Scorchbeasts.
---
Ahh! I was wondering where those came from. Thought I was losing my mind.
---
I played during the beta. Hands down way to many bugs for me to handle. At the time, was not a game worth playing. Now that I have returned to the game and mastered it, I feel it's lacking content. Really annoyed personally that I have the daily missions shoved down my neck every time i log into a server... Anyone else feel the same?
---
We can agree to disagree, they’re also mutation, Diseases, And a whole host of other things. It builds upon a strong foundation, that’s not a flaw.
---
The last time I died, I didn’t get a quest to find my bag either.  But there was a bag near where I died.
---
... I envy people who didn't play it back then. At least they didn't witness the shit-show first-hand.
---
I experience this problem as well and this is a great idea to solve this problem. As long as you collect water from a source every now and then to top up the tank, you have a steady supply of water.
---
I’ve done 20
---
Is it for the camo paint? Because if it is it’s a well known issue and they don’t have a fix for it for months. They know of it
---
Yea it would but I don’t have any pictures since a bug deleted all my photos I took.
---
Wounding is not a legendary effect in f76.some melee have bleed mods but that's it. Raid PA has poison damage not bleed.
---
Those datamined effect may or may not come.they're in the file because the game is based on fallout 4. I also would like to have the kneecapper effect back in the game.
---
I just don't want to deal with alts and middlemen for those trades. I'd price the really rare stuff higher if the cap limit was higher.
---
Ahhhhhhh this pic is is very interesting.    
---
Oh, and that kind of problem is probably very low priority in their system.   I hope you get a response by December.
---
A rain water collector would be nice
---
True, I have a pretty good picture of a nuke going off I'd like to hang.
---
I’ve lost several legendary items this way. 
---
In the future, have the recipient immediately leave the server through the pause menu. This forces the game to save all items in your inventory right then and there.
---
Sigh.  Not this shit again.
---
I like the events. Keep em coming!
---
Even something like the mrmrghth discount gives me a little nudge to go farm legendaries.
---
Thank you very much. Can't wait to try it out now.
---
I've heard they've changed their communication practices and now only accept concerns and comments by holo tape.
---
Time to move on from this game for a while.  Come back when they have a real bank system.
---
Well I said failed 'cause the game didn't went as they planed, but it's cool anyway.
---
Ahh yes when the game was even more buggy and broken than now, good times.
---
Hey, 130 hours in to Fallout 76 now, haven't seen a single instance of blatant cheating.  
---
Not sure what you're on about, but you've got a bad idea and should feel bad.
---
What system are you on
---
There are some items which are almost impossible to buy with caps on the marketplace (trades only) so people complaining about needing to pay 5000 caps for them makes me laugh. 
---
I did quite a lot of trading on the 76 marketplace when I was setting up my character (happy with my build now) and I probably spent 75,000 caps getting all the stuff I needed, in addition to trading some god-tier drops I was lucky enough to get but didn't suit my build. 
---
I have seen some rediculous prices in vendors though, like 10,000 caps for a furious faster fire rate handmade. That's not worth 10K mates. Not all legendaries are equal, some are \*much\* better and more sought after than others.
---
I've been chasing the plasma grenade plan for many months, it's all I need to finish them all off (at least until they add a new rank).
---
Are the dailies giving badges again or are they still borked?
---
Sorry man I’m on Xbox. Just keep looking someone will part with one eventually
---
Ok thanks though
---
Woah. That's some good sh\*t
---
Lol
---
Fucking right dude! But good luck getting any support here, the anti-pvp circle jerk is strong. Couldn't even be chill about us having a space in the game for it separate from their campground Utopia.
---
I'm glad the griefer thing has changed, when I first started playing a few months back someone followed me and my partner around killing us with the reduced damage as a level 97. While we were able to hop servers to avoid him it was a terrible first impression of the game.
---
Haha
---
Never
---
Hopefully one day we get cross-play :)
---
Bullshit survival mode had a decent playerbase before they killed it with the extreme nerfs. It was growing until that point.
---
PvP needs to be better integrated in the Event System. Events like Monster Mash, The Battle that Never Was, The Run for the Presidency and now that factions are coming all kinds of faction wars events need to be made public and run on their own timer.
---
I find the under armour upgrades confusing as fuck. Also: so far every chest piece I've tried with it has clipped through somewhere. This is shit I paid for with real money! On that topic, I still haven't heard back about my combat armour camo skin being unavailable.
---
I watched this and realize my base looks pretty much like shite. A very strong build and a we’ll spread budget to get all that in under the cap.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Just remember. You can collect legendaries all day!! Spend that scrip! I got not one but two (2 shot 3 stars last night. After this sale. Start collecting and saving again!! Think about it... you're hoarding fake currency..... for what exactly?
---
Less impactful if the images only rendered client side. The server would not have to upload any content that way.
---
Have the picture frame object render one stored photo from the client machine and show it to the user. Everyone else sees a picture of Mr Pebbles or some other default image.
---
Savvy users could still have their in-CAMP porn while the rest of the world sees whatever the server friendly default is. No impact on BGS for allowing questionable content on their servers as it's only on the user's machine, and the user inherits the risk.
---
I don’t feel bad at all because I remember the queues in front of terminals, the constant “someone has just been here and killed all enemies” feeling and the countless times I had to server hop for the “Kill Evan” quest. I understand what you are trying to say but there were many issues with the game back then. Not that now is so much better but at least we can complete the main quest line and don’t have to deal with the annoying VATS bug.
---
the new public events should have server-wide benefits (ala canned meat 4 every1!)
---
my first camp....ah memories
---
You're wrong about survival mode. Lots of us were there because we didn't want to fight you guys at all. I hate adventure mode PVP, I thought separate modes would keep everyone happy. At least you'd get a break from those guys when they came over and pulled that shit here.
---
Just tagging the Queen isn't enough alas, you need to deal a suitable chunk of damage to her health bar!
---
Yes but he actually meant “survival lite” as in you would not lose player progression or lose a character after dying:
---
Todd Howard:  “It’s more “softcore” survival.” Death never means the loss of progression or your character. You’ll be in a world with dozens of other players, not thousands.”
---
So you’ve taken that point up wrong
---
Secondly Todd Howard also said: “When we think about games, we think about worlds, and the choices you can make, the stories you create and tell yourself. We have a game, more than any game that we’ve ever done, where the choices are yours, where you’ll decide what happens. You’ll decide the heroes, and you’ll decide the villains.”
---
Since the storyline is linear and we can’t actually change anything in it we can safely assume he’s talking about choosing to help or attack other players.
---
Todd Howard also said; “Fallout 76 is a mix of what you’d expect of us – there’s an open world, with our kinds of quests, and you do have a goal – but then you don’t know what’s gonna happen when you run into somebody else.” 
---
At the moment I know exactly what’s going to happen when I meet another player, he either waves or shoots me, either way I walk away without any feeling of tension as I know there’s no threat.
---
He also said:  ‘Is this what Fallout is for ever now?’ It’s clearly not. It’s definitely its own thing,” he asserts. “We had the idea, and for a while now we’ve been thinking we should try it ... we are sometimes afraid of doing it, as much as our fans are afraid of us doing it. But we’ve got to try new things.”
---
Meaning this was not supposed to be another FO3 or 4 it was meant to be something completely different however with the announcement of wastelanders we can see that this is what it’s turning into, FO4 online.
---
Look I’m not saying I don’t like adventure, and I’m not saying I don’t want wastelanders, I’m saying the idea of PvP has been diluted massively since launch to a point that it is no longer what a lot of the PvPers purchased the game for and, the complete sanitation to eventual demise of the survival mode is another example of that.
---
That's  cool. Glad to hear you ran in and had fun unlike a lot of low levels who try to hide through it all. It's a lot more fun your way.
---
Last night a member of my team was going through alpha to do a launch. While he was in there me and my other friend were just killing time. We bumped into a level 32 and like we always do, dropped him meds and resources. He started to chat on area so we invited him to the team. Just after inviting him he remarked about us being high level and could we help him launch a nuke. By this point my friend had just reached the point of launching. We quickly got the low level to jump over to alpha. Talked him through the biometric card bit and had him sprint through the silo. My friend then let him launch the Nuke. We all jumped over for the SBQ fight. The low level must of died in the fight 20+ times even with us all doing our best to protect him. It didn't matter though because he had an absolute blast. He couldn't loot the queen(I think he was unable to do enough damage) but he got some decent stuff from the many legendaries we all downed. I don't think he would of had anywhere near as much fun if he had hidden away until it was over.
---
Not if it takes half of my CAMP budget.
---
I hope they push it back a year and just work on stability because this game is guna be broken as fuck when wastelanders comes out
---
It was so lonely and boring without the map. I'm not very competitive but I liked the leaderboards, it let us see what everyone was up to. And killstreak breaking was super fun.
---
lol back in my day, the storage was 400, and you were over encumbered constantly with phantom grenades andwelikedit,damnit!  No, wait.  we hated it.  give moar stash space plz
---
 If you haven't found one by the time I get on later I can set you up with one
---
There's a good reason why that rule exists in the first place. How would you even be able to tell if someone wasn't accusing someone else of cheating purely out of spite, or to troll, or just because they could?
---
Bad idea is bad. If you legitimately can't grasp why it's a bad idea, the internet is not a place for you.
---
Sweet! What sort of time so I know to be on I’m gmt
---
We're not supporting bad business practices, starfield and TES6 will be single player rpg's, without microtransactions but dlc's and unfortunately maybe the creation club, but apart from that, fallout 76 isn't even developed by the main Bethesda studio, fo76 is an experiment to implement a game on the franchise with multiplayer online for people to enjoy.
---
I was already 45 I think at the end of the beta with a collections of all pa s we knew at this point
---
Thats awesome i do hope to eventually do a run through alpha i been going to every location i can to get em all unlocked for fast travel and yea i didnt get anything from the queen i was doing 2 damage a round when she was on the ground 1 when she was in the air but between baiting the mobs that spawned best i could and getting jumped on by what i can only describe as giant ticks id go behind the lines and chill at the bunker because the creatures spawned behind the heavy hitters so i tried to distract those and when they stopped spawning behind id run back to the line and pull off as many as i could so the guys with the big guns could aim at the queen
---
Because reporting to Bethesda without a community pressure ever solved anything...Let’s face it, they have too much on their hands to be able to deal with all the cheaters/dupers/exploits.
---
I had 1 star enemy drop a 2 star weapon.
---
Why are you using words like 'equal grounds' when that's not equal grounds, not even in your favour either. That's like saying 'Are we gonna race on equal grounds by me breaking both my legs before the race starts?'
---
My earliest memory was hitting level 5 whilst the level up arrows were still on the screen, some tool  deliberately ran between me and a ghoul to initiate pvp...
---
don't rush it.  ur on vacation in this wasteland, soak in the atmosphere and take lots of pics!
---
What platform u on bro? I’ll show u what breaking some legs is. Tryin start shit, I’ll clap yo cheeks
---
In any of the challenges any weapon can be used to bring down it's energy but the killshot has to come from that specific weapon #powerofyoutube
---
I remember the first time I did that challenge, I looked at all of the syringer mods to try and figure out how I was going to accomplish it. Figured that the radscorpion one was the way to go. Then after spending a few hours trying to actually find some radscorpions (with 0 success, those bastards are rare), decided to just punch it with power armor fists until it was low enough for the basic ammo to kill it.
---
Well... I ran out of ammo before it died, and found out that just using weapon bash with the syringer counted...
---
And now, here I am, learning from this thread that killing things with grenades while having the weapon equipped does the job much easier. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
How did you pay for it with real money? I thought it costs atoms?
---
That camo skin is a known bug and they said will be fixed.
---
Cause trust me mate if your on Xbox these broken legs are gonna walk all over u
---
You don’t need excavator. You can get lead from a lot of things, Rat poison and weights are the best source. Also most of the prewar toys have lead.
---
I've been doing this for the ballistic fiber, but it's not respawning and I'm only getting my a$s whipped. I won't be back anytime soon
---
Now is there a place to get all that steal? I know steal is everywhere but I run out of this way faster than lead or gunpowder.
---
I still see people helping out and being generally nice. Just yesterday I hopped over to Census Violence and one guy was doing it already. I would hit things then let him get in a hit. I was knocked down by Mirelurk Kings, he came over and popped a stimpak. Even though he didnt have too. I don't come across negative people that often.
---
They seem back to back for me? They also said next patch will double speed.
---
Yes
---
FO76's approach to Agility has been more of a play-style modifier vs. a weapon based modifier. If you're a Power Armor user, you may not require what's in the Agility line as much as a non-PA user.
---
Stealth, damage multipliers (Ninja, Adrenaline) and damage avoidance (Dodgy, Evasive) are all on the Agility line and I make heavy use of them.
---
My melee toon has 15 in both Strength and Agility and it has worked out very well thus far.
---
Saw your on ps4 shame I would’ve loved to f waffle stopped u with my “broken legs”
---
You would rather have a mandatory fee then an optional one (atomic shop)? Wtf
---
Wow. As this thread goes on you reveal yourself to be a bigger and bigger asshole. 
---
If you don't believe bullying is a real thing, much less a really real problem, than you arn't half as smart as you keep lifting yourself up to be. 
---
Or your the bully asshole that you seem to want everyone to conform to and join in your asshole behavior. 
---
Because that's what assholes do. If they can normalize their behavior and make everyone just as bad as them then they don't have to feel so bad for being said asshole bully.
---
What's your time zone?
---
He's just being willfully stupid to try to get people to agree with him and make him feel better about being an asshole
---
Honestly, a great idea. That will be next build! I’ll post a walkthrough!
---
Yep I agree
---
Yeah, that was a big alarm bell for me early on. A bug creates a cool little feature and, rather than rolling with it, the devs say ‘nah, let’s fix it anyway.’
---
I bought the Atom Caps with real money.
---
Thanks, but they should have replied to my ticket to tell me.
---
Eastern standard
---
So it's 8:20 am for you, at what time are you free?
---
As nice as it would be, it would mean that you would need to download said images onto your machine through the server directly with the other player.
---
This could either be risky or cause stability issues that's the letdown of all of this ,_,
---
This explains some situations, cause I like nuka grenade everything
---
So you paid real money to get atoms faster. You didn’t buy the outfit with money.
---
You reply bored me🤷‍♂️ so what.. 😂😂
---
I found the mod at an unmarked campsite near grafton dam and grafton steel
---
My experience has been that i won’t get loot or credit if I don’t do at least a few percent of health worth of damage to the SBQ.
---
The only reason given was to focus on wastelanders and that they will use our feedback to improve PVP in the core game. Kind of vague, no mention of bringing it back or any sort of open PvP mode after wastelanders settles in. One can only hope. So bummed!
---
A friend of mine has scraped around 1k of them. Has one left, ridiculous grind to get them all.
---
I've never had it happen before though, except for the times when the legendaries didn't drop any legendaries at all durning that bug.
---
Very nice camp! Maybe time for me to rebuild mine again, have been running a train station for a while now, but times change.
---
Is that apart of the new update or something? Because I was actively fighting the the SBQ and tagging it consistently until it died, and nothing?
---
Not to mention the fight literally lasted under a minute
---
I feel bad for anyone who did play during the launch. Game barely works now.
---
Is that really true? I've never had it happen before today, and I've been playing every day for the last 3 months..
---
Right now
---
Do you have discord?
---
Very rarely. I hate the public event changes.
---
Exactly.
---
No this seems to be my issue lately. I'm only 61 so when I'm trying to tag things amongst powerhouses I often don't even get credit. But yes I think SBQ is buggy. A few others complained about non credit completions last night. No corpse loot or anything.
---
Speak for yourself. You don't know what kind of game "we all" want.
---
I say this because it was no where near as active like the first one and also the plan drops were low and the same plans. So many people grinded out killing scorch beats too. I was in so many failed events due to lack of participation.
---
You sir are an idiot
---
Man honestly that kind of fucks with the whole flow of events. If I’m not even going to get credit for fighting the SBQ because there are level 500+ players partaking in the same event and tend to have great dmg output, then what is honestly the point of me doing it? This new system has effectively locked me out a little portion of the game.
---
Add me I'm always down for fun. Deaths are easy. Fun is not. GT Texas M1ke
---
bffr is better than be
---
You don't get downvoted due to PVP, you get downvoted due to douchebagginess.
---
There's no problem on hating something but why all the community, what did I do to you?
---
I can only assume you weren’t here from the beginning, as it’s amusing to hear someone accuse the player base of outrageous entitlement. This reddit was, by and large, unfailingly patient in giving the developers time to get up to speed. It’s only in the last three or four months, when it became clear that some issues will probably never be addressed (and we got some old ones back, just for fun), that the tide began to turn. So of course people have become curt and impatient, because being polite and patient wasn’t producing results. 
---
As for telling Bethesda what to do, you just summarised the fan base of near every multiplayer game in existence. Sure, some people are constructive, others are rude, but  they all provide a valuable compass as to where attention is most needed. I don’t doubt it’s a demoralising job sorting through them to spot the trends, but that’s how any multiplayer game survives, and reddit’s upvote system makes it considerably easier to see what’s really wanted (though, of course, that’s not always what’s possible.)

I was there for the beta abd about 2 weeks after launch. I left abd didnt come back until the wild appalicha content started to drop.
---
It was only a rumor based on data mined information that such effect would come with the vault raids. As it has been in the files since the beta, it could be just content. Right now, game balance is bad enough without people having bloodied explosive wounding LMGs, or anything like that.
---
Id love to see some stuff like that. But I'd really like to see some kind of sandbox open PvP return to this game.

I have a solution Legendary Syringers!

Welcome to the wasteland. Raiders for life.

Buy my TSE TommyGun first
---
You have a few new areas and events to do.

Scorched mole miner does not account either :-\\
---
Upvoted for the Leeroy Jenkins reference!
---
I joined my first one when I was at about level 40ish. I know that's not low low, but I knew I wasn't gonna be doing much. So I made sure I just killed all the ads and kept the high level players from being bothered by them.
---
Raiders!! Raiders!! Raiders!!
---
Bethesda didn't want to put the time, so we did. We are THE best game mechanic and you are welcome. Oh and we probably did it just to get those 50caps and your junk... Pretty much all you are worth to us really. &lt;3
---
Edit: Forgot to mention, much like you the sense of community and we like the sense of destroying it. 
---
It's a roleplaying game, you might want to reconsider your saltiness after all we are only having fun. Hope you understand, if not, I'm sure Bethesda has enough single player games (eg. Fallot 4).
---
Sometimes it's just kill a deathclaw and you get 20 atoms. It's also easy to get the daily level up challenge. You just have to meet three separate conditions at the same time.
---
But anytime I have to craft or drink a certain amount of alcohol, I ignore it.
---
I think a water tower would be a cool camp item to add to the game. Now if it’s functional I will pay for that.
---
Bethesda is going to fix this for future updates. I’d recommend turning on your damage numbers. My rule of thumb would be to try to hit for a cumulative 1000 damage. 
---
Also you might need to switch the build up for queen fights. People are optimizing their builds for queens and she is dying fast.
---
Welcome to Flavortown.
---
Hey, yeah that's normal, just be patient. Because it took me around 200-250 radium rifles to finally unlock my last mod for that gun. I almost wanted to give up because I was tired farming screws, springs.

Just a tip, use super duper rank 3 and science expert rank 2. And if you're a magazine collector, there's a magazine that reduce the amount of materials to craft weapons even more.
---
You're confused or it was a glitch. I'm pushing 1500 hours into this game and never gotten a drop that was higher starred than the enemy it came from
---
Wtf, roleplayers?  Okay, I'm ready for private servers now.
---
Thanks for that bro. I’ve already put on damage numbers ever since it was implemented into the game, but I’ll optimise and keep a look out to dish out a cumulative 1000 dmg until they fix this in the future.
---
Some people server hop just to contest workshops. Most the time they'll hang out just long enough to see if the victim will try to take it back then jump servers again if the victim doesn't.
---
Does not feel more impactful at all. PvP is basically non-existent unless it’s organized. 
---
Survival was impactful because you would actually get some gain out of winning a PvP battle. Now all PvP among worth foes is just expensive with nothing to show for it
---
Man. I like my camp but it’s never this cool 😂 Building is frustrating
---
I mean... if you want a private server... you might as well play one of the single players games...
---
I needed this information last week!!! I got to try this with my alt. ! It's been the only thing stopping me from getting them backpacks.
---
That sounds so unfun, I don't understand.
---
Thanks for sharing your insight. I think a lot of us are already doing this but that doesn’t mean saying it out loud for others who do not is not valuable. We should be encouraging knowledge sharing.
---
Anything that workshops offer are already rewards from events, full fusion cores from battlebot.
---
Highly doubt that anyone showing up to contest a workshop gives a shit about what the workshop crafts there.
---
I'm not home now but by monday I can have some pics for you
---

---
It took me a while to figure out the scorchbeast queen fight, but if you equip the right perks, it's pretty easy. I just use the tormenter perk every time I go into the scorched earth event and she lands very quickly.
---
Bring survival back
---
Agility still has very useful perks for melee, and although you cannot get any extra damage from it, they boost you massively. It would be fun yes, but it would be overpowered. That's coming from a melee player
---
every so often i think about what it would be like to have an organised event where everyone starts a brand new character and all start in the same world, from scratch.
---
there could even be a roleplay aspect where everyone has to give their character a human name like "michael" or "carol" instead of "xdxd42069" (this is a legitimate name i saw someone have once). depending on how committed people were, it could even be made a rule that they have to have a custom character instead of one of the provided defaults.
---
idk why i just think this would be really cool. let me know what other people think.
---
Free yourself from that, not healthy.
---
My group of friends and I still try and help out players just starting out. One of us collects level 1 hazmat suits whenever they find them and will give them away. I have crafted and modified as many pipe pistols and 10mm’s as I can. And another has a whole farm set up to have food and water for anyone passing by. We’ve also escorted numerous players through some of the more dangerous areas and stayed as back up when they needed it. Actually one of the players in our group was a level 3 when we met him. Now he’s level 54 and he’s began working on crafting armor for lower players just outside of Flatwoods. 
---
It’s the little things that can make all the difference, just remember that there’s another person on the other side of that wasteland survivor.
---
But we do also dick around PVPing each other and leading each other into death traps just to keep things real
---
So, to make this simple, this is a reddit rule that all subreddits must have (perhaps not specified, but it applies in all subreddit, we are just obviously clear about it), feel free to google it. What would happen if we pretended it did not apply to this subreddit? We would be shut down. That is all. So, we can keep the rule, and our subreddit, or we can lose the subreddit. What we cannot do is remove the rule and think it will benefit us in any way.
---
Simply put.
---
Sneak and ninja can definitely increase melee damage significantly.  I’m told it even works on the SBQ, but I haven’t tested it myself.
---
I once did that with my second toon (level 20ish at the time) which is modeled after Melvin Van Zan from the movie Reign of Fire and armed only with a firefighter's axe. I kept jumping and striking the queen, probably don't doing any real damage, surrounded by high level PA destroyers and I begun to hear laughing and cheering in the zone chat (it seems some of them were older enough to catch the movie reference) until the queen is in her last and they stopped attacking her and leave the killing to me and my axe, with the entire platoon cheering as if they were NASA controllers in a Hollywood movie when the queen finally ate the dust. Then, they covered me in ultracite plans. One of the best moments I enjoyed in Appalachia.  
---
edit: spelling.
---
I disagree.  I love this game, but I only want PvE. There's Nuclear Winter for people that want to kill each other, and hopefully they'll bring something good to replace survival mode for you people.
---
God has abandoned us now
---
It does, provided you can sneak up to her. Bloody, sneak melee is still extremely good against pve, just need to be careful to not get spotted
---
This, I can cripple entire mobs and it’s very funny!
---
Yeah, I didn't really think about it that way.  I like to casually farm while I'm watching shows on another monitor sometimes, so I guess I figured they were killing me for the sake of similar convenience lol
---
The part where you go up stairs and are in a greenhouse...I don’t get that. How??
---
Definitely not, or it was a bug that is insanely rare. I’ve never heard of this happening to anyone.
---
Wow, thank you for that info!
---
Honestly, considering the problems I dealt with during the beta, there's nothing I really miss. All I remember is P A I N
---
The bleed out mod is easy to unlock by scraping, it does 30 damage over 10 seconds which is much better than the base damage or even bash damage. I would still like better options though.
---
You might not have, but some people do. Some people have carry weight builds and forget all the junk they are holding. There has been more than once where i've picked up 1400 steal and 800 lead off of people. We take a gamble, sometimes it pays off sometimes it doesn't. We can initiate fight without people's consent, all you have to do is initiate workshop capture.
---
anyone have a sound clip of this? i want it for my morning alarm ty
---
I hope that Bethesda makes a new mode for people that want to PVP, but I don't think that not having survival mode justifies what basically sounds like trolling for the sake of trolling.  I'm failing to understand the perspective of an adventure mode pvp'er.  Is it actually fun killing somebody that isn't even really paying attention, doesn't want to defend themselves, and probably isn't going to gain you more than 50 caps?
---
I'd still prefer a "co-optional" sorta design over what we have in 76 but my opinion on the game itself changed from being unsure about it all before launch, to being pretty okay with it now.
---
Right answer here.
---
Not necessarily. BE has more 1-shot potential, but BFFR has better sustained damage.  If your goal is to 1-shot 99% of mobs in Adventure mode, BE is better.  So it’s situation and depends on your goal.
---
You’re right in term of pure single target DPS though.
---
I know hackers etc can be a problem on PC and this for me is one of the reasons why i tend to prefer consoles, but naming and shaming can lead to witch hunts, accusations and targeted harassment which i don't think is good for any gaming community.
---
Seriously, this has been a game feature since day one and adds a risk to the gameplay which is fully intended. If you don't like this feature, don't claim workshops or stop playing FO76 
---
 So what if you lost a workshop and some materials and caps - stop whinning like a five year old and move on...
---
If you really want to play riskfree, maybe solitaire is more your game...
---
If you're on PS4 no and you should give me your stuff. Lol JK
---
I'll be serious now. Currently the servers are.... bad they need some serious work I'm not getting DC'd but the game is very laggy.
---
Content wise. Depending on  how long ago you stopped playing there is a lot of new stuff. Brewing, Arkos, the burrows, Encryptid event.
---
TBH I'm still having fun but I like farming plans, Legendaries and player levels. The laggy servers are a PIA though. I'm hoping they fix it soon.
---
Furious Exploding has the one issue that if you hit two enemies with the explosion, it resets the furious counter.  So it’s not an optimal combo.  Furious FFR is a better combo
---
I’d argue condition overall is pretty whack. 
---
Most mods shave a solid 1/5 of condition off so even with high durability a modded piece of leather armor will break on you in like one run of west tek. 
---
Shame there’s no real discount for repairing before breaking
---
I don't pvp but i like your idea will there be a place for people to watch it. Either in game by joining the server or as a video online? 
---
Also forgive me if its in the rules on the discord but have you considered the idea of setting up fair weapons? Instead of everyone bringing their own weapons, you provide weapons and ammo for them. That way it keeps things somewhat fair and can avoid the pvp tournament becoming a one shot festival.
---
Is slap damage gone? It's been a little while since I played, last I saw everyone was using damage reflection to screw with greifers
---
Nearly anything in adventure will die to either in seconds, but i just prefer bffr cause its usually quicker and you cant blow yourself up if they get too close. BE would definitely be better if we are talking about semi auto.
---
I think Vampires or Anti Armor would be more desirable than a Junkies.  Junkies is stronger, but not many play that build.
---
&gt;can't blame PVP players for utilizing the only bit of in-game PVP left.  
---
100% this. We literally have nothing left unless we go to NW, which isn't really Fallout feeling tbh. I completely understand wanting the communal feeling of working together, but just like IRL, people are different and have different definitions of fun. I just want to murder people and take their stuff. You just want a Wasteland rebuilder SIM. Both are needed and equally important, as we end up being what makes Fallout "Fallout." Settlers and Raiders. Not everyone is here to help you. 
---
Plus, you've mentioned this is the first time this has happened to you and you've been playing since BETA. At that point isn't you feeling bad for 3 minutes cause of PVP out of your potential 1000 hours of playtime a little... Disproportionate to be salty over?
---
NW needs 50 people per match and queue times were getting really long so first they merged all the regional servers into one global server. it meant the game was laggier but you would get a match faster. then a month later they announced the end of survival mode and in the same announcement talked about the improvements to NW.. they clearly want more people in NW to keep the matches going. But myself and many others just want a better survival mode for endgame pvp, not a "survival" server where fast travel is annoying and theres a 20% exp bonus for everyone at all times so some people show up only for exp and demand to be left alone so they can grind. survival was doomed from the start with the exp bonus.
---
Holy shit that's a great idea
---
That's actually a great idea!
---
Not I. I bought it months ago and can not wait to dive in.
---
&gt;I'm curious that whilst there are two types of melee weapon blunt and edge, the path to using them is singular in strength. Other games offer strength and dexterity scaling depending on the weapon. Is there a reason why Fallout doesn't take this approach
---
Yes, it's not those other games. 
---
r/notlikeothergames
---
I tend to leave bags because I'm always like a pound away from being overencumbered, but I still check out the bags. I'm am SHOCKED at some of the amounts of lead and steel in those bags. Yes hundreds, somethimes thousand and then some. I mean I guess they probably have full stashes or something but why not carry excess stuff that is less risky like ammo or armor? I got killed all the time in survival mode, no way in hell I'd carry all of my junk and aid on me.
---
lol right? it would be hella annoying but also hella hilarious.
---
I got my first Two Shot weapon that way. Lvl 50 TS 50%LD Gatling Gun that i picked up in my low teens just waiting to be able to use it. 263 caps at a vendor. What a glorious time to be alive.
---
This gets asked more than the Grafton mayor asks people to bury a soldier.
---
I'd definitely wake up to turn it off and then spend my day being irrationally angry so it's pretty much perfect
---
Your question is what's the point of having something if you don't have to defend it?  I'm saying I dislike the whole system of having to defend the workshops, not that I'm salty specifically about losing the only one worth taking (I agree that that is the case though).  I think we just disagree at a base level about PvP in the game and the necessity for conflict.  I don't think it's fun to have to defend my shop from other players.  I want to have to actively seek out PvP, and I want the rewards for PvP to be really worth it, not some bullshit where I just get picked off if I'm zoned out.
---
Yeah, I usually carry both types on me depending on the situation.  If I’m playing my heavy build I have to be super careful (even with fireproof) to avoid killing myself in milliseconds.  I died yesterday at a SBQ just because another player ran in front of me.  
---
And yes I play Rifleman not Commando. 
---
PS: don’t run in front of people using high fire rate exploding weapons. 🤬
---
This is why I like to go back to Flatwoods when I see some lower levels there.
---
Can anyone hear me? Hello? AS I was saying...
---
Thats why I hold on to all low level items and if I see a newb I call em over and deck them out. Hell I even went out of my way once to go get an extra power armor chassis to put my raider armor on and give to them. I do this all because of the guy who came into my little lvl 5 hobo camp and asked if I wanted better armor.
---
7 or 8. If you manage to spin up and shoot only one "ammo", it's visible. Not that it matters, anyway.
---
Not sure why I'm being downvoted. It is a genuine question. I thought this game was supposed to be better now since launch? But now I'm seeing topics such as this which aren't exactly encouraging to myself who is interested in finally giving it a go.
---
I’m using a legacy, and it’s super hard to tell because of all the hits/explosions.  There are just damage numbers everywhere.
---
God I read that in his voice. It's like Preston Garvey all over again.
---
That's not how it works. The Atom Caps don't build up over time, they require doing chores. I bought them, therefore I paid real money for the things they bought. I paid additional money towards the company that makes the game on top of the cost of the game and the year of Xbox Gold, which they don't get.
---
I feel like there’s too many cry babies on this game. With that being said DONT TAKE WORKSHOPS IF YOU DONT WANT PVP. Once you do it tells you it’s FAIR game. This game is online there will be PVP regardless
---
Ty didn't know that, cheers for the heads up
---
I keep a store near one of the train stations, but I constantly unload low level stuff in the suitcases "across the tracks" for people that might need it. I will make a set of armor and drop basic plans and food for newbs I help out on a quest.
---
I started a new character on Xbox just last night (usually play ps4) and someone came to my new camp when I was l3 and dropped a ton of things. It was really nice.
---
Time limits is not good endgame content. Sorry but its true.
---
You're right, I am just gonna not claim the workshops anymore, and it is fully intended gameplay, but I am of the opinion that it's not fun, and I think that nearly everyone would agree with me that this is not the ideal state of PvP.  Yeah, it's not that big a deal and I knew it could happen, but it still sucks.  I shouldn't be pushed to quit the game because I complain about a feature lol
---
I’ve got a gunslinger as well ... and other characters .. and will tell you it is a crap shoot on many weapons what ends up being the best receiver / magazine. You might think it is the prime or the hardened or the whatever. You might think priming your combat rifle wouldn’t switch the ammo to .44.
---
You think wrong ;-)
---
There’s lots of cleanup that needs to happen with weapons.
---
Honestly, if you think about them not in terms of real-life and instead in terms of opportunity cost of perks, weight, ammo availability, DPS, D/shot, etc. so many are out of whack it’s silly. 
---
Anyway, the Refined receiver is ALSO better damage. Go figure. The hardened is clearly too low, and the prime should also be boosted.
---
I’m not holding my breath.
---
Hahaha it works cause I went and did the fucking daily so I didn't have to hear his shit while trying to farm responder bot.
---
FE is still strong, but it’s something people should know. 👍
---
Eh. Probably not. Not much content going on. I came back for the double XP/NW content, but haven't played much since.
---
Wait for Wastelanders.
---
Well that's just silly. You're supposed to DRINK it, not snort it. You can drown that way, friend!
---
If that's really how it works, then a 2 star should drop a 1-2 star also. I think that that's really stupid. Out of all the queen fights and everything I've done against 3 star legendaries, a 1 star item is a slap in the face to me
---
"I fart in your general direction!"
---
I agree.  I hope that they will come up with something completely optional but open world and satisfactory for PVP players
---
Nonsense. 350-420 atoms a week worthless. Just say you're lazy and don't want to do them.
---
Settlers vs. raiders would be perfect, if they had zones or battlegrounds like WoW or something, that sounds fun
---
How many beams could beam splitter split if a beam splitter could split beams?
---
Ahhh the disconnects... wait..
---
I shouldn't have laughed this hard at "cowtillery". Have an upvote for this magnificence!
---
This is how it starts...
---
Probably to be fixed in the patch after 14. That is, assuming it is not too difficult to change for some technical reason.
---
The Preston Garvey of FO76, for sure.
---
Yea same here lol. I am a little hopeful that they well show a little love to pistols with wastlanders, it was mentioned a rebalancing of weapons is to come so who knows. It could be good or it could be a disaster lol.
---
I had a routine with herbivore mutation, silva homestead to farm corn and razorgrain. I found out that you only need to be at a workstation property to get pvp'd by other players. I am strictly carnivore now and avoid all workstations property, even farming Grafton steel.
---
Now we have all of the toxic incels running around because Beth stupidly decided to make a new call of duty game mode that defeated the entire fucking point of their original game, and they still have nasty, game breaking bugs they never fixed.
---
I actually try to help new players when they exit out of the vault.  It's pretty fun for me and for them.  Might as well bring a portion of the old days to them.
---
Bulk ammo scraps.
---
Who knows? Maybe she's always wantee to fly, and she's jealous!
---
GOOD POINT
---
Do you use 10mm as well?
---
Now instead of flatwoods its blackwater mine
---
You're a hero in the wastes! This is the excellent content we're all looking for!
---
On occasion. I have a mutants ,aim damage vats fill that's ok, nothing special. I use it in weaker enemies to save 44 ammo. The western Trump's it though.  I'd like to get a Vampire explosive 10mm for a healing weapon, aswell as being more entertaining than the mutants I have.
---
I'm one of those guys who will break into your camp if you do a poor job of locking shit down (workshops by windows, using that one particular brick wall window you can jump right into) And then I'll turn off your vending machine if you have it on a switch.
---
Thank you for the info. Hows NW? Never tried it.
---
There was no time. As soon as they took the last item it said server not responding and crashed.
---
Good job! Congrats! Keep it up! I'm level 112 myself on Xbox. Hitting that 100 mark is a milestone that gives you that feeling of accomplishment
---
Damn. I’m on XB but really wish I was on ps4 for this.
---
I just think the PvP shouldn't suck, and I didn't realize anyone was actually fighting over the shops so taking one didn't really feel like opting in to PvP before, even with the warning.  I will admit that I'm largely salty because I got clapped so hard when I didn't even know they could kill me before I shot back.
---
Look at the soundmixer if OBS is turned on if the obs64.exe is silenced, it does it sometimes
---
The Fallout 76 experience is very different on Reddit than it is in the game.
---
* On Reddit: "I'm getting griefed 24/7!"
---
* In game: Generally very friendly and helpful people
---
* On Reddit: "Every single aspect of this game is a buggy, unplayable mess!"
---
* In game: Yes, there are bugs, and yes, they suck, but they affect people differently, and game is definitely more stable than not.
---
* On Reddit: "LOLCASHGRABATOMSHOPGGTHIEFESDA"
---
* In game: 80%+ of the C.A.M.P.s I visit have multiple Atom Shop items on display
---
That's not to say that there aren't elements of truth to what you hear on the internet, but holy crap - people like to mire themselves in negativity out here.
---
Yeah, I would do this. In the clown costume! Try and take pictures of yourself in a hiding place, with another player around a corner, unaware... Or a non-NW use for hiding in a bush!
---
I’ll give it a check over. Thanks
---
My understanding of the syringer is to give debuffs to the target not to do the actual killing of the animal. If you ever need to do this quest again, literally shoot the beast once with syringer, it’ll buff it first then the debuff kicks in and then kill it with your primary weapon. Nice and easy :)
---
Unless you're on PC an willing to email, I suppose. Just don't forget to send the thumbnail, too, or it won't be the viewable in-game!
---
We could go one up on this idea and have it as our ring tone when people phone you
---
Every time I restart a character I forget how much I love marsupial. It is amazingly fun going back and having everything be challenging and tactical again.
---
I met one of my best friends deadmuch during the beta. We've been inseperable since spanning multiple games and just hanging out.
---
&gt; I'm only a level 30 and I did around 60% of the damage to the queen
---
Pretty much the only way this is possible is if you're running a fully specced, bloodied, unarmed/one hand melee with meat hook build. And if you know enough about the game to make that build you're probably not going to forget that the SBQ is legendary. So what I'm saying is, bullshit.
---
it’s not something i wanted, but it’s what we got, plus if you look at it a timer makes sense for meltdown but not the other two.
---
I remember the road into Flatwoods littered with supply drops (something I havent seen since and probally never will since they are "private" now)
---
Buy a recall card from a vendor (Whitesprings train station definitely sells one, others may do).
---
Take the card to the shack where the event happens in the ash heap and you can start it.
---
Find a server with lot of ppl on, when you start the event they will probably join u!
---
You can earn them... or pay money to get them sooner without earning them... that is how it works. 
---
I have 3500 caps sitting in my account that I didn’t spend actual dollars on.
---
I just started playing but had the game pre ordered. Im a halo fan girl so couldn't breakaway from the damn game until recently. But someone did drop off a power armor suit so that was cool
---
They definitely go for crops and if they are accessible, power generators and turrets first. I've pretty much stopped planting crops because I get tired of fixing them. Even if I put them in the middle of my camp the enemies go after them first.
---
Not pushing, you're the one wanting to play risk free and without intervention from others, just stating the obvoius solution to your 'problem'...
---
workshops have always been PVP
---
Best part of this: Grafton. Graftoff. The Grafter. Have an upvote for the laugh.
---
We will see that again once the game releases wastelanders and/or goes free to play. Which seems like a good survival tactic for this game. Like destiny 2.
---
It’s not being clever. People voluntarily spend money to get atoms quickly without having to earn them. They are purchasing instant gratification. You can choose not to spend money and buy the stuff with atoms. If you spend money it’s because you want things NOW vs waiting a little longer to earn them.
---
Edit: happy cake day
---
error 404
---
My biggest regret in game is not buying the greenhouses. I would love to implement these into my camp.
---
Are you joining the event before her health regenerates? If you join after that point i don’t think you get the rewards.
---
Buy yes you have to inflict “damage”. By that i mean if you weapon only does say 2 points of DMG and she “resists” it, technically you have done no DMG to her, therefore no loot.
---
Yep, slap damage is gone
---
It has gotten harder to pick a fight with someone who doesn't want to engage. Only way I've seen is if you have some kind of damage reflection that procs and sticks you into a tit-for-tat strike against each other that can open up PVP.
---
Have also seen folks in teams where one of them gets the Wanted flag on them and then they use that to become a soft target to engage the entire team in PVP once they get hit.
---
My game style is PVE, so I keep pacifist mode on, and if I somehow get ensnared into a PVP or Wanted scenario will just wait for someone to off my toon. If it takes too long I'll strip down to my underpants and do the finger guns dance until someone gets annoyed enough with me and finishes the job.
---
They're not roleplaying raiders. They *are* raider scum
---
Once you reach level 300.. the enthusiasm wanes...trust me lol
---
I know, but used to be I’d only have to fight for a workshop when somebody actually wanted it, e.g. the Ammo Plant. 
---
Now it seems people just sit and wait for *any* workshop to be claimed just to go player kill.
---
Also, the other bug in that mission was when you were putting food in, random shit in your inventory would pop up while you were spamming the button and become food as well 🙃.
---
That is how I lost a lot of pieces of my first power armor suit.
---
The least they can do is hook it up with canned stew.
---
NW is dominated by hackers injecting weapons into the game at the main lobby before the match even begins. search youtube for nuclear winter hacks and its an absolute shitshow.
---
And there aren't many of us left. My dad used to say that all the time.
---
I found this site a few days ago https://playercounter.com/fallout-76/ 
---
It shows 26.7k players currently online. I can't find (ok, I didn't actually look) to see if this is across all platforms or PC only.
---
Is this a reliable/accurate site?
---
What is it worth? I paid $60 and have over 550 hours in the game. So it’s def worth that. 
---
Game is much more stable now for me. I got disconnected a lot last fall and now don’t remember the last time. 
---
They’ve added a new battle royale game mode, some new quest lines, new weapons and armors. New alcohol crafting system, seasonal events. Big update dropping within the next two months to add dialogue trees and more main quests.
---
Hey just realize that the flux needed for a rad shower is loads less if you use the contractor 2 card. Like a lot less.
---
The start of the game was amazing with 8 - 15 people all running around the same area doing quests, people would talk in game chat asking to group up etc
---
That’s tragically beautiful! 😭
---
Next time I’m going to give him a big hug instead of the usual spray of bullets.
---
Agreed, people only notice now because survival was around but this was happening to a minor scale. Not sure why they would ignore OP, most likely so you can't see them in the map and take their junk. I can't speak for other players but I usually go to a workshop to target someone who might have a lot of junk. People lower their guard when they think they are safe, but workshops are possible the easiest way of triggering unwanted pvp.
---
I didnt forget, that part was bullshit, I was just trying to make it funny. I was there were only two of us there, me and my afk level 179 account for free fast traveling when my weapon needs to be repaired, so I know what I'm doing. Dont get me wrong it took me a good 45 minutes until anyone else even showed up, as I SPECIFICALLY asked everyone to let me do this. For the record, I have a 3 star legendary ultracite gatling laser which is bloodied,  +30% damage to scorched and -90% carry weight, so that's what my main weapon was.
---
..........wat? It doesn't?! That's kind of amateurish
---
Much more stable for me
---
“I also hoarded all the power cores so my friends couldn't use them.....”
---
As is tradition.
---
And if you got the free one I think you loose it if it wasn’t already in your camp.
---
Pretty much. Was lvling my lvl 30 alts trying to farm plans an some exp taking workshops an EVERY TIME a lvl 150+ kept showing up to fight me. Most of them are pretty trash. I trolled one back just by taunting him while standing outside the workshop zone where they cant hit me. I recommend just server hop until you find a semi empty server or one also filled with lower lvls.
---
Said if he wanted a real fight I'd come back on my main an he refused to add me. So he didnt want anything but to pick on low lvls.
---
It’s funny how everyone ALWAYS mentions encrypted but not the quests related to it which IMO are pretty great.
---
"Raiders".....They are just self entitled kids that think the internet means they can be hateful, toxic shits with no repercussions.
---
But you did actively seek out pvp, when you decided to claim. The fact you have never experienced it before just tells you it is quite rare indeed (rarer than posts in this subreddit would make you believe) as there are not that many pvpers to begin with. 
---
Though if by chance any comes to your server, ammo factory is the first place to be contested.
---
Was always worth it
---
Hey there! I think this sounds fun, but I have one question. What’s the mic policy? I never really try to group up, because usually my only chance to play is when my fiancée is asleep next to me. Would love to join the fun and help the good times roll, but for the most part I’d only be able to listen and communicate with emotes.
---
Maybe it’s never happened to you if you’re typically the aggressor, but 100% of the time someone sneaks up and one shots me in a workshop they *immediately* set me to ignored. 
---
That’s some bitch shit.
---
Maybe, I'd have to talk to one of your representatives first, because there's a few things I don't do, and am avidly against.
---
Lol, I did the quest so long ago I actually forgot there's a whole story line there
---
Nope, wait till they drop wasteland and then maybe it will be worth it. At the moment if it ain't free, it's a pass. 
---
Btw they closed survival Oct 1 so now the servers are full for gankers. If you do get it boycott workshop like the rest of us till they fix or remove pvp from them. One shot cheaters are everywhere. There's a new dupe glitch, so if you see a bunch of mines or clevers don't be surprised. 
---
Not worth it atm. Maybe after wastelands. Maybe...
---
Sneak attacks from ranged are just as broken tbh, as long as you are using a well modded handmade. I did 1000 dmg per hit with a one star Gauss rifle and adrenal reaction and only 4 points in perception.  Were I an actual rifleman build and abusing revanant perk, max adrenaline, and using calmex, you can expect easy 3k per hit in rapid succession.  That's without crits/eagle eyes/legacy weapon/etc.

The Brotherhood of Steel - Hellfire Chapter is always looking for new recruits.

It's very easy for players of a high level to make these comments, but what about some of the lower level players who youse these events to get better equipment, a better way is to make certain events high calibre with guaranteed high level opposition and maybe make certain events only available to lower level players with a decent reward all being a lesser one.
---
I'm not sure about there minimum levels but for melee. 
---
Unarmed: deathclaw gauntlet, mole miner gauntlet. 
---
1 handed: meat hook
---
2 handed: super sledge, sledge hammer, fire axe, gragnax axe
---
Would you prefer speed over damage? If you are looking for close combat, the pump shotgun or if you have unlocked it, then the combat shotgun. For melee, since strenght has cards for both shotguns and melee, i'd advise unarmed, takes little perk space and it has the death claw gauntlet or the hook, both fast attack weapons. Or you can opt for super sledges, which are the complete opposite route
---
That's no problem mate. Mic is optional. Rather text myself on the discord
---
Idk what lvl gatling plasmas spawn in but those are nice because you can just blow through your plasma cores and then drop it. I think of it as a consumable weapon. A lvl 20 fire axe with slugger perk card should do a good bit of damage. Until your lvl 50 and can get nice legendary shotguns. Melee Is probably the best bet for close combat imo. I'm a heavy guns build but I cant deny, melee is so powerful in this game. I just want to be able to use the power fist in power armor! Come on bethesda! Why did you change that?!
---
When I was your level I used a plain ole' non-legendary Serrated Machette. Super sledges also can drop at level 15. If you're on PS4 I'll craft you any weapon you want to try out
---
No I’ve been waiting for reclamation day for years so I can murder that bastard Larry, always farting in the bedroom. Kill him and eat him first chance I get
---
Exactly! And it’s actually pretty in depth.
---
This is why I don't have it on any character. I have a potion just sitting in my stash. Probably going to stay there. However, I made my character to run *really* fast; so fast my PlayStation cannot keep up in generating the world xd
---
I’ve farmed those outfits for 130-140 hours in total during February and March. I gave up because after those hours i still had no yellow, no pink, no red and no forest. I just bought them. Either you are really really lucky or i’m just really unlucky.
---
You’re talking to a bunch of goody two shoes who basically want to play Fallout: Wasteland Sims Edition. 
---
One of the more popular fallouts that reaches a wider audience and all of a sudden they want everything to be fine and dandy.  they wanna sing Kum ba yah and hold hands together. Fallouts universe is fucked up and full of horrible shit. Ie New Vegas and fo3 especially fo4 has the Nuka World Raiders and if they knew about those guys they’d see the type of playstyle we enjoy. 
---
The responders storyline is perfect for these guys because it’s the “vanilla” I’m the good guy let’s rebuild mindset they relate to.
---
FYI: All of the vendors carry the card (even Grahm).
---
I'm pretty sure you can trigger it if you're on the quest; unfortunately, I don't think it works if you just have the card (but are not on the quest).
---
Good luck OP; if I'm on your server when it happens I'll definitely come help. My best advice to you is this: bring a LOT of Stimpacks. What I usually do is become a conduit, and then jump on the shack and crouch down there, picking off robots and sniping the Sheepsquatch whenever he gets close. That way, at least one of the pylons is always activated. But it'll blow through health; especially when the group is taking it's sweet time killing the thing.
---
Get it ... on sale at Beth store at 39.00.  20.00 off .... it's a lot of fun. Don't let the haters fool you. They suck.
---
I have no sympathy.. there is a huge PVP warning when you claim a workshop..
---
I agree ..... there's so much... just enjoy it.
---
Depends on prioritization of the ticket. I would expect an auto reply at a minimum though. Anyway- to answer your quest... yes they still support it. Big update coming in a couple months.
---
See if you can find an unarmed weapon. They are the best melee option because they have high base damage and only need one damage perk card. You could go through the entire game including the queen with only ever using a unarmed weapon. You probably can get a mole miner gauntlet off a mole miner in Welch. Scrap them for mods and you will have a decent weapon until you can find a legendary death claw gauntlet or power fist.  I would only ever use shotguns with the enforcer perk to cripple large enemies like a scorch beast.  They eat up too much ammo and don’t do full damage unless your right on top of the enemy which in that case your unarmed weapon would easily take care of.
---
That's nice, but I've bought shit and spent real money on shit and have 50 Atom Caps. The stuff I bought in the Atom Store mostly cost real money, and therefore the company that sold it to me is expected to provide that shit just the same as if I'd bought it from a real shop even though others have vouchers.
---
Yeah you've not played in a while... it's not how the rules now work. Play adventure mode.... you'll love it.
---
What I don't understand is I'm not advocating for consequence free griefing. You wanna wreck or steal shit?  Cool, but you gotta pay the piper for your misdeeds.
---
Agreed. I understand the one shot kill, even though now its harder due to the damage cap its still possible if you have low health. But the ignore bit its the first time I've heard of. I one shot kill and then stay stealth til you comeback, tho I play melee and if I get spotted i'm dead instantly
---
my view has not changed.. Ive always been sad they changed the game from their original vision
---
I think back in February there was just more people farming it, I don’t think there’s so many people anymore
---
I'm in no way a fan of the pvp in adventure mode buttttttt if you be sitting on the munitions factory for more than an hour (if that) 
---
Someone's gonna come along and try and take it. Or at a minimum pick your locks and steal that precious 5.56
---
Correct.  I agree with everything you just said, and if they never change it, then I'll never claim a workshop again because it's a minor boost that I was only grabbing because I thought I could just zone out and nobody would come take it.  That all being said, I hope that they change it, so I posted about my displeasure with the experience.
---
Blade of bastet is pretty good and you should be able to get it at your level
---
Quick question, what does setting someone in ignore do?
---
The same thing is happening to me. Psycho won't check off. Strange thing is, the last time I had this challenge, it checked off just fine.
---
I have a neon sign at my camp that says that.  I don't know why.   I think I put it up when I got the cannibal perk.
---
I did all of 5-50 on my first guy with rifles and shotgun. Shotgun is weapon 2 and only for panic. IIRC I made them all at the bench too. It’s not blazing fast, but I probably only died multiple times from the same thing on a 10 gutsy spawn for the enclave quest.
---
I said... For example.
---
Meaning, you could do something like that to balance it out if you feel you have to.
---
I didn't say that I was demanding it.
---
Touché
---
Yup, it's more more visible on legacy, but you gotta shoot against plain wall. Or maybe record it with fps limiter off, play it back on slower speed and count it.
---
There is a difference between a raider and a cunt in a mascot head with a deathclaw gauntlet hitting me while I am in pacifist mode and in my camp trying to place an object.  If raiders have fallen so far that their idea of spreading terror is to prevent me from attaching a wire to a water purifier, maybe they should hang up their spurs.
---
To be clear, you chose to spend real money because you didn’t want to wait and earn them. Earning is the primary way to gain atoms. Spending money is a shortcut and totally optional.  And yes anything that’s bugged they should fix. Their track record says they will when they are aware of bugs like clipping etc.
---
100 people will give you 100 different answers. F76 is an acquired taste, that's for sure, though I think there's nothing quite like it on market...
---
Report em to Bethesda. No point in bringing that drama here. It’s a bad idea.
---
you probably have a lot of stashed furniture and walls wich take up all your budget
---
I'll copy paste my solution to this issue from a different thread:
---
If the workshop owner is within the bounds of the workshop when someone contests it there should be a 10-15 second countdown to PvP. In that time the attacking party gains progress towards capturing the workshop as though the owner wasnt there. After the timer runs out or once the owner attacks the contesting party everything is as it is now, capture progress stops and both sides are open to PvP. If the owner leaves the bounds of the workshop within the 10-15 seconds they are never open to PvP. If the workshop owner is outside the workshop when attackers start capturing and enters after they are instantly open to PvP as they are now. This is just a one time 10-15 seconds if the owner is within the workshop when the attackers start to capture.
---
This would still allow workshop PvP as it was intended: fighting for the workshop itself. The owners would get the opportunity to take the first shot(as they should imo) or at least get a little time to not be directly in the contester's crosshairs. Pacifist players who were always going to give up the shop can do so peacefully. Unless your one of the OP-explosive-gun workshop campers this change really doesnt have a downside.
---
Well, it’s a new way for him. Be nice!
---
I think that is true for all persistent online game
---
Unless you're below 110 health, no one is "one-shotting" you as the max damage is 110 per shot. 
---
And people have always trolled workshops. Are you sure you're not the one ignoring them after you die?  Also, if they're crouched you won't see them on the map.
---
It was easy farming when the robobrains dropped them. Guess it was a bug.
---
Clearing out the towers in the Ash Heap yielded so many cores. 
---
Now I just regularly go through Arktos Farma for a chance to get 3.
---
I'm on PS4. I've always been interested in getting it, just hesitant about it. I've been eyeing up a possible purchase when the Wastelanders DLC comes out next month. Then the game would've been out for a year as well, which seems like a fitting time to get it.
---
How do you know you're on ignore list?
---
I use the weight reduction perks for chems, food, energy ammo.
---
If I wanted to carry 6 weapons I would use legendary perks to reduce weapon weight or perk cards for some spesific weapon types.
---
It likely won't, considering it's basically complete in the files aside from rewards.
---
You compared me to a 5 year old and said play solitaire because I don't like workshop PvP.  YOU said risk free, that's a big leap from my pretty specific complaint.  You're just throwing shade in a conversation where other people who disagree with me have made good points.
---
Use vats till your crit meter is full than while still under the effects if that spesific drink use the crit on something.
---
Technically all that was found was the effects in the files, there was literally never anything linking them to vault raids besides wishful thinking.
---
I'll give it another go around. I did enjoying the exploring.
---
You mean when everyone was cheating and griefing? And people would play for a day then never pick the game up again? And pretty much nothing worked? Yeah it was amazing...
---
Go to Social - Recent. Their name will be grey and it’ll say *ignored*
---
I try to make sure I'm there at the start of the event. Seems most times I get screwed are when I port into an ongoing event. Can't blame people for having crazy dps. It's just a buggy system.  I don't do high dmg but using my heavy perks and plasma heavy I know I should be registering toward the kill.
---
It's not just SBQ that it happens with either. I've lost legendary kills because of tags not working.
---
I found those plans outside Harper's Ferry, right where the train tracks cross over the road to the Southwest. There's always something interesting there, if not a dead witch: Sheepsquatch, fallen satellite, undetonated bomb, Mr. Handy, etc.
---
There are carry weight perks, armor that reduces weight and chems that increase your strength. There are backpacks and bulking. And most people just sell all their unnecessary junk.  Strength, unyielding and 20% ammo/junk/food and drink items or weapons weight reduction helps. It really just depends on how you wanna build your caracter
---
Wounding, along with all other 4/5 star effects is still unused outside of some quest rewards which use them, but only them. They've been in the files since beta, and there was never anything linking them to Vault raids beyond wishful thinking.
---
\&gt;  a huge part of my enjoyment of the game is the communal feeling 
---
I get where you are coming from. I just want to throw out there that some of us have the complete opposite view where the wasteland is every man for himself.
---
I get that there is a thin line to walk and that some people are just flat out assholes in the way they play. I won't forget the first time it happened to me. I swore I was never going to take a workshop again. Eventually I came to realize a couple truths. The resources gained from workshops aren't all that much, they are passive supplemental resources to add to what you should be out farming. If you are going to take a workshop, you are accepting the gamble that what just happened to you may very well happen again because it is very much an intended mechanic of the game. You can either show up to fight, or ignore it and let it happen. 
---
There are nice people that contest workshops and there are assholes that contest workshops. There are nice people that claim workshops wanting nothing to do with pvp and there are assholes that claim workshops wanting nothing to do with pvp. There is also everything in between on both sides. You are never going to put them all into a box that they all agree is ideal.
---
Seems a lot like what real life would be like if we were all living in the Fallout timeline.
---
How has he not reached the build cap??? I have a decent base but it's super under furnished because of the build limit
---
Just downloading this game now after not playing it since the free weekend when Nuclear Winter came out. Tons of experience with Fallout games though so I’m not a complete noob. Would love to join your group
---
I run about 50% health, like semi-bloodied. If it’s not one shot suffice to say dead faster than you can react. 
---
And nah, it’s not just stealth. If you go to Social - Recent their name will be grey and it says *ignored*
---
Ok who started the cult?
---
Every time I go back to Flatwoods, for whatever reason, I remember that first day I logged in and there were tons of people around. And now, it’s always empty. Not gonna lie, it’s a pretty melancholy feeling.
---
I think the Mayor and Sanjay are the most annoying characters on the radios. When we get DJs, I will be a happy boy.
---
Now I can’t hear tht commercial in my head with any other lyrics
---
Yes, boycott workshop till they fix it. Stay away from them or I garantee a ganker will show up and start something. 
---
It happens Every time I take a shop since 0ct1. It was bad before but now it's just a fvck fest for the griefters.
---
Thanks Beth, once again you stick it to the pve player.
---
It's just the fact that I have the tenderizer and the all rise. And the all rise does a whopping 50 more damage.
---
The strangest propped teddy bears i have seen in game is on the roof (i think, in one of the cornors) of the central train yard. One bear has a magnifying glass looking at another bears ass
---
So I keep using vats and this crit meter will fill...how do I use that on ps4?
---
Dammit, I should have called the pun theft a burgerlary.
---
Idk how to farm legendaries tho. People always say "do west tek and whitesprings" but I see a legendary at whitesprings every 6 or 7 runs and I've never seen a legendary at west tek.
---
I also can't run west tek often because it takes about 500 of my 5.56 (even with a rw aae handmade) and 15-20 stimpaks.
---
Basically it's taken me since like a month before clean appalachia to hit 600 scrip. And idrk how to do more.
---
Griefers=/=Raiders. 
---
Those are the same people who go annihilate a level 9 at a workshop. They arent in it for PVP, they're in it to do exactly that, being a cunt. 
---
The problem is you conflate the two simply because we PVPers have nowhere to PVP sans workshops. So now anyone who goes and bothers you at a workshop is a "cunt" because one dude did some slap damage to you at your camp. 
---
Also, Raiders don't care that you don't want to fight. You put yourself in Pacifist. 
---
Also also. We're talking specifically about workshop PVP here. Not some dude with a DCG whacking you at your camp. Your Camp was never a designated PVP zone. Conversely, Workshops have been since Beta.
---
You are most welcome to join buddy 👍👍
---
Max out the carry weight cards then if you will be partaking in some power armors just use the batteries included and another one that reduces the weight drastically or your PA.  
---
My carry weight has drop a great amount.  I also use the hiker perk as I carry lots of food and drinks.  Look through your cards to find the arrangements you need.
---
Eli5 what happened since launch? Did it somehow get worse?
---
I like the bears on top of Poseidon. 
---
I like to think it’s the same wastelander going around staging the bears.
---
My job is done
---
The flux has always been from the event, and it has always been exactly 4 flux. The queen does not drop flux.
---
At the moment meta is anti armor /faster fire rate or explosive and bloodied or a combination of 3 of the 4. Depends on your perk set up too. .50 cal and LMG for heavy weapon. Handmade and combat rifles for rifles. Lever action for rifleman. It depends what you want
---
I've never gotten any you lucky bastard!
---
Fair enough, that might be true, with all the low levels going there picking everything up
---
SANJAY HERE, LETTING YOU KNOW THE CURATOR IS CHARGRD AND READY TO DIG UP ANOTHER SOLDIER AT PRICKETTS FORT!
---
My nightmares have COME ALIIIIIVE!
---
We are simply bodies for the Curator to bury. 
---
All glory to the Mayor for Life.
---
No, but at launch everyone was un flatwoods doing the same quest. Having everyone on the server in the same place was like nothing else this game has offered since.
---
Kill workshop excavator players... Whoa buddy do they have junk. Not just a little junk either.. Like 30 bulk lead kinda junk.
---
So the curator did. Welp i know my next target.
---
If you look at the bottom of the screen while in vats you’ll see the Crit bar and when it fills there will be a sound to notify you then it should have what button to press next to it. 
---
On Xbox it’s “Y”  the same button to attached wires in CAMP.
---
I hate PVP with a passion. Mostly because games do it wrong. I've been playing since the beta but only in my lvl 30's (I don't try to level up) if I'm on one that has a lot of people I server hop till I find one that don't have anyone or not a lot.
---
but mostly on pvp they need to organize the servers. So you don't see a level 100 holding a area that is for lower levels. or taking on a lvl 20 there just is no contest. (This all  would b more for a new survivor mode though) in adventure the upper levels shouldn't be able  to do damage to lower levels. a bounty has already proven to not work. One why would anyone care about a 15 credit bounty? put like a 100 credit bounty and only people that is able to hunt him is a fraction (the bounty hunters) when fractions finally come in the next update. So you don't see friends taking the bounties
---
Currently I'm a probably shitty melee build. I like melee but I kinda wanna be able to use a rifle too. Guess I need to find a handmade or combat rifle.
---
High levels always pull that crap.  I barely took any workshops over and the few times I did I always checked the map to see I was alone and no one near by but I am so damn slow at everything someone pops in takes me out that is that.  It's always when I am defending the shop from waves or trying to build no one ever would come up to even ask me.
---
So avoid em save yourself the burden.  If they would just make an opt out option instead of automatic pvp that would be nice so if you wanted to bounce you could.  It would also remove that nonsense those cowards pull.  I'm sure they think they are raiders too, just to clarify raiders charge in screaming they don't hide.
---
Not really, it's ok for low level players so you can headshot easily in vats using the stalkers, maximizing damage per shot.
---
Tbh all weapons are good with the right legendary effects and cards.
---
Best are bloodied, junkies, anti armour, for secondary effects, explosive or faster fire rate or if your using melee, swing speed.
---
Struggled with this until survival came into my life. Once that happened it was a complete non issue. I never run with more than 5 stims, 5 radaways, 5 purified water. I used carnivore so I picked up meat while I was out. I am trying to stick with this mentality as much as I can in adventure. It isn't as easy without the threat of dropping it all upon death but I'm doing everything I can to keep my head straight so I don't have carry weight issues.
---
Or the unlimited weight,hardly any stash cap and explosive exp glitches.
---
Sales have dried all around, player count has lowered for the time being and people are looking  for legendary weapons and ammo most these days, especially 5.56 since its the most used. Wastelanders will be where it goes up for plans again
---
I'm two levels away friend and congrats on your milestone.
---
Crown store is eso version of atom shop.
---
Travelling Pharmacy is a must! At least for me.
---
Im a shotgun so I have ScatterShot which reduce my shotgun weight by 90%. 
---
Get the Serum that increase your weight. Starched genes is required. 
---
I also have Thru Hiking which reduce my food n drinks by 90%.I have a lot of food.. Like 100.
---
That's how I keep my weight down
---
ENGAGE HOSTILE FORCES... MEMEBERS. Thank you for using B-B-BOT STOP!
---
It’s triangle on PS4.  What weapon are you using?  Plenty of ghouls and scorched to try on in the area.
---

---
Gotta try to get the group photo of the three in Watoga civic center somehow.
---
If you do auto rifle, the invest into perception and agility. Sneak and vats make your life a whole lot easier
---
As a level 280 w no friends playing this game and not much desired to team up with randoms I’d support this and it’d give me some to do again in this game as I’m currently running low on activities
---
This works I used to hear him all the time but now that I’m carrying around a dead body I don’t anymore... totally worth the smell!

Where is your Camp? Sorry can’t remember exactly
---
Because these kind of practices are shamelessly aimed at getting the most amount of money with the least amount of effort. (I am not saying the actual devs didn't do their best..)  As long as you buy into these worthless ideas companies will try to push the bar even lower, for a wide variety of reasons which boils down to money to simplify it. So you can vote with your money so to say. As long as you buy into this the more of these mind-numbing products will drag people in and turn them into cattle with wallets. That's why every rainbow colored post hits me in the wrong way (But I don't teardown the people because they are just "having a good time"). It's shameless, uninspired, low effort  and devoid of any meaning/goal.
---
True. My level 15 alt needed two hunting rifle or like 6-7 10mm shots to get a tag on the prime beasts in primal cuts
---
Thanks! :)
---
I had the same problem (ps4) trying to figure it out. Basically you fill that meter and once it's full, hit the triangle button before vats shooting again. Hopefully I described that correctly. Fill the meter, triangle button, shoot.
---
Ive done it 4 times over the last few days. Done a fairish bit of damage (not massive but constant). Vats and critical her wings in the air. Melee with a spiked fire axe (more damage with each consecative hit) when she's downed. Also a good few MIRV's so certainly doing my fair share and nothing. She's always empty. No quest rewards. Nothing. Nada. And it's getting bloody annoying now.
---
Yeah I've had friends unload while clips into a Sentrybot but because they were too low a level to do enough damage they got nothing when I killed it!
---
It should be like Elder Scrolls Online where if you are in a team with someone who tagged an enemy and were close enough, you still get the drop!
---
I really want workshop pvp to get rebalanced, and its very simple to fix: add a 10 second warning when starting to claim an owned workshop before pvp begins. this gives the defender freedom from bullshit instant ganks, and gives them the option to reposition for defense or to leave the area. Workshops can be fun for everyone with only minor changes.
---
So does it fill faster with higher level creatures or can I just smash a bunch of low levels to fill it?
---
Server will detonate if these all go off. Someone taking over a workshop somewhere will get dropped and curse Bethesda never knowing of the great WS boom!
---
My vendor doesn't sell too much I have god prices too.  No one bought any of the serums I worked hard to get recipes for and ingredients.  It makes me sad as I just wanted to have a friendly camp but barely making any sales.  I've been considering cutting the cost and vendor space and going off the grid for camp.  I always make my daily cap quota from the vendors anyway and I almost have all the mutations I want so why bother I'm thinking.
---
I might just for privacy reasons to have camp seclusion for when I move it.
---
I’ll take, things that didn’t happen for 1000 Trebek.
---
It’s not just mags... I have plenty of 3* armor and upgraded combat, shielded underarmor for way less than most and sales aren’t that great... it’s like a small mom and pop if even sales wise. 
---
I think many regular players already have a lot of the items they need or know where to find them. 
---
Junk business on the other hand is booming!
---
Nah nah nah nah! Only the cult of the mole god can live!
---
I like to stuff the first Overseers cache with good low level stuff I find, and duplicate plans. I hope I surprise a few newbies doing that.
---
There are 4 in a canoe near new Gad
---
Oh I thought Bethesda somehow fucked it up worse.
---
Yeah for the beta, it’s probably the closest I’ve felt to strangers ever.
---
I've never seen those.  Map marked! Thank you!
---
Just pick a lock and wait for them to arrive, if they go at you wipe the place to the foundation.
---
Ohhh Another pin point on my map! Thanks!
---
That’s probably one of the worst things you could do. Almost everyone runs adrenaline and it refreshes a 60% damage BuFF.
---
Theres isnt a part of this that I dont like.
---
They're dropping again. If say about 10-15% drop rate though.
---
Ahhhhhh that sounds kinda funny! Map marked!
---
The thing is these people aren’t looking for PvP.  That exists in Nuclear Winter.  They’re looking to find unsuspecting people they can clobber with OP weapons, and hope they’ll come back for more a few times.  If they wanted PvP battles with like minded people, they’d take the workshop and hang out.
---
Now to be fair there may be a few that are thinking you took the shop to promote PvP, but i really doubt that.
---
All that said I personally think that survival mode will be back after wastelanders launch.  My hope though is there’s another mode for veteran players where the whole map is a bit tougher but that’s a bit of a pipe dream I think.
---
You can find soot flower and bloodleaf at Overseer camp by the Bridge at the water.

For critical just use any weapon. I prefer something like pipe pistol because they don't use AP much. Find an enemy, Then you press L1 and it will show your target and then press R2,that will shoot the damn thing.Then below will show Critical.keep doing the L1 and R2 thingy until its full. Then press triangle then press R2. Done.

Lvl 15 1 star bloodied handmade. 
---
Or anti armor
---
Nice! I remember seeing a photo album of you guys a little while ago. I'll check it out!
---
Funny they put you to ignore like they’re afraid... lol
---
You better not be toying with my emotions! I'm logging in rn! That sounds funny as hell!
---
It'll be cool to have new content again when Wastelanders comes out. Everyone working towards the same goal again.
---
The griefers are gonna be bad though I imagine.
---
These are great ideas, hopeing some dev or something reads it. Things like these are nice, it's kinda like a grind but also working for a team, the community in this game is amazing so I think this would work really well. 
---
BoS, Enclave, Free States.. maybe order of mysteries or mothman cult as main ones to join.
---
If you wanna try helping all maybe the responders can be like a 'I dont wanna commit but I wanna do the events' they still get a reward at the end but not as much as if they actually joined a group.
---
Then raiders can be like, if you just wanna be a dick, maybe sabatogue events or something and they can get like guns and junk or whatever thruout the whole thing but are flagged for PVP always, but however many events they ruin or kill other players is how much they get at the end of the season
---
I would die
---
I'm not sure how long you've been playing, but you're extremely luck if they 3 stars have always dropped 3 stars, 2 stars dropped 2 stars etc. That's unbelievably lucky, because every other person I know doesn't have that happen, and there have been many, many posts on reddit complaining about it since the game launched pretty much.
---
Valseek has already told us what to do:   nuke Grafton repeatedly 
---
We have our mission, everyone just needs to step up
---
So, maybe you're lucky. Maybe you don't have the best memory. Maybe it's not true. I can't really say.
---
Pretty irritating eh? 😔🥵
---
For getting more capacity:
---
- Backpack w/mod
---
- Strong Back
---
- Radicool
---
- Unyielding and +Str armor
---
- Deep pocketed armor
---
- Marsupial Serum + Starched Genes
---
For reducing weight:
---
- Thru Hiker
---
- Travelling Pharmacy
---
- Sturdy Frame
---
- Weapon and ammo weight reducing armor (aid reduction will not be effective with the perks)
---
For temporarily getting more capacity, like to fast travel home after farming, you can stack these:
---
- Bufftats (+3 str)
---
- Party Boy/Girl + Whiskey (+6 str)
---
- Grilled Radstag (+20 w)
---
- Rad Ant Lager (+50 w)
---
All these talks about the great community seem so strange to me. Maybe it is just my bad luck, but all I’ve seen is people duping, trying to one shot every legendary at Uranium Fever, intentionally blowing up cars around me in Whitesprings, and killing the lovely Brahmin at my CAMP over and over again. Thank Todd for removing the damage to structures because I just lost track of how many times I had to rebuild my CAMP. Oh, I almost forgot the people who pick up the 50 free beers I offer at my vendor all at once. Like, who needs 50 beers?
---
Yeah, everyone in the server gets them, the people who complete the quest get the other item, I forget what it is. I always try to run over there and drop it for the people that finished the quest, but they never get what im trying to do.
---
Shit, even as someone who aimed to run that sort of build I didn't think about that lol.
---
To be fair, a lot of the people were ignoring the ads, which was why I thought I was helping
---
Why on earth would anyone claim a workshop if they don’t want pvp? It’s a pvp thing in its essence? Come on!!
---
I feel ya -  though some of them that require hours of server hoping, I"ve resigned myself to skipping
---
It happened to me about a month ago. I thought I was dreaming, remembering the good times, lol.
---
Right, it was impactful and interesting then, but now listening to it gives me anxiety.
---
Lmao. Just found out I have 3 legendary rifles with this effect...No wonder my rifle build felt underpowered.
---
Ya legendary weight reduction is super important to me. I have 4 pieces with food water chem reduction plus the max traveling pharmacy and max thru hiking. I always have 100+stim, 60+dog food, 40+ each Radaway&amp;radx 100+purified water + 20-30 almost every chem. I also use the sturdy frame to reduce armor weight. Unfortunately there is not a rifle weight reduction perk card but two of mine have the 90% weight reduction( which is hardly worth it since it only effects the base weight and mods seem to weigh 1.5 times more than normal)
---
The warning that pops on the screen saying it could result in PvP is all the warning needed and they acknowledge that... 
---
And that’s coming from a non PvP player... they can be salty as they want but the game warned them... 
---
Most plans you get can easily be found at vendors and player vendors all the time to include the fusion generator.
---
Yeah-  under the assumption that maybe they just badly worded it  and they meant a turned creature not a spawned scorched creature- i even managed to turn a regular animal into a scorched by getting a SB to spray her urine fog on me , and i got a stingwing to turn and a buddy got a yao gui to turn this way ... but nothing
---
Obviously skip to the very end to see the stingwing turn:
---

---
I think if u use it on the 95 Scortchbeast queen it keeps her grounded, during Scortched the earth event....?
---
I run this: 
---
Excavator power armor (added carry weight in a game that cuts the legs off inventory is god tier imo)
---
2 full fusion cores
---
10k 5mm ammo
---
5mm mini gun (legendary so no fear of scrapping en mass)
---
2k 308 ammo
---
308 lmg (legendary so no fear of scrapping en mass) 
---
5 stimpacks (for friends)
---
10 boiled water (save the purified for selling)
---
1 disease cure ( I would carry more but goddamn they’re hard to locate consistently)
---
10 diluted stimpacks
---
(Usually eat meat I find) due to perk cards
---
Keep my weight at roughly 80/400 on my person and close to 750/800 because I collect clothing to sell. Also lead and gunpowder are up in the thousands. 
---
I use bandolier, and bear arms to reduce weight. I’ve tried swapping those out for pack mule but I find the more ammo I have the easier it is to justify bandolier. And if I have bandolier then I’m gonna keep bear arms. (Pack mule was great for trying stuff out to see what I like and when I run out of ammo and can’t carry anymore. I’ll swap them where I see fit)
---
I try not to keep anything else. 
---
Junk, armor to scrap, weapons to scrap, I run light and I run clean. Everything else is scrappable and all feeds the ammo beast. 
---
I got rid of all my regular armor once I got my shit together and organized my build. I was running the riflemen perks and then the commando perks but once I realized I could manufacture ammo for the 5mm at a fraction of the cost of everything else it all came pretty clear. 
---
Gunpowder and ore hang out in the misc section of your inventory and can weigh you down when you mass produce it (acid and cloth from the Chem station) or mine it, crystal ore, copper ore, iron ore, lead ore, sneaky weighty bastards. Found this out the hard way when I crafted copious amounts of ammo and not wondering where the extra weight was from.
---
A melee build that requires no power armor shouldn’t have 5 fusion cores or the chassis sitting In the inventory collecting valuable space, melee build from a friend of mine used as an example. 
---
Find what build works best for you and then get rid of everything else. 
---
Or don’t...
---
I’ve read some people run over encumbered builds. They love it and it allows them to be more immersed within their surroundings as opposed to crushing big bend tunnel, scrapping all the shotguns and then fast traveling back to camp to flash up ammo for the ammo beasts. (Gets repetitive and tedious) 
---
A friend of mine was running a shotgun build but the plastic farming was too much. He jumped to melee and hasn’t looked back since. I get his steel to help feed the ammo beast. 
---
Go with what you feel, and stay safe vault dweller.
---
TIL, you can actually “turn” FO76 creatures into Scorched.
---
Fuck no, I’ve put way too much time into my character I’ve had since the beta.
---
Actually since I posted it didn't happened :/
---
But yeah, pretty bothering
---
&gt; Griefers=/=Raiders.
---
not from where I am standing. I have yet to see a "raider" that is not abusing some mechanic or another to annoy players who have no interest in their shit.  
---
We were happy that survival siphoned all you folks away so we could play the game with minimal asshole content.
---
You can fill it on anything. It fills based on hits and your luck special. Higher luck special fills it faster. But even with 1 luck you should fill it in 10-11 vats hits.
---
If it's better than what you currently have, then it's a good weapon.
---
Until you find the next good weapon, rinse, repeat.
---
Weapons will coincide with your build type and perk choices. Perhaps if you provide the kind of toon you want to build, you would get some more specific weapon options to keep an eye out for.
---
There's a build planning tool called [Nukes and Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) that can help with creating a roadmap for how you want your toon to develop as he/she levels up.
---
Advice, take it and sit right beside the border and the second you get it leave.  do not come back until you get the quest to retake it from the creatures that took it.  Only events show up on the map.  And it's that period of time from when you get the workshop through the first defend as well as later defend events that brings the trolls out from under the bridge.  That's when they know you are most likely there.
---
Also, nicely punned.
---
Damn you waited 45 minutes on a 30 minute event. You really are next level bro
---
Oh neat, I didn't realize the datamine showed that much of the whole picture.
---
My predictions for the rewards: A new spooky melee weapon that probably won't appear in the legendary pool, some new exclusive Halloween costumes mixed in the pool with the existing ones, and a bunch of spooky CAMP decorations. Probably collectible plans for carved pumpkins. The Atom Shop will no doubt get a bunch of Halloween stuff too, like the Creation Club skins from Fallout 4, the vampire costume returning, and more costumes and CAMP decorations. 
---
My unreasonable hope is that one of the Halloween costumes is medieval knight armor. An impossible dream, if you will.
---
Yeah, I've had it happen once or twice, but the last one was terrible.  
---
Took over teh farm in the middle-left of the map, the one with teh scads of raozrgrain? Knocked off a bunch of level 1 Scorched, then sat down to brew up some alchohol for the daily challenge ... and someone level 343 waited for me to sit at the cooking station before hitting me with a Fatman.  
---
Needless to say, I died instantly.  
---
They stole 50caps from me for this, as well as all of my junk (What, like I was going to go back and just keep running into mininukes? I don't think so.)  
---
Oh, and later it cost me 25 MORE caps to retake the thing after they got bored and logged off.  
---
Ugh.
---
&gt; It’ll be interesting when they inevitably push out the NCR Ranger outfit and every single player is wearing it.
---
*Inserts "Shut up and take my money!" meme*
---
There is an auto receiver that benefits from gunslinger ... it’s crazy. I’ve got a VampE and a Vamp/Crit 10mm which are quite fun ... but the Western puts things down so much easier.
---
My gunslinger is a full-health build. Best western I have is a TSE, but really would like an AAE and an Instigating / Aim Damage for sniping - TSE isn’t accurate enough. I’ve got a bloody/explosive legacy laser I’m hoping to trade out for like 4-5 other weaker items.
---
You need to get a plasma for the SBQ though ... need.
---
Exactly.  if you are a stealth/sniper build you might as well just sit naked in a chair waiting for the one shot. Because by the time you even know they are there they have already have killed you.
---
Or just be able to get them out of FO76 in any form at all? (On Xbox)
---
Nope, haven't seen anything like that, and I doubt it's possible.
---
I know! Not just in Flatwoods. When I was doing the quest at the DVM me and some other dude were both running back and forth between buildings. Standing in line together. Iirc a third guy saw us waiting in line at DMV and left. Lol I have heard they changed the buildings. So, you don't have run between buildings. I haven't gone and looked.
---
/The Curators reign of terror has ended!/
---
Basically my issue is that I see people one shotting things where I need to slash it 4 times to kill it. I wanna become useful... I feel I'm severely underpowered atm.
---
Thanks for the cake day. Didn’t know what it meant till today 
---
I feel like that argument would have a solid footing if:
---
-	there was only one bundle a month or two week period
---
-	they didn’t constantly slice and dice the bundles
---
-	the challenges weren’t so hard to accomplish in a daily session
---
-	it was a consistent price
---
-	the atoms available in that time added up to just over its cost 
---
 -	without talking about the ones you get from character challenges which are exhausted for many by now 
---
But instead they do back-to-back-to-back rerolls and price testing and the atoms you can gain and the prices never square up. 
---
On top of that - the atom shop has become the de facto place for “new content”. 
---
Plans have pretty much stopped being released outside of meat week and even then they withheld rewards (BBQ) to ensure the Atom Shop was visited. 
---
All of the recent functional content for CAMPs has been through the storefront - some free but increasingly not - almost all have an expiry date.
---
-	punchbowl
---
-	wild Appalachia posters (not available anymore. . .)
---
-	computer
---
-	scavengertron :/
---
-	fridge
---
-	a working BBQ 
---
They’ve rigged it so you have to play every waking moment of your life or pay to have a life outside of the game but still have a non-subpar fallout experience
---
Someone needs to make both a reality
---
I could be wrong, but I don't think the level of the creature matters? I'll have to ask though.  I usually get the crit shot on the low levels outside of Biv's. There's usually 4-8 L1 or 3's there and I get the meter filled pretty fast.
---
Ikr I'm insane, just hacking into Bethesda's mainframe {If In Game(Max Charecter Set= Yes)} boom too easy, giving myself extra time, all that. I'm just the GOAT
---
But yeah this was all just a lie to make me feel better about the queen beating my ass every time. 
---
But I do actually have that Gatling laser though, and I did ask to be left along but no one gives a shit what I want
---
Fallput 76 was originally ament to have the idea of the raiders are real online people and that's what's happening here, your that hopeless npc farmer in fallout 4 thag get shit on by a group of raiders, now grow a pair get good weapons and armour and go raid someome
---
I think a good balance between speed and damage would be good right now. Any idea where I can get plans for the melee weapons you suggested?
---
Yes, if you join the server, everyone is required to stream their matches using the new Go Live feature on discord so you will be able to watch whoever you want.
---
Sure thing! They’re on the edge of the roof that faces the hill.  Not in a spot you usually wouldn’t be.
---
A real human would not say that.
---
Thank you for the offer! I'm on xbox tho
---
I mean that’s just my take. I think the game can become better but I still like it as it is. So whether or not we ended up with the “intended” version is probably up for debate, but either way I’ll keep playing 76 until I’m truly bored to death. And to be completely honest I did get a little burnt out and was only playing every other day for a while then I took a whole week and a half break. But maybe it was a needed break because i could play for 8 hours if I had the time. Lol
---
So true. Sure there were crazy and hilariously bad problems everywhere. But it was so much fun stepping out together.
---
I was able to mute him by running the quest. I haven't heard it since doing it.
---
I need nuclear materials for making a shit-ton of radium rifles.
---
Not all hero’s wear capes
---
I still, once in a while, stuff the mailbox of the Flatwoods Church and wonder who will find it or if it will go away before anyone thinks to check
---
Nope it will still pop up till he compleata the mission, better grab a shovle OP
---
https://youtu.be/gXG3eTVScps
---
So your not in pacifist mode? If so they shouldn’t  be tearing up your camp. Just don’t fight them back.
---
Got millions of caps, what do you want for it?
---
Super sledge plans are rewards from events. Usually scrapping weapons is the best way of unlocking them and modding them. Pick all the weapons you come across and scrap them and you unlock plenty of weapon mods like that. You can also craft them and destroy them and it will occasionally give you a mod tho its more resource consuming
---
Thanks everyone I finally see the triangle highlight for crit!
---
And thats your perspective, and You're entitled to it, but that doesn't make it correct.  
---
I'm sorry, do you have someone behind you constantly hitting you? Were you -really- griefed that much? If you can't handle them I'll come kill them for you. 
---
But it seems you're hellbent on "anyone who pvps is cunt cause thats what i see" so I'm probably not gonna change anything by talking to you. Cheers, and stay away from workshops so you dont get "griefed".
---
Also. Do try and read more than the first line.
---
Huh, that is lame af, if done willingly. There is however this pvp mechanism, that will put you both in ignore state, if a downed guy keeps choosing revenge - so that might be the cause, too.
---
Not sure where you are standing, perhaps in one of the fissures.
---
Oh awesome I'll get that for sure! Thank you!
---
No, that means YOU'RE ignoring them. When someone kills you in PVP, the game automatically sets them to ignored on YOUR side, so neither of you can see the other on the map
---
Wish it was a simple theory, But Bethesda keeps proving I'm usually right most of the time.
---
Sorry this has been your experience. I look at the other comments on this thread, and these are the kinda people I've met out there.
---
&gt; And thats your perspective, and You're entitled to it, but that doesn't make it correct.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I'm sorry, do you have someone behind you constantly hitting you? Were you -really- griefed that much? If you can't handle them I'll come kill them for you.

---
we were nearly asshole free for months. Now they are back. Not sure why I need to quote your entire post to respond, but whatever floats your goat.
---
I would, but all my character slots are full lol
---
I understand. And as someone who does actively seek workshop pvp I think whole mechanism should be definitely skewed towards defending party; right now it's pretty one-sided.
---
The syringer isn't completely worthless :-p  
---

---
8 pts of str, marsupial,a back pack, deathclaw steak, radstag and brahmin meat
---
the only weight reduction perk card I use is 1pt of packrat
---
I carry 5 weapons.. 4 ballistic and 1 melee..
---
with all my ammo, armor and aid items that usually leaves me around 40 to 60 lbs of free space to gather junk..
---
So I ended up holding triangle when it said crit and pressing r2 to fire.....ps4
---
Oh dont quote it, i dont need it repeated back to me. I just need you to read all the information so you can actually have an idea of what to respond to instead of a "from my perspective the Jedi are evil" line.
---
It's because it's somewhat rare to see Vault Boy without his trademark &lt;==&gt; grin.
---
my wife is gonna love this one, thanks for the idea
---
HEADS UP RESPONDERS
---
I've pretty consistently received 4 random fluxes from the event completion.
---
It’s kinda sad. I finally got geared for PVP and that very week the announced it was going away. 
---
It was also the hook I was trying to use to convince my Day-z &amp; Rust friends to join in on.
---
Couldn't you just remake it isn't the character creator the same
---
The lack of matchmaking is also causing players to stay away. A third party app/community shouldn't be required to find a team.
---
Meat week was exceptional for this. However there are several spawn locations on the map, I use WEST TEK super mutants have a three star legendary usually. I use that spot for plastic to bulk and the steel for the ammo beasts. Server hop until I drop.
---
I know, i have the same problema, my friend vats the guy in head and nothing
---
That's one thing I live about the Queen fights. I've only had one negative experience of people being sour players. The rest have always been a great show of teamwork. Even if everyone is super high level, we know how the game works and make sure everyone gets a change to lay some damage down to get those sweet sweet rewards after. :)
---
No stress. When the munitions producing ammobot (or whatever) comes out for 1800 atoms, people won’t go after the factory either.
---
It'll be about 8 hours
---
100 would be very cheap to get a guaranteed base item. A random 3* weapon is already 100 scrip, and the overwhelming majority of those goes straight back to the exchange machine.
---
I really hope they bring it back. Call it whatever you want was long as it's open world PVP always on. NW is not a replacement for survival mode and it never will be.
---
If your strength is decent, punching it with a syringer works and does a lot more damage than just shooting it with blank syringes, unsure about the other ammos. 
---
This also works for any weapon, so if you need to be killing things with a Fat Man and don’t want to use a lot of ammo, go around punching low level radroaches and ghouls and stuff with the weapon
---
Ohhh that reminds me I saw a skeleton couple dressed in formal wear on top of one of the Manors once. Might have been the home owners? But she is sitting on his lap, like they were dressed for the fall of the bombs. And they decided to get dressed up to die in style....
---
As I find crappy vendors now, I turn off any that have a switch, in order to help others not waste their caps.
---
If you're fighting and you're killing then you're useful
---
It's all part of the game, your gear, your strategy, your kill power all improve over time. Also consider a lot of "newer" toons are actually alternates for folks who can make their new characters very overpowered from the start.
---
Got you if you're on ps4, hundreds of flux if you need, lemme know &amp; congrats!
---
I think at least half of my loading screens are bears in various places, it’s fun coming across them and seeing what situations they’re in
---
There needs to be a moderately expensive yet buildable CAMP radar object for workshops that you can wire it to a siren to alert if a player is coming near the workshop.
---
You’ll get your notice to leave and people will have to change up how they take on workshops.
---
A tip. When you claim a workshop just stay crouched. When you are crouching you are invisible on the map and the pvpers wont see you in the shop will assume that nobody is there and will move along to the next one
---
Me too XD, those good 7-8 hours daily
---
@525, waiting on prestige perk cards....still waiting....
---
Mine too ! And glitched creatures I can pose with!
---
Sadly I can't find Grafton's Mayor in an mp3 on google.  Someone should get on that...
---
I'm still selling a surplus of Fashnacht masks.
---
I was thinking of using him as an sms alert from people I don't really like.
---
Oh I definitely do. But I also just don’t have the imagination for this. I currently have a mothman church next to Berkeley Springs if anyone wants to join the cult
---
I started playing in July. What happened in flatwoods?
---
Yes, it is asked often.
---
Wichita spring golf club is a quick farm that usually has some decent scrip fuel these days. Even non-nuked a quick run through the clubhouse usually yields 1-3 Legendaries.
---
If you can't deal with the "stress" don't take workshops. 
---
I currently avoid them because they have no resources which can't be easily obtained elsewhere and that includes ammo.
---
Start rewarding even 5 scrip for taking a workshop. Or have every wave of attack to defend them include at least 1 Legendary enemy and then I'll be interested and actively farm them. PvP and all.
---
&gt; Oh dont quote it, i dont need it repeated back to me. I just need you to read all the information so you can actually have an idea of what to respond to instead of a "from my perspective the Jedi are evil" line.
---
And I explained that- people say they are raiders whenever they are doing shit to grief. You can't hide behind that name- they are all using it. The latest is getting themselves a bounty and trying to trigger your AE mutations to force you in to combat. Every time an exploit is fixed the "raiders" just find a new one.
---
I need to join a group so sign me up. Lvl 202 bloody build . Been soloing the game since launch and need some people to play with.
---
Id just take what i needed but there are definitely ppl that would take the lot... i did it once with junk. First person who turned up, took the lot and then they very slowly waddled to their stash box...
---
Ugh that sucks! You never really had the chance to enjoy the gear. Shame your friends didn't come earlier. My group is very sad its gone, we had such a blast.
---
Edit: tho it is a small chance. Scrapping is worth more for the weapon mods. You can get the weapon plans off of the vendors, be it player or NPC's
---
The game does it automatically. Every time I kill someone, the game mutes me for them.
---
It probably was the one you killed.  
---
I've noticed especially if you don't take everything, the body follows you.
---
To verify - I took everything from one, then put in something useless like spoiled vegetables.  
---
For the rest of my session, a body carrying spoiled veggies followed me all over the map.
---
Was really amusing when i killed several in the same session.  
---
Raining SB bodies.
---
Did they fix the drop rate? I havnt played since when the patch affected legendary drops. Thx
---
You people?
---
Bummer!
---
Too much hassle. I had spend a lot of time creating it :/
---
I’ve seen these before and normally didn’t take a thing. But I have also rune sales when I need to cut weight and will dump a ton of junk in for 0-1caps. I post it on another sub that it’s inventory reduction sale first come first serve. Those are gone quick normally the first person.
---
Tato salads and don't fast travel 😉
---
Okay. If you kill a legendary enemy too quickly after it spawns it won't have time to roll an item. It goes like:
---
Enemy spawns,
---
Rolls yes or no, yes makes it an elite enemy,
---
Rolls yes or no, yes makes it a 1 star enemy,
---
Rolls yes or no, yes makes it a 2 star enemy,
---
Rolls yes or no, yes makes it a 3 star enemy.
---
They have a 1 star legendary by default, but it needs a couple seconds for the game do the same rolls to see if it will be a 2 or 3 star, and then the effects for it. So, when you see a legendary enemy, give it a few seconds to spawn in all the way and roll it's item.
---
WOW thanks!  But man, this really messes w/ a couple "hybrid" builds I was working on. I liked the idea of being able to snipe from a distance, but then charge in for melee. Can't believe they didn't add the "(No Power Armor)" on some of these.
---
So, quick follow up. While the SNEAK perk doesn't work, you can still "sneak" in PA, right? So like covert operative works, just not boosted by the SNEAK perk?
---
Ah that makes sense. Yeah, I'll have to send my build after work tonight. I crashed last night so I gave up and went to destiny for a little bit. I know I need to move some points around but I'm lost now because so much of my perks seem helpful but as I'm finding out, some perks are broken and useless. I'm also on edge about doing dual perk set ups. Like with melee and non auto rifles. I want them both, but it seems more end game material to only specialize in one weapon
---
Great tips! Do you know what food or drink has that longest timer to improve capacity /weight?
---
I wouldn't (and haven't when I find that.) I try to imagine what my intention would be if I put up freebies, and it would be so that every visitor could take something free, not just the first guy. 
---
I want some freebies for people, though, so I have messages to take free water and loot my scrap collector. I'm comfortable with someone taking all of that because it re-stocks itself automatically and I don't have to read about it when they take it.
---
That makes total sense now, thank you so much. I was thinking it had something to do with killing it to fast, but I didn't know for sure, because I usually try to rush places fast.
---
I will take all the bloodied ffr handmades you have.
---
I always wanted to run that in my kitchen. Never could get it to work. Id love to see more items like this in the game.
---
They planned to have DLC from day one.
---
Just wait till there are settlements that need help.
---
That’s... the point
---
Just because someone disagrees with you, they're a troll? Okay man. That's neat. 
---
So then straight up. You're level 30. You have no experience actually PVPing. If you did, you'd realize that your suggestions are just flat broke. Especially:
---
&gt;"Upper levels can't deal damage to lower levels" 
---
like what? Because I'm level 200, I cant do anything to the level 50 optimized PVP alt because some level 30 was like "no"  
---
If you play so casually, you probably seen another person as much as you've played Nuka Dapper, but hey, guess im just a troll.
---
I think the unfortunate truth is that after a season of general neglect and poor patch quality, the game is dying.  Players are moving off into competitors like Borderlands 3 or Destiny 2, and there's been nothing since the free week to offer us some new blood that would be interested in buying this stuff.  A lot of business comes in waves now - usually an alt character buying up plans, or a higher-level player looking for cheap things to scrip.
---
Once my main acquired all the serum recipes - which took quite a while toward the end because no one would buy anything - there wasn't much reason to continue making caps, so that operation has wound down drastically and she has lost the raison d'etre to play everyday.
---
Shoot, I'm on PC. Appreciate the offer though and thank you!!
---
I think I have one. Platform?
---
You on PC? I know a very fast and efficient method of doing it, not outright saying it cause it’ll just get patched then, but if you’re on PC I’ll show you and do it with you for a bit.
---
Also, for any collectors or traders out there that see the value in having Purveyor loot boxes, maybe you should give me a shout, makes farming legendaries as easy as a click: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/559560837833031682/626787786669817856/unknown.png
---
I always put my plans for free, unless they are super rare- then very cheap, and free ammo. And you know what? No one ever comes and just cleans it out. And when someone takes more than one thing they are usually only around level 50.
---
The real Grafton monster is the mayor
---
is it .wav? maybe even .flac? if i had the game on PC i could make it happen, but alas i do not
---
&gt; 1 disease cure ( I would carry more but goddamn they’re hard to locate consistently)
---
Disease cures can be crafted, there are 6 different recipes that all produce this item, and one of those is known by default. It requires water and 2 each of firecap, bloodleaf, and snaptail reed.
---
Join on the discord link in video buddy 👍
---
Xbox as well - lvl 24. Same screen name - let me know if you ever want to join up. I am using Black Diamond currently / swap to Serrated Machete when i breaks and I am not near a weapons workbench
---
What’s your GT? I want to see your shop.
---
Nobody can ever get back to the past. TT
---
It goes green like you can place it half deep into a concrete foundation...lol
---
You’d think this would be an easy fix but here we are months later and nothing...
---
Not really, because stash space Is the only really límited thing Is this game.
---
Yep. Just let me know when you're on and, if I'm on or getting on, I'll make you one.
---
Alright then. Hahah
---
All the humans around are from the same vault. Literally same team. All the people selected are professionals.. they would just go raider.
---
Starting my second character - player vending really changed the way new players explore. You no longer have to walk to places in the quests. You can piggy back off players who are vending - fast travel. Kinda takes the joy out of it
---
Same person who took everything takes 100+ ketchup packs from fast food places because their free and doesn’t use them...lol
---
TY!
---
I have a lot of free ammo in my vending machine. I only charge 1c each for 5,56, .45, .308 and shells. Everything else is free. It's intended for low levels and people running a niche build but the results are not encouraging. 9/10 times the free stuff doesn't get touched and then somebody comes along and takes everything even though he can't possibly use it or even sell it
---
That's how it works RIGHT NOW. I shoot you, now you can initiate combat by shooting me or not. Unless you shoot me back, I can't do anything to you. Now, if you do shoot back, you have the advanatge of already aiming and firing at me, meaning I will most likely lose this engagement because of the PVP mechanics as your first shot initiates and the second does full damage. It's been this way since the beginning. 
---
And that's why I brought up your level from the beginning. If you dont PVP in this game, you probably don't understand how it works to begin with, should you really be suggesting thing that you dont know anything about to begin with. That's why we have the state of PVP that we do.
---
The third vault raid mission “washout” is a great acid farm on novice difficulty due to all the insects parts giving acid and crickets giving waste acid
---
I see you rifle and raise you hysterical laughter over the mic as you spend those precious bullets and achieve nothing.
---
I built my camp on a acid node now I get so much lead from the lucky hole and now have tons of acid I have started selling it, ppl snap it up as fast as I can put it in my vendors
---
That is a good idea. As a Raider I think I will do this so others can raid my bot for goodies. I will do this all month. I thank you for the inspiration.
---
I’m something like this:

---
Don’t bother prime on the western - it reduces the damage ... might come out ahead on the SBQ - but again, I’m mostly using a plasma flamer pistol on the queen.
---
Really need this to be upvoted a lot.  I am the quintessential lone wanderer with ADHD.  Anyone trying to follow me will quickly grow tired of it.  However, perk sharing can be hugely OP.  Wish more people would just group and go about their own business.  Plus it’s more fast travel spots!
---
Omg I just found it! Its buble gum bear looking at pandas butt! 
---
Best

---
EVER!
---
Thanks dude!
---
No pacifist mode on me or opponent. I usually notice it against actual PVPers. We get a little conversation in at the start of the fight and then it cuts me out on consecutive respawns. It sucks. I would like to wish the opponent a good fight, no hard feelings, but cannot.
---
Intermittent fasting.
---
Mee too!
---
My question is did colored pictures ever become a thing in the fallout universe?
---
You know what it's like when half a server turns up to fight the queen? **Everything** was like that. Only we had pipe pistols and patchy leather armour.
---
The vault was packed with people running around with their mics on (it auto turned on your mic in those days - there was no push to talk). People were asking each other what to do and searching for things before they left the vault.
---
The main quest leads you to Flatwoods, so there was another big gathering around the church and vendor while people worked out what to do.
---
Imagine everybody learning together and progressing through the main quest at roughly the same time.
---
It. Was. Brilliant.
---
World of warcraft has it to, the game mails you boss drops that you missed.
---
Pretty sure I have a couple, I’ll check. I’m running weightless Scout. I can also make it ultra-lightweight for bonus AP if you need that.
---
Lol. “Can I get some ketchup packets too?” Receives 4. “A few more please.” Receives 4 more.  “A few more please.” Etc...etc.... until 100. Lol. McDonald’s free coffee days, “Id like 100 small coffees please. And milk and sugar for each one too.” Lol.
---
it's part of the signs and letters plan cost about 10k at robot vendor
---
Most of the time I log on (xbox), everyone is a level 76 or higher. Meaning people mostly already have what they need and more rarely do I see lower levels. If wastelanders doesn't give this game a reboot, it might be time to shelf the game if you're a merch character.
---
10k?? Damn... Does it drop as wel?
---
Good for you1  Did you get to share in the drops for killing the SBQ?
---
Yep, been happening off and on to me for a while.
---
Probably most people font notice thats free when its mixed in with everything else.  Try putting a machine and label it with neon letters that everything is free, I bet you see it disappear a lot more often.
---
Try taking the perk card off, server hop then put it back on.
---
For me its 100% noticeable, i swap it out for Fireproof when taking on scorch beasts, and it doesnt take long before i get crippled
---
Thank god that was only a dream.
---
I think he means the legendary attributes on weapons and armor that reduce weight. I’ve got a few that reduce weights of all melee weapons, junk items etc.
---
Only what I use and need, I am always pushing the storage limits to keep my Vendors well stocked.
---
Yes, that is the gun I was referring to.
---
Haha I will. I’m at work rn. But thank you.
---
This just started for me yesterday... already annoyed to death!!
---
Ive seen it once
---
Was thinking same
---
Im the same way. If i see scrip level legendaries for cheap I always buy them. My rule is usually 600 caps or less for 3 star, 100 caps or less for 2 star. I dont buy the one star stuff.
---
Really? Man that would be so cool. I hat it when you do a horde event but can't get to the legend fast enough after killing it and boom, bodies fly. I've taylored my attacks to aim for non legends first so it's the last standing but with gun Fu it's not always easy.
---
What do you mean? Delayed pop up or something else?
---
If your turrets were placed on objects, store the object to have the turret stored. If you did not place them on things, you must move your camp to have it stored. This is a glitch and you did nothing to cause it.
---
Scrap whatever the turrets were placed on. They SHOULD appear under the stored tab (not always though). At the absolute worst, you may have to move and rebuild. It sucks but I'm speaking from experience. 
---
In the future, place the turrets on a rug or stash box or table...anything so you're not scrapping your buildings.
---
I'd avoid it, sounds like trap base
---
Well yeah, the Curator took it to dig up the bodies and the Mayor's budget in Grafton is maxed thanks to those filthy protesters, he just can't afford a second one.
---
Same has happened to me. 2 of my missile launchers are gone but the connecting wires are still there.
---
clownshoes
---
I had this issue during the first meat week, the way to fix it, was to place the turret on a roof piece in the first place.
---
Then store the roof piece if the turret disappeared, then replace both from the stored tab
---
Weight limits might also play into this
---
They should give me 5 more characters! :) I’d be very happy haha
---
yea i beleive it can rarely drop from taking over workshops
---
Or just give the owner a pop up to relinquish the workshop or defend the workshop. If you relinquish it no pvp if you chose to defend then you except pvp.
---
Don't forget that Formula-P increases your charisma by +5
---
sweet, i'll add you when i get home, or you can feel free to add me. screen name is TransGaymerJ. I'm using a modded Black Diamond currently, but it's a level 10 so it's just not cutting it for me anymore.
---
I think the baggage claim desk at Whitesprings would be perfect for this. A nice Protectron junk collector from Whitesprings noticed you killed an enemy but did not loot it and brought the useful loot along for you.
---
Do you mean random scorchbeasts flopping out of the air in front of you? Then yes. It's happened to me half a dozen times now.
---
If I think I can turn a profit on it, I'll grab it. I found 5000 5mm ammo for free, grabbed it and threw it in my vendor for 1 cap. I've also found unwanted junk for free, took it and re sold it for 1 cap a piece. I guess it depends on what it is.
---
High levels do that because they're bored and caps to travel are nothing lol. If this game wasn't so ungodly repetitive and sometimes boring those higher levels would be grinding for something. Instead the only interesting thing left to do is pvp. We already know where everything spawns. Already killed everything high level. The only left is pvp for shits and grin.
---
I said long ago. Make the meat piles, Robot metal piles and all the others glow colour X after 15-30 seconds. No matter where they are on the map.
---
I pvped recently havent in a long time only to get destroyed in 3  shots while my dragon did maybe have a bar of health a handmade doin thst much damage over my dragon is dumb
---
I find I reliably get 5 or more bloatfly glands from looting the meat bags at huntersville, so you only have to remember not-to-scrap-all-junk a few times. Still, either takes two real-days for the meat bags to repopulate or lots of in-game time finding them elsewhere.
---
I started a new character last week. Role-playing an old man who has a little shack down from the Overseer camp. He sells only junk and his only weapon is a walking cane.
---
Haha!
---
What the fuck?
---
I've left ammo free and random plans. Never had anyone take everything.
---
May be weapon, may be other gear, may be build. Post your build?
---
The rewards are treated like atom shop purchases. I have a couple stash boxes and I have seem power armor skins too but I am only a level 8 so not much to go off of from experience.
---
Too bad the pve crowd cried about survival until it was removed. Expect more workshop raids because everyone I know on survival is planning to raid every workshop now.
---
Nice find!
---
I had 2 yesterday 1 crate fallowed me from morgan town airport . Then when i was struck by a exploding car i became engulfed in flames that refused to disapate.but hey weren't giving me any bamage.
---
If you are on PS I’ll build you one hahah :)
---
Edit: unless you don’t even play this game, then I’d just like to thank you for stopping by &lt;3
---
Yeah gun Fu is really really awesome most of the time but then there some instances where you just really really wish that you had remembered to turn it off. Especially like the scorch beast Queen or encrypted
---
Once she's landed, the SBQ can be downed in 3-5 hits by a single player with a meathook and sneak.
---
It'd be interesting to throw tormentor, an explosive bloodied shotty and vats wing-strikes into the same toon (you wouldn't have shotgun perks, but who cares) to see if you could reliable land her solo before the old meathook in the butt.
---
EDIT: And yes, the adds would be a niusance.
---
What’s your build / end-state aiming to be?
---
The last character I leveled I went and made a set of fully modified Fixer rifles for use at 20, 30, 40, 50. I pretty much only used those, and it was glorious. I also had a instigating hunting rifle I used for sniping.
---
You can’t unlock the base weapon - but you can learn most of the mods by scrapping.
---
You’ll need to find the plans for the base weapon to craft a base weapon.
---
Is this your first character?
---
I did the same and made it to level 15 so far. The bugs have reduced drastically for me but as for the story line it’s still the same.
---
Ah. Thanks. Someone in my discord was telling me there’s is/was a laser gun skin and to go get it. But I didn’t have a clue.
---
Crouch. Chameleon armor. Berry mentats.  You are now in the top 5% in combat effectiveness.  If the French Canadian greifers are after you, you might need to use a stealth boy.  That's about it.  Winning pvp is moreso strategy and vats than skill.  Brain power wins.
---
I want that shiny red helmet.
---
Or if you're level 30 and it's a level 150. 
---
Like I was already running away dude, I'm done with the workshop, just take it.
---
Do you mean it's bloodied with a fireman or prime receiver, or are you saying it's Bloodied and Zealot's?
---
Oh ok, I thought I missed an announcement.
---
The problem with the reduced weight effect is that it doesn't work for the entire weapon's weight, just its base weight without modifiers, so it's mostly for heavy weapons.
---
Oh dude I so found it! Its frwkinf hilarious!
---
I feel bad for people that missed the beta because they'll never know how bad the servers were back then.
---
For 25 years they've known no deathly hunger or thirst. They've known no lethal threat, either physical or existential.  They've forgotten facing the harsh heat of summer and cold of winter, sequestered in their vault, shielded from the sun and snow. 
---
Losing all that, and being on your own can make people behave in remarkably new ways when their very life is on the line.   The rich folks at the ski lanes did it. Why wouldn't our pros have some within their ranks who would behave the same way?  It's also entirely possible Vault Tec chose some who they suspected would do so after reclamation day.
---
Talons has bleed effect too I think.
---
RustyNix207. At the moment it's just mags as we went on a bender for them and kinda want the room in the stash now
---
Don't fast travel to defend a workshop or respawn at your workshop.  It's a static spawn where you will be easily spotted and killed.  Go somewhere nearby and sneak in.  Use berry mentats if you are vs someone smart enough to sneak or use chameleon/stealth boy.
---
sounds good, any large content additions?
---
Nah, just take what I need/use.
---
I struggle with this when I see super cheap serums. I can sell them to vendors for well over $400 so when I see them for $250 or less it's mighty tempting to buy them out and turn a huge profit, especially because they weigh so little.
---
You should share a screenshot of your conversation with the post office or Bethesda if you can. It seems really strange that a mail carrier would just throw away a package that couldn’t be delivered. In any case upvote for visibility. Maybe someone will help make this right.
---
Schrodinger's bag, which is simultaneously very important and not very important to you. Interesting quantum experiment.
---
You can also bash things with it ...
---
Vault 76 isn’t a test vault of any sort what so ever (explained in the game) 
---
All the dwellers have CAMP and training to get food and water- they are not run of the mill survivors randomly picked... hell they went to vault tech university lol
---
I'm on ps4, I can help you out.
---
I had that too, and dead Brahmin all over the place
---
Large content addition coming out at around november, its called the Wastelanders, may be fo76 last hope to redeem themselves :)
---
I killed 76 with my crossbow in a couple of hours to get the challenge atoms... And I wasn't even looking. I just pulled out the crossbow whenever I saw one. As you say, they are everywhere!
---
What platform are you on? I have an extra one of these plans. I'm on PS4
---
Pc unfortunately.
---
Fought it out this morning with a player.  I admired his or her tenacity but you were outgunned big time yet kept coming back and back to die.   6 times in a row then I got some cores and left. 
---
Also - when I claimed it I did not fire upon the person - they fired at me first.  I would have let them escape without issue but nope.  And I gave them plenty of notice with the PvP emote.
---
Never said it was a test vault. That's a straw man argument. 
---
Being a cut throat was a common trait among a lot of the powerful people pre-war.  I don't see any reason why Vault Tec wouldn't see them as essential within the vault and select some candidates specifically for this trait.  Getting on the roster to the vault was likely competitive as well, further increasing the odds such candidates would be chosen.
---
Ok. Server hop  vendor bot Phoenix at the Watoga Shopping plaza. It will spawn in his inventory. You may only have to server hop twice. You might have to server hop for 3 days. Just depends on how lucky you get.
---
Search for Nuclear winter rewards.  Now is a good time to play as there are some bonus cosmetics you can unlock.
---
The main cosmetics are account based so you only have to earn once, but progress is per character so you have to focus.
---
I'm looking too, if you're still feeling generous. I'm on PS4
---
You shouldn't need to mod a weapon for it to be effective, it should come with an effect by default and the mods should allow you to swap away from that default effect. The syringer does nothing without mods, which shouldn't be the case at all.
---
I know, I mentioned that it my post.
---
That's actually pretty great!
---
Yep.  I took one today and got sniped by two other lvl 200s hiding.  The owner was lvl 150.  I’m lvl 247 solo.  
---
You’re really going to hide with a 3-1 player ratio in your favor?
---
I won't charge you caps but I'll trade it for something I could use if that's fair.
---
Some mags are great! Players should read up on what they do... I like quite a few of the perks you get!
---
Is this in the US?  Seems very odd that the post office would contact bethesda about your bag...  if its undeliverable, it should have been returned to the original sender
---
I found a camp last night that had a vending machine with everything set to 0, with a sign above it saying "Take what you need, leave what you don't" I thought it was so cool! I just grabbed the canned dog food cause I was running low on food, left everything else. Thought it was super cool :)
---
 What are you looking for?
---
Since they removed bottle cap mines i think the paper bag should be re skinned to those.
---
Happened to me today. kept freaking me out it even followed me inside a building and blocked my way
---
Similar thing happened to me, I ended up removing most of the walls and floor to sort it out. Pain in ass.
---
Yea. I removed basically everything and it still didn’t work.
---
I know that Rose's syringer does the buff an then debuff thing, but the normal syringer with no mods has no effects and only does a damage of 1. I also wasn't sure if finishing it off with my primary weapon after hitting it with a syringer would count for the challenge.
---
I've been doing well every day usually for sales. My camp is in the mire so one thing I do a lot is drop a nuke so my camp is right by the blast radius. Players then use my camp as a pit stop for the blast zone. The blast zone area around me generates a lot of violet and crimson flux.
---
Depends on your build.
---
Bloodied / Instigating / Furious / Junkies are likely the most sought after ... two shot maybe.
---
Faster Fire / Explosive / VATS crit / Aim Damage ... those would be solid too
---
Reduced Weight / VATS ... or maybe an attribute ... those would be decent thirds
---
Of course, assemble as you need / use for your build ...
---
Yeah, which is why it would never happen.
---
Acid, lead, gunpowder.
---
The metal lunchboxes would be great. And then they could re-introduce bottlecap mines 😂 “a surprise in every box”
---
Any amount of any of those items will work for me.
---
If you haven't got much camp wise then maybe move your camp a foot to the left. Unless anyone else has a better idea?
---
Based on what. Has anyone from Bethesda even acknowledged this?
---
Undeliverable packages can be marked to be disposed of vs forcing the company to pay for return postage. This is a default for a lot of commercial shipments. The post office didn’t call Bethesda and ask it was just what was in the system.
---
That's what I thought, like I said in my post, we brought it down with other weapons and only used the syringer to deal the finishing "blow", but it was still more like 30 finishing blows. Any further attacks from our other means would have just killed it, but that wouldn't have counted for the challenge.
---
Which pic we talking about? I'm OCD about stuff like that as well so I want to see what you're referring to lol
---
I feel like a lot of people are salty. It clearly says in the message before taking a workshop BEWARE this can initiate PVP.  It’s been in the game since beta I just don’t get how people aren’t used to it yet &amp; still complaining. A lot of us don’t want a sims styled game which is fallout 76 without PVP. I can understand if some asshat is running around grieving you while you’re outside PVP areas, But with workshops it clearly tells you it’s fair game.
---
Go to https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/. And there it is in the front page. The pop up thingie when you enter the site. Dont know how to add pictures  to these posts
---
Also always check your ammo inventory for missiles, nukes, and grenades. If you don't use them drop them. Youd be surprised how fast those add up if you're doing a lot of events. Also check for unsmelted ore in your misc tab. Smelt it or drop it.
---
Funny... that seems too close to reality for me.
---
When the whole duffle kerfuffle occurred and Bethesda agreed to provide the actual canvas bags the recipients had to input personal info shipping address etc.
---

---
You did just fine :) we can't add pics to a post. Only links as you have done.
---
Sounds like you met my ex girlfriend
---
Same, will have it on day 1
---
The pic where he has a shovel slung over his shoulder?
---
that would be amazing if they did a seasonal thing in this game, 11/10 I would love it
---
I'd love to see this lit up at night in the game. Jack tell scary stories, like at campfire tails and the loot be Halloween costumes and candy. Then everyone would be doing the quest in different costumes.
---
Yeah that one 👍
---
I have gotten them consistently from deathclaws (most rare of all), super mutant behemoths, and Scorchbeasts (especially the queen). I have gotten several this way, but never as a world item, only drops...so no help confirming there.
---
I guess so, costs me 60 dollars to take the family to dinner. More than $30 to go watch a movie and that's only 2 hours of enjoyment. I'd say the game was worth more than $60 since I've played over 600 hours.
---
Cut out the carbs
---
When you get a supply drop and clean it out then walk off it will keep spawning  behind you no matter how far you go. It even spawned inside a building for me blocking my way
---
 I've got this stuff.   When will you be on?
---
Yeah he looks a little different. The facial expression isn't one of the ones you usually see on him. His hair looks different to me as well. Could just be me though. It does look a little different than the vault boys usually do to me though.
---
Watoga HS during Monster Mash.  Got 5 Legendaries in one run earlier this week.
---
I cant see them telling the post office to throw it away. Hard to believe. Really.
---
why didnt you get your mail forwarded..?
---
An hour approximately. I'm doing some work on the PC that I need to let finish uploading or my net wont let me game while that's uploading.
---
Thats my point. It kinda looks cheap. Not like the older character photos
---
This has been proven wrong.. The servers were stable when people did the unlimited stash glitch.
---
killing people at workshops is not trolling...
---
The only way to answer that is to try the game yourself. You can ask 1000 people this question and you'll get 1000 variedanswers. Try it out. You might be surprised! If you're on PS4 I can get you some materials to survive your first severe level ups if youd like.
---
Maybe. I remember when battle coat came out, for a week everyone was wearing one. Now I rarely see anyone wearing it.
---
i haven't injured a limb since taking all 3 levels
---
&gt; boycott workshop till they fix it
---
workshops arent broken
---
Post an example.
---
Its pretty funny that any negative criticism is passed off as just hate.
---
Maybe, just maybe, disgrunted players are vocal about it because they want the game to be and do better, ever thought about that? Then theres the community,  who take utility items and them selling weapons on the atomic shop when they said it was cosmetic only, and they defend that shit. Whats not to hate? Why can't the community understand thats paving the way for way uglier stuff?
---
The game is riddled with bugs and they still go "I've never seen it". 1 year into the game and still no real endgame content, but they'll tell you the game is 10000x better now.
---
Im ok with people having fun with it, but im not ok with the assholes that shut down any criticism and put a "hate" sticker on it. Bethesda is a multi billion dollar company, we deserve better than all the lies they give us.
---
Self proclaimed "best online community" my ass, especially here.
---
Case in point, the only comments here that are actually addressing your question are all at the bottom ;)
---
It does, but I stupidly for some reason didn’t equate that with not getting to shoot back before someone can kill me. There was nothing unfair about it, it’s easily avoidable, but it still annoyed me, and I still think the idea from my edit would be cool. Now I’m just gonna do the obvious and not take the workshops anymore.
---
I’d love that. Hopefully they introduce the Zetans to Appalachia in the form of an event or quest, and the blaster plans and mods can drop from that.
---
I'm sure it's not always the same artist drawing these illustrations. Plus I believe it's a different division of Bethesda doing this game.
---
Probably using a bot to log into games and stand around is your best bet.
---
Yeah it’s really stupid to suggest PvP is griefing especially as it relates to workshops.  To me, teams of people with top level weapons and armor that lure you in to kill you is a bit much but hey it’s part of the game.  I take a shop and it’s pretty likely someone will engage me.  
---
You don’t like it?  Stay away from shops!
---
Ok.  I might be able to get on then
---
This^^
---
I havent played for so so so long, i think i was lv 45 or something. I could continue on that character but its been so long im not sure if i should just start over or not...
---
ah nvm xbox here i have a few of the masks not any of the "rare" ones but i saved a bunch from  Fasnacht to sell they sell decently well especially to new people
---
The camp budget needs to be increased also but they won't do that probably because of the Xbox and PS4 limitations :/
---
If somone takes your workshop find their camp location and nuke it. If they move their camp nuke it again. Nuking the workshop itself works sometimes as well because they don't want the hassle of defending it in a blast zone.
---
When there was no meta. Just people feeling cool. All levels 10-40 for most of the time. 
---
We just wandered around building, crafting, meeting new people.
---
My favorite memory is walking towards the Charleston AMS or sumn like that during the BETA. Basically I had to go by a farm. I hit a scarecrow and it made me wanter for some reason. I continue and then walk under this bridge. On top is a guy with a rifle who aims at me and asks a question.
---
"give me one good reason not to shoot you"
---
I look at him and tell him "i don't have one"
---
He put the rifle down and said "I admire the honesty".
---
We teamed up and wandered to Charleston before he split east and I continued south. Never met him again.
---
If you are an accidentally wanted level 13 in fo76 now, a level 304 with a quad explosive ffr tesla canon or some shit will show up and merc you before taking your junk, and tea bagging your ass. It's BS.
---
Got to get those deep pocketed mods for your armor. There's 40 pounds right there. Plus 60 pounds with a backpack.
---
So there's 100 pounds of extra space without using perks.
---
I'll be around all weekend on the game so just message me if you're on to see if I'm on.
---
Yeah it needs to have a more negative effect, so it can be a strategic choice instead of essential.
---
The problem with Red Rocket is it’s so easy to sneak and hide and ambush.  The area is pretty expansive and you can gain a big advantage by waiting out at higher levels and sniping. 
---
That’s one I never go after for that very reason.
---
Munitions and Poseidon - those are two I frequent for obvious reasons (ammo and fusion cores)
---
I would say that from time to time, people do seem to leave "donations" of ammo and other things.  I don't know if it's linked to them having used the free machine, since by the time I arrive, all I see is a paper bag.
---
This game sneaks so many missles into my inventory....
---
How about a small compromise:  
---
Don't PV the forrest areas, aka, "Where nukes can't be dropped."  
---
These are generally low-level areas and it's a terribad thing for a new player to go through.  
---
Ash Heap, Cranberry Bog, etc? Open season. Go slaughter with impunity.  
---
But leave the safe zones alone. Ain't nobdy there looking for a fight.
---
Thank you! I've never played 76 - I don't even have the time to play New Vegas anymore - but I hope you're enjoying yourself. 
---
To be honest this was really just a silly username reference.
---
Well hopefully we’ll have the same thing for wastelanderes
---
Yeah. I get them a lot as event rewards.
---
It's an exotic weapon and you didn't bother to learn anything about it and decided it was garbage. You amaze me.
---
Does the perk lone wanderer still work while grouped but far far far away from the people?
---
i didnt get involved in the bag situation, but i did just move.  
---
where i live the mail forward is only active for 2 months from the date you apply for it.  so if he had sent bethesda the old address and never asked to change it, it could be missed if the production -&gt; shipping step outlasted the forwarding timeframe.
---
This is nothing short of amazing! Absolutely insane. My budget is spent and all I have to show is a vending barn and a pos house. PLUS... you didn’t shut the doors.
---
Yeah. Different studio is making it and maybe they have different guy/gal making assets like that.
---
Bad ass idea..... I’m in!
---
Just RP as Artem Lobov and you'll be good.
---
Don't think it's possible
---
Tbh I love doing a chameleon+crossbow combo if I can find them
---
Pioneer scouts seems like it would be fun but is buggy so be warned.
---
Sheepsquatch is fun
---
Questline that gives you the ability to distill alcohol is silly and entertaining
---
Also you can fast travel free to community events, they pop up in a bulletin on your screen and are marked with an exclamation point on the map
---
All of these can be started at really anytime, idk if stated a new character is needed imo
---
It does not appear to from my experience.
---
Stalking supply drop.
---
It’s hilarious!
---
What is your psn name?
---
not exactly.  tune in Hunter/Hunted.
---
Very likely he's exploiting
---
The syringer is not a useless item. You can use it to farm legendary’s if you didn’t know. Also some items in nuke zones.
---
They will. The background video seems to change with every big DLC. We had the original back at launch, a new one for Wild Appalachia, and then another one for Nuclear Winter.
---
I am at PC but got one from one of the rooms at the Allegheny Asylum the other day.
---
are ppl not aware of hunter/hunted?
---
That would be great if you could help
---
You can't drop painted parts. The paint must be removed first
---
Probably some kind of exploit.  I've never heard of a legitimate shortcut that bypasses launch prep, and you're lucky if launch prep is done in 5 minutes these days.
---
Challenge them to do it. 😂
---
The greenhouse got a variant without the foundation so you can place it on floors
---
I would love this! Unfortunately I think we all know they would limit the skins to atomic shop🙁
---
ive never heard of it either, unless there is some sort of hack terminal you can hit to skip it.  might be something with the PA walk through doors exploit to get through some locked doors as well
---
imo 12-15 is decent especially considering the distance you need to travel.
---
There are a lot perks and effects but I think just managing inventory is more important. I only keep 10 grenades, and a small amount of each chem that I use. For junk, I bulk and sell whenever I get above 50-100. Always check ammo and misc tabs to drop anything you don't use. Inert flux weighs less than purified water too.
---
Post more lore!
---
I roleplay as a clown and I am hoping they make the thirst zapper obtainable some day.
---
I like the idea of having the Flatwoods Monster reliably drop one.  It only makes sense.
---
Wait, because I grew up not having everything given to me and actually having to work for things. Having to deal with my own problems and not cry to my parents to have them deal with issues I should have and did deal with on my own, I'm the ignorant one? It's obvious here who the ones are that grew up in a generation of things just given to them for participating in whatever they did. Your stupidity is beyond most kids these days and that's saying something.
---
I did the same to help low levels. I put up a vending machine for em
---
Well that's just it, I'm not somebody going after people in the forest. The point I continually try to make is the people that are pounding lvl 5s into the dirt at workshops are not the "survival" players everybody thinks they are. We didn't want anything to do with those ilk in survival either. The only difference was over there we could kill them anywhere and everywhere until they left. Shoot me in the forest in a manner that is clearly intentional and I will turn around and unload. 
---
Yes I'll jump in and contest a workshop when I'm in the mood to do it. I usually look for one with an empty health bar, owned by a reasonably high level player. I'll scope it out to see if they are actually using it. If it's not being used I contest. If it is being used most of the time I walk away. 
---
These are my principles though, and I have 0 expectation that anybody else will follow them. When I take a workshop and use it, I 100% expect a group of 4 to show up ready to steamroll me.
---
Should have made sure your mail was forwarded.
---
Ive found it best to specialise into Automatic Rifles and Explosives.
---
Its very rare that you get a nice clear sight line, that would be advantageous to Semi-Auto snipers, and PA is practically useless in NW
---
Seems like this is user error. The post office would automatically dispose of it after a given time.
---
It's not PvE players fault recipes &amp; plans are locked behind taking/defending workshops. If it wasn't for that I'd never, ever take a workshop because of the PvP.
---
Thats what I wanted to put on my free machines, but I ran outa camp budget. So just Free in neon letters.
---
I'm on xbox and also looking for anything that isn't that pedophile looking fasnacht man one. How much are you charging for some of the others? Maybe the soldier or owl.
---
Yeah, thought the same thing the first time I saw it. I think it's the smile and something about the hair that's not quite right. But it's still not as bad as the FO2 intro cinematic where there are two vault boys standing next to each other and both of them look like generic knock offs.
---
The Republic of Dav hears your request and politely declines it. 
---
Might wanna ask Gary tho.
---
Cool,  I'll check that out
---
Can't you track him with the personal computer tho?
---
How much are you willing to spend?  I can be on in about 2 hours and my username is: Maverick-Mann
---
Well they offered to show me how....but that could have been a bait. I nuked his camp twice so maybe he was just salty.
---
$20 less or a bunch of playera in flatwoods. I took the $20 less but you feel how you want.
---
Same as here TheLousyRaider
---
I posted a new video yesterday on the Sunday brothers, Jesus and Juan Diego; Free States members who survived the bombs and the fall of Harpers Ferry only to succumb to infighting between themselves and other survivors: https://youtu.be/Y1cANjiGzaw
---
I think making our characters legendary is gonna do this. Hopefully itll reset all quests too. Just not wipe our plans.
---
I know you can hack terminals to bypass the turrets and stuff but bypassing launch prep was a new claim for me. I think it has to be an exploit because I can't find anything anywhere on how to bypass launch prep.
---
thats the only thing i can think of as well, i dont remember seeing anything in there to let you bypass, and even a bugged launch where no enemys spawn even takes 2-3 min for those slow ass robits.
---
It does go up to 50. I have 3 I bought from player vendors over the course of the past couple months. Not sure if it drops like that or if I got some sketchy cracked version, but they're there.
---
here's what pvp types may not realize: 1) for ppl w/ maxed out Camps, building in workshops let you squeeze out more 'fun', 2) lets say you're playing, having a good time and then (something) says stop, start collecting 300 screws or kill 50 liberators, and it requires your IMMEDIATE attention.  you'd be pretty upset; similarly forcing pve'rs into pvp on your schedule will result in shitty experience for victim (as opposed to mutual combatant), 3) tune into hunter/hunted.  unless you're a no-good, backstabbin, yellow-bellied, measly skunk who likes to ambush randos, 4) likewise, only claim on workshops if you intend to keep it (and therefore expose yourself to future assaults)  its all well and good to snipe from the shadows, but raise the flag and defend it if u really want to defend/execute those principles
---
Or is it Devs?
---
Well I have 25k and am happy to pay that
---
yea i have toothy man mask , soldier , and giant mask i charge 600 caps
---
edit : the owls sold out long ago
---
Thanks for the info, I also wanted to start a new character cause my old character was from the beta and kinda messed up
---
Send me a request.
---
Bethesda on Reddit: “Thanks for the heads up on this bug, we will get this over to the team to get it fixed”
---
Bethesda in office: “Fuck that wall mounted container you guys can get another creation club item from FO4 ported over to the atomic shop for 800 atoms I got better shit to do.”
---
Yes. DEVeloperS
---
I took intel initially to hack and craft/upgrade star weapons. Turned out the system for them was far shittier and oh so random. I was hoping you’d get a lvl 1 star and through heavy amounts of rare Matt’s you could upgrade it. He’ll even the mods are so limited and pointless.
---
I had a similar experience last night
---
Ok I’ll be on in half an hour is that cool?
---
I can earn a few hundred atoms a week If I go all out so the prices are not super annoying to me right now. Also I have just given up on keeping up with the suer mansion camps. 
---
However, I remember having less time to play and every limited time offer or object ‘leaving the vault’ pissing me off.
---
I compared your whining to a 5 year old, I have no idea about your general mental state. 
---
When acting like a child who looses a game, be prepared to be treated like one.
---
If workshops should be finders keepers until they logg of without being contested, well yeah, thats risk free gameplay. 
---
No risk, no challenge... No big leap really, just a logic consequence...
---
Maybe you should reconsider if this is the game for you, if this experience has affected you so negatively...
---
I am dyslexic, so unless I look it up first, I make such mistakes, thanks to pointing it out...
---
I want to be able to TP peoples bases...
---
I have that one at r3 and I have to sell them because I have so many!
---
It ain't anything fancy like that. I know a guy that used to just clip through walls via glitch and head straight to final room then start that 5 robot thing. Don't know if it's patched but I doubt it cause it Bethesda
---
Also check your misc tab for Gunpowder. It weighs a lot and it's not in an obvious place. It's valuable, so don't dump it.
---
Now that's what I call pent up rage
---
My solo best time is about 12-15 minutes. 
---
Has to be an exploit. Damn launch prep alone takes too long.
---
The one that reduces the weight of power armor is completely useless, because all PA parts should be on a frame (10 lbs full of parts).
---
Dude dont worry, i dont think they have the manpower to make real choice and consequences, all the special checks will be for extra exposition.
---
Oh, well thats reassuring. Thanks for the info!
---
1bolstering piece and 1 poison resistance helps with the deaths. Little less dmg for a lot less loading 😬
---
Thanks I guess I misremembered.
---
Right! Dude some one told me about the ones at Central Train Yard on the roof! 1 bear looking at another's butt with a magnifying glass! I just saw it. Its pretty hilarious!
---
Full auto:
---
Ground pounder
---
Master Commando
---
Tank killer
---
Tenderizer
---
Pharma farma / longshot / Demo expert
---
Bloody mess
---
I can pick up an 10 SMG/Auto Combat rifle from blue chests, subs/auto assault ftom yellow, and lasers/handmades from orange crates.
---
Crevasse dam, Dyer Chemical, Harpers Ferry, The Burroughs, Watoga Municpal, Huntersville, West Tek, Satellite Array 
---
That’s my loop. 
---
I don’t even mess with WS anymore.
---
Your missing a lot of dmg
---
How about some normal wallpaper also....
---
Not stuff that looks like it belongs in a mental hospital?
---
Yeah I just talk about the people that doesn't like the people who like fallout 76, the people that defend Bethesda lies, issues and bugs doesn't want to see starfield or TES6 in a good state, everyone needs limits.
---
I agree with you friend, if we don't understand what is good for the development of this game we won't see year 2 with people no more.
---
Should be fine.
---
When I had one I'd say maybe 80% of people took nothing, 15% took what they needed, and 5% took everything. But this was a while ago, when vending was still a bit novel.
---
I don't know how far you moved but would you have been able to collect it from the post office? Where I live I think we have at least 3 weeks to collect parcels that aren't delivered.
---
I would if the stuff was basically needed but otherwise I would just pick and choose what I needed
---
I wonder if the hinted at Halloween event will take place here in game. That part of the map doesn't get much love.
---
I do nore than enough with stealth crits, and my armor piercing.  I actually hit for damn near 1.2k with a crit, head smack. I don't need the glass cannon cheese of the bloody players, when I get survivability, and still do damn fine damage.
---
The apartment made me fill out a mail forwarding form before we left and yet they refused delivery.
---
Being able to scrap it back into its components so we can make the caliber we need would be great.
---
Well, there’s been a handful of bugs, returned exploits, and problems. 
---
For improvements, there’s free fast travel to some events. Dailies seem to more consistently reset.  You can now see how many more mods you can unlock for an item.  Survival servers have come and gone. Nuclear winter has been around and switched maps.  
---
I play most days, and I’ve mixed in a few games during the lash year, but I’m struggling to think of other big changes that have made it better.
---
You can now, yes. This was made before they implemented that as an option.
---
The converted munitions factory should have an ammo converter that you can use once you take control of the workshop.
---
Dense torso mod negates explosive damage and protects against scorch beast screams. If you're a power armor user get the fireproof perk. Does almost the same thing.
---
They’ve made the game worse if you like PvP
---
Ah... True. Thanks. Do we know when wastelanders it's coming?
---
I want a vault based version of timed pvp free for all with respawns like Quake. I’m not a fan of queues and wait times for battle royales.
---
I work for the post office. The customer has to turn in their own form, not the apartment.
---
Are you looking for the paint that was also included in the special edition of the game?
---
If so I’ve seen it on sale for $15 before.
---
Sound a little offended sorry lol. I was just noticing a few perk cards missing that add add tons of dmg. That don’t sacrifice any health. Stranger in numbers amplifies all mutations(talons, scaly skin) bloody mess amplifies ALL dmg from all forms. Just trying to help.
---
I haven’t spent much time looking. IMO it’s better delayed and not disappointing for anyone on the fence.
---
It got good, then bad, then good bad, then bad bad, then bad good, now it got good again, with minor bad.
---
Someone at the post office took your bag. Someone local to me had this very thing happen. Luckily for him he bowls with a supervisor and was told.
---
Pain Train also works.
---
Thanks. How do I send you a request, haven’t done that before
---
I’m not sure that it was with the SE, I know it was in the shop before I started playing and w as wondering if I’ll still be able to get it
---
Got most of them...
---
On PS4
---
Basic masks also spawn at the asylum. The man mask was there my last trip. 
---
We’re like 2 months out. Maybe try to save some caps up and move them to an alt with a friend’s help so you can get them when prices are lower.
---
Hey Faz. I don’t see a link anywhere... can you post it? Is this bones group or a different one?
---
I’ve run across this guy several times on different servers. He’s also a strong player with a good build.
---
theres only 24 people per server. you only will get most 1 or 2 players queue for hunter v hunted. so the quest dosent start . i asume you dont play the game . since you dont seem to see what the problem is.
---
That was patched a while ago. Perhaps there is a new variation of this glitch.
---
Try the Federal Reserval workshop
---
I also think the Flatwoods monster should drop legendary versions, or upgrades to make the damage like 3x better. But limit these only to him, so finding and fighting one is still rare and worthwhile
---
Or make an airport in one distant corner of the map to let it be a cap sink to get to.
---
Bones old one mate. https://discord.gg/9aDRTur
---
I got to do this quest recently except there was no shovel. I heard about another shovel nearby so I spent another half an hour looking for it, found it, went back to the grave only to discover I couldn't use it because the shovel was level 25 and me a measly 11. Thanks for the heads up, Mayor.
---
Same.  Play Time will do the same thing as yours.  Pop constantly but require relogs after the 1st completion.
---
Queen of the Hunt I'm having same issue as other people, it won't complete with the splash screen.  I've tried running away, rejecting, etc..
---
Cascades of 5 empty supply drops. The only guaranteed way to make this happen for me is looting at Morgantown airport from Collision Course.
---
I added
---
That would spice things up big time.
---
Cool man. Glad it’s still going strong.
---
Holy shit that is tragic
---
Run it
---
It all started for me after looting about 7 supply drops at the airport, that might actually be the issue
---
It depends. 
---
I wouldn’t take stuff I don’t use. Rubber, asbestos, 10mm rounds, explosive ammo, are things I would leave. 
---
Unless you talk to the person there’s no way to know if they’re doing it for charity or inventory space, so if I could take it for use, I’d do it every time.
---
 The costume can be crafted at an armor station, the knife is a skin for a machete and the kits should be under the misc tab in your inventory.
---
Cant skip launch prep. You can skip the mainframe cores tho
---
Oh nice idea. Hadn't even though of a unique costume idea. Was just going to wear my witch outfit
---
I feel like your comment is the only reason this thread is getting upvoted.
---
The OP is on some kind of weird witch hunt (probably against a single player who bruised their ego) and you can see this emerge as they reply.
---
Consider downvoting, people. Not the comment I replied to, but the thread.
---
For crit challenges I usually do low levels because it’s easy. Level won’t matter.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/l7MtafK](https://imgur.com/a/l7MtafK)
---
I'm level 101 but I have took down Scorched Beast Queen by myself using Legendary 2 Hunter's Light Machine Gun (lots of ammo) and All Rise for ground attacks. Took almost the whole time limit but got it done.
---
Ok
---
I'll give it a try thanks
---
Oh, send me a psn friend request.  Should of been more specific.
---
Cheating is not okay. "Naming and shaming" *a priori* is **also** not okay. Please find another way.
---
Psn?
---
Biggest change: Introduced Nuclear Winter, a Battle Royale mode which also generates XP and caps for your character in adventure mode and unlocks skins for weapons and armors as rewards as well as some furniture items for camps. This has now replaced Survival mode for PvP focus.
---
Biggest upcoming change: Wastelanders, in about a month or two.
---
My best discovery is a couple of bears that you can find at vault tech agricultural center, if you wonder why they're in THIS position, you can find of box of screws under them... Coincidence? I think not. 
---
https://youtu.be/jpsIU9YljfQ
---
Going to give this a try thanks
---
PvP can only happen if you hang around workshops. If you claim them, set up your extractors quickly and then leave. Also crouch before traveling to them so players don't notice the owner there. Don't go to the defense events either, they show up for other players and they can kill you during those if they opt out of the event so wait until it turns into a Retake quest, those only show up for you. This should minimize the PvP opportunity. Also don't fall for people who are trying to goad you into a fight in voice chat, talk to them right back. "Man you seem like you got anger issues, is everything alright irl?" lol upsets them every time. Last thing is don't fall for the Wanted bait, he could have some friends in his party that can then PvP you. Also speaking of friends, don't accept random invites, they can then hit someone else and then you're pvp enabled
---
It's pretty damn simple. How can I not get greifed at workshops.
---
My camp budget (like most peoples) is full.
---
I need blueprints to make structures and such for NW.
---
Workshops are my only option.
---
The waveform will only collapse and resolve when the observer takes responsibility for not following up.
---
There were patriotic paints in the Tricentenial edition that were also sold in the atom shop. Atom shop items might come back but I was thinking instead of waiting if you could find it on sale somewhere that would be faster.
---
I need to go there and build tho. To make blueprints for NW
---
You can make blueprints in your own camp tho
---
Ahh, he meant he's been doing more NW to get the donut paint. For this reason, he has been capturing workshops in adventure mode so he could blueprint buildings as to place them down in NW to use as defensive structures.
---
Shhhhh. Bethesda might be watching.
---
Like a lot of people (especially PvE builds, my budget us maxed
---
Ive played for about 6 months.
---
Whenever I took workshops, I made a stash box and a workbench at the boundary of the workshop.
---
So i could scrap up and depo my junk before i enter the boundary.
---
If your not interested in PVP, then do not use workshops.
---
This isnt an issue that needs to be fixed by Beth,  its an issue of people not reading properly before they proceed, then getting salty because of other players, playing the game as intended
---
Last time I played nuclear winter I had a good time but I was never getting full matches
---
Lmao
---
PvP is 2 level 90s fighting. Then thats like an irl fight.
---
Bullying is a lvl 250 using exploits to continuously kill a lvl 90 using his god tier gear. That's like irl beating up a defenseless person.
---
It can spawn at any level in the safe where it is normally. I’ve found a couple 20s and 50s myself, it seems random
---
Honestly? It's 15 minutes. Tell him to kick rocks.&gt;! I pick the lock and bypass the reactor, carry an explosive weapon for the security mainframe, keep 15 mainframe cores on-hand, hack turrets in the launch prep room if need be. No need to glitch through the floor (which was patched out.)!&lt;
---
Awesome.  I like also knowing that a workshop taken this way waists a griefer's , sorry "raiders" time that they could actually be off playing a PVP game they clearly don't have the skills for.
---
This checks out. Your ignorant to how good the game once was. You joined around the perfect time that people with no respect for how good the community was joined.
---
Makes sense now.
---
No problem!
---
Added!
---
Play late at night or early in the morning. Capture weird workshops like the junkyard. I regularly hold all the power plants to farm crazy fusion cores and hardly ever get harassed.
---
If you would like me to articulate a good argument please revert to my first comment where I stated everything that needs to be said on this subject.
---
You claim a workshop you open yourself up to PvP. It is not realistic in any way at all for you to expect anybody else to think the same way as you. To further illustrate this, I completely understand that you are not going to "see it my way." 
---
Don't worry plenty of people will be along to pat you on the back, give you a cookie and guide you to a safe space.
---
I believe it-respawning seems to be a persistent issue in this game
---
Im not going to argue this point any further with you, as your clearly not interested in listening and your not going to get any sympathy for opening yourself to pvp, then moaning about getting killed.
---
Good luck
---
[Dilute Meaning Of](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dilute%20into%20thinking)  
---
See the difference between delude and dilute is this:
---
To delude, one uses underhanded tactics to deceive, either oneself or another.
---
To dilute, one spreads oneself so thin, or perhaps thinks so narrowly, that they are unable to see reality.
---
How is it bullying to engage in PvP in a PvP area..?
---
Just curious, I am not much of a PvPer myself, but that is why I stay the hell away from workshops.
---
Wait that works for camps as well? Also im in the low 100s now. PvE only. I have a level 90 alt whos the one being shredded tryna do workshops. My main is basically as useless.
---
Shows ur at main menu
---
Omg! That is hilarious!
---
What you perceive as "griefing" is actually game mechanics. 
---
You are trying to do something that while possible is not what's intended.
---
So either live with it, or come up with a different plan.
---
Well this is the idea. They're doing it not for a fun fight, but to pick on low levels. Tell me how it's supposed to be a good experience to be killed a dozen times by someone 130 levels higher than you.
---
Nah man, it's fine, I prob came across as a dick myself. Got rid of it, and apologies :) I get it now, I just don't do the NW or workshop stuff :)
---
Wow, you really just kept on digging on this one huh?
---
I've seen 2 out of the 4! Where are the last 2 from? Location wise...? Btw Thank ya!
---
Treasure maps, mainly in Toxic Valley for Raider Power Armor.
---
 No, they got more important things like the 250  DR while reloading bug that strips away  our Prefixes.
---
Thanks, that more or less confirms my findings too. I think Enola's recordings probably are the closest thing to an actual 'target' we will need to kill, and we have no reason to think nuking Prime wouldn't do the job outright. I guess it's lucky that a lot of the 76 Dweller must be adventuring in the area and stop to watch the fireworks!
---
pvp at workshops isnt griefing...
---
Sleep and balance are more important daily challenges. You’ll be ok.
---
I remember leaving my vault room the same time as another person who was interested in taking their time with the BETA. We both just chatted about past fallout lore as we searched the vault reading letters and terminals. While other dwellers were eagerly sprinting out to explore Appalachia. It really did feel like we left the vault on reclamation day. Seeing the entire server all in one spot as the dots on the map slowly spread out to different regions. Some of us darted to complete the main quest,  others just chose a direction and went there. I wouldn't see that many of us in a single location again until I did my first scorched earth event. Ah the nostalgia
---
Beta was not a demo. You couldn't play it without buying the game or a beta key (not from Bethesda). And they made changes before release.
---
And you probably would participate a wastelanders beta? So what's the deal? They test it internally and make changes while it runs. Or they just call it Beta in the beginning, like nuclear winter.
---
I don't get your point due I would play it as early as possible, no matter how they call it
---
Thanks.  Guess I need to get back in the Tm game.  Last fews times I went through a coupe hundred maps per run and ain’t land one plan I didn’t know.  Do specials or perks card help this at all?
---
Noooooobs
---
I had a few from treasure maps. Best suggestion is make and scrap the weapon if you can get the plan.
---
I wish, and woukd like to be able to do it at our own camp.
---
Dude I love this game but no B. E. T. A  was a demo. It didn't give them enough time to fix any of the major issues before launch hence the rough launch. I don't care if I never get into a pts. I just want this game to succeed. Sorry if that offends you or makes you mad. But this game and more specifically wastelanders needs a pts. 76 can use a solid win. But either way not here to argue semantics over B. E. T. A  I just want the game to win and a pts will help assure that win.
---
I'll suggest patience, wait until November, wastelanders comes out there 
---
But now is good too, the community is beautiful and super nice to other players. At least in game.
---
I'll be there too for welcome you, if you are on ps4 😅
---
If you’re on XB, get in touch with u/bangshield for ammo.
---
Just a tip for #3. Do the side quests. The main quest will take you into areas that will overtake you. Don't bum rush it. For xp do public events, lesser events, claim workshops, do defend workshop quests. However, don't defend workshops if you notice people coming for you. Workshops engage you in PvP automatically. Once you level up, and flesh out your build then you can come back to the main quest.
---
So you had to work hard to be this stupid, got it
---
I've waited out a queue like twice, took maybe like ten to twenty tbh.
---
Ahh fasho, just give me an add them, psn: Xavier5249
---
I could guard you while you build and I can place down my prefabs so you can blueprint also.
---
I mean, everyone does have a point but at the same time,  its all about being efficient and concise with your time.
---
You so sure about that? Last I recall some numbskull planted a mininuke in my grow bed!
---
The bears are cute. The gnomes are sinister. Found one with a broken camera in the middle of nowhere. Followed his eye line and discovered the remains of a nude sunbather.
---
Good suggestion but probably not at all easy to implement considering how client/server code is usually handled in gaming and other software alike.
---
Thanks dude. I'm trying not to sound whiny but it hits the point where I just miss beta so much. No one would think of that. If anything high low level interactions were high levels dropping 20 stims or a low level legendary.
---
Ill add you.
---
No, me and a few friends did statistics on the maps since we have widely different Luck stats and nothing made any difference it seems, no perks seem to do any real help either. It is just pure RNG and which part of the maps the map is in. Raider stuff in the valley. Low level stuff in the Forest/Ash heap and standard PA plans in the divide, bog and more.
---
This I could get on board with. I’m fine with the workshops as they are, but the timer would definitely give someone who isn’t interested in PvP time to get out of there.
---
For farming without high expenses, get an instigating sledge, SS, Grognak, or fire ax. 
---
Sprint, power attack, sprint power attack, etc.  you may need 2 stims per visit of the populated parts.  Using the healing mutation means you get a breather twice outside before going in at west tek.
---
Ok first of all WHERE LOCATION PLEASE 
---
second of all ....omfg creepy! Lol!
---
I guess I didn't really take into account how hard it would be to implement, it just seemed like something that should've been there in the first place. Like, imho it feels like having the game queue you up before removing you would be a better option.
---
With my perks and mutations, outside of combat I regen 50hp a second or so.
---
I have a +1S ss vampires Grognaks axe but idk if thats any good.
---
Do you know how to efficiently make caps?
---
Well if it is consensual, which it is since you are in a PvP area freely, and you are both lvl 50+ it is all equal. Levels after lvl 50 have no real effect, more than choice and options. So, it is not really bullying. It is two characters, both lvl 50+ doing PvP in a PvP area. You don't like it? Don't go in.
---
Just buy it I loved fallout 4 and only just picked up 76 a couple of months ago and it feels like you're just continuing from 4
---
Understandable but you must realize at this point, due to lack of end game content and removal of survial mode, there's not a lot to do for those people, right? Once Wastelanders arrive, i'm sure it will go back to that time for a bit but still, you gotta adapt to be ready.
---
And sounds good.
---
That isn't an option. I need to go in. Ffs I've tried deleting the post and everything now. Sorry for wishing we could return to the non toxic days we had from like beta to 5 months ago.
---
Thanks
---
Does anyone have any stimpack diffusers?  I'm having a hard time finding them to complete the medic part.
---
I'm just killing them at range and moving on, same with scorch beasts no point checking loot.
---
STUPID FUCKING SCORCHBEASTS BLOWING UP MY CAMP AND KILLING ME JUST BECAUSE I WRECKED YOUR DUMBASS COUSIN IN THE FUCKING MIRE SUCH FUCKING BULLSHIT!!
---
Being very honest, not much has changed. There are some different event mechanics, the Purveyor and some bug fixes.
---
The next big change will be Wastelanders, and I think this is a fantastic time to start back in and get yourself set up for that :)
---
The liberators outside of 76 were my favorite batch of enemies to farm these challenges
---
I'm sorry.  I don't think you understand what I wrote. Maybe read it again?
---
1. [Maintenance log](https://bethesda.net/community/category/232/fallout-76?language%5B%5D=en) with links to patch notes
---
2. For storage, make sure you're not sitting on molerat teeth or bones, assaultron heads, deathclaw hands, etc. since they take up a fair amount of stash space. Scrap/bulk your things to make them easier to organize, and sell the bulked goods that you're not going to use. No reason to sit on 50 bulk leather if you're never going to use it. I tend to float at 7-8 bulk of whatever and sell the rest. For stimpacks, honestly, screw them. The penalty for death is so minimal in Adventure mode that if you die a few/many times in a big battle, no big deal. Hang onto them for special events where it might matter if you die, and the rest of the time, just die.
---
3. For quests take them up as they interest you. Some repeat daily, others appear more frequently at different spots on the map. It's very easy to get caught up in a grind loop in this game based on farming for resources or legendaries, try to avoid that for as long as possible.
---
For getting stronger it may be worth planning your full perk distribution ahead of time. Planners like [Nukes and Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) are useful for planning out your perk and SPECIAL point distribution, and generating a road map to get there. Also, if you haven't looked into mutations yet, do it, they are hugely beneficial. You'll want to put 2x into Starched Genes though before acquiring any mutations. The serums can be pretty easily sourced for 300-500 caps per at player vending machines, just gotta shop around.
---
Have fun!
---
The Survival mode was just removed and I've noticed more people trying to attack me. Pvp rates will go up but it wont always happen. Remain careful and you should be fine.
---
HAS ANYONE REALLY BEEN FAR EVEN AS DECIDED TO USE EVEN GO WANT TO DO LOOK MORE LIKE?
---
Making and selling mutation serums to vendors is the most efficient, but that requires a lot upfront. If you want to clear vendors with 0 cost, clear lucky hole mine over and over while wearing excavator PA. 
---
Have butchers bounty 3 equipped. Search everything you kill, even radroaches. Cook all the meat with super duper equipped, clear vendor. 
---
Smelt the lead yourself or sell to someone who makes ammo. If you’re on Xbox I can hook you up with an ammo guy that will buy the lead you farm.
---
Probably not that hard to check, but to initiate and hold that slot before you actually swap over is the issue I would rack my brain over. Once a slot opens up you still have to disconnect and make a new connection, at which point somebody else could connect and take that slot. 
---
Anything is possible, that's what I always tell my bosses. It's up to them to decide how much money they want to throw at something.
---
It's funny you think you could or even should be someone's dad. Your ignorance on the subject shows you should never procreate and if you do I feel sorry for your SO, because they'll be doing all the work disciplining your children and taking care of them.
---
Yeah, from threads I've seen its been bugged for well over a month
---
I found them at a player vendor’s camp. The other way to receive them is as a reward for completing project paradise, the arktos pharma mission
---
TLDR
---
Try being me with my camp right next to the cemetery.
---
Thank you
---
Skellyassassin. Feel free to lurk in my camp whenever. I'm level 98 and a junk vendor.
---
AND PEAS ARE GROSS! FUCK!
---
Please just fix the fusion/plasma cores. Let  us be able to combine to lower ones together. Or at least be able to pick which core we want to use. Instead of having five 20ish percent cores in .y inventory and constantly just putting my 100% cores in my guns.
---
How things used to be used does not really apply to the world now.
---
I WANT TO FUCK A SNALLYGASTER IN THE ASS.
---
FUCK THIS GAME FOR NOT HAVING EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA AS A LEGENDARY EFFECT OR MUTATION!
---
Can you see the difference between beating up a kid and fighting another person? Because if you can this shouldn't be hard to grasp.
---
I’ll check into it
---
I'm just saying that there are some good reasons to dislike this community.  There are some things that this community does that can get on someone's nerves.  Things like making posts thanking and praising Bethesda for acknowledging a problem in the game, not waiting to thank them for actually fixing it or being upset at Bethesda wondering why it was even a problem in the first place.  Or all the posts shitting on youtubers for disliking the game.  Or all the posts that start with "To the player that..." rather than just write their story like "Met a player today that...".  After the dozenth time it gets really cringy.
---
There are a lot of really derivative posts and they can range from being fanboyish to cringy.
---
Ok thanks man, I agree with you.
---
That's a good point,  but how do you propose going about getting the water up there? 
---
If you are going to bother with a pump you may as well just use the 6 million other containers laying about everywhere
---
I REALLY NEED LEAD, SO I TOOK OVER THIS WORKSHOP BY THE LAKEBED, CLOSE TO MY BASE. AS SOON AS I SET IT UP, SOME HIGH LEVEL TWATWEASLE SNIPED ME AND TOOK IT, JUST TO BOUNCE, WHICH ALLOWED ME TO RETAKE IT. AND THEN......AND THEN.....AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR OF LETTING IT COLLECT WHILE EXPLORING AND QUESTING, GRODDMANNED MAYTHERHUCKING GAME CRASHED AND I....LOST....PROLLY LAK....14? 15? LEADS?  MUGGAFUGGGASAHMBATCHING BARFTHEBUS!
---
I can bring the queen down solo, but the adds cause problems.  Two people 1 on the queen and one on the adds is great.
---
That is interesting; will try that out.  
---
Regarding blueprint budget: you can always blueprint parts of the structure and build them together later - it's pain in the ass, but it works.
---
ANYONE CAN’T REALLY EVEN BE SO CLOSE TO EVEN USE LOOK MORE LIKE! 
---
FUCK!!!
---
LIKE, MORE LOOK DO, TO WANT GO? EVEN USE TO DECIDE, AS EVEN FAR? BEEN REALLY, ANYONE HAS!
---
Ok I’ll be on in 15 mins
---
......FUHK YEAAAAAHHHHHH, ALL SEVEN HOLES FILLED, BIIIHHHH!
---
Heard when you throw a grenade with the assaultron head equipped it irradiates you
---
I offer all legendaries I find for 5-25 caps. I love playing the game but don’t care about scrip or legendaries and don’t need the money from selling them. I just want other people to benefit.
---
agreed. everyone upvote.
---
This... i like
---
No one knows yet.
---
i like this idea, because i imagine it would make it easier to spot your loot bag when you die. as it is right now, I have to search around for an hour if I happen to die in thick foliage or at night in a forest.
---
Must be your connection (or PS4 network settings?). How should the game affect the consoles connection? I've never had something with my ps4
---
JUST SAY FUCK IT'S FINE
---
YES
---
I can be your companion.
---
PSN:Weezunder
---
That’s gonna be $5
---
Until then, continue your moo-vable feast, good neighbor of the wastelands! :D
---
THEY'RE NICE WITH MINT.
---
SO HIPSTERS TELL ME, ANYWAY.
---
I tried that too. The house is way too compicated. Kinda looks like the weasleys house from harry potter. Lmao
---
Sounds more like a connection issue for your whole internet. I commonly have the game disconnect and my PS4 disconnect because our net is unstable living out in the country.
---
Has anyone found a 3rd creature that works to complete the challenge? Stuck on 2/3.
---
MIGHT BE SPICY.
---
CAN'T HELP BUT AGREE
---
TWATWEASLE.
---
I AM STEALING THIS WORD.
---
Tons of potential variables. I'd say if people knew exactly what was causing it they'd work to rectify it.
---
You have Todd watching over you.
---
Ok thanks for clarifying
---
You have that problem too? Or it's just the router of some people?
---
Man I say it seriously, I don't have that problem. It's my router?
---
Same thing. All the crashes people have confuse me how it happens.
---
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT!!!
---
I LOVE LAMP!
---
OMG! I had no idea and I've been running this for ages.

WHY THE FUCK IS THERE NO ARMOR PEN PERKS FOR PISTOLS.

I DONT WANNA BE FORCED TO DOA  STEALTH AUTO 10MM I WANNA BE A COWBOY W MY REVOLVERS DAMNIT 
---
ALSO FUCK RIFLES FOR BEING SO FUCKING HEAVY
---
Also...
---
Toilet paper finally has a use... gonna need a pressure washer for the power armor though...lol
---
I don't know either. I really want to know it for helping people with the problem.
---
Yeah same
---
I MASH THEM WITH MINT AND BROCCOLI. DELISH.
---
YELLING IS ALWAYS FUN
---
DAMMIT A SENSIBLE POST
---
Nice save bro
---
Constantly throughout the last week. Had one crash into the middle of my house today.
---
This is still happening. Just happened to me
---
I WANT TO WRECK SOMEONE'S WORKSHOP.
---
Not surprised its still a thing.
---
You fucking know it let's go bois, down to bedrock. I'll be back with more bullshit just you wait
---
You can still bypass the mainframe by placing your power armor on the other side of a certain tunnel (that you can see- no glitch outside of the map). Only problem with that is you can't open the short-cut door (if you are with a group running all 3 silos at once), so once you hit the end, you have to launch, no coming back. But yeah- that only saves 3-5 minutes depending on how fast the server is responding to slotting the cores.
---
Word, word. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Disconnects pretty much stopped happening to me 2 or 3 patches ago. Think I had 2 disconnects since then, but I play over 4G so that might as well be my connection.
---
WENDIGOS ARE FUCKIN SPOOKY. DO ME A HECK EVERY TIME
---
Awesomeness 😟!
---
The most I've ever sold anything for in my vending machine is 7500caps (TSE 50 cal) that I could easily have sold for over 25K caps elsewhere.
---
I am continually buying things for 8-12K caps - because that is what vendors sell for.
---
Buyers going from vendor to vendor complaining about having to pay 2.5K caps for and Instigating Aiming bonus Lever action need to recognize what the going rates are and get real.
---
If I try to sell  a pair of Calibrated X-01 Legs for more than 750 caps .... they sit there unsold forever.   Its not even worth the work to make them for that.  10 Violet Flux alone can sell for more than that.
---
Completely agree with the thread.
---
I don't have many disconnects either. I still say a lot of the supposed "server problems" are actually local or locational issues. I've been playing MMOs since 2001 and it's pretty normal to have certain people complain about lag when others say there is none. In an online world, not everyone will have the same experience. There are simply too many variables and the game company can't control your end
---
That is also true, but as I said I dont care how it gets up there. Physics I am not to worried about I mean look at the trains. Those hills? Never make them. Turnouts? Also never make those. Hell looking at the locomotives they have, those would never make a normal curve anyway. (Should have keep the New Vegas F unit looking ones they look more correct for the locked in time frame.) Sorry train rant.
---
I may be naive but I thought all cheating methods were stopped?
---
If you don't get anyone to help you soon, I can make a max lvl Gatling Gun later tonight
---
Going to keep an eye out for you as well (GT the same). Awesome CAMP!
---
same for me 
---
buddy of mine recently started playing with me after refusing for ages (because of all the bad news) 
---
he always thought im just defending the game because he knows im a fanboy 
---
but seriously we play days before encountering a server crash or a bug 
---
when they have seasonal events or such the game disconnects more often but even then its like once or twice in a session of 5 hours
---
IM SO SICK OF PEOPLE SELLING DOG SHIT ITEMS IN THEIR CAMP, NOBODY WANTS YOUR COMMON ASS CLOTHING OR NON 3 STAR WEAPONS, OR YOUR PLANS THAT WE ALL GET ON DAY 1 AND THAN YOU DON'T EVEN SELL IT AT A REASONABLE PRICE. STUFF THAT SHIT IN A RANDOM MAILBOX AND STOP LURING ME IN WITH PROMISES OF ACTUAL GOOD STUFF YOU JERKS, I WILL LURE EVERY CREATURE TO COME AND EAT YOUR COUCHES
---
100 caps for a 100% fusion core is nothing.  It takes 5 minutes of game time to make 100 caps.  It takes an hour of game time to find a 100% fusion core.
---
Yeah, treasure maps is where you get them. I might have some extra plans for raider PA if you're on ps4. I'll have to check my stash.
---
As are the rest of us.
---
I used to do this until I realized no one sells at the prices I do .... When I have to buy something, I have to pay 10K caps or more for something I would sell for 1500.
---
I like to move merchandise, but I don't like cheapskates who won't pay a fair price.
---
And that's the main problem with the game rn I get it you have to literally participate to get the rewards but it's not fair when some level 250+ player one shots any legendary boss and you didnt get a chance to do any damage and you get no loot is a little unfair
---
On the bright side of changes to that event, at least the canned meat stew doesn't degrade anymore.
---
FUCK BROCCOLI.
---
WHAT ARE YOU A BARBARIAN?
---
FARTBOY.
---
there was a very similar post a few hours ago and the answer is know
---
someone did a quite well explained comment on how it negatively affects server stability and likely you would encounter countless inappropriate pictures
---
not only is is the mayor always talking about the body in pricket's fort,  now also rose tells she doesn't just want to use me &gt;.&lt; UUGHH
---
NO CAPS GTFO NAB
---
It's fun when they do a free weekend, we need atleast once a month tbh
---
I don't have the issue nearly as much as I read about others having it. Maybe 1 disconnect per day if that, crashing to desktop is way less. Especially when compared to months ago or just after launch.
---
My consoles &amp; PC are on a dedicated connection though &amp; it's usually just one being used at a time. Ping (in other games, as 76 won't show you) is very low. I'm no IT expert but I've been dabbling with it for ages &amp; have my network setup quite tightly.
---
It just seems to be an elusive issue, people with brand new PCs &amp; gigabit internet can still suffer from it (just going on posts I've read from the past 9 months or whatever). It crosses from PC to PS to Xbox. Could blame the servers but then other people have barely any issues at all. It's just very strange to me.
---
Totally agree with you, I hope you're enjoying your play time with your buddies.
---
I don't have any more character slots.
---
You can always add me, and I can join you whenever I'm on. I'm on (pretty much) daily, so odds are, you'll be able to connect with me.
---
And if youd like, PLEASE, I have (or had) about 18 or more bulked screws, and I dont even remember how many loose screws I have...
---
What door do you pick to bypass the reactor?
---
No way to get around carrying 15 mainframe cores required to reboot the door to the launch room ?
---
I actually have plenty of bulked Ballistic Fiber, if you were wanting to trade, lmao. I'm pretty sure I have around 13 because I used to buy them from vendors when they had them.
---
I FUCKING HATE WHEN YOU DIE AND CAN'T RESPAWN ANYWHERE (except if you have a friend on, usually can respawn on them), NOT EVEN VAULT 76!!!! KILLED THE QUEEN? NO LOOT FOR YOU!!!!!!
---
I have seen such vending machines, and only took what I needed. I didn't take everything, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone did.
---
Leeeeeeeeeeeeeeroy Jenkins!
---
My bet on crashing players is they are running mods and background programs on an underpowered laptop. I am running a bottom line PC that barely makes the cut and have had very few DC's during play, only full server crashes.

It takes place in whitesprings.
---
It the true true
---
FUCK BROCCOLI 2020!
---
There’s really no way for a game to affect your console’s network connection or your local internet in any way. It sounds more like you’re having connection issues with your internet as a whole.
---
Weird. I AM able to craft the regular backpack...I found the plan for it. I did not complete the quest for the pioneer scouts though. Is this still the reason I'm unable to craft/use the Raider backpack skin I've just purchased from the atom shop?

No, it's the game.

I rarely get any disconnects....last night I had so many I actually rage quit...I've NEVER rage quit any game!

SORRY THEY TOOK OUT SURVIVAL MY DUDE ITLL BE ALRIGHT IM SURE SOMETHINS GONNA COME ALONG WE CAN ALL ENJOY PS PLZ DONT TAKE MY WORKSHOP IM A FOOD BUILD
---
Makes too much sense. So the chances of it happening are pretty slim.

Man I really needed something like this the other night. I killed a 3star scorched and he disappeared right as I was gonna loot the body.

everyone knows the best time to play any game is at launch when no one knows what they are doing and it's new and magical.  Their loss.

*Walks past u/Water_colours workshop and proceeds to demolish the workshop of the neighbors*
---
Nice, keep it
---
thank you all for the feedback, a lot of interesting info here, will also check the links and get up to speed
---
out of curiosity, how important is crafting (not modifying) gear and weapons in this game, if best gear comes via quests / events, then I better sell big part of the resources I am sitting on and get some good storage back, what do you think?
---
Through the decon arches; turn left, Lockpick (level 3) door on left wall. Mind the Assaultron. Pick the lock, enter the room (1 turret,) go through the doorway on your right. (2 turrets in this room.) Hack (level 3) the terminal next to the door on your left. Reactor Breach Lockdown overridden, door will open. I have not looked into methods of bypassing the mainframe cores, as it would likely require an exploit. I support efficiency, but exploits aren't my playstyle.
---
You don't need the shovel to place the body, only to bury it. And then you don't have to carry the body. I can't remember if it weighs anything but probably?
---
Two shot and explosive add about the same damage, explosive expert might push that up a bit, but it's a LOT of points to make a little difference.  They're both in the ~20-25% range if memory servers.
---
However, two shot weapons suffer a lot in accuracy, which hurts them quite a bit.
---
Some mobs are resistant to fire, though it's not a huge concern usually.
---
Don't look a giftsquatch in the mouth.  Especially at close range.
---
It can go to 50 and STILL sucks...
---
Thank you so much!
---
I would, but then my current lvl 120 raider looking guy would have to stay on the shelf instead of mingling with all the new NPC raiders added to the game :( . Perhaps if Survival ever came back or Bethesda does another free week I'll make a new person to mingle with all the new players. Or when the game finally gets added on steam.
---
All I want is half walls/ stairs and stairs that can snap to the corners. That would open up a ton of building options.
---
WORKSHOP PVP ISN'T GRIEFING.  STOP FOODSPLAINING.
---
Holy shit, I thought I was alone with this issue! I get the exact same thing going on here too. Ignore all of the people telling you it's somehow you or your connection. It's not, it's the game. Really hoping for a fix for this at some time.
---
EDIT: Keep trying. Eventually it will work. Sometimes if I totally restart the PS4 it works.
---
Same just happened to me right now. 2 level 200+, one claimed the workshop and the other shot me from behind.
---
I, like most of the other commenters, hit WT, satellite array, and Huntersville.  I throw in General's Steakhouse plus the rail yard west of Watoga station.  Additionally, I hit all of the BoS outposts circling the bog to farm ballistic fiber, magazines, and bobble heads.  Occasionally I get a legendary at one of these too.
---
Also, I often do a run from the shallows all the way to Watoga station.  Just hit the highway and see what I encounter.
---
F
---
“Now here is a story..”
---
I usually do this then hit them with the syringe to finish them off
---
Haha you are so right. I remember just dropping 3 star legendary heavy weapons all the time.
---
Should spawn as 3Star legendary too
---
These are cosmetic digital items with only one seller, and they can't be resold, so their value is 100% arbitrary (ie, worthless). The entire point of limited time items is to persuade you to spend money. Earning atoms from in-game challenges is just to help with player retention and get you inside the shop to begin with. So when it comes to us players that wouldn't spend any money on the Atom Shop to begin with, they don't really care if we miss out on a few things.
---
Personally, I don't think it's worth fussing that much over. I'll save words like "predatory" for if they introduce gambling-like mechanics. And if they set it up where my experience not spending money becomes significantly worse than if I *did* spend money (pay-to-win, loot timers, or an absurd grind I can pay to skip)... I'll just stop playing.
---
I’d only take the things I could use. Unless it’s legendary, then I’m taking it for scrip. Gotta make a living somehow...
---
He broke in
---
Can you explain me when you get your disconnects maybe I can help you.
---
Also I noticed the sarcasm good one XD
---
I play on ps4
---
No capes!
---
IM FUCKING PISSED THE MARINE COMBAT HELMET ISNT IN THE GAME BUT ALL THE OTHER MARINE ARMOR PIECES ARE FUCK ME BACKWARDS ON A TUESDAY
---
Strange in numbers is the best perk.  If I’m playing I’ll log my roommate in so he is afk so I can use the strange in numbers.  
---
Mutations that give extra damage and marsupial are just crazy.  
---
Good suggestion.
---
Anthem has this as well. Bethesda could limit it to just events to keep fairness. Especially if someone is using exploding bullets and people love exploding legendaries across the map. I think it make some people feel good
---
At least a glow or something where we can see the body
---
I say you nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
---
That's true, also maybe it's problem of the drivers or maybe a closed port in the router idk...
---
Again...
---
Last night maybe 11.30 pm (UK time). Honestly tho I never rage quit but I got disconnected so many times I gave up and went to bed lol. The game is normally pretty good for me.
---
I play to over 4G and I only disconnect 1 time since November, since that moment all my disconnects where maintenance.
---
MY BRAHMIN'S BREATH SMELLS LIKE BRAHMIN FOOD!
---
Oh I think I get it. Maybe that day the devs where doing something into maintenance without a maintenance disconnect, that happens some times in MMO's, if that's not the case I'm sorry.
---
Also have fun playing 😃
---
2 shot is actually 1.25 shot.  Less accuracy and more recoil.
---
That's just server delay I'm sure
---
Also , check out /r/fo76filthycasuals, they have a discord server.
---
ugh!
---
You WERE helping.
---
It's a pretty safe bet that you weren't able to stop ALL the secondary attack damage, and you were doing YOUR SHARE dealing the most effective attack damage for YOUR level.
---
Highly doubt anyone was bitching about "some low-level screwing up my Adrenaline perk".
---
Meantime, you earned XP and hopefully some decent drop items.
---
WHY THE FUCK DOES IT TAKE MY GAME 5 MINUTES TO LOAD? QUEEN IS DEAD BEFORE I CAN FT TO HER!
---
I play on PS4 and I only had 1 disconnect since November, the rest of the disconnects where just maintenance.
---
yeah, I always expect to see loads of people there and then I'm surprised when no one is there. I always remember it being crowded.
---
I’m convinced a lot of atom shop stuff is designed by interns. 
---
No offense to interns.
---
For as rare and elusive the bastard is I'd say that's a fitting reward.
---
Bugs.. bugs never change...
---
WHY THE FUCK AFTER 1 YEAR WE ARE STILL GETTING "ITEM IS FLOATING" or "NEEDS SUPPORT" ON STORED BLUEPRINT BUILT WITHOUT GLITCHES???? WHY??? WHY THE FUCK??? BASE DEPLOYS FINE...PUT RADIO ON TABLE-MOVE CAMP-DEPLOY STORED BLUEPRINT-GAME:" OH HELL NAW"

He just needed to borrow a cup of sugar.

i have a free vending machine and have been cleared out a few times, but not most of the time. if you have a machine with only free plans, some people will take all of them, even the ones you have multiples of, because they think you don't care about it. if you put free stimpaks the first person to see them will take them 99% of the time. if you have a variety of things ppl will mostly just take what they need. i recommend writing something on the machine, on mine it says "take what you need. ok"
---
on one occasion i was at my camp, im lv 260, a random  lv 60 i guess dropped a bunch of stuff on the ground and i was very confused? he texted me "for your free vending machine" and that made it all worth it.
---
Yep that was me use 3 nuka mines and had some random dude help
---
You grew up when you hit lvl 50. You are like a 30 year old man who lost a fight saying it is because he is a kid on the inside. You are as good as a lvl 50. As a lvl 100. As a lvl 150. And as a lvl 200. You are as good as a lvl 250, and yes, you are as good as the lvl 300 person. Because you both passed lvl 50 where the game stops making you better.  So yes, there is a big difference between beating up a kid and fighting another person. Huge difference. It is also not relevant, because you are a person who has the same options and possibilities as your opponent.
---
Now, if you had simply done a post saying you were bad at PvP or how your reactions suck and you feel you can't compete, I would most likely have given you a few helpful advice, since there is alternatives to what you are trying to do (no, not talking about tearing down your camp),but  you keep claiming an unfair disadvantage that don't exist. So... suck it up. If you go into PvP you get PvP.
---
Nice. There was an update in the middle of November that seemed to markedly boost server stability and responsiveness.
---
Sometimes I just want to rewind back when I started playing seeing all of this over again. Figuring out how to do things, my vault dweller innocence. I remember when I was a level 20 I found out about joining the Enclave I was so determined to joining it no matter how high level the enemies were that was my biggest accomplishment at such a low level that was huge for me. Here I am today, level 146, having pretty much everything I ever wanted.
---
Yes, a friend of mine told me she does this with her machines. Everything is free she said. And apparently its caught on and people drop stuff for her to put in her machines quite often. 
---
I just really liked the idea. I have so much stuff that I drop in peoples camps and at train stations for other people. Problem is that I never know if people get it or more likely if the bag disappears. The free machine is a good answer to that issue.
---
It's current damage is 15 to 20 so it could literally do 10 times is current damage and still be balanced when compared to the ttk of other weapon archetypes.
---
No, don’t do this I make a ton of caps selling ammo 😝
---
We went to the post office and filled out a form there too.
---
Thanks, it’s an open camp design, free water, benches and nice views...lol
---
Right when you moved?
---
Doesn't really matter. Everything that gets removed comes back at some point. Save your atoms if you want it that bad. Or if you don't have a job and therefore any money, maybe get a job. Welcome to the real world bud.
---
Edit: spelling
---
Back when PvP consisted of super sledges and combat shotguns...
---
HA! SORRY! NOT USE TO YELLING...LOL
---
TOILET PAPER FINALLY HAS A ISE... GONNA NEED A PRESSURE WASHER FOR POWER ARMOR THOUGH...LOL.
---
They will come back.
---
if you're dropping stuff in train stations, put it in a world container, not in a paperbag, the paperbag can disappear if you leave the place/world(I'm not sure) but if it's in a container i think it stays.
---
i think the free vending machine is something that will catch on, if more people do it people will get more used to it and not take it all, then we can all just be recklessly kind.
---
Yes. Absolutely.
---
WE NEED A NEW FUCKING MAP BEACAUSE ONLY HALF OF THE SO CALLED "BIGGEST MAP EVER" IS ACCESSIBLE!!! WHERE THE FUCK IS MY FO76 POINT LOOK OUT?!
---
We need a bounty on his head..lol
---
Was the guy that clapped you lvl 708 and on xbox?
---
Rad Arch sounds like some bloodied build characters want to get to keep their health down! I know u meant decon Arch tho. I was so happy when I built my decon Arch, used the contractor perk cause I had almost no stable flux back then. Now about another 20 levels higher I have a nice stockpile of flux in my stash ready anytime :D
---
You made me smile at such a dumb joke , take this silver
---
Always check scorchbeasts loot, they drop plans and even if you know them, you can sell them.
---
It is much harder and less likely for a level 100 to have OP builds (perk leveling is a thing), op weapons (legacies and farming/buying), lots of caps or legendaries (it takes time for these).
---
Using both logics here it is more akin to a 30 year old body build walking up to an 19 year old computer sciences student and fucking mercing him before claiming it's fair because they're both legal adults.
---
But know what fuck it. I've got enough shit for being averse to change today so maybe I will just make that fucking post.
---
Does this person not have a camp budget? My camp is garbage compared to this and I'm near the limit
---
A tip for this one, crafting glowing blood packs counts as both itself and a regular blood pack so you get two for one.
---
Likewise for the chem crafting challenge, there are several that double or triple count. Don't remember exactly which ones but Fury is one for sure. I think Psychobuff too. I only have to craft three things to get credit for five.
---
I was planning on straight up living in survival mode
---
Some players have taken to using 5.56 as a secondary currency to bypass the cap limit. Many of the players who were collecting magazines have completed their collection, as well, so the market has dried up a bit. I sell stable flux for 150 each, and all plans and treasure maps for 76 caps each. Ultracite PA plans sell the most. Maps take time to sell, but when they go, they tend to buy them all in one go. If I weren't scrapping every single one I found to learn mods, I'd sell radium rifles.  I personally buy cheap ammo, nuka-colas of all varieties, and reasonably priced legendary weapons/armor. I also buy priced-to-sell legendaries to scrap at the purveyor.
---
I STARTED THIS GAME UP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 3 MONTHS HOPING IT WOULD BE FIXED. I HAVE A 2700X AND A RTX 2070 SUPER. THE GAME STILL LAGS, THERE IS STILL A DELAY ON HIT REGISTRATION, YOU HAVE TO FUCKING RESTART THE GAME TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE SCREEN MODE FFS AND ALL MY FUCKING CHARACTERS ARE STILL MARKED AS LEVEL 1. HOLY FUCKING SHIT TODD, GET THAT DOVAKHIN SHAPED DILDO OUT OF YOUR ASS AND FIX THE FUCKING GAME THAT I PAID GOOD MONEY FOR TO PLAY. YOU LYING ASS PIECE OF SHIT. FIX YOUR FUCKING ENGINE AND FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME. OTHERWISE HOP ON A CART, RIDE IT TO A MEDIEVAL OUTPOST AND GET YOUR HEAD CHOPPED OFF YOU SWEETROLL FUCKING SIMPLETON.
---
give it a Beam weapon conversion that allows it to fire a beam of energy that costs x ammo per second and does y damage per second
---
I can’t believe someone didn’t know what 1337 was...is it already that old?
---
The lever action has higher dps overall in most cases.
---
That camp was great to run through. Sorry I didn't wave back, when you did btw was busy running errands and missed your greeting.
---
MURGHHHHHHHHHHHH. NO FURTHER EXPLANATION NEEDED.
---
the Bloatfly barrel is quite good for farming nuked ingredients in a nuked zone, and it is even better if you have a group
---
Yup. It happened to me twice in a row last night. It’d be one thing if it made me spawn at Vault 76 but this bug completely softlocks me out of the game and I have to reset.
---
Silver lining: If you wait, you at least get the legendary and Flux for completing the event. Ypu just can’t pick up the plans and loot off of the queen....
---
I COULDN’T AGREE MORE WITH YOU ALSO STOP SELLING NORMAL EVERYDAY ITEMS THAT NOBODY WANTS!!!
---
It reduces the weight of the frame as well.
---
When drunken sheepsquatch attack
---
After a point, I used crafting to make weapons to scrap to try to learn mods.   That's how I learned all the mods for the handmade and lever action. Some challenges require you to craft items as well.
---
I’ll help
---
GT bipolarbear4040
---
Ease..
---
When unblock the door and hack de PC open a descontaminación door... Front this door you can see a boxs stack.. just try to put your power armor in the hole with L1 and L2.. now you are in the last room ;)
---
I got a 3 star shovel from the perverter a few months ago with reduced weight so I just carry it around on me. Also comes in handy when you have to kill critters with farm tools when the atom challenge pops up.
---
Haha yup!
---
Personally I use a hunting rifle for sniping. Main reasons are that it has a recon scope and .50 cal ammo is so plentiful when crafting it. 140 rounds for 10 lead, 280 if super duper kicks in. A slower rate of fire than the Lever but it feels good for what I use it for.
---
FUCK WORLD-STEALING MUTFRUIT-LOVING SCORCHED BASTARDS
---
I just started playing not that long ago and there’s a few things I would but today it I could. The cool globe is the main one. Also wish I could gift items. My GF and I ate teamed up. Her camp is our real camp and my camp I move as needed. I can’t but the glowing map, dart board, or anything else for our camp cause it’s not my camp. If they solved this they get some $ from me.
---
So there isn't a legitimate way to do it that fast. You have to glitch to do it. But you still have to do the launch prep phase. He said you can skip that.
---
Hot take: it could drop nothing but quad TSE alien blasters and it would still drop nothing of value due to how shit-tier the alien blaster is in this game
---
I went to a camp that was just like this on PC yesterday. All the machine had were plans that I already knew, so I didn't take anything. I'd definitely take all the free meds and bulk junk though, as I could just resell them and actually make some free caps.
---
Why don't you just rename your regular guns? I start all given item names with a - to always put them on the top.
---
Me! I'm ready to get my spook on
---
wat
---
Its 5. I've tested it over and over with my explosive one against a wall because you can more easily see how many shots are hitting than with a non explosive one.
---
There is a damage calculator for weapons, but I don’t have a link handy.
---
I’ve been selling a fair number of plans.  Not even exotic stuff.  There was quite a demand for armor mod plans and it may be people’s alt characters buying stuff up.
---
It does come in waves.  Sometimes, you won’t sell anything for days and other times you have to shut things down to avoid going over 30K.
---
Magazines and Bobbleheads are odd things when selling them.  My mule has all of the magazines and bobbleheads I had left over from collecting them.  When I’m on with my mule, I vend them.  It’s roughly 400 pounds of stash so there’s variety.  I don’t sell many and I think people are trying to complete displays at their camps.  They are certainly not flying out of the vending machines.  I sell magazines for 20 and bobbleheads for 50.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
This post has upvotes but no comments. Is that like the thing where only 10% of victims come forward to speak up? Lol.
---
You mean ex-wife
---
I don't get many either. You probably do just have a solid connection. Mine sits around 80ish mps, with almost no issues.
---
It should drop a 3-star alien blaster, a drill, two lead pipes, and a weightless wood chest piece.
---
I have a similar approach on one char but - the vendor is full of good stuff, 5.56 ammo, unyielding armor, you name it - all free and - I don't plug the vendor in, so it don't appear on the map.  When someone actually happens to find it and investigate, happy surprise.  1 customer a week gets very happy :)
---
If it could be worked out, I think it's a terrific idea.  On another topic, I've thought about doing a painting tour video, highlighting all the great paintings throughout the game.
---
Meanwhile I found a server that cycled through Project Paradise three times!
---
We all know what it's used for... Bloatfly Meat parties...
---
Nice. I Miss arktos and free range
---
Oh this is good OP, tag that with suggestion. Doubt they think of bloody wallpapers on their own. Can't wait for the spookydays either
---
It's not that you're not doing any damage it's that doing too little damage isn't even counted either!
---
ACCURACY WOULD BE HORRIBLE, SHIT ON THIS IDEA! CAN YOU IMAGINE TWO SHIT EXPLOSIVES!?!?!?
---
 [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) 
---
this one?
---
So it's not worth anything in the vender?
---
Did even more digging, as apparently 76 is using my mic but not actually broadcasting it for whatever reason, according to Windows 10 settings
---
I endorse this statement
---
It could be Rose.
---
Recently sold a 10 ton heavy ass 3 star bloodied explosive poon real cheap 1k caps because of that.
---
Same goes with the greenhouse. 
---
Right now the fix is to install rugs and place whatever you want on top of rugs. This goes for every single indoor environment that places items on roof.  
---
Just use the fix for now and you will be happy.  
---
People have posted 10000 times asking the same thing you just did.
---
No, I don't. I mean if they added *paid* gambling mechanics. Like if you could spend real money on scrip.
---
That’s it! Great work.
---
Ha ok, good luck with the second build then.
---
I have had that happen to me before. This time I did not die however. If I remember correctly you normally get the flux off the body. It did not show as part of the loot today for me. The one legendary and other sbq pieces did show in her inventory though.
---
Just added you, shoot me a DM when you’re online
---
You need fire rate to actually use faster reload, even without this legendary effect speed demon and perk improving reload speed of heavy guns will allow you to reload faster then harpoon fire rate (it’s 2.5 or something like that)
---
Why do I care if my door bugs you, it's my camp lol.
---
Yeah, it's quite unpleasant.
---
The sarcasm is strong with this one.
---
THE GAME'S POTENTIAL FRUSTRATES ME. THERE'S SO MUCH THAT COULD BE.
---
EVEN IF THE GAME JUST SIMPLY WORKED AS INTENDED, IT WOULD BE AMAZING AND THEY COULD ACTUALLY FOCUS ON NEW CONTENT INSTEAD OF PATCHING HOLES WHILE THEY TRY TO PUT SOMETHING FORWARD.
---
[FUCK EVERYTHING](https://youtu.be/meDqJqoq7K0)
---
Like they were going to die by the nuke anyway so they just ran into the storm like morons it was so funny.
---
I think actually they are the same in this case lol
---
It's still a pretty great weapon roll, but it's not part of a meta build. Someone would probably pay 1500 for it.
---
I’d take the stuff I’d use.  If it’s not something I’d use, I’d leave it for the next guy.
---
HELL YEAH
---
The flux is never off her corpse, it's from the completion of the Scorched Earth quest.
---
25 at max level with no perks, 15 with the fusion mag. But semantics aside, yes. It desperately needs to be better. I have no idea why they thought it was okay in this form. It’s an insult to past versions
---
Weapon breaks twice as fast with explosive not two shot
---
Stalkers prefix isn’t great, but the rest of the benefits are solid.
---
Omg everyday I log in that's the first thing I hear and its annoying
---
I had to make a new guy just because recruitment blues didn't register for me.  Glad it was that and not the level 100 trophy.  That's shitty bro.
---
MY TSE LEVER ACTION RIFLE MUST BE MADE OUT OF CARDBOARD BECAUSE IT KEEPS BREAKING WHENEVER I GET INTO A FIGHT.
---
Cool, thanks for the info. 👍
---
Its fairly buggy still so it depends if youre a person who can deal with it go for it, some bugs can be game breaking though.
---
If you do get it do not pay full price...a hard copy in the store is a fraction of the online price.
---
I've seen gameplay, and it looks fine, but I've heard that it's boring and repetitive. What is the fall update going to bring?
---
Either that or it glitches. Like on the Grahms cooking event I put it 15 meat everytime and I did it for a total of 6 times and only gotten legendaries twice out of it I was confused
---
its really more of a looter shooter...
---
If you are looking for an RPG I'd wait till the Wastelanders DLC comes out and ask around then. Right now it's more of a Lite Survival Looter-Shooter
---
I sold an anti armor bone club 3 star for 2 or 3k yesterday. People will buy anything.
---
Ugh, that is a hard one ... I would say get Fallout 4 first.    
---
Fallout 76 is fun but I feel like in order to really "Get"  Fallout 76 - you should play other Fallout games first
---
I honestly don't remember exactly where I was. I had fast traveled to someone's camp and then wandered a short way aways and found it. It was south, I believe, and the nude sunbather was near a small stream or pool.
---
More story and more NPCs, including human NPCs. Settlers and raiders returning.
---
I know I'll get flak for this, but if you are really looking for an RPG, you should stay away, as FO76 is an FPS.
---
I have borderlands, but I don't play it very often due to the bleak atmosphere and repetitive gameplay. Is fallout 76 similar to borderlands?
---
But but but the tooltip on the loading screen says it is super powerful.  What are you going to claim next that the ripper isn’t the super tough melee weapon those loading screens claim /s
---
Omg now I have a quest!
---
Thanks for the info. Will the price go up once the dlc comes out?
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Yea it does it to me all the time when I run battle bots
---
It’s only repetitive once you finish the main story and side quests , however there’s much more than the main quest and side quests to do so it’s up to you if you’re going to have a repetitive experience imo , also wastelanders adds NPCs and a whole new main quest.
---
Start south center of the map, then work east. It was in that vicinity. There were trees and such around, so not in the Cranberry Bog.
---
The recon scope is real nice
---
I've been told I should get fallout 4 instead. What do you think about that?
---
THIS IS GRAFTONS FUCKING MAYOR. BUT OF COURSE, YOU ALREADY FUCKING KNEW THAT. WHO THE FUCK ELSE WOULD IT BE CUNT?
---
Nice. I have a feeling whatever we are going to get is already made, and it's probably not this good 😂
---
Get whatever you want , but fallout 76 has a very different vibe and is a different overall experience compared to fallout 4.
---
Nah, its good. Reddit moves on.
---
Do it. Been playing since launch, still enjoying it.
---
IT’S GRAFTON DAY!
---
Dailies award a small amount of scrip separate from legendary scrapping. Though there is no notification about it just like scout badges.
---
What is their ideology?  
---
I've seen Curtons talk about "Sending a message to Bethesda"  but the ONLY cheating group I've seen in this game seems to be them
---
THANK GOD!
---
That actual power armor pieces?  Thought they only had mod plans.
---
They really missed an opportunity to make loot bags Vault Tec Lunchboxes.
---
Also, if you pickup someone elses loot bag they should have the option to initiate PvP.
---
AGAIN!! ....
---
Maybe we lock our doors because y'all live in a god damn barn. I'm tired of people leaving my doors open, only unlocked door is the shop lol
---
FUCK THIS GAME FOR PROVIDING ME WITH AN ENDLESS STREAM OF FUN AND EXCITEMENT OVER THE LAST 10 MONTHS, NOT JOKING I PLAY DAILY AT LEAST 4-6 HOURS AND WILL NEVER FUCKING TIRE OF THIS FUCKING AWESOME GAME AND COMMUNITY.
---
It’s too bad you’re on XBox.  I’d invite you to my camp and lock the door behind you.  
---
Finger guns baby (that’s become my thing with these PVP types lately).
---
It might have worked out different if player vending was available from the get go. Instead the prices of most semi-valuable items are dictated by their worth on the sub reddit. 
---
It's obvious when a vendor doesn't use the trading sub but it can sometimes work in your favour. I snatched up a 2* bloodied faster fire rate handmade for 571 caps, had a little accident in my pants. Same day found a vampires faster fire rate LMG for 1k. 
---
Of the flip side u see folks wanting 200 caps for a Stimpack or max caps for 3* scrip material
---
Reluctantly traded the handmade plus caps for a 3* AAE handmade and was offered 15k for the LMG.
---
I agree though that pricing can be ridiculous but at the end of the day something is only worth what somebody else is prepared to pay for it. In some cases 150k caps, a kidney and their first born child
---
HELL YEAH BROTHER
---
WTF IS GOING ON WITH THE SOUND? IT JUST GOES SILENT NOW AND THEN SINCE A FEW DAYS! 
---
AND THESE FUCKING DISCONNECTS GETS ME EVERY TIME!
---
Absolutely.  It's not the most accurate gun in the world (although being in third-person helps), but when it hits, it hits hard.  And it sips ammo relative to other heavy weapons, so it's a great complement to a melee build... arguably the only gun you'd never need.
---
Depends on legendary effects in my opinon, but its one of favorite guns
---
Game over, man.  Game over!
---
I think so.
---
Amongst other things, I’ve used one to take down vertibots, cargobots (and the strategic versions thereof) 
---
SBs, SSQs, mothmen, Col Gutsys, and in the SBQ fights I’ve joined.
---
EDIT: as someone above stated, gatling compliments a melee build (which I am).
---
Stabilized3 is the only heavy gun perk I have equipped.
---
i totally do buddy thank you very much :)
---
I have a BE and it one hits max level supermutants and pretty much anything else.
---
Don’t listen to the other dude, NW on PS4 is fun and competitive. I play with and against almost all the same players and I know everybody enjoys it. From day one till now. I’ve actually gotten more of a feel for the community in Nw than in AdV. seems like we were all actually from the same vault. People start to remember the names that kill em, and vice versa. Got rivals in that mode. 
---
Just listen to Red Eyes Raider Radio, the story of Atlas and how Ted Eye got his name are in the same vein as the types of stories that come out of that mode lmao
---
And of course this is my experience, just had to say it cause this subs full of fools who will point that out like no shit
---
In the last 30 days I've crashed 2 times in Morgantown just from opening my pipboy or turning around to fast. Yesterday someone crashed my whole PlayStation exploding duplicated mines. 
---
I have also crashed walking up to player camps, just a few days ago I was walking from one camp to another, crash. I've crashed fast travelling to camps that disappear.
---
A few months ago I would crash every time I used a workbench, if I had too many items. I had to sell extra aid before I could fix my gun. Inspecting legendarys crashed me too, so repair kits weren't helpful either.
---
It’s my backup gun on two out of three characters. With the right perks and legendary traits, it’s great!
---
It’s been shitty as hell for me. Expect downvotes if anyone even remotely thinks you’re being negative towards 76
---
Slippery little SOBs don't like to appear very often so it would make for a fitting reward if you do manage to find and kill one.
---
Very nice weapon. I haul three varieties, Executioners, Furious and Scorch Killer.  Mod them w long barrels, ring sights , fast receiver and extra large magazine.  Very efficient w ammo and very hard hitting.  I use my Prime LMG to bring SB's below half health and execute them with the Executioners gatling.
---
Let me explain this to you, you’re asking the 76 circlejerk subreddit if this game is good. The only people here are people who believe it is or stragglers like me who come here for help but get shit on because  my attitude towards this game is negative. I love the idea and the amount of possibilities this game has but god I hate what it is and what they’re doing to it
---
Unarmed build, and Ive been hanging on to my ol trusty Gatling gun for months now 👍🏽
---
Suppose if you had the singing protectron as your wake up alarm?
---
Drop it at a low level area. Overseers camp
---
Can drop plans, not guaranteed!
---
Hey if you ask me the ripper should completely ignore enemy DR like in past games but sadly I’m not in charge 🤷‍♂️
---
There were 4-5 played assembled at munitions factory this afternoon so of course I went to check it out. 
---
Little did I know there were one or two teams working together to fuck people up including getting wanted status to tempt you into taking them down to farm YOU for caps. 
---
I did manage a couple of kills but it was a shit show.  When I unload a 30 mag clip on my BE auto prime handmade and it barely makes a dent I know there’s rough sailing ahead. 
---
Still, we went back and forth and despite the shenanigans I had fun.  I could easily come in here and whine about PvP but instead I think some people should embrace it a little more.  
---
There’s only so much farming and camp building a person can stomach
---
If you pick up the corpse but don’t complete the quest he shuts up too.
---
Which one is bleaker and lonelier?
---
That's a good idea. I gave up on workshops based on losing them when you log off and the pvp aspect. They seem a big part of the game and badly conceived.  Unfortunately many people don't get into re-building together. They're only into showing off and pretending they're winners by stealing from others.
---
Just waited 30 min for someone to come out of the vault. These people is slow
---
It's just another form of trolling.
---
Afk maybe lol
---
Yeah I get that and I'm quite the fanboy myself. I can't stand those opportunistic youtubers who created the hate 76 bandwagon.
---
But we got to be honest. Today was a mess. Nothing game breaking but immersion was gone as it was more all kinds of graphical glitches.
---
Ghouls without heads, flying molerats, dead scorchedbeasts falling from the sky just like that, weird lighting etc.
---
If I’m honest, it’s up to you. I hate this game and I hate that I lost my money to it. Every time I try to play it again it stresses me out more than the last time. Their fixes break more than they fix and some shit I’m starting to believe they flat out lie about fixing (I.e. infinite turret sound glitch which has been fixed what, 5 times now?) As long as you can immerse yourself in the world then you can do ok because thats the only story this game has. There are no consequences to any of your actions. Your story isn’t important and everyone is dead. This isn’t your story, your ride, your quest. It’s a long dead world which you get the “honor” of existing in. If you can find enjoyment from that go for it
---
PvP keeps me from grouping with randoms. Can’t trust someone won’t suck me into it. There should also be an icon indicating in ppl are in passive or non-passive. That could open the door for more random grouping.
---
I mean like before Christmas last year I had a deathclaw get stuck in my house and it basically destroyed everything and I was underleveled and my brother who could’ve killed it sat there and laughed......that asshole
---
YttyTkt kyu
---
Fallout Shelter was my introduction to the franchise too, and from there it was love at first sight once I watched some gameplay from FO3 and 4. If you got that feeling too I say go for it, but I agree with the people saying 4 is objectively better and also a better introduction. Bethesda themselves more or less came out and said 76 was just meant to be an experimental side-project for the particularly interested, rather than a fully fleshed out Fallout title. It's fully playable though, and if you like sandbox type games I don't think you'll find it boring (at least for many hours).
---
Assholes abound in this game, unfortunately. It's one of the reasons I stopped playing. Some of us play games to get away from assholes and into a better world for a while.  The only assholes I want to see in a game are NPCs.
---
Real talk, I refuse to fire the game up until this bug is fixed. three times was enough for me to go "uh nah no more not ever again"
---
It's bad enough that loud bastard yells at you whenever you get within a square mile of grafton anyway.
---
Grafton mayor is worse than Preston Garvey.
---
Nuclear Winter sucks 
---
The concept of Survival was much better warts and all.  Then the whiners showed up and complained which is  classic because 85% of them probably never played Survival or PvP. 
---
You people bitched and moaned so you know what?   Enjoy the season.  The PvP season that is.  Some people need their PvP fix so if it’s in Adventure too bad you asked for it .
---
Yes the moment I turned 30 I had one and it out shined my other weapons easily
---
YOUR MOM IS A NICE LADY!!!  GAAAAAAHHHHH
---
You're out maybe 500 caps in materials lol
---
Nope. And all DLC will be free
---
WHY SOME WEAPONS ARE MAXED OUT AT LEVEL 45... WHY NOT 50?? WHYYYYYYY?
---
What were the complaints about survival mode? I haven’t actually been sure why it went away, I just never cared about it one way or the other
---
FUCK YOUR PIE FOR NOT DROPPING AFTER 12 FUCKING HOURS!
---
A homie got no aluminum do
---
Gotta get after robots you'll get more than you'll need.  I sell it in my vendor and it moves, seems lots of people are hard up for aluminum
---
Neat idea! Would be cool
---
Things were rough as recently as a month ago but it's not bad now. Even when it's buggy it's still a whole lot of fun. It goes on sale often so grab it whenever that happens.
---
A MrHandy Mailman would be a nice feature.  Delivering legendaries you forgot to loot.
---
Tragic comedy
---
Fallout 4 is bleaker but it has a lot of NPCs.
---
&gt;
---
Fallout 76 is colourful and diverse but the only friendly NPCs currently are robots and one friendly super mutant... and obviously players but you don’t run into other players a lot normally unless you intend to or you’re at a popular spot.
---
You gotta be right up on them, close enough that it shows their name over their heads. It sucks ass, but that's how they programmed it for whatever reason.
---
So I run a rifle melee build already. No perks but damage.
---
I wanna do one that actually specialises in a weapon and doesn't need 18 perks to do subpar damage with 2 weapons (not that I don't love it)
---
Basically if I were to run a pure heavy weapons build is it viable?
---
PC player here. Took out a scorched wendigo I found in the mire. Surprise surprise it didn’t count...
---
Sounds good. I'm on daily as well. gonna be on and off tonight till the fights are over but i will add you and keep an eye out. You are my new favorite person.
---
WELL, FART MY FUCKHOLE, THIS IS SHITDAMNNING BADBITCH INFORMATION RIGHT HERE!
---
Well months back they said they were working on some kind of breakdown for ammo they either forgot or are waiting to shove it in the atom shop
---
We need a quest line that involves killing the mayor!  Make it a level 50+ end  game thing!
---
I mean I'm right next to them and it's taking up my entire screen..
---
"So many pumpkins, so little time"
---
This.  Now here’s a guy who saw an annoyance as an opportunity and came up with a snappy solution.
---
Sorry, only way to get plans for pa chest arms legs is treasure maps from the mire or the cranberry bog. Mods are available from the top of the world.
---
Unyielding or sentinals
---
Hmmm... it's harder to choose between them than I thought it would be.
---
Rug glitch is life with the bungalow.  Used it to fit a nuke generator in it.
---
How did they steal 500 caps?
---
I love mine.  I have had some items pop up to the roof but managed to make it a nice spot to sleep and have my work desk.  Blinds?  I still have not replaced the blind on the door of my real RV.  Who's gonna be looking?  We can't even take that damn dirty underwear off to wash it.
---
I went and fought her with a lvl 11 and ran out of bullets and just like you all said everyone was reviving me.was so fun I recommend it to anyone.i did get loot off her but no event loot like flux.still everyone should try this.just don't hide
---
Don't forget about the meth making bears up at the ice cream shop
---
Interested how
---
Where can i get robots
---
Yeah I think so too, they made good money with them bundles. I will wait then, maybe we’ll get the vault tec rep outfit in future bundles too! Thanks for the answer!
---
if you enjoyed that you ought to go claim a workshop.. someone will be along to REALLY make you feel part of the community..
---
It's a Scorched Earth event reward rather than an SBQ drop. Occasionally you get glitches where you never join the event despite being in the area.
---
Hopefully it comes with the wastelanders release
---
OVER A MONTH INBETWEEN PATCHES EX DEE XD XD EGGS DII
---
Yo dog! Whats ur PSN! I love this kind of shit dude. I'll be on ASAp
---
Yeah how many we got till now? 4 I think? And as you said they always where released nearly back to back.
---
In the past I’ve logged in before to have all 5 pieces of armor completely broken. Only happened twice tho
---
It’s of no use to a rifle build. Just get a good Instigating or Bloodied Lever Action.
---
Yep you only need a shovel to bury it. I did place the body and then left the event, but when I logged back in it appeared in my inventory. Body doesn't weigh anything, like other quest related items.
---
Why not both
---
Psst. I know a spot that they spawn in. Built at a cool spot that just happened to get a Flatwoods monster every now and then. I've encountered 4 so far and they're usually a level 30
---
Ladder stick a tap in the side call it a day
---
I agree. I know there is a work around. But as someone who dose a lot of trading it is very annoying.
---
I do not know why this glitch dose not get more attention
---
My dude uses 4 Unyielding and 1 chameleon. With a mix of AP Regen and poison resist second star and sentinels and cavalier third star
---
How this isn't a feature from launch i'm honestly not sure. Just works and is kinda obvious. Not one dev thought of it?
---
IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR SINCE RELEASE AND PERFORMANCE IS STILL SO BAD ON MY XBOX ONE. I LAG WHEN SWAPPING WEAPONS IT'S SO GAMEBREAKING!
---
ALSO THE FIRE OF MY ROCKET PROPELLED BASEBALL BAT DOESN'T EVEN MOVE ANYMORE, IT'S SO GAMEBREAKING!
---
I would love to meet this person, I would message them, and call them out on how they got to that level. 
---
I hate to say it, this person has found a exploit to be at that level. I have friends that have time on there hands, and play 12 hrours a day, every day, and they are sitting in the four hundreds. Any level higher than that I would have to call  bullshit.
---
 I myself have put close to 2000hrs  in, and I am at level 350. I honestly don't care about leveling against others,  but I am also not a loser trying to cheat, to make myself feel like a winner. And on top of that going around griefing others for enjoyment. You should have posted his screen name could have had some fun with this guy, more than likely a kid. 
---
I could be wrong, but none the less I wish you  and everyone the best.
---
What's your FO76 tag?
---
Sounds like an atom challenge
---
Honestly after this glitch I hope Wastelanders adds a quest where you’re tasked with assassinating him.
---
Or at least sabotaging all his communication equipment.
---
Id probly pay 2k for the reduced weight for camp display
---
😅😅 class!!
---
Harpers Ferry is quite cool.. but don’t expect something too fancy
---
I usually ignore the level up challenges too much effort
---
This is the only one I know of (you'll have to press More a few times) - figure maybe it'll help with your guide, as it would be nice to have some details as well lol=)
---

They offered to sell me a suit of Raider PA. I'm still learning all the ins and outs of the game. Basically they said that they would drop the armor and sell me a round of ammo for the price. So maybe steal is not the right word and rather I just bought a super over priced .38 round. Jokes on that guy though, I was looking for that ammo.
---
Not familiar with that perk - I'll check it out.
---
Well, I tried. Game fucking froze right before it died. I don't have the 2000 caps to Shell out for a new card, and if I did, like you said I'd probably be screwed anyway. So much for getting a good fixer this weekend.
---
I have run over 250 events in the ash heap with no luck at getting the plan. I'd like to know too please.
---
I disagree. You get a massive warning that workshops are pvp the moment you try to initiate capture. Me and a lot of people don't initiate pvp for the workshop. The production rate and the resource cap make them basically worthless. We go there because sometimes people have incredible amounts of junk. If you give people 10 second warnings, then you have no junk to take. Most of those who do pvp in adventure don't do it just for to test/show their OP build. We want items without spending countless hours farming.
---
Reason why nuclear winter is not a good survival replacement is because you don't get to keep any of your items at the end of a match.
---
I don't want it for my rifle build. I want it for my new pure heavy guns build.
---
I already have a tse lever action and a aae handmade.
---
Yeah - that's how it worked out. My heavy gunner thing and my co-player with a serious melee build.
---
Every scorchbeast I have killed since Project Clean Appalachia started disappears as soon as it hits the ground.
---
All I use is a Gatling gun and the magazine is a waste of weight. The gun is so ammo efficient there’s no need to have more than 250.
---
Took a screenshot of your moronic comment. Nice try in deleting it
---
That's the thing - trying to concentrate on the queen with everything attacking you from the sides and behind. Once I heard the sound of a Mirelurk king behind me I knew I was in trouble.
---
Get a decent Instigating Lever if you mostly play solo, it’s way better than TSE.  AAE is a great handmade.
---
For a heavy build I recommend a good Gatling for your day to day gun, then get an LMG or Minigun for bosses/SBQ. An Instigating Gatling would be a good one if you mostly play solo.
---
That’s actually the custom name for my TSE Scorched Killer Gatlin Gun.  Small world...
---
There’s a lil bear in the hills NE of Welch in a little nook in the cliff wall behind a stump. He has chalk in his paw - and if you look closely at the tree stump in front of him, he drew a pic of a lil bear peeking behind a flower pot with butterflies. It’s hard to get to - look for the stump. So dang cute.
---
Haha, I think in Fallout 4 the children of atom actually had a Arch that sprayed radiation. Definitely not what I'm looking for though!
---
Whitesprings is the best imo.
---
Lots of raw violet flux at nuked Harper’s Ferry...
---
Glad you had fun taking on the queen.  What level are you?
---
Or have teeth...
---
B-but. There's s o ma n y
---
I started selling magazines at 15 and now list them at 35.  I am going to have to discount them again since sales have slowed.  I couldn't keep bobble heads at 45, but now I sell them to the vendor due to their weight and slow sales.  
---
As far as plans go, I get bursts of sales followed by a dead spell.  One person bought 16 today at once.  They were of all different varieties.  I have rare plans but only put one in the vendor at a time to make it seem more special and like a "discovery" for the purchaser.
---
Also, springs, adhesive, and anything requires to fix power armor sells for me.  I price way below vendor bots but high enough to be worth my trouble.
---
I like the idea but I know I’d get either a troubleshooter’s or exterminator’s... if I’m really lucky nocturnal.
---
ayo in case u missed it the Curator has found another body and it needs a proper burial
---
The only achievements I dont have is leave the vault and reclamation day :&gt;
---
People complained about the high damage builds, such as bloodied riflemen or melee and their capability to one shot. So Bethesda put a damage cap. That reduced the amount of people in survival considerably. Then they increased the power armor overall defense against bullets, so that the only way of killing them was faster fire rate and anti armor or some god roll railway riffle/ harpoon gun. Now a days a lot more legacy weapons (laser and flamers with explosive modifier) are being used in pvp in order to go through someones armor. However, to everyone else who doens't have one you pretty much have to brace or have a friend with one.
---
That all started with the damage cap, it reduced survival player base and Bethesda used that to take the mode away. It's a shame that even in survival people complained about pvp.
---
Why not both ?
---
But If you are going to get fallout 76 I can’t stress how important it is to :
---
Scrap all spare weapons and armour at a workbench you find to unlock mods 
---
Click “scrap all junk” at workbenches, then store the junk in your stash.
---
Hit up places with offices.  I know AMS has a few.
---
That's definitely helpful, thanks!
---
Im not on atm .  But there is a cemetery in the ash heap that has 3 safes you can lockpick.
---
Im level 22 took on the queen at level 20 i think
---
Good to know.
---
Morgantown airport has two inside in think. I just server hopped it until I got my trophy.
---
Instigating on an autoweapon? Interesting.
---
Damn,wish I had seen this.
---
Ehhh Chishito though
---
Omg. That sounds cute!
---
My wife and I once sat down to listen a nanny bot tell us a story.  Just as she reached the end of her story my wife sat on the x-box controller, that she had put down on the couch and her character swung a super sledge into the center mass of the poor level 1 nanny bot.  I'm still upset we didn't get to hear the end of the story.
---
What's your build?
---
On a real , buying fallout 76 and 4 will probably cost you a combined £30~ , just go for it.
---
if you think the point of workshops is to shoot people in the back and steal their junk, how about you uninstall and go find a new game to troll in? its pathetic that you admit you use this tactic and admit that you wouldn't even try to claim a workshop if you couldn't just ambush people with cheap shots. you prove my point perfectly. the point of the 10 second timer is because nobody likes people like you, you aren't looking for pvp, you're a cheapshot bitch who cant fight.
---
Oh yeah I've seen those to. The lil ginger bears wearing gas mask right?
---
Just changing the default paper bag would be a great idea. Sometimes they are hard to find if you drop your loot in the grass. :/
---
Rifle man perks.
---
This has never happened to me before, but I’m assuming now that survivor mode is gone... it’s just a matter of time.
---
