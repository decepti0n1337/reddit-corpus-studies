Todd says 'it just works' and until the players collectively stop giving Todd their money, Todd is not going to fix things.  Seriously, cut off the revenue and watch how fast Todd will change Todd's tune.  Todd.

Oh my god thank you so much for this.

Consoles feel left out. :( mod support cannot come soon enough- even just for QOL mods

You can no longer crash the servers using that method.

I was in one with a level 15. He was the mvp. He ran around and revived people endlessly. I actually did help keep the adds off of him. So they aren't all worthless.
---
Idk why people seem to think that ACP is that hard, I soloed it with PA and a JE .50 Cal and that was with me doing a miserable 12-25 dmg per shot(depending on Adrenaline stacks)

Glad it's over, ppl will run silos and encrypted again instead of wasting time for a lil scrip and mediocre rewards

If you're asking for the maths, this is your answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i9yv3i/no_it_isnt_a_bloodied_nerf_on_the_pts_its_a_nerf/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Depending on the weapon it can be anywhere from 40-60% and in some cases 90% overall damage reduction.
---

---
Most of my weapons will be 40-50% of there current damage output.

Pants down in a Morgantown alley, I'm guessing.

Finally, a pet that won't die or get lost.
---
Well, according to some other selfish asshats in the other recent thread about this, we're bad and toxic and should quit the game if we don't want lowbies ruining events.
---
Oh.  Oops!  I forgot, they also think it's offensive for me to call them lowbies.
---
Lol.
---
I don‚Äôt see them often in 76, mainly remember them from Far Harbor.

100% agree, hoping low levels will try the event and see that it's no joke, then take the time to actually level up to seriously participate
---
I used explosive on one and ultracite on another. With Demo Expert it has a big impact and ultracite did what its supposed to with scorched
---
Perfect. Thank you. I don't mind people hacking or cheating but don't fuckin' let it affect other's gameplay. (Granted, asking that is like asking the sky to turn another color, but c'est le vie.)
---
Because -- I dunno --- hmm, because he sped faster than me (I have speed demon) to the boss before anyone could get close and blasted him in 5 seconds? THAT MIGHT BE IT.
---
Also, I grabbed that snapshot before he killed him because the weapon looked cool. Assume elsewhere.
---
Most badass hunting rifle I've ever seen!
---
Because sometimes you get a piece of shit who will kill you with explosive bait between events. I left myself on a spit while afk until that happened, then I just started hiding nearby with a chameleon armor piece on.
---
Is it possible to complete Grahm‚Äôs Cook Out Event if everything is done EXCEPT contribute Prime Meat?
---
I often had only 3 Prime Meats because of the difficulty in completing the Primal Cuts Events to get Prime Meat.

This man is the true repair man.

still got em?

Hey, Bunna-bun escaped from that psychopath for a reason, and she hunted him down like a dog. The sentry bot is just trying to do the right thing.

True that, but SBQ nukes are pretty rare now with the Colossal Problem being fresh.

Maybe that‚Äôs what is happening to me. I wouldn‚Äôt know because I don‚Äôt know how to view my Xbox screen from my phone.

Moving you camp module within the camp boundaries changes your fast travel spot.

'...while Bethesda is working on a fix...'
---
Bwahhahahahahaha!  You new here or something?
---
Also, this has to be the biggest story twist on 76 Reddit today, An angry rant where Bethesda is not mentioned in the story.....
---
Haha thank you my friend. I've been playing since beta so I know a thing or two. Though I understand your anger, later on the game placed me with only two other guys (one level 40) and obviously we failed. 
---
Maybe with one wasteland it will balance a bit?

Put away the ruler, we have our winner.

You are correct, it's just the only thing that worked for me. 
---
Good luck man.
---
Thats what I think my build within the current system is, I'm foodie while i'm roaming, and optimised (within the confines of my spec's and perks) when I go for events.  
---
This nerf means i'm going to have to respec at least 3 points, and will have to gain 3 points for the perks I need as well,  which will mean losing 2 Qol perks and 6 levels, to regain my current "optimised" damage output (i've started saving my levels already)  I still have my fingers crossed that they may rework the nerf before general release though, or that I can offset some of the issue's caused by it, with the new legendary cards.
---
I got the game when it was on sale and so it‚Äôs been while. I played on and off and got on for the Wastelanders update, but now I plan on playing the game more since I have nothing else.
---
Username checks out.
---
I don't even know what the hell meat week is. I gave up plenty of 76 months ago. They can go ahead and test out their incomplete ( yet for some reason released )game on somebody else.
---
What does the screen say when you come back to the game? I would get logged off sometimes and it just said "Disconnected from the server" or something like that but I have no idea why that happens.
---
It's easier to die because visiting players keep shooting him ;_;
---
However unlike tamed animals he will respawn!
---
Jesus Christ the goatee shame was the funniest thing to ever hit TV.

Nah ps4. I‚Äôll open it back up to a frozen screen every single time

I‚Äôll come back from my 8 hrs at work to see ‚Äúdisconnected from server‚Äù on that screen

[removed]
---
Do we know how long the event will be enabled for?
---
Still got close to 2 weeks and you can always grind the repeatable :)
---
yep
---
I hope he wasn't a prophet, for your sake
---
What were they exactly?
---
I miss that show something fierce. Although I gotta say, I feel *The Good Place* is almost as good, if not just as good. Highly suggest it. Feels like it has the same kind of humor.

[deleted]
---
This happened during Prime Cuts too. When I kill the beasts as fast as possible, I got thumbs downs as if I‚Äôm a big bad bully taking away their xp, I let them fight they die repeatedly and eventually timer ran out before they could finish wave 2. Very, very annoying.
---
Its still such a hassle, they just need to make it sell all.
---
The Bog Outfit was the monthly exclusive. The bed was the weekly free/discounted item for FO1st subscribers. If you look on the FO1st tab in the atom shop the bed doesnt show there. Thats the bonus I am asking about. The one that appears on that tab
---
u/Ladydevann - can you please check to make sure this is "as intended"?  We already loose 30 pounds of carry weight .... for,-10% spoilage... is a joke.
---
Seen that happen a few times as well, very annoying
---
Not all mobs are built equal. Lv 60 scorch will lose against lv 20 yaoguai (most likely) for example.
---
PA has inherent DR reduction in excess of what is displayed as DR/ER. 
---
An identical DR/ER PA will outperform its non PA counterpart.
---
We don't have enough information to know what happened, but ghoul would be on the lower end of damage dealers, all things considered.
---
Isn't a meat week bonus week one of the brotherhood supply rewards?
---
Just wait till some Tesla cuck starts bucking a 999 tesla unlimited. That is LAG
---
It still destroys all your stuff
---
That's what I always got. Sometimes I get the same thing just playing the game normally too.
---
It was the ghost herd in the sky.
---
The repeatable are only good for 100 score right? I knock out 99% of the Dailey and weekly in a day or so
---
&gt; It would look *so* good with the Imposter Sheepsquatch Helmet 
---
I guess that they felt like there were already enough horror elements in this game that they did not add more. Also, they were probably afraid that they would have to raise the ESRB rating of the game.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wanamingo
---
Then don‚Äôt comment on a post about it. Or the subreddit about it.
---
That is what I would say if I was lying like you are!!!You say the guy literally got there before anyone else and blasted him, but on the screenshot, I can clearly see a dead person on the ground.
---
You are trying to tell me this - he rushed there and kill the boss in 5 seconds, that is not even enough time to spawn wendigos, so how did the guy in the back die that fast with no enemies around?
---
You are so lying and it only makes you look stupid. You probably just made up this story because of the weapon he has. Nice try.  
---
Edit: And wtf, how can hacked weapon make you run faster anyway?
---
Yeah I got no clue. I play on Xbox, sorry :(
---
Yeah? Haven‚Äôt seen it. I‚Äôll definitely check it out though. Thank you for the recommendation!
---
It does change color, at sunrise, sunset, night time, and daytime.
---
Back to the point, yeah, report him.
---
And +1 for using perk manager.
---
Hmm, a new loot pool? My 16k~ empty mole miner pails may finally have a purpose.
---
Believe it‚Äôs a visual glitch.
---
Yup only 100 score, but repeats. 
---
If you optimize yourself for xp you can make 100 score every minute or two doing super mutants/harpers ferry etc (it really depends on server hop and respawn etc). 
---
If you can do 100 score every 5 mins, in 60 mins you have 2k~, which is almost as much as a full day of dailies
---
Same, but it kept happening around the 3 hour mark because I‚Äôd come home from work and I‚Äôd have 9 meat cleavers in my inventory before I disconnected from server.
---
I really wish Wanderer would learn a few new songs.
---
Oh ffs
---
Perks that used to be multiplicative are additive. I don‚Äôt have details beyond that.
---
ya got about another 200 years (in game) for them to evolve.
---
see fallout 1-4 and new vagas for proof.
---
I also want an answer to thid
---
Yep and still no ingame marker or anything
---
Nope, my food is spoiling within the same day playing time, where as I could keep cooked meats for at least 2 (days) of gaming sessions.
---
Awesome! My miners helmet looks funny with this outfit
---
What an ignorant response, that's the equivalent of me claiming you're a duper or ammunition factory exploiter that has millions of rounds. All weapon damage is going to be different since damage multipliers from perks have been reworked. Player's damage have changed but the enemie's damage resistance still remain the same, so yes everything will still need more hits to kill no matter the build.
---
So they really are a true FEV monster. Not a mutated creature. Interesting
---
What kinds do you have?
---
I think that's just chance that it happened after 3 hours multiple times. I've had the same thing happen soon after logging in. I'd think it was server issues, but no one else seems to get booted with me. Maybe the game just randomly loses the connection of players at times.
---
I know, right? So many posts complaining and gatekeeping without doing anything about it :-/
---
Gatling plasma is 28 lbs without weight reduction
---
Looks legit...lmao
---
God I hope they do a giant robot of some kind.  With tons of miniguns and fatmans out of every possible angle
---
Just so the NPC involved in the quest can say "How.. How did a nuclear bomb DO THAT??"
---
I'm just asking what kind of damage should I bring I'm level 69 (nice) I do about 328 with a gatling bloodied is that enough do I need better protection
---
According to OP earlier in the thread, the old plans will be dropping again.
---
Right? So anti climactic. I was expecting a graphic/animation. Fanfare.  A rocket ship. Congratulations...something. anything.
---
It's not that simple.
---
I thought his damage resist was strange too. A few of us cut him down to 50% in a minute or two, I thought it was going to be easy. The next round took us to about 5 minutes to spare.
---
No ofcourse not, the mole rats! 
---
They are genetic modified because there ancestors were abducted once by aliens and after some experiments put back in the wild on earth, that made Them smart. The radiation Just made Them ugly.. duh
---
Something's gotta come of thee mothman cultists.  I want them to summon ~~cthulu~~ the dark one
---
I think Grahm's little song should get into the rotation on the radio.
---
Not yet. It's only on the PTS right now for testing; it's not yet known when the event proper will drop for regular servers.
---
I know right Travis cracks me up
---
https://youtu.be/gZwk8u-x6AU
---
Nerf it more, you say? Well, if you insist. 30%.
---
I never said stuff wouldn‚Äôt take more bullets, but people are completely overreacting and blowing it out of proportion. Enemies being a tad bit harder doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll need to start crafting a bunch more ammo, and with the new event and daily ops well be able to farm more ammo just by killing things. Yet you‚Äôre still acting like things are gonna need so much more that you‚Äôll be crafting noticeably more ammo, which just isn‚Äôt the case
---
WHY? DO THESE OBJECTS! KEEP MOVING! Oh yeah, because I moved them
---
For me it took quiet a long time as well to get to level 50 because i didnt really understand the grind. Only after i reched level 100+ i started leveling up really fast. Im 295lvl now it took me about 4 weeks to get from 100 to almoast 300 its crazy!
---
Quite hacked.  
---
Looks badass though.
---
I never considered this üëÄ brb gonna go check on Bunna-bun
---
They said the last meat cook would be noon's on the 26th. Which it was.
---
Thank you for the reply.
---
It never occurred to me that enemy strength at a given level wouldn't be balanced across the game.  I would have thought that a level 20 ghoul would be roughly on par with a level 20 super mutant or scorched.
---
Looked at from the point of view where type of enemy is a bigger consideration than level of enemy my overall experience with the armour makes a lot more sense now.
---
 I don‚Äôt know. I think I‚Äôll ask my roommate to check on my character next time meat week rolls around.
---
Yah just wish we could convert them faster...
---
That‚Äôs awesome!
---
Seriously though, if you collect the magazines I‚Äôm happy to try to fill any gaps in your collection.
---
I‚Äôll try to hit you up later!
---
FIX every mob. No goo, no ash pile. If you can't make a "feature" work consistently and reliably then don't do it.
---
Just send an invite when you get on. Ill see it and jump to you, should be simple.
---
If you give the brotherhood more wood than you gave to Grahm, we are not friends. 
---
Grahm only asked for what, 25 wood per week from each of us? And as a reward we got the best week Appalachia has seen all year.
---
If the BOS shows up with genocide in their eyes, I will defend Grahm and Chally to the death.
---
This. Sooo many times players were focused on tagging AND looting enemies instead of going after the remaining, fleeing, creatures. I'd run out and just kill whatever was far out to speed things up. Then one of these jerks actually messaged me that I was ruining the event. ü§î
---
I‚Äôve got all the mods, but not any salt, pepper, or spice. I can craft the base tenderizer and will mod it if I get the mats
---
Yeah, hopefully they‚Äôre going to be as strong as they were in FO2 - You did need some serious heavy weapons or Energy weapons to take them down.
---
I love this post. ü•∞
---
If the glass donation milestone gets completed, yes.
---
(which ^it ^^will ^^^be)
---
The 100 count is based on a tally of unique rewards from my inventory, and is not a guess. 
---
On the first two days, the event took some groups 5-6 mins. Several people, including myself, had researched it though and if you found even 1 other knowledgeable person you could complete it in ~3mins. When that happened on days 1-2, you could jump servers. Those first 2 days, I was able to complete an average of maybe 1.25-1.5 events per hour by server hopping. By day 3, I gave up trying because *everyone* had figured the event out by then and was doing it in 3mins.
---
It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhard‚Äù to do. Just extremely tedious. I set an hourly alarm on my phone for :55 after the hour, left my computer on but the game shut off, and then logged in around 57 after at the spot. I completed the event and logged out again. 
---
I do work for home right now so, during the work day, I would do the same thing. I‚Äôd work in a different room then pop upstairs to do the event. Since it was only a 5min time commitment, I only ever AFK‚Äôd it when I had a work call. Sometimes, I did have to skip the event if I was on a call that rolled over the changing of the hour. On the uncommon occasions that I AFKed the event, I always was on a spit or drum to contribute towards the progress.
---
Every other time I did the event, I would arrive early and participate on the drums or spits for the full first 2 mins, then switch to waste and fire duty, followed by wood, greens, and finally critters.
---
I am certain that I carried equally as many events as I AFK‚Äôed. Especially after ~9p on weekdays when server pops we‚Äôre lower. The number of people who ignored the waste piles and fires was, frankly, astounding.
---
Re:  the # of hours in the day, I have a 5mos old at home so my days start early. I‚Äôve also never been one to go to bed before midnight despite an early rise so I did this from 6a to midnight or later, burning sleep in favor of trying to get the plan.
---
I usually went afk when Graham‚Äôs meat cook came up (but I hopped onto the drums or a cooking spit to help out!) but I will 100% eradicate the brotherhood if they dare to harm Graham or Chally.
---
I would not say useless. But it definitely needs a buff.
---
Be cool if it unlocked a location that "winners" only/people who've completed Run could go to.
---
This works for me also.
---
If a bloodied build can get through this event on 20% health without dying they deserve an award.
---
Oh nice what are some of your favorite mods. I am looking at them now, i see perk load out omg I needed that why wasn't that implemented
---
This is very good to know.
---
Someone here a few days back said put the sample in, leave the building and re-enter.
---
Just to check, it really has those rounds in there, and is not the visual bug where the counter sometimes counts up?
---
I have an automatic combat rifle, 25 round magazine. When I fire full auto and let it auto reload, sometimes it shows 7 rounds left when it reloads, but when I count how many rounds were fired, it had fired 25 rounds, the 7 rounds showing was a visual bug.
---
I joined as a 28 (I have higher level characters so I know what‚Äôs up) on PS4 earlier and only died twice. I don‚Äôt understand how people can be so awful at the game
---
Would brown be worthless
---
Scout armor is the high end enclave armor. You can buy it from modus or try getting legendaries from events/the purveyor
---
Scout armor is the enclave armor. You won‚Äôt get the SS ghillie armor skin for like another dozen or so levels.
---
I've already put the sample in it wants me to analyse it but it won't work. Thanks though
---
Why would people panic over getting extra? This makes no sense. You could've just mentioned how Beth clearly posted the end date of Meat Week so they shouldn't have been surprised it ended on said date. The problem is the wording, but I agree we can be a bit ticky-tack at times.
---
Thanks, but you can keep her. I don‚Äôt need to hear that guitar riff again.
---
8 people would be a start
---
That's cool, and the point of this is helping the community. Luck rolling in those fat stacks of caps
---
there was a bug in the first release in this PTS round that meant unarmed weapons (gauntlets, etc) did hardly any damage at all because of a missing number in the calculation - that one's now fixed so it's working as intended.
---
I fixed it by putting the blood in the centrifuge and activating it before putting the T fuse in the fuse box.  That may work for you, I'm on ps4 btw
---
No problem, PSN is Aaron1128
---
Sixteen times the lag!
---
I have a Vampires, 25% FFR, 90% reduced weight one
---
Nah.
---
You will be fine! But leave the lv 5 weapons at home. ;)  good luck!
---
PSN is Aaron1128
---
tldr?  Where is this happening?
---
Damn it ok. TKS! I see that the SS ghillie isn't for another 15 or so levels. Damn
---
Yeah, then leave the building and go back in to analyze.
---
Spot on.
---
This event actually forces players to tweak their builds.
---
Highly doubtful higher levels after completing this event, are doing 
---
 the event over,and over again as a bloodied build.
---
Hoo boy they almost crippled me
---
When you say nothing referring to TLR, do you mean that you didn't actually recieve anything or it just kinda felt like nothing? 
---
I can agree w that, the bundle is cool, but not that exciting; especially once I noticed the galaxy light just glows instead of projects and I can't even put the gameboard on a wallpapered wall üòµ
---
I love this idea.  Would be awesome for a part of the map to have some sort of dynamic event like nukes and everything there would have the mechanics you listed.
---
I saw you. Let's just say nobody 'made you' pick up Chally's poop with a huge smile on your face. No judgment, just pointing out what I saw. üòÅ
---
Did you loot or interact with the PA that sometimes spawns in the prison yard? It might have put you as the owner of the chassis if you tried interact with it. So when you left the area it dumped the chassis into your inventory, along with the armor parts.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That's my guess on what happened.
---
Follow Rammadeus' guide. So brown is close to worthless.
---
I still hate myself for selling a red and forest outfit for 10 caps each when I was new lol
---
My .50 cal does that as well.
---
I constantly have this, thought I had a dodgy controller or something
---
I'll happily take them.
---
500 to 750 for camp decorations. 1000 to 3000 for plans. But that's just a guess. I know tenderizer plans are difficult but I am not sure how many people are double handed weapons.
---
I'm level 56, with only a few legendary armor.  I cant tell if I really even damage Earle.  But I am really good at peeling those little green guys off of you 100+ heroes in power armor, so I do that.  Seems to help every time I've done this event.
---
We might get that second helping in a few weeks. I'll be fasting till then. I put on so much weight. ü§ê
---
I hope so!
---
Came for this \~ need a "Could you not?" or "Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this" emote
---
I second this!
---
PTS some special events, some enemies are "mutated" and can't be killed except with a melee weapon, for example.
---
When will he be back?
---
If you are helping, I'll take you on a team every time.
---
IF your hunting sbqs only then sure go do the ultra whiners builds today , i should say BUILD because i know youve seen what ive seen if youve been joining public teams lol. Seems like you want the tippidity top of dam? IF you dont care that your going to see this game worse than it already is , go do bloodied and get bored within weeks :) Seriously other than sbq and collouses, just about any build is possible. i just dont understand what these other people are doing when they say only one or two builds are viable ..... unless you are only talking about sbq without mentioning it so you can get a "gotcha" in when talking about "viability" like lots like to do hahaha. MY pump is awesome, will take down anything in the game EASY on a "food build" ofc not the above mentioned tho ;)
---
Yes.
---
I‚Äôve got another . Smithy_bmx
---
I play bloodied and I think it kept making me heal past Nerd Rage even though I'm irradiated to hell. I was constantly healing up to about 75/308 HP.
---
I like earing : pull my finger kid
---
Add me then but i only have mounted creature plans
---
It might still with a few weeks in between.
---
Awesome. I know someone will be happy.
---
üòÇ
---
Are you running Healing Factor? I have two bloodied builds and the one without it doesn‚Äôt seem to have that issue.
---
I'm new to the game so I don't know but do Bethesda normally compensate players with Atoms for quests bugging out like this?
---
Some more chunky quest lines.
---
LOL nice
---
Just encountered this bug tonight. Left and rejoined two different servers because it would not advance. So frustrating.
---
Thanks for that.
---
Have done this event a few times now after dying over,and over again as a bloodied build during the event.
---
I finally figured this event requires a player to have enough life to survive at least long enough to Stimpack after the Collosus screams.
---
Ironic really that i have a Stash full of God Roll Queen killing bloodied weaponry.Including a bloodied mini-gun.
---
Yet the best weapon for the event running with a decent amount of health was my Zealots explosive 50 Cal with 30% damage to scorched.
---
This dropped so long ago,it was my first real exciting drop.And served me well.I couldn't get rid.
---
And hear i am again using my old friend effectively.Best weapon for me personally at this event by far.
---
The first issue is a big peeve of mine, even when buying and teying to figure out what I have and dont have. Switching is just an issue.
---
For the second one, my phone is almost glued to my hand, but switching through tabs and wasting time figuring out what something is is just tiresome. Seriously even plans should show more than a folder. 
---
That last one.....just kills me.
---
Use the fucks as cannon fodder, I‚Äôve only been able to do this bad ass event 3 times and every time u do it I have to deal with these fucks so yes. Let them draw the attention üòÇ
---
Is the min 3 ranks? I killed a bramin when I equiped rank 1 so I am pretty sure you can't use rank one üôÑ
---
I just saw it and picked up before leaving for work. From now on if it's not pink forest or red I'm leaving it.
---
You can‚Äôt fix stupidity
---
i had a lv 310 attack him with JUST a combat knife, no bloody build
---
Upvoting, didn't know that the magic effect had trouble here. Maybe it's the fact that you need to focus a single body part to trigger it, and the explosive effect can hit a second area, resetting it? I don't have a magic gauss mini so I can't really test it. Maybe you just have to shoot the queen's foot, haha.
---
I do have a TSE minigun, though, which is probably as close as you can get otherwise, and that thing misses half it's shots unless I'm closer than 15 feet away. Without the magic effect, a TS FFR gauss mini will do more damage to the queen, but it's going to need to land first so you can stick it up its nose...
---
The game doesn‚Äôt start at 100 lmao they‚Äôre is nothing to do after the main sorry other then grinding the same 3 dailies for bullion it‚Äôs an awful end game it is nice to get high enough to have a nice build and destroy things but that‚Äôs only fun for awhile
---
That's legit what an education's for
---
why do you lock your doors weirdo, what if a passerby needs a workbench?
---
Many of those players came in over the last two months and were able to easily join any SBQ fight without any real problems besides not getting any loot from her.
---
With the majority of highlevels just waiting for her to land, there were always wayy enough nannys around them. But earl is diffrent and we have to cover our own asses first to keep that shit going.
---
Dont expect us to revive you another 5 times after you got downed instantly again. Sry mate.
---
I am currently in a deep emotional state as I am stocking up my vendors.
---
I have had my camp for 2 characters set up right next to alpha for about maybe 8 months give or take. And no I have never seen this intimidating version of the Yao guai. Awesome capture! I hope and kinda hope I don‚Äôt encounter this guy lol
---
Will do!! Thanks
---
Try a bloody build. Or just get a bunch of rads
---
Even worse, when bloody mess procs and he explodes into a trillion pieces and you have to find one of his hairs to loot him
---
Have you tried a fresh install of the game ?
---
When i changed to SSHD and did a fresh game install,i logged in and played from where i left off.
---
Make sure you save your pictures though if you do this.That was all i lost.
---
Maybe mine was a combination of a shit hard drive and bugged downloads.
---
I hit max caps recently as someone was stwpping up to my vendors. I dont think he enjoyed me scrapping the vendors as he walked up. Went out and bought a bunch of stuff and still havent finished restocking.
---
Dam thes comments are hole some as fuck
---
I was there, the day Grahm slew the Emperor
---
Ok, I'm a complete dumbass....I had a full set of unyielding scout armor! I remember!!!!! But got rid of it when I finally got my full set of SS unyielding. Damn it!!!!
---
If it's a week or two ling event I'm going to be disappointed, it should be a regular event on the servers.
---
You don‚Äôt necessarily need 8, I do it in a team of 4 regularly absolutely fine, just more than 1 end game player
---
Not aggressively killing those things can result in their wandering off and the event failing.   Thumbs down in that situation mean less than nothing, except to indicate you're dealing with the clueless.   I did appreciate it today when someone motioned me over for a legendary, but I didn't expect him to do it on Prime Cuts.
---
Grahm's love for Chally was my favorite part of Meat Week, maybe even the entire Summer.
---
Being a stealh build I would highly recommend way more people. You want a lot of high levels there as they usually know what they are doing and there is some spots you can jump to that your not often hit at. Hard to describe in a text post. But you'll see them.
---
what do you have against my pipe revolver, man :(
---
The level 50s sure didn‚Äôt help. I remember being low leveled and taking potshots at the queen, but this is different. 
---
Completed it twice today with pretty much the same group of 8. Everyone was fairly high leveled (over 200) and we popped lunchboxes while waiting for the rubble to clear. 
---
It was still not easy (as it should be), but we completed both within 5 minutes.
---
There needs to be a level cap for this event. On the PTS, I played it (level 480) with a group all under 50. It was horrible.
---
Well, if you‚Äôre going to be using the SS armor then it‚Äôs no big loss.
---
I am getting Better.
---
Have 3 cursed Shovels.
---
Also the Wendigo Collosus Head.Which i think is really cool.Love the way they move creepily with the colours.
---
If you're armed with a pistol/rifle/whatever, does the equipped weapon magically become the staff, or become a twirl, or something?
---
Life tip, if you have no idea what you are talking about, don't speak.
---
Screw the Cult of the Mothman, I'm down for a Chally based religion
---
Which one and do you play on Xbox?
---
A subtitle saying **\[Radio Static\]** would be a pretty easy one.
---
If Chally can say \[Delighted Moo\] during the Meat-Cook, I don't see why they couldn't indicate the Radio noise.
---
I think I‚Äôm in the same boat as you are.  Maxed my settler rep, working on raider, doing their dailies, amassing bullion to get a secret service armor set (can‚Äôt convert fast enough).  I think there is another season and other stuff coming down the pipeline though.  I really need to improve on my camp too I JUST started building one...
---
In data mined files there is model for it
---
I just finished the run today and had exactly the same thought. Very anticlimactic.
---
I think bloodied is difficult in this event compared to others.   The next time I do it, I'll be taking off the rads and going full health with a vampire weapon.
---
Big F for those of us who actually use it.
---
That sounds like a Plan.
---
Yes, third week of Sept I think some people have mentioned.
---
So basically don't have fun, got it.
---
Would have been a good use for a new public team type. 
---
Make an Earle team, 2 full teams can go in and that's about it.
---
equip and unequip it to see the difference, 10% per up to 5
---
I get 1100 caps wonder why the big difference
---
Ah ok. Thanks. That worked!!
---
me too ... darn ...
---
2 of the tenderizer, 3 of the pepper mod.  Sold 1 tenderizer and 2 of the mods for 25k each so far.
---
Damn I'm honestly sorry to hear that
---
It just popped up before logging off at 5am.  Ran in after nuke went off
---
Not sure how it works exactly but when I came out there was a crowd of people.
---
Is it the first 8 in and then when the 5 minute timer is done and you drop down nobody else can enter?
---
Well the drums are just part of it, there's plenty more you could do to participate!
---
Good, one thing less to worry about.
---
You gotta check your power privilege and not use derogatory slurs like *lowbie*. 
---
Next time try "numerically disabled" or "gently leveled". C'mon dude, it's 2020.
---
Wtf how. I only use 8-10 ult plasma cores before he dies. I‚Äôm assuming your using a shitty weapon. I‚Äôve ran this event over 10 times now.
---
Even if you don‚Äôt make it out you still get the rewards.
---
This kept happening to me today ü§£ so annoying, 3 times in a row ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è didn‚Äôt die the rest of the event but as soon as earl died I kissed goodbye to my loot
---
I'm so sick of seeing them in vending that I thought I should start buying every last one less than 100 caps and dumping them in a the worst lake I could find.
---
How bout NO. 
---
*MODUS LIKED THAT*
---
Always been a fan of flaming medics , they always throw the best brunches.
---
Possibly third week of Sept I think if we achieve the Atlas event for the BOS.
---
I wont say level 100+ my brother is only level 80 and my friend is level 66 and both of them held their own when we did the event. Anyone who cant do it at their level is either buns at the game or buns at perk building
---
Yeah have fun curing the hangover with the included stims .)
---
If you don't mind me asking, which one? I've regularly had the "95% chance to hit but miss 4 times in a row". My shots hitting but not doing anything has been pretty recent(last few days) and it really sucks when enemies are rushing you but you're not hurting them
---
Hangover?
---
don't be sad - Graham walked through my camp two hours ago, with Chally
---
Once when I was fairly low level I was getting destroyed by Super Mutants at the General's Steakhouse, when Grahm came out of nowhere and saved my ass. Grahm will always have a special place in my heart for that.
---
Like I said. Min 50, for someone not planning and playing for fun, might take to 10p
---
Or they just dont have proper gear
---
If you ever played any other MMORPG, this would be your standard PUG.  Only the team leader can accept people.
---
My workbenches are outside, genius. He picked the lock on my lead extractor and stole my 14 lead scrap.
---
"Human...Grahm not feel so good"
---
No it is the same item unfortunately
---
For most things I just use my junkie's lever action (which I am built for) but the minigun downs scorchbeasts quicker (the ultracite ammo is kind of a pain to deal with though)
---
Yea it should be level 50 and up ONLY
---
For issue 1 just hold down when hitting the accept button you will move down to the next item in the list and not reset to the top
---
More tenderizer plans for me...excellent....
---
I wish they'd fix the bug where you can't use a stimpack until the barrel stops spinning on gatling plasmas, miniguns, etc.
---
Ha that's awful.
---
I could have used some low level fodder earlier. Joined the event, it put me into an instance alone, even though it said only four players were active in the event.
---
I pulled him down to half health pretty quick as he was going through the opening motions. But then I died and he went back to full health. By that time there were so many wendigos I couldn't get steady fire on earl with out taking massive damage or dying, which caused him to regen all health since I was the only player.
---
If I would have had a couple low levels distractions I know I could have ended it. I just gave up, no one was joining and I realized I was just wasting ammo.
---
But yea, damn event needs a level cap, and it's obvious that low player count instanced events are a horrible idea.
---
SS business suit. Plans cost 5000 gold
---
I never get why low levels do this, I'm level 35 and know to not go fight a big ass mutated wendigo cos it'll just eat my ass. I'll just stick to fighting ticks the size of my torso. It's more my level
---
Aim for the heads will do a lot of damage, stay crouched and keep moving, you‚Äôll be in caution but not in danger. But boss fights as rifleman is tough since even the best rifle (lever?) doesn‚Äôt have very high dps. Commando or heavy gunner will be quicker.
---
I agree. I did it with two level 40's one day. Plus I still don't even have the achievement for resing. I also have never failed ? in like 20 attempts. I have died being greedy before looting earl tho and that sucks but is pretty funny honestly.
---
Go donate, the reward is alcohol and stims.
---
The idea behind that is some players believe that the event scales in difficulty based on player count.
---
 Bethesda does not have any documents that say anything to the contrary.
---
So sometimes you get a "good samaritan" who does a spot of pest control.
---
 I fully support the killing of LONG term AFK's  (30 mins plus, if you didn't fight for it,  you dont deserve to get it)  in public events, however I dont support the use of explosive bait for camp demolition or griefing events.
---
I think Skeet shooter in perception does that
---
I exit vats automatically after the first shot on mobs, especially when they're chasing someone else. I tend to miss a lot of shots that have 95% hit chance, even with my B33 handmade and almost 40 perception. 
---
I've also been slapped by the 0 damage bug and occasionally my vats crits miss but still register at the top of the screen
---
I think alot of games use that timer as a way to avoid people fighting stuff above what they can handle, or not having enough people.
---
Example:
---
You have a boss fight, you fight it, deal some daamge, but die in the process. If you instantly respawn, you can run in there before health regens, do a little more damage and die again. Wash, rinse, repeat.
---
I would think "skeet shooter" would work, I don't use it though. "Your shotguns have improved accuracy and spread." If you use VATS, it can cause your gauss to act like a sniper at times though.
---
It gives you 10 seconds or so before the rads start killing you once your outside. That‚Äôs enough time to put a hazmat or stealth suit on.
---
There's a LOT of stuff that's not implemented in the game that really should be. My suggestion? Treat it like a shopping trip. Take an hour and prowl through Nexus' mod list. I tend to go to about page 10 with them filtered to show the most downloaded first. I bookmark the ones that look neat and when I download a Mod Config tool (I use Fallout 76 Quick Configuration, just search for it on Nexus.) I install them all. 
---
The Quick Config makes it STUPID easy and it has a lot of tweaks to make the game run better too. As far as my FAVORITE mods?
---
I have both inventory mods. They're a godsend. (They will change the game for you in such a good way!)
---
 - **Better Inventory**
---
 - **Lyravega's Item Sorting**. 
---
Another mod that I really like is called '**Save Everything**'. The primary purpose of it is kind of outdated, but it allows me to use the keypad when buying/selling stuff. Instead of the slider.
---
'**intRaw**' is also another really good one. No more do you have to guess at how much budget you have left or how much things cost! It tells you an ACTUAL NUMBER. Super handy for squeezing as much value out of your CAMP as you can.
---
Probably the last two are '**Power Armor Clean Hud**' (it removes the backing to the hud so it's transparent, really allowing you to see better while in PA) and '**Power Armor Quick Exit/Entrance**.' This second one basically forces the game to use the combat entry/exit to PA. It's SOOOOO much faster. 
---
Hope these help!
---
Bespoke. Oxford's not brogued.
---
Eh, not really. they‚Äôll just fix it and apologize for the bug. now if it has to do with atom challenges, they will probably compensate
---
I have really enjoyed this event.
---
For the love of God people, leave your Tesla Rifles in the Stash Box for this event.
---
Only time i have experienced any sort of issues is when a player just permanently has their finger on a Tesla trigger during the event.Seems to not just affect the FPS during event, but affect the server.Hope this gets fixed.
---
Before anybody says it is an issue my end,thumbs down,angry face emojis,and players bailing out of the event says it isn't.
---
Thanks
---
Ik, it sucks, but Bethesda‚Äôs still Ghetto
---
It's a godsend. I don't think I could play without it once I got past so many different perk setups.
---
So you have noticed a difference as well?
---
This game desperately needs UI upgrades as well as streamline some of the menus to make them easier to access. An example would be the the perk screen doing away with pop up notifications or a cosmetic tab that is separate from armor. There are plenty of other small ideas out there that they could incorporate into this game that would make it a lot easier to navigate.
---
Yea i definitely agree with a level 50 floor for entering the event, or have it programmed so that low levels only enter the event with other low levels just to get them to realize they aren't fucking welcome
---
This is awesome. I still have 38 useless pounds of dusty pails just waiting to be cracked open. I literally almost sold them all for dirt cheap today too. Crisis averted!
---
AFK people on a spit or drums are 100% helping during every single event they're there for. Killing them just makes you a piece of shit and makes the meter fill up slower.
---
Even if you have the notes it's still nearly a month of gold exchanges. Jeeez.
---
Have you ever done ACP? Do you know how it runs? It sounds like you don't.
---
I'm not gonna waste any more time on you. I deal with enough ignorance at work, don't need to waste my time on others.
---
It's so freaking hard to solve it traditionally. Props to Bethesda to go all the way on it though
---
For me, there is a huge amount of respect for a bloodied build that isn't having a tenper-tantrum right now.
---
I've had people try to lecture me and get downright angry at me for not doing a bloody build. Some people in this game have mental problems. Just blow them off and keep having fun!
---
Sincerely, a v/e/90 carnavore.
---
lmfao: thank you for clearing up my ignorance, I definitely dropped the ball hard there. And thanks for the luck too!
---
I had no idea you could buy plans off him lol! Looks like I missed my chance
---
The only task in the second round of project bravo that counts is the possibility of a second meat week if we donate 250.000.000 glass between september 7-10.
---
After the main missionsand side missions, there's nothing to do.  Isn't that every game?
---
No mod, but Formula P works.
---
Man, I exclusively ran lone wanderer until Wastelanders came out.  I haven't used it much since, normally just running tenderizer.  I may start running it again now that my friends have quit lol
---
Also speaking as an IT guy, having your GPU run for extended periods without or very limited frame change can cause damage to your hardware or in xbox terms the red ring of death from component exhaustion and or over heating.
---
Play medic and/or get ADS off of us, and we're golden.
---
I use it on my melee character, which I haven't played in a while. What I meant was "Big F for those of us who actually use it if this post is true."
---
7 times, only dupe I‚Äôve got is 2 mounted head plans, that‚Äôs some real bad luck on rolls. üò¨
---
Welcome to fallout 76. Where they timegate arbitrary things.
---
How‚Äôd you level up so fast?
---
Hope you enjoy it! &lt;3
---
I forgot this "event" was still an ongoing thing.
---
Lmao fallout games are endless they‚Äôre is always  something to do on the other ones don‚Äôt give me that. I had a ton of fun on this game but it‚Äôs such a let down when you‚Äôre a high level compared to the other games
---
Thanks for the advice I'll bring a shotgun build and some decent armor
---
Gotcha üëçüèº
---
Mine is 79.
---
Yes, cap please.
---
Also, sorry for your RNG.
---
The best thing about meat week was the meat we cooked along the way.
---
What content is there to do when you've done all the content?
---
On the rotating spits yes, drum not so much (at least on pc they dont help)
---
Ps I thought you where orginally talking about the drums on the prime cuts hunting events, not the cook out part.
---
We'll get em next time bois. Wait no we won't
---
Hahahaha.  &lt;3
---
I made a post about this after the PC update last week. That's when I noticed it. Since then it seems to work sometimes and not others.
---
Don't just do the 3 WL dailies, do the four others that proc as well. They award scrip, enough to turn 150 per day into 200 per day, plus they now have a chance to drop WL gear. I know it doesn't sound like much, but over time it adds up. You'll want a lot of legendary modules when it's time to craft up that gear. And yeah, if you're not into farming and build experimentation or doing the boss fights you'll only have about an hour's worth of play per day.
---
It's not about panic, it's about sending a message. Everything burns.
---
What type of power armor are you trying to put it on? Communist skin isn't a type, it's a skin. Is it T-60, Ultracite, what.
---
If you wouldn't jump into the center of the Queen fight with what you have...you most definitely don't want to tussle with Earle. My first one I thought i was good to go. Lots of ammo, healing items, my regular powerarmor. Nope...died twice...sure didn't seem to touch his health. So the next few...full Queen gear with added buffs. I use ultracite gatling laser ffr...usage buffs...8 to 10 cores.
---
Ultra cite
---
Definitely.
---
Experienced this today myself on PS4.
---
Some Clown kept his finger on the trigger of his Tesla,and the FPS got more,and more unstable until everyone just bailed out of the event.
---
It affected the whole server.
---
I actually logged out and back in again to correct it.
---
Some right arseholes in this World.
---
Yeah it's 8 code pieces, along with a keyword that's unveiled one letter at a time throughout the week. It's found on the wall of the general's office in the Bukker. Nukacrypt bruteforces the password at the beginning of the week though, with only 1 letter uncovered, using hundreds of keycards
---
Explore a world that‚Äôs actually worth exploring way more misc quests, companions, DLC. What is they‚Äôre to do on this after level 100 (if you‚Äôre going for a max build and not just quests which can be done by 50) the end game is a let down homie
---
Bless you and all the kind souls that emote "follow me" for the impossibly hard to find exit at the end!
---
Stash your junk.
---
And honey, someone taking your junk isn't "toxic."  I've had rape threats and other profane things said towards me on area chat. *That's* toxicity.
---
GRAHM AND CHALLY LIVE!!!!
---
I got the cursed shovel. Wanna trade üòÖ?
---
People have been doing that on their own for a while. I've been hired to build camps a few times, by people who visit mine, like what I did and message me asking me to build them one too.
---
You also see advertisements and wanted ads on the trading sub, of people who build and also people who are looking to hire a builder.
---
No, from the way it is worded the 3 just does more healing than 1
---
They all look bad compared too NV anyway so I dunno why u would want more. They're so convoluted compared too the much better looking NV one it's almost an offence
---
Ultracite now i get the comment sorry manüòÖüòÖ
---
You are right.
---
Have only seen it two times, at both these events.
---
Why thank you üòÄ
---
Nope
---
If you're the lowest level, you need to be able to at least take on those level 75 wendigo spawn and also be the healer when people go down.  I am not the lowest level in our group but I do have the weapons which do the least damage so I get hits on Earle as much as I can and then help to minimize ads in the room and make a dash for people who are downed.
---
I've had voice chat on mute since like week 2 and don't have an issue in team events.
---
I intend on donating exactly nothing whilst still getting all the rewards because Bethesda have been making up the numbers anyway.
---
I dunno I like it. Don‚Äôt know why but I like exploring and legendary grinding. The end game is perfecting your loot/ build tbh.
---
Scorched earth is a repeatable event and running a nuke is a repeatable quest so it doesn‚Äôt matter
---
130 days later and I am suffering the same fate. Did you ever get around this?
---
The fuck did you expect?
---
No i kinda of agree waaaayyyy toooo glossy also on the base one the mask should be a more gray metallic color not fucking black but in my opinion it the best looking helmet and outfit in game only rivaled by the Reclaimed Deep Mining Gas Mask but this is all my opinion
---
I sacrificed all but 2 of my SCORE dailies to the swift blade of autocompletion to witness this quiet lie of an ending. I was devastated...
---
Awesome thanks
---
I always play with my wife. It's pretty dope actually. But idk man find some discords. That's how I always found partners for Hunt: Showdown and Tarkov. Or I'd go hang out in certain streams and get to know people. Internet friends are way better when it comes to consistent partners.
---
Have u played NV?
---
Ok, so I‚Äôm not imagining it... lol 
---
Didn‚Äôt see your post... sorry ... will watch tomorrow again to see if there‚Äôs still a difference
---
The toxic thing here is that after i sent him a wtf, he had reported me for toxic behavior and I am now communication banned. I‚Äôm not salty about the junk at all, it‚Äôs his reply on being called out (?) on it
---
Dead scorchbeasts
---
Yes loved it
---
Wow no kidding ? What's the trading sub called?
---
Ah, thank you!
---
I will attempt a hat trick later.
---
If it's the Chinese one that's for the excavator.and like I said excavator's don't have jetpacks.
---
Just bury me please
---
Bloody Mess, too.
---
BaTHeSHDa PLZZZZ NeRF ErL!!!!!
---
I wouldnt MINE that. Jk I hate all the cursed gear
---
It's ok! No worries‚ò∫ yeah it's definitely happening to me too
---
I‚Äôm not but I have a friend who runs a bloody gunslinger.
---
Tenderiser plans are tens of thousands of caps.
---
There is another one coming up pretty soon
---
tbh, the local raiders sounded the alarm and opened fire when i left.  they've survived the same thing before, so i expect they're fine ( lol )
---
Im sad boi
---
And you're sure you've learned the ultracite jetpack mod? Do you need to equip the Power Smith perk in Intelligence to apply it?
---
I think I just found my new favorite hat.
---
The "end game" for fo4 was too. I did all of the quests, and there was nothing left to do.
---
Sorry, I'm on call for my work and tonight is a loss for me. I'll still add you as I play regularly when I can
---
29 if you're running Serendipity, since 30% Health is the threshold for it activating.
---
'course if you're doing it in power armor, you should have Emergency Protocols on your Torso, and just stay at 20%.  Combine that with Blocker and Fireproof and maybe even Dodgy if you're not using VATS a lot while in your PA...yeah.  Percentage-based damage resistance for days.
---
Public test server? Still not there for me!
---
I don't have an option to claim it again.
---
I'm a level 26, just started playing a week ago...how do I help donate?
---
I got every mod for it but not the tenderizer itself.
---
Try the Nuka girl Helmet, it seems to support eyewear.
---
I can't get my wife to play it haha.  She likes mmos but not Bethesda's games.  
---
I'm fine playing solo, though.  Sad the good times are over, but I played my first 120 levels alone and it's easier now that you can join public groups.
---
Thanks maybe it was just bugged when I killed my milking cow, I will have to do some testing, I don't want to kill a brahmin in free range.. don't want to be that guy!
---
I totally disagree. Love the game and grind. My RNG is unreal tho :D
---
Where is his only fans?
---
I changed my stealth rifleman to a stealth commando and put an automatic receiver on my fixer. Made a huge difference to this fight, especially if you get a vats lock on one of the heads.
---
Why do you ask
---
The rounds are still in there since if you stash the weapon and cancel the reload you can keep firing off the same core when you pull the gun back out
---
I‚Äôm about to get into heavy weapons like the ones that go brrrrrrr for the first time, any tips?
---
IS THAT WHAT THAT IS??? god i've died so many times to bloodbugs and stuff because I just can't stimpack
---
You'll float too, Georgie!
---
Awesome at least now i know im not the only one
---
The last part of your comment is so true.
---
If yall cant solo this shit I don't want you in my team level 200+ only
---
Dont forget repair kits. I broke my main weapon about 3/4 through last time. Smdh
---
Lol I saw that porta potty on my ill-fated run but didn‚Äôt have time to peek inside.  Good to know!
---
Exactly!  I did this the other night after Earle's regen. I went around taking down the spawns so the heavy hitters had an easier time.
---
It‚Äôs a pretty solid build from what I see.
---
I vote all runs of Earl have at least four people singing various Rammstein songs.
---
I'm on console. You won't be able to claim in the PTS  because you need the season 1 Legendary Run game board not the Armor Ace board.
---
I read this in my mind with toddy's voice.
---
When I built mine the only thing I knew I wanted was a lead extractor. So after I explored around a bit I finally found one i placed my camp, placed the extractor and put some floors around it and went from there. Now I have my permanent camp and I bet I'll be there for the rest of my fallout 76 life. Love how it turned out, I use a bunch of decorations to make it not look so industrial around the extractor and a radio to drown out some of the noise it makes
---
This is over complicating the issue. Why do I need to wait. Just make ammo scrapable
---
It is but the gun is the hardest part to me. Don't know about others though
---
Junkies, bashing, faster reload. It‚Äôs a VATS death dealer.
---
I was there for approximately 45 seconds before the event ended.  Seriously, it seemed like it must have been a cool event when I missed it last year, but this event came at a time where I really needed a break from gaming like a part time job and I just couldn't get on to put in the work.  The one time it was up while I was playing, it was over before I knew it.  Like an event that just consists of only the resource gathering part at the beginning of fasnacht with players either afk or waiting with inventories full of the stuff needed to finish it in seconds.
---
It did not live up to the hype.
---
Make sure to do all the settlers missions too until you get that warning with them, or else you‚Äôll miss out on a free Chinese stealth suit
---
I've only managed to get in once and halfway through his second health bar he clipped through the ceiling and was invincible for the last ten minutes.
---
Worked like a charm, thanks.
---
It‚Äôs actually pretty strong if you can get past the low durability. And I have the weapon artisan perk maxed out so I can repair all my weapons to 200%.
---
Hmm, it could be possibly because I already had the atom store Captain Cosmos helm perhaps if they're just being lazy and reusing that asset.
---
Its just called black suit, the npc's wear a dirty version though, there is a clean version in the files and and atom store images for it but I don't think either have ever came out. The glasses are just the shades you can get in-game. I want the suit too.
---
If you have not done a single settlers quest, I *strongly* urge you to do so before committing with the raiders. 
---
You will likely be very upset if you do not finish the settlers missions up to the point when it's time to make a decision to pick a side. 
---
When both factions are asking you to commit, then pick one of your choice.
---
Um
---
What weapon perks do you have the most of? Shotgunner, heavy gunner, martial artist etc
---
I have the shades, they are just sunglasses. The closest I could get is the dirty tan suit. Thanks for the info.
---
If you already had it from the Atom Shop then you already have it and would not need to claim it.
---
Are you talking about the first shot you take in vats that usually always misses?  I JUST invested in a guass shotgun today and noticed this....
---
Damn, I was really hoping that the legendary run versions would have matching colours...
---
Lol no. I stay until the roof collapses. Gotta loot those screws. Then I pray to Jet for no fast travel bug and FT out of there.
---
HA HA.  BIG LETTERS MAKE LITTLE MAN READ IN SUPER MUTANT VOICE.
---
*Wolf whistle*
---
I can build a set for you if you‚Äôre on PS4
---
I'd gladly help you purge Appalachia of all mounted heads
---
I have a character who runs a slayers gunslinger build. He carries a slayer type + 33% vats/explosive for every type of creature in the game :)
---
What platform you on? I am ps4
---
It‚Äôs not that it doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs that it only triggers when you‚Äôre hitting the same part, high FPS, and 200+ firerate. The gauss mini has explosive effect meaning it doesn‚Äôt need the super high firerate but on anything you actually need the magic effect on (that doesn‚Äôt already die in 2 seconds), which is the queen and earl, they‚Äôre immune to explosive. Meaning it just doesn‚Äôt work on them. Plus Xbox never gets high framerate at either of those events so it wouldn‚Äôt trigger anyway
---
I just use the white shirt and slacks/ the shades for now, look okay just more casual than a suit.
---
I have slugger, expert slugger and master slugger all at 3* as I was using the heavy all rise for quite a while
---
Other weapon perks are only 1* however I have a few level ups saved for making a build so could rank some up
---
Ya...
---
Gotta find something that you enjoy.  For me it was building different camps and making them look real and not like giant polygon sets.  For a while I had fun taking workshops and building weird shit in them then leaving it to be discovered.  Lately I've been having fun engaging in PvP at workshops.  But you're right, there's really not much to do.  You're really got to reach to find something.  It's mind boggling that they had actual group content and then yanked it.  I'm dying to make my character into a support role and play as a groups "healer".  This game needs group content beyond "be in a group while standing here holding down your trigger for 5 minutes while shooting queen/earle."
---
I was also there to watch it end. It was right as the Atomic Shop was updated. I asked him why he decided to leave so abruptly. He said, "Grahm no meat-cook meat when Bethesda put Grelok stinky pile in shop." And off he went.
---
Sounds to me like your a Filthy casual player my friend. That's an excellent sub on here you should check out. It's made by players just like you. That being said unless those are weapons you use and genuinely enjoy using I personally wouldn't spend the effort reworking your build around them. But as for what's next just find whatever you enjoy doing. That's what the game pretty much is, it's an open world full of absolutely random ways to play. I know people that literally just like making their base and brewing alcohol to sell at the base. Some people just scavenge supplies to make and sell ammo. Me I just do whatever I feel like for that day, usually knock out the dailies to get that legendary run done, I like certain events and have been meaning to try alot of other things, I have tons of treasure maps I keep meaning to go hunt down, and mostly I've just been spending alot of time trying to do the main wastelanders stuff but keep getting sidetracked on my limited play time. I hope this hasn't been too much rambly and meandering for you and I hope it provides some help, either way, keep having fun bud!
---
My main character runs a bloodied 10mm and .44 revolver with a 15% faster reload as well as a instigating black powder pistol, and im on xb1
---
Powerful weapon, but it‚Äôs a little disappointing when it does that.  Leaves you open to attack when that first shot totally misses...
---
Weapons to scrip I got, I need to be able to scrip more per day now that ACP drops are two three stars usually.
---
Yeah that's it lol. I end up mashing the button and slamming like 5 stims in a row, very annoying. I now use a 50 cal on harder fights.
---
Ahhh yes gatekeeping is the way to go. What a wonderful welcoming community. What a joke. Sure they may not help much. But its Bethesdas responsibility, not theirs. They paid for the game, same as you. Be mad all you want.
---
When you are about to move camp, disconnect each vendor from each other and any generators. Place the vending machines on the terrain, not on a foundation.
---
When you move camp, the vending machines will be in blueprints still stocked. Before you build anything else, place the vending machines. You can move them later. This also works for displays. I place the vending machines and displays before building anything in a new camp and it saves the things in them.
---
The DLC for fo76 is literally ongoing. They just had ATLAs, wastelanders, companions, meat week  faschnacht, misc quests like order of tadpole challenges and wasted on nukashine; none of these were present at launch.
---
As for the world itself, today, it was the first time i thoroughly explored Watoga civic centre. Have you ever been inside? I don't recall any quest taking me there and it was a very interesting experience.
---
Did you know there's a system of tunnels underneath the highway that runs north from Watoga? I didnt until a few months ago. You can build in the tunnels. There are signs someone used to live in them.
---
Not just the gauss shotgun, any weapon with "hold trigger to charge" is fucky in VATS. Bugs been on the gauss rifle since day 1, but now that we have a shotgun, pistol and bow, they all got the same bug...
---
You‚Äôre probably addicted to alcohol and didn‚Äôt realize because it shows up in another section
---
I thought I was buying the suit when Wastelanders dropped and the under armor was incorrectly labeled secret service suit sold by Reg.
---
Because you can read.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the time those low levels are tweenagers/young teenagers. I'm occasionally in a party chat with two of them and they think they can take on the world yet are also always asking myself and the other older people in the group for ammo and gear. Had one try to solo launch a nuke a while ago after everyone else in the group repeatedly told him he wasn't ready. How not ready? He was running around in just a hazmat suit and being repeatedly downed in the forest area. When he got part way through the silo and ran out of stims and ammo, he came crying to us for help and then told us we were being mean to him when we refused to come bail him out.
---
I mean even after lvl 50 with proper build awareness and itemization, there are still times when things can get botched. I dropped into the event in a rush to make it in time forgetting to reup on stims, then some new guns i was trying out ran out of ammo, and i kept getting aggro when melee.. there were only five of us, and one was lvl 37. I hopped on my mic to apologize for not even having stims to save anyone, even tho i did save one person while i still had a few.
---
Well tomorrow starts project Bravo for helping gather supplies for the Brotherhood of Steel, the first item on Bravo‚Äôs list is 150million pieces of wood. 
---
Before anything you‚Äôll need a minimum of 250 pieces of wood to donate, next you‚Äôll have to travel to the Atlas Observatory in the savage divide- this is a high level area so be careful when traveling. The savage divide is the long white part of land that divides (hence its name) the other five regions of the map. 
---
Atlas Observatory should be fairly easy to find since it has a graphic on the map that looks like (you guessed it) an observatory! When you get there there will be donation boxes around the front area, the easiest one to find is near Russell Dorsey, he can tell you more about the brotherhood and why he wants to help them.
---
It didn't work on my partner's pet Yao guai üò©. He couldn't heal it either.
---
This is exciting. I actually enjoyed the first event
---
Quad barrel missile launcher is like 40 lol
---
Makes me wonder of you need a certain rank for the fire healing to outpace the ballistic damage or something. I've never actually tried using FF before.
---
wouldn't be surprised hahahah
---
But now you can just ditch or sell the heavy scrip weapons and hoard the Cursed stuff!
---
Would be much better though if they increased the daily limit yes.
---
That's impressive
---
&gt; When you are selling an item from your Stash, it scrolls you all the way up to the top of the list, it makes it a little annoying when you have to scroll down each time, especially when you have moved your camp and you have to restock up to 120 items. Back and forth, back and forth.
---
I find (on PC) if I hit Enter and then down arrow immediately after (very quickly) on the screen where I set the price, the down arrow command moves me to the next item in the list before the cursor has a chance to jump me up to the item I just put up for sale.
---
Until the next one starts
---
I had a two shot vats combat shotgun and it didn‚Äôt seem to do anything although I don‚Äôt have a shotgun build either so no extra damage on top of the base.
---
The suspenders and slacks wouldn't look to bad either. Kinda like you took your jacket off for some air.
---
Please stop Earl from glitching into the ceiling. Funniest thing i saw this morning was a melee guy standing on 3 sets of PA so he could keep hitting him.
---
Oh man, Sylvie &amp; Sons is going to be barren all week isn't it? I better go up there with Woodchuck turned on tonight so I have enough for myself for the week.
---
Did they try doing it recently? I was able to heal mine (also a yao guai funny enough) with a shishkebab yesterday.
---
Good idea
---
thank you I would never have looked there
---
Meat weak
---
YES!
---
I hope the Croc bag drops for me, it's the only bag I want :/
---
The way you fix this is quest lock it and set a minimum level.  Mmo content design 101.
---
That sledge if modded out is damn fine and worth building 2h melee around. Get your 15 in strength with max blocker and incisor. As bloodied you'll need nerd rage in intelligence and want serendipity in luck for when you're not using power armor. Strongly suggest dodgy and adrenaline in agility also. Besides that you have freedom with perk points since you're probably not sneaking or using much vats.
---
I‚Äôm tellin ya I use a two shot combat with 2 full shorty perk cards and a few select others, they don‚Äôt get time to say ‚ÄúBFDICKSNXOSNXKSOFBDJ‚Äù and smack you
---
What a useful comment
---
Make arrows as well. It's just plastic and adhesive from memory and it gives you heaps of points
---
Same rewards if you die and spawn outside as you get when you make the run out of the mine. Only difference is the trunk by the entrance that only has junk in it anyway. It's far more lucrative to stay in the mine so you can fight and loot the Windego until you either die or time runs out.

---
Took about 40 Earle victories to gather all cursed weapons and plans from that event.
---
I love those extra stats and would love to see them in FO76.
---
Have you tried the drum with the thunderpipe mod? Does it have the same issue? I‚Äôm not sure if I want to use it as a build(at least not until loadouts are released), but I love how the gat handles. Would really like to go heavy bloodied on the colossal
---
Oh man you will love it It way more active then fo76 server wise 
---
The most magical moment is walking into town and hearing a group of ppl chatting
---
So like, I can‚Äôt just loot clothing off of corpses? or does that come later. Lol
---
They postpone meat week, then doesn't properly change the end date!
---
Oh ok, I think I stumbled upon that place the other day. I have lots of wood after finding that lumber camp so I'll do my part. Thanks!!
---
On my heavy, I use a plasma caster to take care of wendigos, kills em fast. 
---
On my stealth junkies rifleman, wendigos are free xp for my rifle and I actually switch over to an explosive gatling laser for the big guy.
---
Need to bring my pistol fella next!
---
:'(
---
Right this happened to me the second time, I want to loot the room and earl
---
Perfect Thankyou I‚Äôll give that setup a go, just modded the sledge you‚Äôre heavy spiked
---
Really. That‚Äôs so bizarre
---
Thankyou I‚Äôll start on that quest line now
---
My face hurts!! That was hilarious!!
---
Cheers for the heads up
---
Oh yeah that does suck if you don't get a chance to loot Earle!!
---
You and me both
---
Some skills still do unfortunately, but they're datamined so its not hard to figure out
---
The communist jp needs t60 jp learned. It's part of the bug that lets it work on excavator torso.
---
Items that are on feature in this week's atom stuff are visible in build menu. I think the items you mentioned all just left the featured list today.
---
The settlers/raiders tent might be only available for people who had fo1st when wastelanders first launched. I'm not sure.
---
We cauterise your wounds and spot weld your robots!
---
Yeah i was always looking to solo em. Suprised not many would show up in cranberry bog. The mire which spawned the legendary queen mirelurk i was able to solo on a public server often, too. The one that spawns sheepsquatch there'd always be some other person joining after i had been at it solo, but at least that one the legendary spawn was easy to spot. Whereas the one in the divide i never saw the legendary once, and it was always a large group joining mostly
---
I don't have Thunderpipe so I can't really say. The issue is that the handle on the drum lines up exactly with the sight. So it blocks the crosshair itself but it doesn't block the targeting area.
---
The drum is 500 rnds, so if you get a legendary buff that adds DR on reload, you probably won't be using that buff very often
---
Yes
---
3 times isn't really a good tell if something is rare or not. RNG can very often say f you 3 times in a row.
---
The brahmin grills and the clean grills were meat week items, one was a plan that dropped from the event and the others were atom shop items
---
Meat week second helping is in a month, maybe they will bring them back
---
Nice. So you have a couple options in my opinion in what you can do, some people really like maximizing their build to make it as strong and perfect as possible, and that‚Äôs motivation on its own to continue playing events and missions, so you can get more level to mix up your perks. It‚Äôs not really necessary though, you‚Äôll survive with basically any build in this game and it‚Äôs all about how you want to play. I recommend shotguns or heavy guns if you wanna try something new, since I assume you have a lot of points in strength already anyway.
---
You can get everything from both sides in the heist mission, but make sure to complete all mission up to that warning point. Then after that you still need to do daily missions to get the rep to max for both factions, which is another thing you can do.
---
If you ever want, fill out your character build on the link I posted and I‚Äôll let you know what I‚Äôd do with it.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Ask for that and we'll just loose that feature on Nuka girl knowing Bethesda...
---
He also tends to fall out of the map and disappear if he dies and falls against the walls, so he could've ended up falling out of the map while turning into the ash pile for the other players... Gotta love client side corpses.
---
Not to mention ash piles during a Radiation Rumble steadily dropped my fps until I crashed, they ended up pixellating everything around it while killing the framerate. So if someone made a ton of ash piles from the wendigo spawns I bet there will be a similar issue in that fight too.
---
Oh wow. That‚Äôs an absolutely brilliant idea! Just put all the ammo you don‚Äôt want in the machine and it converts it all for you rather than doing it manually. Fantastic suggestion!
---
It can happen to all automatic weapons. It's like the game can't register correctly how many shots you fire anymore
---
That's just it, the first time Meat Week came out none of the mobs ran away or hid or stayed in place until you went out to find them. This time around the event was just completely broken and even the timers were shorter (not a bad change but with the event not working right it was plain unfair). Fact of the matter is that Bethesda simply doesn't care and won't bother to listen to anyone about how broken the game continues to be. How much more loyal do we have to be so that we can actually have big fixes or events that aren't broken? (Sorry for the long rant, here's a cookie üç™)
---
That clown thing is so freaking stupid. I NEED IT.
---
Sadly it's identical to the atom shop version and doesn't match the new colours.
---
Happens to me all the time, I'll hit 4 to 5 vats shots in a row for over 1k damage each and not a scratch. It's a bug, I believe and old one that had been reintroduced. I just recently started playing a vats build but I remember this being an issue a while back
---
Yes and no. It does this to me but I managed to find the perfect spot where it would display over the wallpaper and looked nice to me.
---
Wow thats actually kind of dumb. Every reward should be new and in no way a reskin or straight up copy. Especially since its a season reward.
---
I totally agree
---
my main character has bird bones so i just jump down the hole, also because I thought everyone was a lemming that jumped down and it was coded so you don't die.
---
Then I tried it on my alt without bird bones. That's the first time I even knew the ledges were there.
---
Should be called the BS collection quest
---
In terms of bugs, this is minor. Just be happy it points forward, unlike PA headlamps that they will never fix.
---
I think it was last week. Time's been flying in ISO so not sure exactly when.
---
I would have never redeemed it. Its a pretty stupid way to handle it although I hate to say it but there might not have been many other options to get it out to people who earned it? Maybe if they put up a notification in their news panel on the start menu thatd help. Serio I sly would've never redeemed it and would've missed out.
---
Dog food.  I lived off dog food.
---
No matter how many times I play, I \*always\* let the raiders who tell the story of the motorcycle guy live. May his legend live on.
---
I‚Äôd smash
---
Savage
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Probably. Half-baked way of handling the glitch. At least put up a notification on their news section in the main menu
---
Only reason I found out was the fear pushed me into it. It's level zero.
---
I usually try to kite the spawns to them to make sure they die a few extra times. Might not be nice but I get my laugh out of it. Kinda what you get for joining an endgame event
---
Also fix the event not always offering rewards to participants.
---
Thanks, hope so. I'd been wanting the other grill since I saw it in somebody's tent. The Brahmin one ain't so bad though.
---
Sucks, I should have gotten them yesterday. And now I'm finished Legendary Run and no impetus to finish all my dailies/weeklies. Oh well, thanks.
---
I don‚Äôt think the plushie are low, atleast for me because I got it two times in a row. But that helmet does seem a bit rare and I really want to get my hands on it
---
Just visit the Toxic Valley and knock it out.
---
yeah i do that and barely die, the problem is when he decides to focus you and drop that magma shit there so you need to move until it disappear heheh
---
I‚Äôd be a lot happier with it if I could have change 500 scrip a day
---
Downvoted for answering a question? What a shit community...lol
---
I still remember the Valentines Bed that would become a 1st Exclusive 6 months later and the Nuka Cola Refrigerator we still haven't got yet
---
Lol they're honestly a blast. Make sure you have Ammo Smith and, of course, big guns go great with power armor. If you get the Stabilized perk to max rank and get an anti-armor weapon, you'll ignore 95% of armor while in PA =) Bullet Shield is a must have as well
---
Heavy Gunner PA build can be switched around to a shotgun build since they're both in Strength. I swap between the two depending on what I'm doing.
---
You could just build a character big guns or have a weak dmging big guns build with max perception.
---
Pretty sure Bethesda will end up giving us a "second helping" like the other ATLAS rewards
---
I normally run a shotgun/VATS build and what I've noticed is that the only way to "fix" the 95% bug is to manually turn off VATS and relock onto the enemy. I have a feeling that the bug causes something to occur so that every shot during that VATS lock-on is a guaranteed miss.
---
Dead easy, quick stroll around vault 76 and it's done
---
Dying has basically no consequence in this game. That's what they tried
---
To paraphrase John McClane, "You wanna stay alive, you stay away."
---
Me either, I figured it was the same inventory.  Whoops.
---
Yes he can don't let the troll get you.
---
That was me, standing on a golf cart a week or so after launch. Running out of ammo as i emptied every gun I had into the horde.
---
Then they respawned. 
---
Good times üòÇ I actually miss enemies being dangerous
---
On release every enemy gave like 5x the exp they do now. Those were the days.
---
The pixelation effect it causes on other objects is so strange. It is one of the worst graphical bugs the game has.
---
My fried is tanking the event with a Vampires limb damage Mister Handy Buzz saw blade, keeping Earl both crippled, and himself at full health!
---
What does your special stats look like? I‚Äôve been prioritizing strength just for the sake of carrying shit lmao kinda balanced everything else except charisma and luck, with higher endurance for more health
---
Your build is probably not even well polished. I'd doubt, as a relatively new end-game player, that you alreally know what you are doing with your build. Lvl 100 isn't that high, you probably don't even have enough perk card to swich of build without moving special points.
---
Over lvl 50, you have an whole entire game to learn and test. At this lvl it's time to learn about the legendary effects and see what fits you the most. I even started like 4 other characters just to try to figure all that shit out. Now my main character...i mean i'm just waiting the "Perk loadout" system to switch to my shotgun build or melee build when ever i'm tire to play on my Heavy gun build. I mean switching a bunch of perk cards...i'm just not feeling it...
---
Come on man, you have an whole game to learn ! üí™‚úå
---
Based on what my loadout is and the weapon I'd be using, how much of a struggle am I looking at?
---
Capital Letters! That's it! That's why they haven't fixed it before. How could we all have been so blind? They're definitely gonna fix it now! Hallelujah!
---
What tf is a food build
---
I think you should try the event once before you move around a bunch of stuff, especially since you have all the weight reduction perks on your strength, so taking those out might throw your entire storage management off. 
---
Usually there‚Äôs enough heavy gunners to kill earl if you can do a good job at preventing the mobs of windegos from killing them. I‚Äôd try it once with you being mob support, especially if you can one or two shot a windego.
---
This...but also, there's an issue where people can continue buying after you reach max caps, made worse by the fact that they'll sit in your store and crack open christmas presents to keep buying stuff...
---
Oh my GOD no wonder. Like really though in what world does the fire part of friendly fire not actually include the fire??
---
That's were you are wrong. I'm a developer and I even developed a game didn't published it but I developed it. So let me tell you that: when one thing works and an another really similar thing don't you compare them! 101 troubleshooting. 
---
At this point I can say with confidence either the devs are garbage or the code is.
---
That actually works? Amazing.
---
Holy hell, I almost completely missed out on a the entire suit. Guess I never claimed it to begin with? (Either that or it came back up as 'claimable' once they fixed the lacking helmet.)
---
This is feels bad man. I actually enjoyed Meat Week. I didn‚Äôt mind logging on and doing events.
---
Honestly? I'd rather the tasks get completed than not, so I won't complain. But yeah.
---
I see your point. But I have a mule that still has some carry weight.
---
It's atomic shop so no unfortunately they can not
---
Oh I‚Äôd get rid of covert ops and put in marathoner though since there‚Äôs no way to sneak in that event, and you‚Äôre gonna need to run across the map to get distance from the mobs and to help others a lot
---
I feel ya. the structure is nice, but goddamn I am fucking ready to be done with this season.
---
As long as he keeps cutting at the legs yeah it seems to most of the time.
---
No you'd get smashed
---
Look up Angry Turtle lazy shotgunner and his other shotgunner build on YouTube. I followed the basics from him then just tweaked it to my play style. I can't show my load out is I had to replace my console. Gotta download 76 again. üò¢üò¢üò¢
---
Tired as hell, "I can get 1 more event in before it ends. Site says "Last chance at 12pm on the 26th". I'll just meat spin and read for a bit.". 
---
12pm comes. "Oof." Tab back in to see everything despawn.
---
That's ok.. I didn't need that one last chance at that dang Tenderizer plan or 2 mod plans I lack. /twitch
---
Oh, you can say yes to it - but there‚Äôs no way to say no.
---
After a certain level, foods that give XP buffs and Leader bobbles are crucial to leveling up at least once a day.
---
I have never struggled with the event solo. This may be that I just know where to stand and when to stop being bloodied in order to tank and spank, but I just don't get how you can go into this event as a level 100+ and not have the resources at your disposal to grind the boss down consistently regardless what other people are doing. It does not take a huge fully fleshed out build and top tier uber weapons to beat the event if you just stand there consistently doing damage with a moderately good gun. 
---
I welcome the bait players, it makes my life moderately easier when the ads get distracted.
---
Probably just bad luck, the sooner you travel the better chance you have to be with other people. Also don't know if team matters because I haven't done enough of it but that could come into play as well.
---
I assume this is only for the PTS? How does one go about getting on that?
---
With or without the pickaxes?
---
I don‚Äôt understand how you can‚Äôt level up, I‚Äôm above level 300 and I always level up once a day, granted I play for a couple hours but it takes roughly a day or two to level up. This game isn‚Äôt meant to be completed in a few weeks, it‚Äôs meant to take weeks and months to get good items and level up. The game can be confusing at first but the point of the game is to figure out your own play style by experimenting and finding out what suits you, I started off as a melee build and it took me a while to get to a bloodied rifleman build I‚Äôm using. This game is a grind just like games in the same category. This game is not hard, it‚Äôs just a tedious grind and it pays off in the end but you have to be committed or just don‚Äôt play if you don‚Äôt want to invest the time.
---
Also if you check out his heavy gunner builds he'll show you which ones you'd want to spec into then you can start switching between the two builds.
---
For sure thanks man appreciate it
---
I don't mind moving cards or storing items (a lot of it is just for convenience sake). I do it a lot during a normal session anyhow. It's the points I don't want to touch.
---
You did nail it though..I should at least try it first.  
---
Do you recommend sticking with my current gun (F3390 Fixer) or should I move to the LMG?
---
You can run with whatever perks points but you lacking the perks needed for big guns. More str = more dmg. That doesn‚Äôt mean you need three points invested into big guns to do dmg. Run 1 perk cards big guns. Blocker makes you tanky. You might need bandolier for reduced ammo for the lmg ammo. Stabilized is a must imo for power armor big guns. Adrenaline is a must for you to gain dmg you lack with seven strength. Add bloody mess three one gun army is nice. Glow sight is dmging perk for glowing enemies.
---
You don't spawn in the same place everytime though. I know this because sometimes I will spawn away from my house and others, right into the floor. Hell I spawned to someones camp and fell off a cliff because thats where it put me.
---
Noted and added. Many thanks.
---
I would do that but my Vending Machine are plain obvious and apparently everyone spawns on the back of my home or in front of it so it's weird.
---
There should be a way that once you join the event, you can‚Äôt leave. I only tried it twice, and on both occasions ppl bailed before the end and i ended up alone, doing not much damage.
---
i'm bloodied, junkies and my build is jack of all trades master of none lmao.
---
I can use shotguns, heavy weapons, melee, a little of commando (but not full spec). I degeneated the build to fit my personal taste, sometimes i feel like going heavy gun PA, sometimes i want to be a lil commando with sneaky and gauss rifle, handmade or laser rifle (1k-1.5k damages noting crazy) then there are times that i challenge myself to see how much can i survive west tek or AWOL with a little bloodied knife/super sledge and full evasive and serendipity.
---
Still my main is just bloodied gauss shoty with unyielding armor set but i don't use it that much until is needed like project paradise or something. Queen and colossus i just use PA junkies plasma gatling.
---
I can only do this in PC thanks to the perk manager mod so i have already a deck of 12 builds to swap instantly on the fly tho and you probably saw me diying a lot in the meat week bc I was trying to use an explosive submachine gun and failed miserably haha but ey it looked cool!
---
To those that hate your allies bitching and talking all the time: There's many mods that mute them. I would highly suggest them. If it were up to me, I'd just put duct tape over their mouths.
---
Another thing, if you're going full health build I'd suggest becoming a Junkie.
---
Seeing the Meat Week Cookout disappear in front of my eyes was sad, but also sort of funny. I met up with Grahm somewhere else and I bought a scarecrow plan from him and when I looked away, then looked back he was gone, without a trace. Very unexpected ending for Meat Week for me.
---
Cheers! it was worth it for the beer stein.
---
Read the original post kaijitt (sry if I miss spell anything it‚Äôs like 11at night here and my dog wants to pee so I had to get up and let her out .-.) Ik it‚Äôs about the event to most but still the wording was very misleading and toxic sounding. I actually saw a lvl2 today at colossus and he died less than I did and probably did same damage as me 1 regs. And a lucky 5crit :/ but do remember players with the mentality that they are born god tier have existed ever since only games existed -._-. Help everyone and be Kind and remember to worship the moth man, hail modus and praise atom and then you can finally achieve nuclear happiness with vault tech:)
---
Did they increase the spawn rate? The last event was so picked over, we wandered around for 3 hours and never found a single treasure hunter moleminer.
---
Having done the Santa Scorched event, I couldn't be bothered to waste any more time on it.
---
150 per day is the real bottleneck
---
lolno, FO4 had a much worse end-game. "Here's another settlement that needs your help."
---
I'll add them to my list. Many thanks as well.
---
That would be amazing I want to finish one of the shows that where the first  responders
---
MY EYES!! THE GOOGLES DO NOTHING FOR MY EYES!
---
Ugh, I need some bleach. And maybe a lobotomy. 
---
Cannot unsee.
---
I fucking worked the whole event fuck adulting
---
I've been using an AA, +33% vats, -25% vats cost combat shottie to do the same. 
---
Protip: If you can spare the loss in hit chance, hitting the Wendio Spawns in their head is an instagib like 99% of the time.
---
Honestly doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôm bloodied Unarmed melee and I could use the wendigos aggroing on someone else. I took a couple of sub 50s last night to it, they kept the wendigos off my back while I killed Earle. Man he‚Äôs got some crazy DR though. Took us about maybe just over 10 minutes to kill him. It said my damage on him was 2k a hit when I think I would be up to 5k on the queen. 
---
Lol the dumb thing was, after I killed him (not just me but I did about 80% of the damage for the 7 of us), somehow I died instantly while standing there going over to loot the body and then I couldn‚Äôt spawn back inside . 
---
The level 45 told me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, I just got a Nocturnal Pickaxe‚Äù
---
But no, I wouldn‚Äôt revive a Lower level if they were there. They would be wendigo bait
---
I managed to get the Taxidermy Head Display on my very first run.
---
That bashing magiiiic
---
Yeah, I saw one of these the other day. Funny thing was because of the sheer number of prefixes, it was only called 'Glowing Deathclaw' but it was ***obviously*** scorched from the color palette.
---
I'll be out of power shortly.. my dreams of completing the season are probably gone.. I'll probably be out of power for at least a week. Hopefully not
---
Don‚Äôt worry about my VATS...I get right up in their dirty little faces and squeeze.
---
I tried attaching it to various deer antlers. Only one it kinda worked with was the deer skull with antlers. You can attach to the bottom of the skull so it isn't floating.
---
Have to lol
---
You need to be quick. Everyone gets the "Death From Above" timer in the top corner of the screen, so you know exactly when the nuke will hit. Have the map open while that timer ticks over to zero, and click the event icon the moment it pops up.
---
I've gotten into full instances (most likely the *first* instance) every time I've played it.
---
Fun fact, if you use the (IIRC, it's called) "Community Campfire" structure, NPCs will come from further away to sit down and relax. (A friend of mine has his base about 100-150m away from some random NPCs and they'll walk all the way over to sit in it.)
---
I have like 15 plushies, and 5 helmets. Lol. Havnt gotten a single head plan though which is weird because I thought the helmet was suppose to be the rarest drop.
---
I run commando bloodied in ACP and have no probs.   You will die a few times but try and stay hidden and move around some near the drop point.  I take out the spawns and vats crit earl.  Works good for me üëçüèª
---
what food gives xp (with ingediense) and what is leader booble if I may ask?
---
that can explain some
---
You will be before you know it. My last two levels went bam!
---
Highly recommend hoarding up high-level junkies weapons. Power armor builds are nice and easy to maintain, but most heavy weapons don't do a lot of damage unless you're bloodied or junkies. Blooded builds don't do too well in power armor and if you're not using unyielding armor there's really no point so junkies is the way to go. I've actually got a power armor junkies build on PS4 if you want a super in-depth look!
---
He typically runs with a b2525 10m but also rocks a BE 44. He‚Äôs one shotting most things at the same rate as my bloody shotgunner. He really falls behind on the big big creatures like mirelurk queens. 
---
It makes me wish I ran a pistol build because he got his guns from me and they were all legit drops from enemies and events.
---
I'm finding myself wishing you had taken a recording and put the 'Cops' theme to it.
---
*‚ô´~‚ô™ Bad Boys, Bad Boys, whatcha gonna do? ‚ô™~‚ô´*
---
Do you have the commando perks maxed out? I‚Äôd stay with the fixer either way, I think LMG is considered a heavy gun
---
pics??
---
It really was because the meet week one gave me an instant trio
---
I‚Äôve completed 7 so far, rewards are as follows: 2 mounted heads, 2 rugs, 1 pickaxe, and 2 harpoon guns. Seem to get one weapon or plan per event. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I don't know why, but it just feels that  VATS chokes shotguns to an insane degree. Even if I am manually aiming in 1st person mode, I can't get my pellets to choke like they can in VATS.
---
With FFR, fireworks, and a three star quick hands its like I have an endless clip of shells.
---
I will pass. Aesthetics on my camp over everything else. Can‚Äôt spend the time to look around my awesome camp? Buh by then. Caps are so easy to come by that I honestly don‚Äôt need to sell items. The semi cool items are there just to get you to come by and admire the camp. The real items for sale aren‚Äôt even in the machine.
---
Edit: did we scare you off with opinions that were not in line with your own?
---
Yeah, I hear the dying part is pretty much a given, no matter your build..lol.
---
Good advice and I thank you for it.
---
I'm wondering if I was one of the ones with you. I did the same thing recently with a big group of randoms. It'd be total coincidence but amusing nonetheless!
---
if people wouldn't abuse them, message boards you can build at your camp where people can leave short 20-30 letter messages would be cool
---
If you tell me how to upload them on this sub
---
So if someone kills you, are you dropping a random legendary weapon? üòÇ i actually do like your idea though, sounds cool
---
I do have them maxed out. I'd just need to change the reciever on the Fixer.
---
I'd throw this into the PTS report and not reddit! Great idea!
---
No.
---
I have three cabins with signs above the door.
---
One says home, one says crafting, and one says shop.
---
People still madly run into the wrong two cabins and throw confused emotes at me
---
Atoms for 76 revives!
---
Try a bartering subreddit. This subreddit doesn‚Äôt allow bartering.
---
Oh yes I snipe things all the time with the gause shotty in vats. It's kinda shocking lol and fun. When it on target I feel like a great shotgun god!  But oh man when you get those opening shots that miss and followed by another miss sometimes it's like wtf
---
Give me one. I've gotten nothing but freakin' harpoon guns. And they're terrible. . . . BASH DAMAGE? WHO THE HELL IS BASHING WITH A HARPOON GUN BETHESDA?
---
Huh that‚Äôs a good point. I‚Äôve got an unmodded vamps rn which has been nice for survival but I‚Äôm not doing much damage. Seems like I‚Äôd be best off getting a Bffr if it‚Äôll be a secondary dmg dealer. Do you know how much dmg you‚Äôre usually doing?
---
Well said.
---
the only one I will help with is the collectron goal lol
---
Get a better one, if you aren‚Äôt going junkies or bloodied go Anti Armor, pm me if you need a build
---
Building is my favorite part of F76, although it takes months for me to perfect my builds. I never consider them finished.
---
Dude, if you're gonna make a post like this you GOTTA give us some pictures of your pimped out base. Please? :D
---
scrapping Handmades
---
I hate literally anything in the game that involves a computer.  I get they were going for that super old, like DOS computer feel, but that does not make it more fun.  Also, out of any sort of hacking Mini game in any video game, this is my least favorite I've ever encountered.
---
alrighty then, ill just make this my temporary build weapon
---
Bring a few repair kits or use the weapons work bench at the spawn point where the drop is to repair bc ur gonna break at least once or twice before he dies.
---
I‚Äôm willing to bet they don‚Äôt even know there‚Äôs a player limit for CP
---
any idea where i can buy them in bulk?
---
I was unsure until I solo'd this event with relative ease and saw a marked difference in damage output where none should have existed.
---
How do you upload pictures to this sub?  Also, it's really not that good.
---
to be realistic none of it would exist.
---
There are usually 5-6 different random spawn points for your camp, moving the camp object doesn't always change any of them.
---
Intensity the devs didn‚Äôt even mean to add, they‚Äôre so talented!......
---
This is the only game I‚Äôve had crash and force my ps4 off WiFi
---
Hey kid, pull my finger.
---
Oops, too late.
---
I wanted to get a pension, but all I got is tension!
---
They don‚Äôt do a seniors discount anymore, why is that.
---
You know, licorice just tastes better after the war for some reason.
---
...easily the best NPC to have at your camp.
---
I leveled from 636 to 640 today after work.  Maybe you aren't doing it right.
---
I mean that works too. Just SOME indication of where the fuck their vendors are would be SO helpful and appreciative. I used to waste a good 2-5 minutes trying to find vendors. Now if it's not easy to find, I just move on.
---
Nope. I'm not adding tacky directions/signs to my camp because you're too lazy to locate the vendors yourself. Don't care if I "miss a sale". Your caps aren't important tbh because they're sooooo easy to get on the game. Who cares if a lazy player doesn't want to buy from me because I didn't cater to their laziness?
---
Shame it doesn't guarantee the Cursed weapon every time...
---
I'm glad I'll finally get to put those to use. Many thanks.
---
PM me if you want a build for that sledgehammer
---
Weird. I (and my friends, and everyone I've seen teleport to my base) arrive at the exact same location every time. Granted I might've forced the game to do that because I experimented a lot with CAMP placement as well as building placement.
---
nope
---
cool
---
can yo ufit them all?
---
off to whitespring raider ig lol
---
Yep! Prime Meat is just worth extra scrip for you!
---
Yea I‚Äôd do the fixer as an automatic and you should be good to go. Just carry a couple thousands rounds and a ton of stimpacks and a few radaways. Don‚Äôt be afraid to run and jump away from the mobs and keep an eye out for when you get poisoned so you keep healing yourself. I think you should be good Nice gun btw!
---
Oh last thing, I‚Äôd take out sniper and put in either concentrated fire or ground pounder depending on how much you use VATS. And make sure you don‚Äôt have a sniper scope on, it‚Äôs all pretty close range
---
Agreed. He's the only one I can tolerate.
---
You better find someone REALLY nice if they are going to give you it for free. On the same level as the one guy who gave me the initiate paint plan for free. Forever grateful.
---
Earlier today I was I a group of low levels. I was level 225. There was a level 300+. The rest of the players were less than level 50!  The one that was level 25 was yelling at us with his mic to stop wasting his time and kill the Wendigo Colossus already. When we failed he started to yell at the other low level for launching the nuke in the first place. 
---
There has to be some kind of level/dps check. 
---
Maybe a solo indoor instanced quest that needs to be passed in order to enter the event?
---
Please go to the DMV and fill in graduation application form c-4b... Have a nice day...
---
you cant....apply super duper and start crafting.  Apply scrapper when scraping to get a bit more scrap back (none of the good stuff though).
---
The vendor in Harper's Fairy sells the plan. You can craft and scrap low level ones to learn the mods.
---
I was going to do the same thing cuz I finished yesterday, but thank god I checked this subreddit earlier and claimed that shit today!
---
you probably have a billion more dps than me and knows exactly what to do yes. This is from a returning semi casual player point of view.
---
Did the event a lot of times. Only thing I never got was the chally suit, but the game thought it was funny to give me 4 masks. Oh rngarbage...
---
Lmao. It's not in the rules so we can do what we want amirite? I can tell you're a noob, so let me try to put it in a way your kind will understand; if a noob who contributes no dps to earl takes the space of a good high level player, that one guy will make everyone there fail, and he will fail too. So no one gains anything. Therefore, you noobs need to stick to the main quests, leveling up, and when finally you have enough experience to understand the mechanics of the game, you are welcome with arms wide open.
---
Impractical and as unlikely as it would be, I would like to play my own music through the pip boy lmao. Would use it a lot more then.
---
I‚Äôm down
---
Well you can't come back after one session and expect to know how to do everything right.  Takes time
---
  Also i run a full health build.
---
See I haven't gotten any plans yet. I've just gotten the legendary off of Earl and the cursed weapon off of the event.
---
Reclaimed mining helmet: 5%
---
Wendigo Heads: 9.5%
---
Cursed pickaxe: 12.825%
---
Wendigo rug: 14.535%
---
Cursed harpoon gun: 17.442%
---
Wendigo plushie: 18.3141%
---
Cursed shovel: 12.311145%
---
Meat pile: 10.072755%
---
Haha, oh god. That‚Äôd be fun if you could actually slot the weapons like the punch bowl.
---
Whenever I see that herd there's usually a a couple yao guai fighting them and a dead honeybeast.
---
The raiders side of the questline is bugged in the same way. You have the option to be nice to RaRa or be mean to her. Doesn't matter which option you pick, because later when you speak with her she says how much she hates you for being mean to her, even if you were actually nice.
---
Something about these Wastelanders quests is not writing to the environment variables correctly, so it always defaults to the 'bad' option.
---
Get the plan for them and craft them yourself 
---
Or if you‚Äôre on PS4 you can give me the materials for them and I‚Äôll craft you as many as you want
---
I don't really run a meta per say, but about 25 a shot for SBQ on 40% heavy gun perks and level 1 PA armor piercing. It's an Instagating Gat with +10% damage while ADS.
---
If I aim for heads on a Scorch human I can usually pull 700 on the first shot especially in sneak which is the main reason I use it and it has good ammo economy which makes it ez to apply everywhere. I definitely imagine it'll be a lot more on bloodied or Junkie with a Prime 5mm receiver. But yeah, really range is the worst aspect of the gun. Accuracy isn't that great but it's not like a CoD sniper rifle on hipfire kind of bad.
---
I'm actually swapping over to a rifle build but just need the levels to move points. I have way better rifles than heavy guns lmao.
---
You can buy those anytime l.he walks around the map.
---
Bet you're being hard on yourself.
---
And the easiest way for me is to upload them to a website like Imgur and just link them. I always like seeing interesting bases. Even weird ones. I came across one the other day that I just HAD to take screenshots of because it was so creepy and cult-like.
---
https://i.imgur.com/1xdfL1E.png

https://i.imgur.com/kJKmzJc.png
---
Got a Nuka-Cola Girl/Sheepsquatch plushie cult goin' on here.
---
what is that, 15 in endurance and gear that supports health? Is there any cap on special points?
---
I use the surgery mask with wrap around goggles with the Imposter Sheepsquash outfit, the colours match and kind of ends up like a super hero secret identity.
---
Ive seen people able to solo it so I think it's less of a reduce the number and more of a just prioritize who you are shooting at better. Not even trying to be rude but I think the number is fine, they die quite easily.
---
But... the screws.
---
I dropped my tent there last night and I thought it was still going today, I ran up so excited at 12:50pm and everything was gone.  I was shocked.  üíî RIP meat week.  I loved it.
---
Mine reset at 9AM PST.
---
He said he wants to trade for not, not free
---
This is a texture issue that popped up with colossal problem. I‚Äôve had it happen once so far but it stopped after server hopping. Haven‚Äôt seen it in relation to the mining helmet.
---
No, but you'll hold the staff during that animation.  Like the Grognak taunt, you just conjure it out of thin air, and go back to your normal weapon when the emote ends.
---
Ya don‚Äôt waste a bone on a dyin‚Äô dog
---
i'm lv 300, nothing scare me in this game
---
except when the colosus has low health, I start to panic and avoid the rubble falling from the ceiling or any wendigo, my worst nightmare is to die right there and there is no single safe spot, maybe the middle but still it's dangerous lolol
---
thats what i try to do but they just saround me and keep on stagering me
---
Hahaha..that's why the Bandolier and Traveling Pharmacy perks (usually 10k .45 and I have around 1k each of Stimpaks and Radaway to hand out to low levels).
---
I carry a sniper just for shits and giggles. That'll be stored away for sure. 
---
I greatly appreciate the help. Thank you very much.
---
Helps if I read the whole thing doesn't it lol.
---
Both?
---
Gotcha; thank you!
---
I saw he said medics doesn't work anymore but that was it.
---
No im just saying im not a bloodied build so dont have crazy high dps or use unyielding  armor for crazy high intelligence
---
There's a countdown above the challenges...?
---
There's a timer literally in the game, if you're playing right now.
---
Please don't I need the spawns to keep my Adrenaline at max rank and as they die so easily sometimes I have to run around to find one every 30 seconds.
---
hmm...this gives me an idea. 1 vendor, 30 lvl 15 handmades, 50 caps a piece....think they would sell?
---
Probably.  You see the hit on your end, but the server, which might see the physical position between you and the enemy differently, might see a miss.  It's especially noticeable in VATS against targets that move around a lot.
---
Lol I lack the sophistication for this comment
---
I‚Äôm heading in game now. I‚Äôll send an invite. My GT: DtownCracka 
---
I‚Äôll wait for you to get to my C.A.M.P., we‚Äôll kill 2 of the 3 whatever spawns, let the survivor kill you, I‚Äôll revive you and we should be good to go!! Thanks again!
---
you will be able to get it again in the next treasure hunt event, just wait and dont trade an arm and a leg for it.
---
Well, yeah, obviously. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs curse.
---
You can definitely sneak in that event. I was looting wendigo spawn like a few feet away from earle, wearing power armour and with 1 point in sneak.
---
If you stay far enough away you'll be fine and hidden/caution unless a wendigo literally walks into you (can definitely happen) while you're shooting and focused on earle.
---
Well you'll probably have another shot if we complete the second helping of Meat Week objective for ATLAS.  Just check in with Grahm every time you visit the Meat-Cook, and hop servers from time-to-time to re-roll his inventory.  He doesn't always have this stuff, but you should eventually get it.
---
I wouldn't get your hopes up. Last one took place for a week in May. It seems to be an event they'll drop every so often for a week or so.
---
My point isn‚Äôt about PVP.  Is about joining a team  to hunt the other members.
---
Yeah, both times I waited until I saw others on the map.  Next time I‚Äôll try hopping in right away.
---
Yeah, right after the challenge where we donate one million beers to the BoS.
---
Bethesda: Ok done. Now he shoots across the room at Mach 10 when he dies and clips through the celing.
---
If someone wants to mod their handmade then yes, they‚Äôd sell. But how likely you think it is for someone who‚Äôs looking for handmade plans to come across your vendor and buy them? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it especially since vendors take stash space
---
And usually people who want the mods will just save themselves the trouble and buy the plan for them instead of looking for bulk handmades to buy, personally I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good investment
---
Sounds fun! Im just now getting online as well. See you there
---
I mean dropping all my junk is enough for me to not die
---
I used this [build.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1843eb&amp;d=a12ss2si2se2l71lu2a72lt2sj0s51ce0eu0eh0ee2ao0a80l32pe0ck0cf0e31sg2aj2am2&amp;w=i12&amp;m=1c29fe8hb3)
---
Asbestos chest mod. Bloodied/fss weapon. Unyielding armor. Health down to +2 all stats from unyielding not +3. Uncrouch, crouch whenever in danger. Didn't die once. Sure, not as much damage as +3 all stats + nerd rage, but still more respectable than a non-bloodied/magic weapon builds.
---
You can even try experimenting with lower health than I did cause tbh the kings of the loadout are the stimpak related perks and sharing team medic. Don't think mysterious savior/revenant even procced cause I was always topped off. I even came out with more stimpaks than I went in with.
---
But yeah, hopefully bloodied builds can still 1/2 shot the wendigo adds after the nerf cause that's what worries the most about the fight.
---
Edit: you can use sneak 3 instead of evasive if you got 350+ dr and er already.
---
Yeah got 15 in strength so will run this bloodied build for a while and have fun smashing things with a lot of dps and hopefully pickup a 2/3* legendary heavy somewhere along the line and rebuild for that 
---
Thanks for your time and help
---
Fuck yeah new plushies!
---
I'm a newbie who downloaded the game 2 weeks ago. I'm level 22. Today I ran into a lady at Foundation, who wanted me to go look for "Evan" in some mine. The only reason I noped out of the quest was the massive complaining I saw on Reddit the last 2 days about newbies joining this event. Otherwise, this literally seems like yet another quest. There is no "dude, this is end game content!" warning. Maybe it's clear if you actually embark on the quest (I wouldn't know), but I don't otherwise see how I would know that this would be over my level.
---
And now I'm crying.  üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I did it today as bloodied with full heavy weapon with bloodied Gatling laser. I could get fair damage on Earl, enough to notice it barely move, but if he hit me once I died. I died a lot. We failed.
---
Take one down and pass it around. Still got a million bottles of beer on the wall because the BOS probably doesn‚Äôt even drink. Tight wads would probably use drunkenness as an excuse to kill us and take our cool gear.
---
I see what you did there üßê
---
I would still keep the TShooters because fukka ASSaultron.. youll thank me later
---
Yuppp
---
I did the event at level 17 on my alt, but he's decked out with full vanguards low level armor and one of those glitched lasers, so he can do quite a bit of damage and pulled his weight well enough.
---
At level 94, they've probably looked at that screen over 300 times and yet...ü•¥
---
Feels so bad lol, sorry you had to go through that on the other side as well. Made a lot of it feel like a waste.
---
So are we still going to be able to get the backpack with the wavywillards plushie coming out the back? I missed it the first time around...
---
oh yea, assaultrons are a bitch, so yea ill keep it
---
Nice, I think that‚Äôd be great for ACP then. He doesn‚Äôt go far, but reloading can just be so bad when the wendigo spawns are rushing me
---
Thought the spawns where based on how damage is done to the big guy?
---
Especially if you have a jet pack...lmao.i did it once cause i was trying to rush and forgot..
---
I was working on turning ammo I never use into points, then accidently miss clicked Buy crap ammo for 15,000(?) points. Kinda lost interest afterwards.
---
Later on yes, but it's rough at early levels, which is what it's designed for.
---
So what you're saying is you want eveything nerfed and some events with more bugs?? We'll get right on that.
---
Almost all mine were done in a minute, or less.  Usually we had full spits and drums.  At the end everyone would set off their fireworks and lunchboxes.  It was a beautiful community that I've missed since Fastnacht(spelling my phone spelled it like this) but the post queen chill between nukes is now happening at my camp for the Colossus which is nice.
---
What the hell is a food build anyway.i don't understand this wackyness.
---
I've been playing since Day 1. Level 357. Its called playing Devils Advocate. And "your kind." Really? My kind? What are you talking about, no rules? But sure throw around wild accusations because you can certainly tell what level someone is in a videogame from a reddit comment. Grow up.
---
We need hard end game events, not easier.
---
The PTS are the test servers. If you unlock them there, you won't carry over to the actual game.
---
This is just testing an Event that will be coming to the game soon(ish).
---
To a point.
---
While you can stay there until the mine collapses and not face an actual death, things like the collapsing ceiling and the Wendigo Spawn *can* actually kill you (ironically).  That's where you can run into problems.

Usually, the game will respawn you at the exit of Monongah Mine, but if you're not in PA and didn't have a chance to put on a HazMat suit, spawning in the Nuke Zone may kill you coming out of the load screen and cause you to drop your Junk.  It's also possible for the game to bug out and spawn you in the middle of nowhere, kicking you from the Event with no Event rewards at all (but with the Junk).
---
So, you do need to be careful.  As the escape timer ticks down past :30 or so, I'd put on a Chinese Stealth Suit/HazMat/PA and gravitate over to the raised platform in the middle, where you'll be safe from the ceiling, and just wait it out.
---
Death by snu snu
---
Don't spend much on it if you find it, it will be available in the second helping event.
---
Run that as much as you can, I managed to get a half-dozen or so, so they're not particularly rare, unlike the tenderizer plan.  Only got 1 of those, they'll be worth a pretty penny.
---
I‚Äôm used a lvl 35 didn‚Äôt die once and did enough damage to loot earl and revived all my teammates
---
And you've only been on Reddit for 9 days? Calling me a noob. Ok bud. Have a good night.
---
Anyone get the disco ball ?
---
Yes!  Were you on Xbox?  I think I was on drums with you.  We had 1 dude doing the robot in armor and 1 doing the funky mothman.  üíú It was so fun.  If not good times were happening across a bunch of servers, I love this community so much.
---
This game is a Pandora box. Maybe the Ultralight mod is there, but when you apply it, all your weapons become magic shotguns or something like that.
---
Nothing is weirder than the "reduce damage while blocking" magic effect, and still...
---
There is when you first click NW.
---
Turn off auto team it puts you in a team by yourself
---
Personally, I find smashing the Mainframe Cores with an explosive gun rather cathartic.  It was a different story when that was broken, and you had to go up and press E on each one.  That was super tedious and annoying.
---
I hate you and love you right now
---
Is this a joke lol?
---
Thank you for this information kind individual
---
You can also create a public group that 3 others can join, and they can fast travel into the instance with you.
---
War. War never changes...
---
Tried that didn‚Äôt work
---
Does a yao guai shit in the woods?
---
   
---
Tons of hackers, rarely is anything done, mostly in NW though.
---
You can get the plan from Grahm!!... Oh wait ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Ward can be annoying, but not as bad as Astronaut girl.  I cringe every time I hear her complaining about nightmares in someone else's camp.  She's permanently out of all my camps on every character now.
---
Plus, the Vats unkown is pretty useless compared to Final Word.
---
Healing salves can be used like stimpacks without waiting for an animation.
---
I'll bury you with the three Cursed shovels I got from doing the event ha ha ha....fml
---
Oh I'm aware. I was just curious as to how to access the PTS if the mood ever strikes me.
---
I honestly thought I was the only one who has had fo76 crash and kick my PS4 off WiFi.
---
I'd never experienced a Meat Week before and thought this was how it always was. TBH, I thought it was a lot of fun, actually made it challenging.
---
Love that house actually. First time I found it I thought "damn I'm never gonna pick up this many books"
---
Since Monday even!
---
earl is a ammo sponge.. your build regardless means  nothing.. you cant see em because he blends in..
---
I did about 20, and only had an issue once where there weren't any mobs left but it didn't complete.
---
Shame they always despawn before I can loot them all....
---
My last five or six levels took place since Colossus hit the PS4. That event is the ultimate Exp farming experience. I didn't even notice I had done the last two.
---
The only legendaries you can craft are the items added in Wastelanders which cost bullion for the plans.
---
Completely agree!  Nice post.
---
I‚Äôm sad I never got the bottom of the chally the moo moo outfit as all I got was the head piece, sigh oh well I did get the bbq grill.
---
weapons/armor/modules from the purveyor, plans from bullion vendors.
---
I‚Äôll take it!
---
Ik but only people there were doing afk bugs
---
the spacesuit is a good find I hope you grabbed it! I actually tried doing this today as well since I found him but the same happened to me. Got a hunters longcoat tho!
---
Stop getting political this is a sub reddit for 76 just saying most of this user are not from America
---
Na I already have 2 space suits at home, hunters longcoat is what I've been dreaming to get from vendor bot :(
---
Actually those ones will still have the old loot pool. In order to get the new items you'll need the newer loot pails.
---
Ultracite ammo farm!
---
I‚Äôd spend 2 hours on a server and never see a cook out. 30 pieces of prime meat rotting.
---
Yup, take screenshots/video, send it to Bethesda support, they'll lock your ticket and ignore you. Next send it to journalists till Bethesda finally starts to care....
---
They used to be people
---
Deathclaws in Fallout 4 and 76 are real pansies..
---
Not likely. Back when 76 first came out, the folks who ordered the power armor super package didn't get the fully advertised items (not me, i got the tri-centennial edition only) in that the high quality canvas bag folks were supposed to receive only got a cheap vinyl bag. Now, bethesda eventuslly got the real canvas bags out (if I remember correctly), but their initial response to the outrage at the failure to deliver as promised was to say so sorry, can't be fixed. Here's 500 atom (5 bucks) for your trouble.
---
With bugs, their universal answer has, is and always will be, report the bug so we can fix (takes forever and likely to break other things with the fix) and have a great swift kick to the butt...lol
---
Actually some are saying it is listed as a wanamingo plushie, not an angler. One other guy in this forum said the wanamingo was even datamined.
---
Been playing for two weeks and honestly hadn't seen anybody even suspicious
---
PC players have been running nexus QoL mods since shorty after the game launched on 2018. No one has been or is getting banned. Bethesda's official stance is that they do not support them, so if a mod messes your game up, they won't help you.
---
No shit like what did there suits look like
---
Imagine having an Osmosis kit yo give him every time that he never actually remembers to take...
---
We're all ghouls down here, Smoothie.
---
Just make it work like the shop screens.
---
Probably like normal cloths, because they were normal people, no need to be a dick
---
A hand job at the very least.
---
There's quite a few amazing QoL mods for PC. I've had Perk loadouts, better inventory, and better strings since 2018. Plus my meat piles glow bright purple and my health bar is sectionalized to make it super easy to know exactly what % health I'm at.
---
Post specifically says in there suits which were special designed to go in to toxic mines maybe read the post
---
Ya but it doesn't turn that off for all other players..
---
building is what keeps me playing along with lot of others. I wish I could show off some of my builds properly hah I'd love to help people out and build designs unique to them!
---
That only works for me. I want no one else to have a teammate. Why would I want to go 1 vs 4?
---
The spawns are adrenaline
---
I did. They were probably made after they mutated, as they specifically fit them, and are labeled as such.
---
They aren't *that* low, but you will need to run it a few times, yes.
---
Something to keep in mind is that if you wrap up your instance fairly quickly, look and see if someone else is still in Monongah Mine.  If so, and they are on a Public Team, join that team and Fast Travel to them.  You may be able to double dip on rewards.
---
As a reminder, you can find large wood piles at Pickett's Fort and at Helvetia.
---
Dude there suits melted in to them because of mutations and radiation so the suit has become apart of them
---
Oh well it looks like you have it figured out. Good for you, want a cookie?
---
I‚Äôve honestly had zero lag each time I‚Äôve done it, maybe I‚Äôm just lucky. I‚Äôm on Xbox as well.
---
I‚Äôll watch some YouTube how tos and try that this weekend
---
A real solution would be allowing us to scrap legendaries for a chance to get modules. More stars better chance to prevent inflation.
---
I had the opposite problem, plenty of chilly suits, no helmet. Open to trade if on PS4!
---
Try a different sub that allows bartering.
---
Don‚Äôt know. This happened to me. I launched the nuke. I fast traveled close. And ran inside. There were multiple other people hovering over the event icon when I looked on the map, but I was the only one inside this specific event. I didn‚Äôt feel like wasting all my ammo, alone. So I just logged out and jumped servers and did it all over again. Next time, I had max people.
---
OK! Then the few Cook Outs that failed for me were likely due to a lack of attendance and participation, not a lack of Prime Meat. 
---
It was annoying seeing people just standing around during the 2-minute countdown to Cook Out. I was normally on a drum until the countdown ended, or on a split if the drums were full. In one event someone was standing in the middle of a drum (probably AFK) and it was inoperable.
---
PC but glad the spirit of Meat Week is strong =)
---
Nope, there are absolutely positively no hackers whatsoever on PC.
---
Stop getting so butt hurt cause your wrong the whole point of this post was to see what people knew or theorize
---
I had lag in one event but besides that it hasn‚Äôt been too bad, about the same as SBQ for me
---
If you built your turret on another object, like a roof, you can scrap/store that roof tile which will then place that turret that dissappeared into your 'stored' section. The only other alternative to this is to relocate your CAMP. This is a bug that has been going on for awhile now - unfortunately. It is best to make sure you build the turrets on top of another piece in order to be able to get them back when this bug occurs.
---
Are you drunk
---
I need that clown like I need air.
---
GIVE ME
---
I hadn't read anyone else complaining about lag either.
---
Maybe there was a duper on my server or something :(
---
I find having a good vampire weapon works wonders. Keeps you alive when you should be dead.
---
Just a lil ;)
---
I thought ‚ÄúDeathclaw Hunter‚Äù would mean an outfit made from Deathclaw hide. Not just a generic hunting outfit. Disappointing.
---
I‚Äôll sell some for 30k each.
---
I'm not a fan of this. Maybe they could just let players do it on their own clients if they want to, but I like to be able to see what I'm doing and realism be damned.
---
Nice set up.
---
I got this one set up planned for when the Ranger Tower prefab is added to the atom shop. Setting up the fences in a box around it in a 4x4 space, watch tower in one corner, space for a mineral extractor in the other, and finally a 2x1 small workshop. When instanced interiors come around, they'll hopefully allowing for expanding interiors while inside and i'll be able to make my bunker idea.
---
Vampire heavy weapon.
---
I think I would've been ok with SBQ level lag. Heck, I half expected it. This was.... something new.
---
Thanks for your input though!
---
I have done this event 5 times since Monday on Xbox and nothing bad has happened to me as you describe. There was one time where it was slow but that was it. Most time it ran smooth. On my third fight the first day I died and when I respawned earl was dead so I couldn‚Äôt go loot body and when I went to head back out of mine I got a black loading screen. I was mad, so I let it like that for ten minutes. Closed game down started back up and somehow got all the rewards. I have so far gotten the rug, meat pile, cursed harpoon, the heads and tonight the plushie. I am glad I haven‚Äôt experienced any of what you had and I‚Äôm sorry you have had this happen. Hopefully you get to experience it. Maybe ppl where using a bunch of explosive legacies
---
I've been using mostly my Shotguns as well.  Enforcer allows you to cripple Earle with only one or two shots per limb, which keeps him in place and prevents the heads from attacking as frequently or accurately.  The Wendigo Spawns also don't stand a chance.
---
Part of this could be the "magic" nature of some Shotguns in VATS.  But even if it is, they don't exactly melt him like some weapons do.
---
But.. I stuff my pillow with Gamma rounds since they never seem to sell.... 
---
If I sell them to you, what will I use to inflate my pillows?
---
I used to rock the skull mask (not the costume piece, but the bone one) with the sheepsquache imposter helmet.
---
Yes.  The game's architecture is very insecure, Bethesda's monitoring is very weak, and their enforcement is very lax.
---
No you do not. Colossal Problem is actually required in order to complete Something Sentimental. Your problem is probably that it has limited space available. Once the event is full, no one outside of the event will be able to join or even see the event marker on the map.
---
"Just optimizing my build, bruh."
---
That's weird. I saw this exact thing (guy?) during Fashnacht. Same nudity, same hair, same mass
---
You on Xbox?
---
Down to trade for the helmet? I got a spare heads plan xbox
---
If you're on Xbox I'd be happy to build the plushie for you.
---
The graphics-- particularly the Wendigo Spawn I was fighting-- pixelated. At one point, they looked like an 80s style sprite hopping around.
---
It was almost charming.
---
Hello! So food items like canned meat stew (received as a reward from the "Feed the People" event), cranberry cobbler (along with the relish and juice), and Nuka Cola Cranberry all give XP buffs. A leader bobblehead is one of the bobbleheads in game. These are consumable items and will give you an XP boost for an hour. (Their XP boost lasts for 2 hours if you have the Curator perk card equipped, which I believe is a perk card found under Luck?)
---
When the event marker pops up, there will be a "suggested level" if you click on it. To be fair, I wasn't a bit salty about lower levels joining; it's the join and sit there complaining that irked me.  :)   If you're willing to revive, kill spawns, etc, you're good.
---
Thankful iv been lucky and Have not seen them much in normal mode. Occasionally someone shows up with hacked weapons and ruins a boss fight or abuses god mode glitch. But usually nothing like you described. I believe it though. Bethesda does nothing to hackers. 
---
Now nuclear winter on the other hand. Yea its pretty much a hacker free for all in that mode. 
---
Also might wanna remove the players name from your post. I think its a rule on here that your not allowed to name actually usernames.
---
It pops up for the entire server. It has limited space though so once it's full it disappears off the map.
---
I've mostly found them in level 3 safes or as a reward from Distant Thunder.
---
How does one play medic, and would they get the full rewards?
---
Yes there are hackers on PC. 
---
But dropping his gamertag violates the no witch hunting rule on this sub. ;)
---
Did you try loading into a different character? What about joining a team and having them start the match.
---
What about starting in adventure mode first then go back to NW
---
If your spawning in dead try to find ways such as changing endurance in adventure and going to NW might work. 
---
Once you start to spawn in normally it shouldn‚Äôt do it again.
---
This is the first time I ever heard of this kind of bug.
---
That wasnt the point , I was right there , on my B day no less.
---
Ahhhh the plushie! Thats what I'm after!
---
Most players seemed to be using automatic weapons but I don't know if that would've done it? I have an explosive combat rifle... Could I have been the one to mess it up?
---
I'm going to launch a nuke this weekend when I have a little more time and try again. Gives me a few days to recoup the ammo I used haha.
---
Yeah came out on Monday and I love it being I can carry another 40 on my 3 star all unyielding secret service armor. So now i can carry over 600 with food buffs
---
I've done it maybe 4 times. Got the pickaxe, colossus rug and then the plushie twice.
---
I just want the mining gas mask.
---
Pipe Revolver build can actually deal a lot of damage.
---
God mode got patched forever ago, dude.
---
It's not a bug. Bethesda expects you to manage your caps and vendor inventory. That's why i always keep my vendors behind windowed walls and connected to a power switch. I have 4 vendors all full of items for sale and hit cap max frequently. When i get close enough, i turn their power switch off to stop advertising that i have vendors and replace the windowed walls with standard walls incase someone randomly finds my camp. That way I don't lose out on the caps I'd make if they buy from me while cap maxed.
---
Also, if you're cap maxed and you have folks literally opening Christmas gifts to get the caps to buy more stuff from you, just leave the server. That way you can hop to a server where folks aren't cleaning out your inventory with you getting nothing for it and can take down your vendors until such time as you're low enough on caps to want to re-open your vendors
---
Nah never.
---
I guess. The best weapons to keep for scrip is 3* unarmed or 1h weapons like boxing glove or rolling pin.
---
Lol!
---
The RaRa one is funny, because the game definitely tracks the state correctly, as she'll fetch the plasma gun for you if you were nice.
---
This suggests it SHOULD be an easy fix since the state is known, they just need to fix the conditions on the dialogs and the barks.  However, Bethesda can turn a single easy fix into 6 new bugs so I'm not holding my breath.
---
No I doubt that would do it. But if someone was using magic guns or legacies it could slow frames down I guess
---
By "play medic" I mean run around and revive downed players. It's what I did when I was new to the game and tried joining SBQ events as a low level.
---
And no, they can't loot the boss if they don't deal enough damage to said boss.
---
Yes it goes on a discount but Beth doesn‚Äôt notify u and dormant show the discount but yea there is
---
I would give it another try if it did. I only played the most when I was doing the battle pass and when I got all survivor, Halloween and Christmas rewards. Since I finished all them I haven‚Äôt touched it since
---
The night is dark and full of terrors.
---
Almost being the key word there.
---
Were you able to complete the event?
---
When is it going live on public servers, specifically console? And how long will it last?
---
My bf and I played this event. He‚Äôs level 31 and I‚Äôm 139. Whenever I died and the revive option was available he‚Äôd revive me. He was actually useful to the event in that sense. Earle and his Wendigo goons seem attracted to me bc I usually do the most damage to him and he seems to target whoever damages him the most (which makes sense). It was actually pretty fun and we both leveled up. But in general yeah I agree. Please be at least level 50 and have good weapons. Bloodied heavies is  the best build for this so it‚Äôs preferred but not requires.
---
This would be great
---
Huh good point. 
---
Welp. Hope I have better luck next time I guess!
---
There's no legendary plans, with the exception of the 3 current endgame vendors, Samuel at Foundation, Mortimer the robot inside Crater, and Regs the Secret service guy at Vault 95.
---
They each have weapon and armor plans that require legendary modules or vault steel to build, which is available at the Purveyor at The Rusty Pick in The Ash Heap.
---
Also at The Purveyor's, you can try your luck at guaranteed legendary weapons or armor. But it is random what you will get. The possible drops come from EVERY weapon or armor you have already obtained beforehand.
---
But you occasionally get a lucky drop, or might have something in high demand that you have no use for.
---
Bloodied pipe revolver rifle is dope though. At least until patch 22
---
Hey bit of advice if you‚Äôre running on fusion cores/ultracite fusion cores use the perk that doubles them. It gives you 1k rounds instead of 500
---
When not necessary? If a boss fight isn‚Äôt a good time to use consumables, I don‚Äôt know what is.
---
I am not sure if this is related: however, today I decided to do the event with my commando that uses tesla weapons. We also had another party member that also used tesla weapons during the fight and this resulted in a tremendous amount of lag. I have done this event at least 6 times before without tesla and had not experienced this much lag.
---
So it might be related to that weapon. Now that I think about it, I do remember people complaining about lag in general that is caused by tesla weapons.
---
Bethesda: "No."
---
It isnt. That is very similar to my build and I can solo him in like 10-15min. Just sit where you drop, stay crouched. He comes close, but cant get to you, and his ranged attacks hit the base of the wood.
---
Edit: I‚Äôm also running bloody.  Next edit will have a link for my perks.
---
Edit2: https://imgur.com/a/GSqkkf2
---
Actually, my bigger problem is the daily 150 Scrip limit just being far too low.
---
The problem with this system is that Scrip begets Scrip.  Most of the drops you find go into the Scrip grinder.  Most of the things you buy from Murmrgh end up going right back into the Scrip grinder as well.  You can kick the need to spend your Scrip down the line by purchasing Legendary Modules, but unless you actually use those, you're spending a bunch of Carry Weight for something that will likely turn into Scrip again.
---
In my opinion, I'd like to see the Legendary Module system expanded to work on any crafted weapon or armor.  Say I want a Legendary Light Metal Right Arm, because I really want that to complete my armor set.  There's currently no intelligible way to accomplish this.  You have to get lucky.  You'll probably need to turn to an outside-the-game source.
---
Instead, let me buy a Legendary Module and roll that specific piece.  The vast majority will be crap, but I know that, eventually, I *can* get that specific piece I want.
---
And make it sellable. People want the game to be "immersive", isn't selling ammo for other goods immersive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland?
---
I swear us shotgunners are having the best time with this event.
---
Enable pacifist mode and you'll be okay
---
One more query... were you all running same builds or slightly different?
---
Mmmmmmm death by snu snu gooood
---
It's against the rules of the game to sell game items for real money. It's also against this subs rules to be discussing doing it here. Also it's extremely exploitive to be doing it in the first place. If Bethesda was selling weapons in the Atom Shop people would be rightfully outraged, this same thing applies to you.
---
I'm low level at level 32 and my level 57 friend keeps trying to join it. I seen what Earl does, why the hell would a low level like me not realize what that beast could do I finally got a good gun they want me to do a event getting killed every 5 seconds please.
---
Are you saying that when I purchase a 3 star legendary ranged weapon from mrgmrghmghrgehgehrm or whatever, it'll always be something that I have already had in the past?
---
It‚Äôs against tos to do such a thing and leaving a online print that can possibly trace back to your main account is not a smart move.
---
It‚Äôs much safer to do it between friends or people you know.
---
Your taking a risk doing this, but, if you really need the money it‚Äôs possible.
---
I don't believe that's a thing.
---
Ahhhhh! There was someone with a tesla weapon. And another with an Ultracet gatling. Maybe those two together is what caused it. 
---
I think I remember having a similar issue in Uranium fever when someone used a tesla weapon too.
---
The dragon has 4 barrels anyway. Bloodied is a main legendary effect. There's also a main legendary effect called Quad. (what that does is means the weapon can take more rounds   between reloads. So in effect you'd be able to shoot 4 separate shots/clicks in series before reloading. (although when you do eventually reload it will take 4 times as long)  
---
You can't get bloodied and quad on the same gun. :)
---
&gt;gatekeeping 
---
Sure buddy. It's not gatekeeping when the event literally says its "very hard", your just taking a spot away from someone who could actually *do* something.
---
&gt; **EARLE LAUNCHES MY WARM WET CORPSE TO THE MOON** 
---
This is going to sound weird, but why does this phrase sound dirty to me?
---
I'm on console.  Moved my Camp.  Didn't get the budget back, but the factories are gone.  Bethesda got back to me, acknowledged it as a known issue, and said they are working on a fix.
---
If you wanna try a automatic rifle build . Can't go wrong with a auto railway . They are fun..... All though only good in vats. Cause it'll rip your arm off
---
I still have some pails from the last event. I wonder if the contents will drop from the old loot table or the new one. Is that a stupid question?
---
It is really sad because tesla weapons look so awesome so it is shame that they cause lag. 
---
... I wanna be a Sith Lord who shoots lighting at people :(
---
Upvoted for a good story, but mostly for quoting Ron White. I gotta listen to some of his stuff again soon.
---
Nooo! Sad day.
---
Perks aside, I believe weapons should be balanced through mods. Add more mods to lower tier weapons to make them more useful. Also ballistic weapons damage should be linked to ammo caliber (hello .308 and .50). Weapons with a single ammo type can be buffed with rof mods. Energy weapons can burn more ammo to produce more damage or add rof mods.
---
Woah, cool!
---
Will they take spoiled meat and alcohol as donations? I have lots of that.
---
That's good. How much budget did you lose?
---
It's a 'been there and got the t shirt' event for me too.
---
I found it enjoyable but I'd never be able to solo it and unless I befriend a handful of really elite peeps I probably won't bother to go again.
---
They give us 4 day bonus xp ‚Äòweekends‚Äô, it‚Äôs ok if they fudge the numbers sometimes
---
It‚Äôs not necessarily a bad one. Especially if your running commando. It will come in handy with robots and work great as a starter weapon. but your definitely going to want to seek out a different one depending on your build. I will leave a list of what your going to want based on your build. 
---
If rifleman= instigating
---
If commando= furious or anti armor. But I believe furious does not work well with the explosive effect so keep that in mind. I personally prefer furious because it stacks pretty well in vats.
---
I feel like it's a weird mentality behind buying higher priced items simply because they're higher priced. Like someone feels like they got something even more special because they just spent two thirds of they're stores on it lol
---
Thanks guys. 
---
That's basically what I said when my friend suggested it, he just said it like it was common place.
---
Also just to clarify, I have never done this, I was merely looking for info as the last thing I wanted after years of playing was to get myself banned lol. 
---
It was something that had never occurred to me so I just thought I'd put it out there and see if I was the only one not getting paid to play lol
---
I hate to say it but Grahm can sell them fairly often. Luckily we'll be getting a second round of Meat Week soon so you'll be able to server hop and check him until you find it if need be.
---
Brotherhood of bongs
---
I've never seen it on sale. Same with atoms. I check fairly regularly too. I can't speak for 2018 and early 2019 though.
---
Tuff. Thanks tho bro

1. Create a Folder Bookmark for 76. The top on the list should be the Fallout wiki and "Nukes and Dragons" site. A build is where you intend to focus on a weapon group and playstyle. There's no real 'correct' way to play. Skill is also a major factor.
---
2. I play solo most of the time and have 2 alts but they are largely ignored. My main is a Stealth Sniper and uses VATS quite often. My build for a Sniper and what perks I use may not work for you.
---
3. Many perks are situational and don't need to be on all the time. In my experience, rank 1 of any damage perk simply isn't enough. I have Rifleman, Expert Rifleman, and Master Rifleman all maxed. The wiki also has a page for all the perks and which ones related to what weapons group.
---
4. In my experience, a melee only build isn't good. Every enemy has a ranged attack and you're powerless until you get close enough. 
---
5. I've rarely used Power Armor. I have a mixed set in my Stash 'just because' right now. I'm not sure but I think you can craft fusion cores somehow.
---
6. Endurance perks are largely ease of life but END does give more HP. My main has 1 END. 
---
7. Gear and Perks are essential to each other.
---
8. A 1 Star Legendary can be as good as a 3 Star while a 3 Star can be worse than a 1 Star.
---
9. Quests give rewards including plans, recipes, gear, food, etc. Most if not all is geared toward your current level but also in increments of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. with variations being 10 and 15. Some quests have a guaranteed legendary drop many of which are the best after being completed at level 50. 
---
10. Keep your CAMP simple. It's better, IMO to wait until after 50 before you start to 'pimp it out'.
---
11. Shop around for stuff. The Ammo converter is SO SLOW.
---
12. You'll find many like myself who'll make or give things away for free. Helping new plays is something I like to do. Early on, everything is going to be of value
---
13. Always carry a high damage melee weapon. Killing low level mobs can save a lot of ammo.
---
14. Scrap what you need for your CAMP, repairing, and making things. Sell the rest. Early on sell all the chems you find except for Stimpacks, Radaway, and Rad-X.
---
PM me for any more questions and I'll do my best to keep things spoiler free.
---
Dang it you got me good with the sith comment.
---
They do look really neat though!
---
About 10-15% is my best guess.
---
It sucks, I team with low levels all the time, build fusion reactors in their camps, load them up with supplies.  I've taken blind invites before and played since month 1, now this happens.
---
Some say child workers others say adults
---
I'm lv 225 and I was the only person over level 50. It was more of a pain in the butt for my first run, but thank the mothman that I've hoarded 2mm rounds like it was stimpacks in f4.
---
yeah, your welcome. I usually drop stuff I dont need and I'm sure I'm not the only one who does that. I also keep the overseers camp stash full of starter items. Usually a fully equipped lvl 5 armor set with a hunting rifle and ammo.
---
I was working toward getting it. WTH.    
---
I do have the Chemist mod.
---
Really hard to not die when the fucking game lags out everytime you try to use vats and the enemy can just stagger you over and over again before you can reload your gun
---
Wow, that must have been a lot of factories...
---
I'm a bit concerned as to what you're doing to be making such little progress. I can typically get at least a level a day just doing events and killing things without having to go out of my way to grinding things.(currently 171 on my main and usually don't run any xp buffs). 
---
From my knowledge, legendaries and bosses don't give any kind of grand amount of xp(like the sheepsquach you mentioned). Even the scorchbeast queen doesn't give you all that much. Sure, it's a noticeable bump but not a quarter level or anything. There's also to consider that xp you get from enemies scale depending on level(as a level 20-30, a lvl62 ghoul would easily get me 300+xp, now it's generally aroudn 162xp) and that the requirement to level changes from 50-99 and 100+. The requirements are constant from 50-99, and then it's essentially doubled once you hit 100. 
---
I'm not entirely sure what you're saying in regards to a lack of information. There are plenty of possible builds and most of the gear information is stated(magazine size would be nice). I'm just glad that the perk system isn't like Destiny2's class system where it's "choose A, B, or C". The perk cards are pretty straightforward with what they do, though a few may be a bit unclear. Having exact numbers would be nice but it would be a bit much(like buffs based on remaining health). Even then, there's tons of information you can easily look up online where people do having exact numbers down in tables and spreadsheets(if you don't look them up online, there's even a perk that tells you an enemy's armor stats while using VATS).
---
One thing that I'm definitely confused about is that you say that you "will not start an alt because \[you\] like the character \[you\] made" and yet you're going and respecing for an entirely different build. Of course it's going to take a while because you're trying to start something at an endgame point. It would literally be easier to have started a new character for a completely different build. Then with how you phrase it, it's like you're saying that you'll have to complete everything again if you make a new character(for all achievements, you'll need 2 characters anyway). Sure you'll have to complete a few things here and there but it's not like you'll actually need to repeat everything or that you'll be going back to every single location. With the public teams, it's incredibly easy to get around and grab fast-travel points without even spending caps. 
---
The way I see it, when you're making a character, plan ahead and spec towards the build you want to have endgame. Even with card packs, there's no way you'll get exactly everything you want by 50 so the next 10-20 are generally for fine-tuning. Like said, if you just started a new character, it would be a lot faster as you need less xp to level and you'd be getting a ton more xp for each kill.
---
The quest has been bugged for about 3 weeks in the next hot fix I believe that are going to fix it I‚Äôm not too sure though
---
Too bad it doesnt help against the wendigo spawns during ACP
---
&gt;  child workers
---
Anything in game to support that idea? Sounds really messed up and certainly like the kind of thing that would happen in the FO universe.
---
You don't have the colossal plushie yet.

I'm 0 for 12 now. All I get are stupid cursed pickaxes and harpoon guns.

---
Ya, been using for quite a long time now.... saved me 3 points of Luck ...
---
Maybe so many people farming screws and wasting time on the adds is why there seems to be so much trouble for people on consoles completing this event.
---
The title had me goin for a sec
---
I fill my urinals with them.
---
I loathe the builds and gear which require you to be weaker in some aspect. As a slightly disabled gamer, I can't nor want to pursue a Bloodied Build.
---
All i wanted was the Chally mask and i didn't get even one of them.
---
What‚Äôs the reward for this one?
---
I fast travelled out with 5 seconds on the clock.... Guess that exits you from the event...
---
Chemist is saving me 3 on STR. Thing is I don't carry that many Chems but I do tend to go after them as priority in loot.  
---
I do carry more food/drink but one of my armor pieces has that 20% weigh reduction for them.
---
Seriously. No love for thicc batmom.
---
They drop toys that‚Äôs where the theory comes from

Can I also get one?

And you can scrap em all at the same time
---
Warm wet anything sounds dirty
---
They need to unique-up the Fallout 1st exclusive gifts instead of just reskinning the same outfit.
---
Yeah I didn't know it aas a no no, so I put it in my camp. When I heard it was, I had to move my camp tp get rid of it, but now I have some of my budget taken up, with literally NOTHING built, nothing in storage, no blue prints of any type and nothing in my stash. 
---
Just don't do it.
---
I mean, I'd settle for a normal Scorchbeast Plushie...
---
And then they could make the Queen version a Giant Plushie like the Sheepsquatch Plushie we got in The Legendary Run.
---
You've got a bad attitude, you asked a question, you got an answer and you started mouthing off.

Maybe this Reddit isn't for you.

 "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo"
---
Im pretty sure the dailies have a countdown timer above them if you can sign on rn
---
Fuck that. If Bethesda wants to give me a job they can give me a contract and a health plan.
---
Why not?
---
Now the secret‚Äôs out.
---
I wonder if these type of players are the ones complaining about the death timer and demanding that it should be removed so they can Zerg rush anything.
---
Ok cheers
---
Hm that was happening with tomahawks and throwing knives iirc, until they patched it not long ago. They completely forgot about this "new" item
---
Im try and delete what it was on hope that fixes it cause i like my camp
---
Maybe but it is a ranger after all which is cool

This type of post will soon replace the auto completion bug as the most reposted thing on the sub.
---
i've been going in since like level 50 with a bloodied/rad melee build without PA, has been alright. only fucked up on my first one since I didn't know what i was doing or what was going on and also this is like my 2nd week playing the game lol. Thankfully he dropped me a level 45 ver on [this](https://i.imgur.com/kUMOxUX.png) so it made it easier for me to one shot the lil buddies to keep them off everyone.
---
Also yes I do go thru a lot of stims lmao.
---
Thanks I would have never gone back on that board as I finished 10 plus days ago.
---
Didn't know there was a vendor bot near to Foundation. Thanks for the tip
---
I run a tanky Vampire shotgun build. health is almost always capped off.
---
And why can't I interact with my other plushes to have them make a sound like we can with the Earle plush? Mr. Pebbles should make angry sounds at being poked.
---
After seeing faster swing speed and improved power attack on the other two, it made me think maybe the improved bashing had some weird benefit I didn't know about.
---
Run one character to start. You‚Äôll be able to redo missions with her anytime.
---
The camps could be close together or far apart whatever makes her the happiest lol you‚Äôll save a bit of caps having them farther apart and use them as fast travel points.
---
Sniper/sneak is viable. Rifle builds are pretty dope overall
---
Dude he gave a dumb ass answer it like very obvious im the post i said pre mutations suit now it is know they had a special mining suit we can tell because of the breathing apparatus he gave really stupid and obvious answer
---
This is great. Anyone know when the event will be in the game and not PTS?
---
Other than some XP from events, XP is driven solely by kills and the type/level of enemy you are killing.  You have to go somewhere where there are lots of tough enemies (Ghouls or Super Mutants are best for XP) and whittle them away.  The higher your effective INT stat, the more experiece you get.  Eat lots of cranberry stuff, brain bombs/soup, stay rested and hope some kind soul will open a lunchbox for you.  You should be leveling easily several times per session at your level.  Wandering around exploring and killing random enemies that you may come across won't level you very quickly at all.
---
Because it is INEVITABLE!
---
Its just so slooooow
---
Thats a really good theory I like this
---
What melee does this even apply to? Or is it just the ax?
---
The Medic Pump mod saves me constantly from Earle's poison.
---
You buy certain weapon and armor plans from the gold bullion vendors, such as Gauss Shotgun from Samuel at Foundation. To craft them, you need legendary modules that you buy with scrip from the Purveyor. The thing is, you don't get to choose what type of legendaries they become, it's all random. You might have to do a lot of crafting to get the roll you're looking for.
---
You can also use scrip at the Purveyor for random, fully-crafted legendaries instead of modules.
---
More like there‚Äôs no reason to do anything
---
It‚Äôs unstable at 8.   Super fucky when there is 8 people and three dozen wendigos

Bethesda: ‚Äú...‚Äù
---
Well that's a new one. The amount of weird spawns people on here find never ceases to amaze me.
---
Correct, if you have picked up only Combat shotguns and laser pistols from leaving the vault, and not picked up any other weapons, your possible drops for ranged weapons would only be Combat shotguns and laser pistols. But depending on how many legendary stars you are looking for, 1,2, or 3 stars, the chance of you getting exactly what you want be come smaller.
---
If you just wanted an Anti armor Combat shogun, you would pick 1 star ranged weapon, but you might have to deal with Vampire, Junkies, Bloodied, Two shot versions of shotguns and pistols before your Anti armor drops.
---
If you wanted Anti armor Shotgun with faster reload, you then have the same issues, but now you have the second star's possibly to deal with, VATS increases, damage reduction,faster movement while aiming,and many more options.
---
3 star weapons, while being highly sought after, are very, very hard to get the exact perks you want, you might have to just accept you'll never roll your God weapon, and have 5 'nearly' weapons instead.
---
Check trade posts on other reddits to find out what's most wanted to get an idea of what you might need to trade.
---
What perk is that
---
Deleting the roof fixed it thank you.
---
Your build is fine, you just need a Bloodied weapon with better DPS to feel like your doing more against the SBQ. Even just a 1* primed Bloodied .50 Cal and you'll chew up here health pretty good. Either that or a Bloodied primed Gatling Plasma, Ultracite Gatling Laser or LMG will make you pretty powerful.

I hate things like that b/c it requires me to play a certain way or those effects don't kick in. Common sense in that all gamers' skill isn't the same.

You can find out how many times you have been reported in the past on that account. very easy to find page google "how many times have i been reported xbox live" and it should be top result. You dont get suspended for saying wtf unless you have a history of being reported. If i may ask, can we see the photo of your suspension then another photo of the site showing how many times you have been reported? You do not have to and i wont hold it against you :) ITs funny, how many times i called people bitches for messaging me like you did .... and im still here playing hahaha guess we just get unlucky. hint hint: messaging them just gives them more power, i just love when some angry person messages me outside of game thinking they look in the right. This isnt a jab against you at all just forwarding my feelings!!
---
That's what I thought.
---
Wholesome, thank you for the smile today &lt;3
---
Your weapons, if top tier now will still be top tier after the "nerf". They're not making anything more or less powerful relatively speaking, just changing how the multipliers work.
---
Myself, I like using one gun army. And I don't know how much it would affect you being a bloodied build, but I would swap out dodgy for rank three of adrenaline. I use rank five adrenaline on my vampire heavy and she absolutely shreds.

I use t-51, emergency protocol chest. When I run queen or colossus I bring my HP to 40% any other time I'm @ 19% HP.  All my weapons are bloodied, I like using energy weapons but fortunate enough to have bloodied .50 cal and gatling guns.

I heard one of the creative directors of wastelanders was a fallout 2 dev so I'm pretty hype that they're bringing back so many original creatures that weren't brought over in the jump to fallout 3

I don't have an update about this issue but I know the team is definitely investigating it

It‚Äôs funky with floors, try playing around with different heights and such. Changing floors can also help.

So far the only bloodied heavy gun I have is the 1 star bloodied Gatling gun. I was thinking of making it prime.

Yeah like is it really that hard to make it autoclose after 5 seconds?
---
Sorry. I was interrupted multiple times before posting. At the end I felt I left thoughts out but posted anyways. 
---
Like I said, I thought I was at 99, not 100 and nothing really to confirm it. Except of course for the claiming the PA skin in the final space which is actually a huge giveaway. 
---
But as it is there is nothing on the board that tells you about the game board and the jangles stein. Frankly the people in here reminded me the stein was a thing, I had forgotten about it. 
---
I guess the empty bar was a glitch as it is full now, but at the time It was just confusing everything so if have to agree, it be nice to at least have a slightly different "claim" notification to let us know it's all over.
---
I avoided adrenaline because apparently it was bugged at the moment.
---
To the best of my knowledge, it's working now.

Lol

Thank you! I don‚Äôt really carry food on me except for spoiled meat. And I usually carry inert flux for drinks. So true hiker would be useless for me. But the rest I‚Äôll think about.

I was running it against Earle using a VFFR minigun with outstanding results.

---
Yeah, I don't really know what your wife is like, so it's a little hard to tell. Has she played any fallout games in the past? 'Cause if this is her first fallout experience, it may forever change her view of the franchise forever. Me and my bf play together and having a camp nearby isn't so much an issue because you can fast travel to your friends and your teammates for free. But if she feels more comfortable being your neighbor, then you should do that. Both of us have both high and low level characters, making muling items easier. But I will have to say, the one most important thing, don't yell out loud at other players for doing stupid shit or not playing your game style, I've experienced it and for a sec there it felt like I was being yelled at and that I didn't belong in the game anymore because I wasn't some op god tier player. Like I said, I don't know your wife, but personally, I'm a bit of a sensitive person,  and if she's not, awesome I wish I wasn't.
---
I've done it 21 times and now have every item, multiples of all except head and helmet.
---
There are multiple bugs related to core weapons. Most if not all of them stem from that stupid system where it equips multiple cores at once
---
Yup neither do I. Its more for the added agility/AP. I like to have my Agility at min. 10 points for Qol. U don't want to have to stop after running 3 steps.
---
i was able to take several hits from earle and the wendigos as a level 45 in excavator power armor, and was able to contribute to maybe 5-10% of the boss overall. i see lots of people with the irradiated health bar doing this challenge and getting whapped by the environment traps suddenly.
---
 i could never bring myself to sacrifice survivability for damage output and it seems like it worked out for this, but it also still seems like everybody and their mother runs the "bloodied" build
---
It's all F1st. They'll never split it.
---
Plz, all I want are more plushies
---
DMartin-CG
---
Someone that uses the term ‚Äòfood build‚Äô is just giving you an easy way to tell that they‚Äôre an elitist, gatekeeping, arsehole.
---
It‚Äôs rather nice of them to give others an obvious sign that they‚Äôre a twat. Makes them easy to ignore.
---
I don‚Äôt have to use any stims with a vampire weapon, but it just wastes ammo. Once I learned the event, bloodied is better. I use about 10 stims But save around 2k .50 cal ammo.
---
Because they are denial and still believe that the Mothman is the true lord and savior. Don't worry, they will see the truth in time. just have faith.
---
Yeah i guess the cybernetics doesn't make sense as a mutation...but god dammit i still think its cool to have terminator-esque versions of enemies that shoot eye lasers.
---
Maybe it can be repurposed as some Kronenberg type of mutation where they combine with mechanical parts or gun parts?
---
You can circumvent that delay a little by gun bashing.
---
Hit the bash bind and then start mashing your stimpack and you'll get it faster than releasing trigger and mashing stimpack. At least in my experience it feels faster, anyway.
---
When I do actually get to play the event, the fps is only bad when someone used an explosive heavy weapon, and it‚Äôs only demonicly bad when someone uses a tesla rifle. Those damn tesla rifles can tank the fps down to a damn slide show
---
Oh, I think you need guns and bullets 5 on
---
I haven‚Äôt tried running inside yet, only clicking on the event icon.  But the third time tonight I got a full group by traveling right away.
---
I think you need guns and bullets 5 on
---
Ironically, these people use the chemist backpack mod from the raider bullion vendor.
---
I use travelling pharmacy ‚Äòcause I have spare points in my build and PA is screwed when it comes to carry weight.

Dont have another character but I can try that. Tried the rest but I just spawn in dead as if I took max rads.
---
Weapons that have over 200 fire rate and have a specific effect
---
Anit-armor legendary effect is halved while in use with an anti-armor perk card. Only -25%+card instead of -50%+card.
---
PTS is still working through changes. I wouldn't start hedging against what goes on there but the general consensus is if it's good now it'll still be good. What it looks like is they are flattening the damage curve making builds the focus and not the weapons. You'll still do great damage for what you use but may need to put more focus into perk cards.
---
Magic weapons are weapons that for some reason do a lot more damage then they should. [Here's a video that explains everything pretty in-depth.](https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs)

Next update
---
Smh lol, I finally got it after 5 boots and reboots
---
Everybody knows the Mothman is the herald of Atom. Hence the children and cultists are one and the same.
---
I was in one the other day with 5 or 6 players in their teens, and they just kept jumping down the opening and dying and repeating.  I just left the instance, not sure what was going on.
---
Had a level 12, 18 and 30 today at the event. 
---
We very much failed.
---
I thought not because its legacy right?
---
The main issue is the debris honestly
---
dammit
---
They only drop from Savage Divide events now.
---
Power user Intellect card +33%/+66%/+100% fusion core duration. Raises Gatling laser ammo per core from 500 to 999. Doesn't affect gatling plasma.
---
When I saw angryyTurtle he had rank 3 but he was doing a vid, and of course you would have max rank, to show it work.  I did swap a perk and tried to heal the brahmin and hacked it right in half (bloody mess triggered). I am sure the look on my face was priceless. So anyway, the card could have not registered yet and didn't trigger.  So wack something not important with rank 1.  Preferably not my milk'n cow .. got to have that spoiled milk for my 30 rads.
---
And here I thought it was a build that focused on using Food Buffs.
---
When you have the camera pointed at the correct place it will display text on the screen for what or who they are in the upper right hand corner. I believe the key to this one is you have to be on the outside of it looking up at the top.
---
Thanks for the laugh. The amount of posts that exist here about that are glorious.
---
I have a clip somewhere of going from 843 rounds to 0.
---
Vats. Or you could use Vats, most shotgun builds use Vats. Me on the other hand use Vats. I dropped perception to 1 point and rely on vats. U can get fancy with it and use concentrated fire but I have more success aiming for body.
---
[here you go](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=fallout+76+magic+weapons+)

They are all at different angles and use different lighting and effects. I like to have variety

Come, join us. Drink from the waters of the Glow!!!
---
They removed the legacy aspect awhile back
---
I'm a Hubologist. I paid good caps to get this irradiated.
---
I honestly don't know what you're saying. That's probably my fault, but I don't understand.
---
I like u!
---
If it makes you feel any better, I'm level 182 but I don't have a specific build and my weapons are for shit.  So it isn't just low levels that will fuck your game up.  We're EVERY LEVEL.
---
So only legacy is explosive weapons or what

Man today was a great loss for me. I went to fight and almost got it down to half its health but then I ran outta ammo I died by multiple wendigo spawn gave up but when I tried to go back down the path was already sealed and while running down to try and get the loot out of it the mine came down to me. But that's not the worst thing.... I accidentally dropped my .50 caliber custom prime machine gun while trying to use a buff and wasn't able to recover it because the mine collapsed.
---
Any idea what the prize is? And is this the last event of this kind.
---
Cranberry Bog is supposedly the rare one IIRC.
---
That def sucks.
---
Not sure why you felt it was necessary to keep shooting that corpse around. I didn't need to see much more after that.
---
Legacy are weapons that were removed from the drop pool, explosive Dragons, Flamers, etc. Supposedly.
---
Really want this helmet without the cap!
---
Toxic valley is where it's at for logs üòâ
---
Dude.  You use vats?  Nobody uses vats anymore, we use vats instead.
---
I stand corrected , no more is needed :) Thank you responding. It must be a changing landscape for such a petty response from microsoft.
---
I had a buddy tell me you can get them from enclave events. Not verified yet but worth a try?
---
But..... I've got wood.... just not the kind you are looking for....
---
If you have done the Raider robot, Rosie's quests, you will be able to access the Pleasant Valley hotel. Down in the basement there is a door that requires a pass card, look under the doormat for it, and there you will find the Pleasant Valley Valet bot. If you normally check for junk on bodies you might find a claim ticket that the robot will take, and if you are VERY lucky, you might snag The Fancy Pump Action Shotgun. It's something like a 2% drop chance, so don't expect it to get it quickly.
---
Don‚Äôt do anything drastic until the final product is at least imminent. What we‚Äôre seeing now isn‚Äôt simply a nerf, it‚Äôs a major change to the damage system and there are more steps that will certainly be taken. There are a bunch of things not working right, perks not applying to some things etc. Don‚Äôt jump to any conclusions just yet.
---
I would assume only fusing of the flesh would have to happen, which a nuclear blast can solve. One problem however, they wouldn‚Äôt be functional.
---
Yup. Just confirmed. They were built like that to stagger players regardless.
---
Lol this amused the hell out of me. Good post
---
Yeah well according to most on here you would be unwanted and a waste of space in this event. I played the event with a level 11 earlier and he didn‚Äôt die once but was helping while my level 382 team leader was revived at least 6 times. Go figure.
---
My Fixer, Tesla, and Handmade all appear to reload prematurely as well.  Visual Bug with the counter?
---
No it won‚Äôt.
---
Theres a brand new song topping the charts in the Wasteland, straight from
---
The Appalachian Invasion, the Radroaches playing "6 Days of Meat"
---
I ain't got nothing but meat, Grahm, 6 days of meat.
---
6 days of meat, I lo-o-o-o-ove you... 
---
6 days of meat, ain't enough to show how much I care...
---
If this works I‚Äôll name something important after you.
---
no
---
I play rifle and sometimes is a little hard to play with others. I usually play fallout76 with my teenage boys. 
---
If my oldest is playing his sneak build there is  no problems. But when they play other builds or both are playing its constant dad move faster......dad where are you i hate that stealth suit(switched to unyielding and bloody to fix not being seen). Lol
---
So depending on playstyles and builds. 
---
I would second making camps further apart to save on caps moving across the map. 
---
You can also just get one 1st account and make it the crafter builder and junk horder. Works pretty good. The non1st account keeps just enough to repair weapons and armor.
---
They are basically like Deathclaws where they were purposely made as weapons.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
no that was changed it is only savage divide events now and its a small chance
---
It wasn't necessary,  but it was fun.
---
I member.
---
Doesn't have to be realistic. Also they could just create a crazy scientist npc questline who "experiments" on victims/creatures which is why they appear.
---
I mostly just want that Deathclaw Hunter outfit
---
And have it store caps so you can hold more than just 30k
---
Never saw this glitch until the first Mole Miner Treasure Hunter event. I wonder if this is what the Mole Miner model looks like under the costume.
---
Couldn't. resist. Downvote... Aahahahhahaha
---
that deathclaw hunter outfit gonna be worth a lot
---
You get both masks (urban and forest) together as a super rare event reward in Savage Divide. I got them yesterday in Uranium Fever (plus all the super rare jumpsuits). It's like a 0.2% chance or something stupidly low like that.
---
What's a food build?
---
I personally like it cause when it reloads it gives me an extra mag due to it not taking a core
---
I've done it twice so far. First time was just me and a friend, no one else showed up. We got destroyed, couldn't even wait for it to fail.
---
Second time was with a group of six and it took forever to kill, like there had to be only 5 minutes left. No one must of been OP because it was just endless wendigo spawns and wasting ammo left and right and barely doing any damage to the damn thing. We finally completed it and I got my plushie but I was extremely dissapointed with this event, I was looking quite forward to it.
---
I have a full suit of X-01 and my armor was being cut through like butter leading to me die many times. I'm a mainly two handed melee focus build with an option for Rifles and Big guns if I swap my cards. So with my armor being basically nothing, I can't get close to him to use my axe. I can get right in the SBQ's face with the axe and barely take any damage.
---
Last time I went on, server didn't have any recent nukings of the mine and no one looked to be doing it soon. Event seems dead on xbox.
---
Oh no. Now you've done it, they're pulling out the slide rules and calculators.
---
Eh I just rather stick to mutations, if this was at the Big MT then sure but some wacko managing to merge the two together is kinda, too wacky. Especially since the scientist at the Big MT couldn‚Äôt even do that.
---
Really, why is scrapper left active, seems like some of those perks could be better allocated. Stash management would eliminate the need for traveling pharmacy and thru hiker.
---
i think that this is because you reload when the magazine/power thing isn't depleted, which leaves you with a bunch of low charge magazines. to fix this leave all the low charge fusion cores in your stash
---
No, bad dog.
---
I have bloodied shiskabob purely for friendly fire in events like Radiation Rumble, Riding Shotgun, Project Paradise, etc.
---
Jeez I can only imagine how rare it must be if this one took a thousand hours to drop lol. Maybe I can trade it for something good who knows
---
oh god the knockdown
---
&lt;Wanamingo knocks you down&gt;
---
&lt;Wanamingo crits you for 36 dmg&gt;
---
&lt;Wanamingo hits you for 20 dmg&gt;
---
&lt;you die&gt;
---
What's your platform? I plan on farming Collosal Problem for most of this Saturday
---
Just out of curiosity, what are you hoping to get? Sounds like you have already optimized gear; is there something special you are chasing or do you just like the chase itself?
---
My best guess?: It'll likely collect Fusion Cells, Brotherhood/Military type items.
---
Oh! And likewise, you too.
---
Don't worry, I got you man, some Todd-licker downvoted you.
---
First time I saw one in 76 was a couple of weeks back at Dolly Sods. I had no idea the brought them into the game or that the one at Dolly Sods could even be different form the usual dusky variant.
---
Woof?!?
---
What's in the box!?
---
Can you give me a little more detail on the rifle build? Is it more of a medium range/long range?
---
My favorite is the legendary chicken haha
---
I got in an instance where the lowest level was an 87. Everyone else was above 200. But the server had to crash so that was wasted I guess
---
Do you mean the outfits that are exclusive to 1st? Because if so, you still need to craft them at a workbench
---
I don't think I have ever yelled at anyone over a video game xd. But I willnote not to do that :)
---
No I mean everything, I can‚Äôt get access to the private worlds, atoms, etc
---
I got caught in that, too! Pinged the Deathclaw with a little potshot to get the legendary drop after it was killed and then sat on top of the substation raining lead into the Sheepsquatch to get a second one.
---
Ouch, this is what console players are dealing with? Is that on an xbox one x?
---
At least the M word wasn't used.
---
Maybe shooting targets? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But that‚Äôs a quest item.

This is the build I use personally and combined with a good shotgun and armor, I'm able to handle most fights with ease. I have over 300 DR without power armor here so survivability is decent. Theres always things that can be tweaked tho! Mine is mainly focused around mobility with a bit of a focus on vats. Since you're usually up close and personal, perception doesn't need to be too high. Alternatively you can lower luck and raise endurance for health but there aren't a lot of perks in endurance that help with combat
---
Ahh sorry. PS4 here
---
Than it wouldn't be a server.
---
You're good
---
All my frustrations at not being able to get a box like that of my own, I assure you!
---
True but still
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a boat!
---
I've heard of this happening on XB. The real kick in the nuts is when Bathesda tells you that all of your scrap is gone and they won't replace it.
---
Nah. Just an Xbox One.
---
Sometimes quest items lose their quest item flag and stay in your inventory so I'll have to check next time I do that daily. I have some greens from Meat Week in my stash but sadly they're invisible when put in a display case. :(
---
Just call them Bambi's.
---
Your post made my day.
---
Yeah, pretty much all the perks I have in strength are to reduce weight/maximize carrying capacity (obviously). Currently, if I'm not running around looting things my average carrying weight is around 223/250. 10 of that is my power armor chassis, which has excavator armor so I mostly only bust it out when I want to temporarily carry even more stuff until I can get back to a camp or whatever. Part of the reason I had batteries included is because with the gauss rifle and the lever action rifle, I needed to carry both ballistic and energy ammo. Same with martial artist, as it was to reduce the weight of my backup melee weapon.
---
I'm on PC, incidentally.
---
Also, I just realized that I never actually got Master Rifleman (derp), so I just a bit ago finally got enough more levels to Rank 3 it and replace my lockpicking.
---
What I find with my build is that I do really, really well as long as I remain undetected (obviously), but as soon as someone detects me it's just game over. Is there any way around this or is the solution just be ready to run away?
---
Nice try, kid
---
Go into Vats,  back out of Vats, back into Vats and the first shot will be on target. You'll get the hang of it real quick.
---
Agree! Some folks seem to feel it is punishment to not be able to get every reward if they miss out on the timing. It isn‚Äôt punishment - it‚Äôs extra rewards! Sprinkles on the icing on your cupcake.
---
Maybe you can hang onto those greens for our potential and probably second helping of Meat Week in Sept? üôÉ
---
Let me know when/how i can install mods on PS4.
---
Legendary modules will never go on sale. In other news, this event will auto complete even if no one donates anything.....
---
I got a pic of people doing this also. A truly magical sight
---
Yeah, I'd never done much with Nuke Zones, before I stopped playing they were just too chaotic and deadly for me. Now though I want to build that radiation arch thing, which apparently means a ton of nuke zone materials...
---
I was just saying :( I‚Äôm paying 12 dollars anyway
---
Is this some rocket science, to spam steampacks, or most players are just bad?
---
Happened to me the first run. Second run, finally killed him, ran over to grab my loot, roof caved in. I die. End up outside the mine with nothing but the PA on my back. All that at the expense of 9 fusion cores. 
---
Not currently enjoying colossal problem.
---
I can try that. Scrapping is just such an automatic process for me that I'd probably forget to put it back on at least 70% of the time if I took it off :D
---
Ah, forgot about serums. I wish there was a way to preview what a player was selling before paying the caps to fast travel there!
---
Wow, you are one dumbass motherfucker
---
Ooo I want a mod that makes them sound. Like the adults in the old Peanuts cartoon specials... Then again.... Maybe not.
---
Bro check your dms
---
Its the [shooting targets](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Box_of_shooting_targets)
---
Its been a while since Ive done that daily quest but I feel like Ive come across the targets in loot containers outside of the quest. You also get given more locations to find them than you need to complete it I think so I think its maybe possible to acquire them without being tagged as a quest item.
---
Scorched, wendigos and robots. The true 76 experience
---
Nope, PC. Must've been a weird co-inky-dink!
---
Yep, if it fails it would make the games playerbase look like its dwindling, and Bethesdas shareholders wont let that happen
---
Economist &amp; Designers are doing balancing. Devs and QAs are handling the bug fixes/features integration.
---
Not the same people.
---
Nope, just a normal bash +40% damage. Not like bash damage was anything to shake a stick at anyways.
---
Not sure if this helps but it's one of the links on the Reddit.
---
https://www.reddit.com//r/FalloutMods/wiki/consolemodding
---
That's it for sure. Now to just try and figure out how to keep them... I can think of 3 locations off hand where they spawn.
---
Not sure anyone has noticed, but there will be Meat Week, Second Helping during September 22 - 28 period.
---
You can find the non quest version on a bench by the lockers in the big building outside the mine by whitesprings Station
---
I actually like the bugged reload. When it does manage to finish a core, it automatically loads a partial core into the gun and starts the reload animation. I cancel the reload animation each time and can finally finish my half-empty ultracite fusion cores I've been carrying forever!
---
something else to consider: I've been running rifleman (obv). I read a post by a rifleman who had switched over to commando and said it does way more damage and you can go easy on the trigger to help save ammo. i had a ton of levels saved up because of the legendary run and 2 days ago, i made the switch. just swapped the 3 riflemans for the 3 commandos. put prime auto receivers on my handmade and fixer (had just been running with prime on my primaries) it made a BIG difference for me. like even with the jump to auto, i gained something obscene like 30 damage per shot. buddy of mine tried it and it didn't make a big difference for him. I have no idea why it bumped me so, but i'm here for it. obv straighten out the rest of your build first, but it could be worth a go once you're happy with your build and just bored.
---
This. Definitely this.
---
That is the 'signs and letters plan'. A copy/paste from the wiki:
---
* [Watoga Shopping Plaza](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Watoga_Shopping_Plaza): Sold by [Brotherhood of Steel](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Steel_(Appalachia)) [vendor bot Phoenix](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vendor_bot_Phoenix).
---
* Sold by the [Brotherhood vendor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_vendor) and the [raiders vendor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raiders_vendor) at [the Whitespring Resort](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Whitespring_Resort).
---
* Sold by the [vendor bot Raider](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vendor_bot_Raider) at the [Sutton station](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sutton_station) and the [Pleasant Valley station](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pleasant_Valley_station).
---
I would absolutely argue that foundation is not a good faction.  Maybe "good" compared to the Raiders, but of the two, I'd still prefer the raiders, at least they are up front about being the way they are.
---
I've seen a few good write up's that delve into it... but between them showing up from outside the region and setting up shop (a point the raiders make, which isnt wrong.. they are not from there, they have zero claim to the land other than what they take by force), their haughty attitude with the locals (you, as the vault dweller, not to mention the raiders), the fact that Penelope Hornwright is afraid to even contact them for fear of being shot on sight (yet the 'bad' guys have both ghouls and supermutants in their camp... strange), Page and his attitude, then there is Ward.  Lets go in to that.
---
Daily he sends you off on errands as a mercenary (refuse him, he refers to you as such while he is complaining) to hunt down and kill someone.  Ok, thats pretty Raider like (they do the same, after all).  Usually its some piece of 'vital equipment' that Foundation cant do without.  Except, it isnt.  There is no option to bargain with the thief.  He wants them dead.  Period, end of story.  Even though their reason for taking it is frequently a good one (hey, if my family was dying and I had to steal the tools to keep them alive, especially if the 'good guys' wouldnt help me.. damn right I'd take it from them) , that doesnt matter.  Then when you return and say as much, he informs you that it wasnt that vital, wasnt their last one of whatever it was, but it was the 'principle'.
---
So lets recap.  You've got a group of people who left their home to take over better land elsewhere, that kill the local inhabitants, show very little tolerance for the locals or anyone that isnt 'them' (at least, not without you coercing them into it), that routinely send off mercenaries to kill whoever crosses them regardless of the situation, all the while acting lofty and king-like in the land they took, smug in their righteousness?
---
And these are your "good" guys?
---
The responders were about as close to 'good' as it gets.  Sorry, had totally forgotten about them.  Though the case could be made that had they helped the BoS and not horded their resources and turned them away, they might have been better able to deal with the scorched threat.  Maybe, maybe not.  So I'll concede the point on them.  Foundation though?  They are worse than the raiders, minus the heads on spikes.
---
for oh shit moments like that, i jump around and use my explosive handmade lol. and there's the perk (i cant remember) that allows enemies to lose you in stealth. that helps too.
---
So any idea if it gets more playable on an xbox one x?
---
Fucking dumb thing to say. If you're such a badass at the game why do you need a team? Since you can solo it and all.
---
No idea. Don‚Äôt have one. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
&gt;Even emergency protocols dont work.
---
You have to try pretty hard to have a Wendigo kill you in PA.  They can usually one-shot you if you're bloodied in SS.
---
This was my experience with it tonight.  https://imgur.com/a/mH937q9
---
What is the Rifle build style?
---
Plasma, but the difference is minimal.
---
I thought it was because I constantly reloading to early, I am a rifle build and used to hitting the reload whenever there is a small break in the traffic. Recently started using one against SBQ, and found myself reloading every couple of hundred rounds, I have since stopped doing this because I thought I was half depleting cores and generally fucking up the way it sees different core levels in my Inventory. So much fun to use, might just try a heavy gunner loadout.
---
MY idea is just cybernetics. It's not even hard to imagine about how they would implement it considering they have robo-brains and NV have implants.
---
Also there are cyborg perks and creatures already in fallout:
---
 [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Cyborg\_(organism)](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Cyborg_(organism)) 
---
 [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Cyborg\_(perk)](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Cyborg_(perk)) 
---
However i do understand that it kinda sticks out like a sore thumb from other mutation factors, i just went with cool ideas i would like to see in the game.
---
Yeah, I mean he never yells at ppl directly, like on the mic.
---
They all work great together, those three are even the mutations I have. Hasn't given any downsides so far.
---
It‚Äôs the circle of life!
---
I'm level 566.. Planning on doing multiple runs this Saturday if you want my help. I haven't done the event yet though. I'm going in Bloodied PA heavy weapons.
---
Are you still gonna be on in 10-20 minutes?
---
Couldn‚Äôt you just farm weapons with your friends
---
I completely agree.
---
There are few hairstyles in the game, the art for Fallout 4 has a lot of good post-apocalyptic hairstyles
---

Yes, if you want my ID is CM_PunkBITW
---
Thank you so much, I can't believe I've never even seen any mention of that box being there before. 281 levels and tonight was the first time I've ever seen one in a display.
---
I think i can help, mi ID is CM_PunkBITW
---
I'm just wondering if thats what everyone on Xbox is putting up with. Explains all the threads of complaints since it dropped on console too. I feel for you guys, hopefully bethesda can sort this mess out, as the event is actually really cool when it works properly.
---
Or if they were just highlighted. Basic stuff that Bethesda have a hard time doing.
---
How much longer is the event
---
Ok cool thanks! I have all that unlocked I just need more tickets hah I'll find a drop chance list somewhere
---
Anything to help really. Would save some time and frustration lol
---
I kinda want no one to hand in anything and see what happens, but that would require far too much control and influence to do.
---
You can add me too if you like, I‚Äôve done it 8-9 times now edit: dj-mike-h
---
I can join as well!
---
You kinda missed the point of what I was trying to say. The Big MT has some of the greatest minds in the world, and over the course of 200 years, they made cybernetic enhancements, but not to the extreme your talking about. They had all the resources they needed to do so, but couldn‚Äôt do it. How would some guy manage to do cybernetics without even having the proper equipment to medically merge the two together without causing necrosis of the tissue, or death. It would have to be more robot than man to keep it alive (Robobrains are a prime example). I‚Äôm just saying it kinda messes with the lore if you get my gist.
---
I remember my first time seeing one in fallout 4. Good times and terrifying
---
sweet thanks dude
---
Oh damn got me :P
---
Dear Bethesda Dev,
---
Did you forget to add protection against airborne / waterborne hazard to this helmet ? 
---
I just test it on Ash Heap and I can confirm this helm does not provide any protection against any sort of hazard, which is not right (consider the fact that both space suit helm and Chinese Stealth Suite Helm are both protecting you from airborne hazard, I can't see any reason why Cosmos Helmet is  inferior on hazard protection level. 
---
For the love of Atom, please add at least airborne hazard protection to the Captain Cosmos Helmet !
---
I‚Äôm joining U
---
I believe there's a 'Second Helping' of Meat Week as a reward for one of the resource turn-ins to the BoS, so it's not all over yet.
---
I hear ya. I just can‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôd like the cool cosmetics and the atoms but it‚Äôs just too much of a grind and I have ADD or something lol
---
This is super annoying, especially when server lag is added to the mix. It's why my gatling plasma and laser never get used in chaotic situations. Sad really. Can't even switch weapons during that time.
---
Join in a public and I‚Äôll add you, there‚Äôll be more players to help
---
I showed up today for A Graham cookout and found an empty field.  Made me sad.
---
Shooting Targets. When not active on the daiily quest, You can grab them at the big garage at the mine where uranium fever runs, and at pleasant valley ski resort in a trailer near a house on a cliff below the main resort building and they are not tagged as quest items. Now if only we were allowed to place junk items in our camps...I have a shelving unit that needs some clutter dang it.
---
That hasn't been announced yet

Yeap....Im going to be nuke launcher fresh graduate very soon. Just need to finish up the last few 2 missions maybe for the I Am Death quest. Thanks for the assist rendered to all of the going to be nuke launcher gradutae noobs! üòä

my base is at a lake at the bottom of the map and my main source of wood is a cult camp up the hill
---
On way!
---
Sad that i didn't get the Chally Mask, got everything else though. Goodbye Grahm see you next time
---
They chew through lots of ammo. Having your camp on an acid node and farming lead from lucky hole mine are really helpful ways to make this manageable.
---
I thank you and people like you who do this, so I can get those sweet sweet revives towards some paltry Atoms.
---
What the fuck is that private pile
---
Wait, how does someone elses "food build" (not even really sure what that is exactly) cause problems for HIM?
---
I do push for a non atoms version that would allow for a cheaper option.
---
They should just keep their legendary glow after death.
---
plasma with the splitter by far, but you're also a lot more likely to blow yourself up. without it they're more or less the same.
---
Yeah, I was like that.  Then I traded in Lead Belly like stuff for 100% immunity to chems and alcohol addiction because I was using them so much mainly for.....embarrassingly more carry weight (whiskey and PsychoBuff)
---
I had a similar situation, but perhaps not quite as hopeless.   I attended my first event today without stimpacks or fusion cores.  Totally unprepared lol.  Anyway I was killed numerous times and had to respawn eveytime for some reason, but each time I'd hobble back in and take another chunk off Earl using my tse 50cal....obviously the best weapon available at the moment out of the group,  but we prevailed in the end!
---
That's cute, I may adopt that.
---
Confirmed.
---
Right after my friend that had run it multiple times told me to just jump in.
---
Then laughter.
---
Then a nice "welcome to earles world"

my lvl 35 toon can kill scorchbeasts in less than a mag sooo....

There really is no reason we can't do this other than Murmrgh's weapons and armors would be pointless. But I suppose she could instead maybe sell high end stuff like stable flux, ultracite ammo, rare junk mats, etc for scrip along with the modules. That way she could still be a specialty vendor and we could also have an easier time of rolling gear.
---
Here i am, nuke launched
---
I understand and if fallout had casual cybernetics pre war I think it would work. Good thing Cyberpunk is coming out. Are you anticipating that game? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll buy it simply because I‚Äôm not that interested.
---
I'm a console player, I have to remember their exact position lol
---
I died when I read this üòÇ
---
Cool, we‚Äôll do alpha after this if you want?
---
I want the skull that indicated way higher level enemies from Fallout 4
---
Because we‚Äôre not batshit crazy who terrorize other people who don‚Äôt follow our views (Far harbor reference).
---
Tried relog or jump server?
---
Same here, ps4 lol. Pc players don't really have to or something?
---
I split the reward after siding with the Raiders just to fuck with Meg and help both groups get a foothold.
---
Plus, I support the Enclave so both groups are muties waiting to be cleansed for true Murrica' to re-establish itself...
---
The wandering musician lady is fairly decent
---
Yessir
---
It has, but I can't remember it yet. I think in the next few months.
---
Yeah, I remember fallout 4.  Why you ask?
---
Being power hungry has nothing to do with being religious.
---
Pictures have been uploaded.
---
Umm... I'm sorry wasn't this about you and your girl?And all of a sudden, this is about me? I yell back at video games sometimes myself, not the ones with ppl in them, 'cause this is my first online game. But really, this is what we're  doing? Is this actually important enough?
---
I do not see what he did there...
---
Nothing wrong with that, but I think there's a easy way that you won't be effected, and a lot of people who have time crunch issues would benefit.   Just extend the expiration time on daily challenges (barring the complete 5 challenges today one) to 72 hours rather than 24.    
---
You still have your daily routine, and others who can only play a few days a week still have a legit shot at completing the map.
---
Well I haven't pitched in yet for any of it, so you've got my vote lol
---
Nope, wasn't you at all!
---
This is just an extension of the UI issues as a whole.  It needs a LOT of qol updates if not a complete overhaul.
---
Apathy happens.
---
Depends on how you play it.  When I first started it was extremely long distance using the scope and manual shooting everything. Once the kids started to play we were having alot of loot sharing issues from the long distance shots so I switched to using vats. Vats has more of a medium range as I have yet to figure out if or how to use with a scope(and scopes increase ap cost so i don't use them in main weapon). 
---
Look up lady deaths sniper build for a build to use. I did not like the critical because I always forget to hit the button ,so changed a few cards in luck. If you use the build by the time you hit 50 you will know what you like or don't like and can change things accordingly. Think I was finished with current build by lvl 70. Also research bloody and junkies builds they are the most popular and hold alot of good information.
---
If you like the scopes I would recommend not using long scopes as it narrows the view to much and short and medium are more then adequate to see maximum range of the weapons. Alt holds breath to steady shot and space bar in vats will cause a critical when the crit bar is full. Wish I figured those out sooner than I did.
---
Lever action is my goto for all of the small stuff as it one shots most anything. For the ones it can't kill in 2 or 3 shots I use a handmade. I would use or try a fixer but have not found one to fit my build yet. Until you can get those the hunting rifle(used one well into my 40s) is a very good weapon as well.
---
Amen
---
Nope. I don‚Äôt see one.
---
It's because of teams. If someone is in a team of 4 and join the event, he counts as 4. He takes 3 more spaces for his team. It's not first come first serve. So if two people in separate teams join at the same time, that's 8 and you go to the next dungeon.
---
As long as the final wave if prime cuts starts spawning
---
Well no, i am just going with the themeing of the fallout universe, if you go to:
---
[https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Cyborg\_(organism)](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Cyborg_(organism))
---
You can see the super mutant has a cyborg eye. Also there is a cyborg eye and parts on vault dweller guy in the perk.
---
[https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Cyborg\_(perk)](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Cyborg_(perk))
---
Meaning bethesda/original devs themselves always planned to have some kind of roleplay option as a cyborg character.
---
 The big MT stuff i get however there could easily be wacky science explanation about why they couldn't get it to work, such as a lack of healing factor(mutation) to stop the necrosis of the skin.
---
It could make a cool questline, in a similar vein of what automatron did for fallout 4's robots.
---
That‚Äôs odd
---
Listen, you might be a non feral Glowing One, but observe a few Uranium Fevers and you'll change your mind.
---
Ok. For starters, Radiation Rumble is also marked as ‚ÄúVery Hard‚Äù, and even as a level 28 2H melee that event is a joke. Why? Because if you know what you‚Äôre doing, at level 60-65, you can confidently say you have a fully optimised build for your particular weapon/armor set. My build was finished at level 57.
---
Your job is to kill wendigo spawns and revive people.
---
You won't do any worthwhile dps to Earle as a non-auto.
---
I have done it onve i had an army of wendigos after me
---
Damn, I feel like if Beth is custom making Legendaries, the least they can do is make sure they have at least decent abilities
---
It was Epic for me. I can get on with my life now. It also left me questioning whether or not I'll come back for the next one.
---
Mine was for killing that runaway Raider and I got it maybe half an hour ago.
---
Because it's doable, for one. 4 guns assumes they know what they are doing. Your OP points out exactly why it's not hard. They aren't always together or communicating. I've ran solo and won solo in NW. it's really not that hard. Moreover, it's fallout. The apocalypse wasteland and you want it to be fair? Come on now.
---
Gotta love the mute options the game offers. Ain't never hear anyone bitching about anything. Problem solved.
---
You want all the armor pen you can get.
---
Earle has a flat 80% damage reduction *before* your damage is reduced by his 400 DR/ER.
---
Actually...
---
*tries to think of a reasonable argument*
---
No. I got nothing, except it being a fictional and alternate timeline.
---
Me too buddy, me too.
---
I would assume its because its a stolen movie prop or stolen from a halloween store post war.
---
I love you all guys
---
think Supermutants with Cybernetics is more plausible since they could probably take the pain and run less of a risk of catching a disease that could cause the skin necrosis, however tbf he had access to the Master who probably gave them to him after he mutated. As for the  perk, I believe it was more of a gimmick referencing the Terminator rather than actually insinuating that the player is half cyborg, otherwise that would mean Nuclear Anomaly makes the player half walking bomb.
---
You CAUGHT the Tater
---
I guess that makes me evil that I have "remove rads" card when I revive people.....
---
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Still no excuse to be so rude
---
That‚Äôs poison!
---
&gt; 150-200 stims
---
Those are rookie numbers, gotta up those numbers.
---
I've got like 700 or so on me.
---
The fact that I have two helmets and still no meat pile hurts lol and 18 percent on plushies?? Then how come I got 7 harpoon guns?! Lol
---
Where did the stats come from, btw?
---
Incoming
---
Well guess you won't piss me off
---
This made me LOL. "Stay. The. Fuck. At. Home." üíÄ
---
Seriously they were scary in new vegas? By the time I got near them I was one-shotting them with the Varmint rifle with suppressor, on the hard difficulty, you really had a weird build if you had a hard time with them(or went close to them too early).
---
Fairly speaking I didn't play the first games yet, but I doubt that with a good character and the right equipment the Deathclaws would be any different, imho of course.
---
Except the part where you use a nuke to open the place lol but I agree with you.  Nuking the Queen has a lot more build up and anticipation, this is just a casual nuke.  
---
Maggie shouldn't give the quest unless you've launched a nuke before
---
His dailies should be on the same cooldown as your other allies, if you did a daily for any other ally in the last 20 hours or something then you probably just need to wait.
---
Same
---
What is this PVP you speak of? I've been playing for about 6 weeks now and the only pvp I've seen is when I accidentally took over someones workshop when I was level 15 and was promptly obliterated.
---
I can‚Äôt find the link anymore but there was an earlier post with the drop rate spreadsheet going around. I only took a screenshot of the spreadsheet and unfortunately my screenshot didn‚Äôt have a link on it.
---
Dude why are you getting so heated about a post about mole miners? Chill tf out
---
The last 2 ACP events I went through were carried by lowbies with magic weapons.
---
  
---
Both events lasted 30 seconds. I'm actually thankful for those lowbies in the event lol.
---
Mole miners deserved better
---
Yeah. Had that tonight too. Mid match, DC. Start of another match, DC. Both times, server not responding
---
30k for Caps.   
---
5k for Gold Bullion.  
---
1k For Scrip.   
---
Treasury notes don't have a cap, but you can only hand in 20 a day, I currently have over 4500 of them in my inventory.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre attitude isn‚Äôt going to change anything ü§£
---
This is one of the things I like about the game. I can use the perks and item effects to fit my style. The next person can do the same and play a sniper completely different then the way i choose.
---
I personally choose to play a glass cannon. Using a bloody build and all of the synergies to maximize damage. Using sneak mechanics to overcome the fact that I die if something looks at me for half a second.
---
On the flip side my son uses a junkies build with full health and stealth. Can take a few hits but does a little less damage. He still one shots the smaller enemies. The bigger stuff he does a noticable amount less but also dies alot less.
---
I don't know, I think at least they should put a warning like "your level doesn't fill the minimum recommended for this event, you're sure you want to join?"
---
But don't allow them to play it is kind of discrimination, and I know how you feel, just got my first fail (out of 4 runs) on this event because out of 7 players there was a level 14, a 34 and a 27, the rest above level 100, but also there was this bloodied level 250 who died a lot, like more than 10 times and I only died once (used like 35 stims). We failed for like 10% left of Earl's health but only three of us were doing the job. :(
---
Most people above 50 are mutated.    
---
Marsupial was the first and IMO, is essential to any build.    
---
I also have Bird Bones and Herbivore. Class Freak R3 makes the negative effects quite low. I think my INT and INT is 5 with everything else at least a 9+.    
---
Some people say all are good as long as you have those two mutations maxed and always equipped but IMO, they aren't.    
---
Speed Demon will require you to carry and have a lot of food on you. There is a legendary effect which "Reduces Food and Drink Weight by 20%" which saves you 3 Perk points in Luck I think. There is also a Grocery backpack mod which does the same but it doesn't stack.
---
It's kind of the same principle as how when a bug benefits players  Bethesda clears it up immediately but  when it hinders players it might last 2 years
---
Yeah I have an Auto Handmade that likes to reload with 10 rounds left in the 25 round mag. Now I just anticipate it.
---
Glowing ones can already shoot atomic explosions out of their body. So yes Nuclear Anomaly could make sense.
---
We are talking about a  sci-fi world that makes sci-fi references so it constantly breaks its own rules to make references and ideas work to fit the aesthetics of older movies/concepts/ideas.
---
Terminator type characters(synths/kellogg who had cybernetic enhancements) are not too far off theme for the universe
---
In the end they could come up with any explanation for it working since scientists at Big MT was never exposed to the types of mutations W. virginia had with the unique circumstances beloging to it such as the geck running wild in the eastern part of the map with the stranglar hearts, there could be certain elements they lacked for it to work.
---
Yeah trying to reverse 20 or 30 years of radiation with your attitude is hard
---
Good bloody question

You caught the tato.

Why in the world would you only carry that few stimpacks?

Bring Poison resist and Fireproof 3 if you don't want to take damage.

Well exleast I have one

Good I‚Äôm a girl so that works out well for me üëçüèªü§£

yes, exactly. I was playing on barrel when everything started disappearing, and Grahm started slowly moving away from the now empty area to do his business with Chally.
---
Sad.

No problem! Best best might be to make a fresh post requesting a link to the spreadsheet. I‚Äôm sure someone‚Äôs got it saved.

Well shit i tried

Are you still on? It‚Äôs not giving me the option to join you and you aren‚Äôt showing up on my friends list

Relative new player here from ps4

The last 5 trys i started encrypted i had to w8 several minutes but one after another came in and i started the part with the pylons and finished the event. fyi i ended up buying the fixxer plans for 8k caps tho :(

 but i would go there 10/10 to help that dude spending all his caps for this event cuz why not? Why do u play this game if u dont want to do some events.

Sooo...you are a minority compared to most low levels that join.
---
I did another run just now with only two people. It was much better. Actually took him down. The lag session someone had the a Tesla and was lighting the cave up. Plus it was a full house.
---
You can't blame them for joining. I say that generically as I know you are not :)
---
Probably every other event in the game is fine for under-levelled players either because its not that hard to kill the targets, or there are no player limits. No reason for an under-levelled player to expect something different with this one.
---
Bethesda: "due to our support tool limitations: GET FUCKED SUCKA!"
---
And why, God why, does the gold vendor's slider go all the way up to 626?
---
That would look super funny on my low level character that runs around naked and beat stuff with his fist.
---
My main is 430

Same for me. No quest today. On PC.

That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. One of my fav weapon to use it the ult gat laser haha
---
For the most part mutations are based around mechanics and not actual story. They have been modified to make them more fun to use.
---
The glowing ones don‚Äôt explode, they release radiation that isn‚Äôt from an explosion and will instead irradiate the player, not blow them to pieces. It even revives nearby ghouls. The player literally explodes with an explosion noise.

You do know that the announcement at the beginning g of the game had the correct end date?

Well there's another fast travel bug, the only one i've personally encountered.

Me: "oh hey, it's time to go to the ammusement park, I'll just fast travel there."

*Loads into Nuke Zone all the way across the map no where near where you clicked*

---
What is a treasure hunter event?
---
Scorched earth is a better event than ACP. The relative ease of it for the flux alone beats the annoying hassle of dealing with random hordes of wendigo spawn that you can barely see due to lighting. Not to mention the high probably of accidentally dying after Earle dies due to random fire and poison pits. I know the event is supposed to be difficult and I enjoy that part of it but between the long wait time and the 8 player cap...Meh
---
Done the event 3 times now, first two were smooth. Third was an unplayable mess with two people rocking Tesla's.
---
Right?
---
I always show up to radiation rumble even if no one else does. I can almost solo it but it can be tough
---
Nah, he'd just go "oh well looks like it's not making money anymore, let's shut it down and make another game"
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
With the same assets, and game engine....AGAIN.
---
i don't use wallpaper, but it does set itself into the dang wall so once it's placed you can't move it without taking the whole darn wall with it.
---
Completed it twice with no issues. Third time was an unplayable mess with two people rocking Tesla's. Just gave up on the third go around.
---
Earl event giving so much screws, so i dont think i would pick up any more. Its like 150-250 per event (you dont rly need to run out, loot your wendigos, loot stash at the exit not worth it, some crap ore and shit)
---
Take it and run the second it completes.
---
Nobody is staking out workshops waiting for you to take them, so there's no risk.
---
If you take the workshop and linger around like an idiot, you will be killed like an idiot.
---
Helvetia, woodshed behind the restaurant. Logging site marker next to sons of Dane. Never want for wood again my friends.
---
I mean, they are, but whatever.
---
I do have to see in that a really well planned out level 60 is still better than a Lvl 38. Even though you may have perk cards, it‚Äôs hard to contribute with weapons below level 45
---
Vats is disabled. Try aiming for once.
---
Same for my strangler heart. Least I can use most nw skins
---
the mine is Gauly Mine in the forest area, which levels 1-10, endgame is cranberry bog and the mire areas.
---
wait misread that nvm. I am used to seeing people confused on where to go for the wayward quest that when I see someone talking about finding someone in a mine, that's what I think of
---
Why doesn‚Äôt anyone do the event for the enjoyment? I‚Äôve been having a blast doing a new endgame event even though I already have rewards
---
But yeah the loot pool should be bigger, something like the ultracite calibrated shocks for grind for 
---
Also repair kits! Why is this not a thing??
---
It‚Äôs so sad üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I‚Äôm being dramatic but I love that darn skin! And all my guns have a gold skin to match! It‚Äôs the ocd
---
Considering a magic weapon finishes this event in 30 seconds for 8 notes, probably do it every time.
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
Heyyyy, West Coast is the Best Coast!
---
Do whatever makes you happy and enjoy the game dude ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèª
---
I got them both including these jumpsuits a few weeks ago at the "one violent night" event.
---
I always do Project Paradise, Radiation Rumble, and Free Range even if solo.
---
So far I've jumped in every ACP and SBQ that I come across, but I've never ever seen Riding Shotgun. Everytime I show up nothing happens and can't start the event.
---
I don‚Äôt want to grind like that again.
---
You lose one of yours
---
Absolutely but as long as people pay...
---
Raider punk has no story quest just a daily one which has a cool down. Only Sophia Astronaut and Beckett ex blood eagle have story which you have to complete before they can give you the daily quest which can give you a legendary item depending on the quest given the one that gives weapon case as target of.
---
Reminds me of the bug where, if I'm mashing Sell-Confirm-Sell-Confirm, to trade my list of bulked items too fast, the game will randomly sell a Aid item while I'm still in the Junk menu...
---
I always play games for fun... they're games not life. But I do plan though lol
---
Use them like Dogmeat in Fallout 4..the spawn go after them and it's easier to pick them off for those sweet sweet screws ‚úåÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôd play them before you say that seeing as 1 and 2 are very different games gameplay wise. Hard to judge how hard a mob is on based on a game designed with completely different mechanics. One and two also were in general harder games than bethesda games that get too easy once you are leveled highly (even Vegas was prone to this but was better about it). 1 and 2 were better about not making you feel overpowered just cause you were higher leveled (long as you were in the appropriate area for your level). 
---
And I admit my builds aren‚Äôt power builds.I build for how I play and what I find fun, not on how optimized it is. Besides, one of my complaints about bethesda games is they get too easy when you get higher leveled so I wouldn‚Äôt even bother trying to make a power build, I don‚Äôt want to feel overpowered. Bethesda games are more fun when you are low level and everything can kill you and you have to come up with strategies on how to get around them or give yourself an advantage. My favorite time in 3 was when every bullet counted and I couldn‚Äôt even buy enough bullets so I really had to make the most use of each. 
---
Don‚Äôt remember what level I was when I first met one though. I just know a headshot didn‚Äôt kill it and honestly I don‚Äôt remember ever having a headshot one shot them in Vegas.
---
That sounds terrible
---
If you buy 1 month, do you keep the scrap box?
---
 I'm also looking to buy just 1 month.
---
i had that outlook at first but then i see like other posts or videos about like only certain builds being viable, anxiety is fun
---
One problem is they're so complicated. Multiple steps or needing to use a shepherd's crook, just weird stuff. A great, crazy battle would be great, something with super mutants and two behemoths and like a couple artillery pieces or something. Just a fun fight.
---
Oh shit, I'm getting close in caps. I didn't know.
---
I had a 3-star corpse literally blink out of existence earlier when I got ten feet from it. Made a beeline for it when it dropped so I wouldn't lose it, and yet.
---
Camera didn't help. Don't think a perk would, either.
---
That title is so damned stupid i don't even know what to say.. Have you tried removing items from your camp maybe? The budget limit is there for a very good reason.
---
No problem hope you get all the good drops
---
Yeah, i gotta agree with this one, so many cool items to display and whatnot, but my budget is at the limit with pretty much how i want things, if i wanna add something i have to delete an item. I have no Turrets, Crops or anything that takes up an insane amount of budget. I wish the items showed how much budget percentage it took, instead of the bar we currently have. Maybe i do have something that is taking a lot of budget and i just don't know it.
---
I understand, chronic anxiety here, but it doesn‚Äôt matter what other people think or how other people choose to play, just do what makes you happy, it is only a game after all! Besides, a lot of people hate bloodied builds and bitch about them constantly so that‚Äôs a flip side for the anxiety
---
Yeah placed some rugs down under the turrets.
---
PC sadly :(
---
Yes, I enjoy the event but I can‚Äôt see anything
---
More a band aid, than a fix, but your teammates can teleport to you inside the cave, using social menu, if you have some spots, so you will be together. Completed 2 events in a row that way, first with event teleport (players melted Earl pretty quick), then i joined my teammates via social menu (they were still fighting Earl)
---
A successful completion of this event will eat about 6k 5mm ammo for me with a vampire‚Äôs minigun
---
I think you *might* be pleasantly surprised with interior camps. Depends how it's handled. When you think about why items in display cases/magazine racks/bobblehead stands have a budget, then removing camps from the open world and making them interior locations is the logical course of action. And like all things logical, it took Bethesda years to arrive at the conclusion..
---
Camp budget is due to resource drain and server stability under load because all assets are loaded as part of an area. Remove assets from the area and making them load on-demand and free from the heavy load of the open world, and you will be free to drastically increase the budget before you would reach the server strain that you were getting before with exterior camps.
---
But... assuming it'll be done right and this golden opportunity will be used correctly is a mistake I have learned not to make with Bethesda.
---
I'm a tank and don't need them other than Encryptid which is a rare event these days and reviving others, which with most people dying immediately isn't worth the 1Ib weight a piece.
---
Out of curiosity, was he passive? 
---
I think I ran into one as well a few weeks ago and he would not stop chasing me lol. I was so much lower leveled at the time and didn‚Äôt stand a chance. Cool encounter tho.
---
Holy crap caps are that low! I'm lvl 62 and have almost 27k that's ridiculous. Kinda sad
---
Not just events. All savage divide events, quests, dailies etc etc.
---
What i was trying to say is that there wackier things happening in the fallout universe. Why would this idea of game mechanics not work based on your own explanation of mutations being about gameplay, couldn't cyberborg parts be similar?
---
It doesn't need to be held back by the lore, they can create new lore. The whole point of nuclear winter is all the progress and stuff in W. virginia gets burnt to a crisp anyways.(kinda hate everything we do is for nothing but i get why they did it)
---
Also the ghoul explosions show that there can be similar factors taking place for  these crazy types of mutations to be possible. Such as a ghoul turning into a tree, or fire breathing ants.
---
Mutations are Pandora's Box in the fallout universe, anything is possible. I just personally would create a cool side quest giving it's own faction thing rather than making it a part of muta-storms. Be more interesting..maybe create a evil scientist cult that is sorta the opposite of followers of the apocalypse?
---
What's bad in this? You can farm and kill Earl no prob
---
Yes but after the month end you only can take scrap from it.
---
Not just events. All activities have the same chance. Quests, dailies, etc..
---
thats true, thanks for the advice.. think i might just finally do what i enjoy(except bows right now.. rip)

The only one out of these i always do is Free Range, even if the Cows Die by the end, the Sheepsquash fight its fun on its on even if the event fails. A Colossal Problem will definitely be one that i will not start my self and or join it, i just don't see the fun in such a difficult fight. Radiation Rumble is actually pretty darn cool, but every time it pops up i go to it and wait for a few minutes and 6 out of 10 times nobody shows up, but when people do show up, is such a fun event. Encrypted is terrible. Project Paradise is nearly impossible without a good team and i haven't tried Riding Shotgun yet.
---
I'd like having super duper activate while crafting legendaries to trigger an automatic 3 star.
---
a lot of people complaining about bloodied being op are misguided and don't really know how it works. some dude told me that unyielding paired with serendipity makes you invincible, for example. but truth is that there are several viable builds.
---
having said that, pistols are probably the weakest weapon class in the game, even with the addition of the gauss one. an auto 10mm is probably still your best option. thankfully they're getting armor penetration in the future.
---
don't let that dissuade you from playing a gunslinger, though. Fo76 is hardly a full fledged mmo. most people play it in a singleplayer, coop fashion. just keep in mind you won't be able to reliably solo bosses in general, specially once the nerf hits.

My favorite quote from him- ‚ÄúSome human‚Äôs no eat meat. Only eat leafy greens. Graham thinks this strange, but this okay. They just like Chally, and Graham love Chally! Graham love strange human too!‚Äù
---
OH MY GOD, I thought I had the worst luck. Ive been looking for a non light left leg for my metal set for literally 5 months. What in the actual fuck
---
&gt;I really don't know why won't you fix the basics first before spending time on stuff like nerfs and such
---
I don't know about Bethesda specifically but it may be different people with different skillsets doing these things.
---
Bug-fixing game mechanics isn't the same as adjusting parameters related to mechanics.
---
What is the recommended level for Coloassal Problem? I‚Äôm level 52 but I feel that‚Äôs too much of a burden for the other high level players who do the event.
---
Are you on pc?
---
yeah thats all fair enough, i didnt consider doing the bosses solo because i kind of like the interaction of groups so im hoping itll be okay.. or ill hold onto my bow dream
---
This is some Resident evil 7 shit.
---
Interesting. I've been playing since Beta. Just finished the Legendary Run this weekend. I feel burnt out. Logged on today to cash in some Scrip and couldn't fast travel the first 5 tries. After 5 minutes in the game I logged out. I'll probably come back eventually, but the thrill is gone.
---
Him do good Snu Snu...
---
Ehhhhhhhhh.
---
Harold and the fire ants have explanations. Harold was exposed to some FEV prior to becoming a ghoul, which stopped him from turning into a super mutant. The fire ants in 3 were genetically modified by a scientist trying to revert them back to being small. The ones in NV probably underwent the same the the Fire Gecko went, which was ‚Äúconstant exposure to sulfur‚Äù. They all had explanations.
---
The perks are, well, just perks. They are bonuses that give you an advantage that don‚Äôt really have an explanation. Ones that do have them are usually companion perks and perks you can get from certain quests.
---
Some time it bugs out. It happened to me once and the next day / reset I got both of them. It is rare hopefully you at least get one.
---
For such a refined intellectual reading a stupid title, you could have probably puzzled out a lot of people are maxed out on budget and don't have the intention of lighting half their camp on fire every time a new Tuesday update is out
---
This is hilarous! I made a post obviously complaining about the lack of polish on the map and that sometimes you can't even click on the event to join it
---
And i got downvoted to hell for dare suggesting bethesda improve their game.
---
And now someone makes a UI for pretty much exactly what I had a problem with
---
Hundreds of upvotes
---
Reddit sure is a great website.
---
This is what I do.  You get event rewards when they complete! You can not get the boss loot and when you think about how this game works, does that really even matter?
---
Been trying this every day for a month. Can‚Äôt get it to work. So frustrating!
---
*spits meat smoothie out* what a second meat week!
---
it should be ok, then. for everyday use, a suppressed gauss pistol is more than capable of reliably dispatching enemies. specially if you make use of sneak criticals.
---
just keep in mind they don't trigger if your target is in combat with anything else, including players. so that will hurt your damage output in events. also don't forget to invest in sneak and escape artist, just a CSS isn't enough.
---
&gt;or ill hold onto my bow dream
---
correction: pistols are probably the second weakest weapon class in the game.
---
Nice
---
Mine is about as amazing as yours, after a good battle I killed Earle with another guy and just when I looked down at the corpse and tried to loot it, the cave collapsed on me as i was standing right under the shaft. Respawned outside and no way to loot üòÇ
---
They did mention that camp restrictions will be being lessened soon (TM). Not just more budget but also what you can do with it. So hopefully that‚Äôll help.
---
What's your point? How does that stop them from creating new lore/factions/enemies?
---
My advice, find a group of players who just enjoy playing the game. Ignore the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù players that make games like this a job, rather than entertainment.
---
The most fun I‚Äôve had playing this was last night, getting into a Colossal Problem group with players who could‚Äôve cared less about what builds everyone else was running and just cared about having fun. 
---
Everyone made sure that each person had the opportunity to tag Earle and made sure to signal the group that they were popping lunchboxes.
---
Bottom line, enjoy the game for your own sake. Don‚Äôt play in a way that you don‚Äôt enjoy, simply because someone else takes it too serious. For every ‚Äúmeta‚Äù jackass, there are 10 like me who want everyone to have fun, regardless if it takes an extra minute or two to kill the Queen or Earle.
---
My point is that the perks don‚Äôt need lore. Why limit them to lore when you can just call them mechanics, which by default means they can add whacky stuff without being limited to lore. Who gives a crap if mutants blow up into a bloody confetti mess? It‚Äôs a mechanic, no explanation needed!
---
A pts guy said earlier that it‚Äôs coming out sometime after patch 22
---
Magic weapon got nerfed in PTS as they say, if true there won‚Äôt be free meals any more. Might as well farm the shit out of Earle before the mass nerf.
---
Was the silver grill in the atom shop?
---
Ty
---
Lighten up Francis. It's a game &amp; you're NOT a virtual cop. 
---
Do what you can newbs. Either way, xp will be had.
---
Getting a shit ton of ammo is not hard but yeah those people do exist
---
Actually plenty of people show up at those events. The only exception is Paradise for some reason, no idea why.
---
thats my ideal kind of group honestly, thats what steered me away fro mgames like wow, was the min max try hard people. That group u found sounds awesome
---
Get this with my automatic Tesla rifle - which only has a capacity of 15, and needs to jam to reload at 10. Thus, unusable. How on earth can stuff like this be unsolvable? Do you ever think that they‚Äôre utterly screwing with us in a grand piece of performance art to see how much we believe are truly organic programming errors? They know about these issues, refuse to fix them, and introduce comically worse bugs patch after patch. There‚Äôs much more logical evidence that this game is purposefully broken in a lab experiment of gamers tolerance
---
I get your point and was in the same place. What if I'm not doing enough damage? What if my armor isn't the greatest in the game? And honestly it hurt my overall enjoyment of the game. Now I have high level stuff and I just play to my style, I always get rewards from SBQ and Earle and the game is actually enjoyable. Plus let's be honest, there's always going to be a hacker/duper out there who has nothing but God rolls so it's sisyphus and the Boulder, that or copy piece by piece someone's loadout from the internet and at that point why even play an rpg
---
Now that‚Äôs a good question
---
Sounds like some butthurt whining.
---
Why?
---
I believe its 70, but if you can hold your own then no worries.
---
I haven't seen any sales on 1st since it released. If by any chance you play on console and you have Cash App. Cash App has a discount of 10% for any purchases made on PSN or Xbox. I pay $12.66 for my 1st subscription every month instead of $14.06.
---
Tried, but they died too fast so the spawns came looking for the rest of us.
---
They look weird but I don‚Äôt think they look like that, not on Xbox at least
---
True. With where I am at in the game, boss loot doesn't matter anymore.
---
Cause I *really* need another ultracite PA mod plan. /s
---
Big F
---
Just change your location to 3rd world country or Argentina, vpn up and buy it for dirt cheap.
---
Thank me later
---
I usually go all on rifles+sneak build in all Fallout games post-2 of course, and the damage amount is tremendous with these builds.
---
I know that fallout 1 and 2 are turn based and of course these will be harder  because the player's(not character's) skills won't count as much as they do in the other games after 3, of course Fallout 3 and all games after are fairly easy, but let's not forget any rpg is meant to be played while reading through abilities description and trying to figure the most effective skill/perk combination, and when you've done it right any game will be easy for you, but yet again it's my opinion, and I've been playing mostly action games, so I might be wrong.
---
I assume they'll leave exterior camps untouched and add vault/bunker doors that lead to the instanced section. Which raises the question of leading into what? A blank slate like those underground camps? A selection of predetermined caves and caverns? Prebuilt shelters that you just customize a bit?
---
Any chance of getting your perk/armor build?
---
Exactly! Mutations are pandora's box! I just would personally like to see some factions/lore around cyborgs or something.
---
I think it would be pretty sweet if done right and would add new effects to creatures in the world that mutations can stack on top of. Cyborg type creatures can be their own faction and attack the same enemies like other deathclaws or raiders in their own faction since borgs are loyal to evil scientists and are being controlled.
---
So basically these creatures become their own type, that can also have random mutations separately in storms.
---
Probably Halloween
---
On PC if you aim your camera at something, it'll tell you what's in view in the upper right corner. It would surprise me but not surprise me at the same time to learn that's not the case on console.
---
I forgot it ended today... :/
---
I didn't get three of the plans...so...yeah not happy.
---
Fingers crossed!
---
Bought mine from Grahm earlier today
---
Legendary chicken &gt;&gt; Legendary chick
---
You read my mind i was telling my brother this it would be so cool
---
I had a lvl 9 join us tonight like seriously, why did they think it was a good idea?
---
Ah okay, thanks for the clarification. Never played on PC before.
---
Lmao damn
---
After posting this I went to a private server and analyzed the blood first and of course it worked!
---
Maybe something like what two others mentioned above. A glow or highlight on them
---
Mega F, I ran that shit like six times today and my Playstation went brrrrr at the wrong time
---
One wasteland is coming out, or I think thats what it is called, that will make most players more hesitant to fight any cryptids or big enemies
---
Can be done on console too.
---
My plasma caster is bloodied and uses ultracite. It one shots highest level ghoul, super mutant and scorched. Two shots yao guai's and 52 gutsy's. Its my best weapon for standard mobs. The only thing its not good against is bosses or any large cryptid with a boat ton of health.
---
I have a prime gatling gun and it sucks compared to the caster. Plus the GG uses more ap per shot then the caster too.
---
I could invite you tomorrow, I usually run like 6 a day solo
---
I would disagree on that one, I think people will not actively launch nukes for it, but the exp you can gain is just too good. I know that in hitting it 3 times on the same server I leveled up a level +300 character twice. On top of that the cursed weapons are a wonderful source of script, with the 90% reduced weight you can easily store them or carry them to trade in for 40 script.  
---
People do not do the other events as much because there is a protect portion of the event, and if you do not run a build for healing NPC's you can lose the entire thing over bad luck. I find that people tend to not bother when they do not feel there is a chance of the event succeeding. Especially with Project Paradise and Free Range. Radiation Rumble has the multiple parts and if you do not have at least 3 people to gather ore you cannot get the best rewards.  Riding Shotgun is not on a timer and a lot of people do not want to pay the caps to go check if they can run the event, or even know that it is not an event that starts at random. Encrypted is an event I know I do not go to unless I see more than 4 other people in attendance.   
---
I know that public teams have helped a lot with getting a good team that will tackle the harder events. I have had several nights where we would run from event to event, hitting every one you listed and we would have easily half the server at them. If things look active people will come because they believe you will win. Sometimes all it takes is a level 350 sitting in Project Paradise for people to give it a chance and join the fight.
---
nah bethesda might screw it up and probably make you drop a weapon from your stash or your vending machine
---
Yeah sure! Just invite me when you get started! gt: "Harvey ARX"
---
It‚Äôs too bad the institute didn‚Äôt dabble in Cybernetics too much. Maybe some other state that had a university that dibbled in Cybernetics pre-war would form a more Institute like group that maintained a Wasteland touch to them. Medically enhancing themselves with cybernetics since, you know, they specialized in that. There could be crude enhancements (forearm missing but surgically replaced with a plate that can equip melee weapons) and the most sophisticated ones with ranged weapons (mostly laser based) attaches to their stub.
---
Yeah next actual event is Halloween with the brotherhood landing right before it.
---
Make sure you are wearing your Excavator power armor while farming ore to increase the amount you pick up.
---
I believe its x4 while wearing it
---
Woopsie looks like it doesn't effect Ultracite.
---
If youre on pc hmu on discord bartbart#1916 i have spare ore
---
If you take a closer investigation to one of the rooms in the enclave-bunker you might think that every creature is a FEV monster ;-)
---
Best part is I dont even know what that means.  I dont have a Bloodied Junkie's Explosion Blah Blah Blah.  I know that people have those, but I've been having a blast just with my perk cards and workbench made weapons.  It's a super fun game when min-maxing isn't important, but I am glad that the min-maxers are having their kind of fun too.
---
Oh.  
---
I completed Beckett's first and then kept her around for the Lover's Embrace buff. Her constant "I can't shake these nightmares." every 20 seconds is really annoying. I'm like "STOP Fing talking about it then."  
---
What about the Settler guy is he the same only for Foundation?
---
Does it?? I could only see the PD bit and figured it was the LAPD one, my bad
---
That weaon case one popped up and I did that before I  put down his radio.
---
Maybe in the Atomic shop for 500 atoms in the future. Lollll. Hopefully would be added as a reward from loot pool from Scorched Earth. Would get me to start farming queens again, or more often lol.
---
How much does it heal? Is it a set amount or direct damage-to-heal conversion?
---
Isn‚Äôt that essentially what the crown icon is for?
---
does the increased chance of exclusive rewards by low-quality pails include the pails which were obtained in the first hunt?
---
I have a couple  of them in my stashbox...
---
Every time I just stayed the drum all of the animals came to it while everyone gunned them down with time to spare. Sometimes (once) they were considerate enough to let me get some shots off at the Legendary.
---
Go to the lumber camp near where the event one violent night starts. There is a ton of wood piles. With good perks u can get more than 200 in one run &lt;3
---
Hey it looks great! I like how looming it is. Are you just south of foundation at the acid and lead spot? I love it there!
---
It‚Äôs weird because sometimes I check and it says -10% 
---
Other times says -60% !!! Very confusing
---
Can't say it's something I want to do. It's a good event don't get me wrong but it should have been an open world event with a full server availability. The 8-man showed they had way too much faith in a public servers ability to coordinate an end game event.
---
Ive done it and unless I get an invite from a lethal team you won't see me wasting my resources on it. 
---
For me it's all economical. If I'm not guaranteed success (Ie reliant on what turns up to the event) I won't invest my resources. The SBQ is almost a given every time and even gives you the kits to patch your gear. 
---
I mean, before you run a silo do you check the median server level and the calibre of public teams? I definitely do.
---
so don't know if you've seen now but they did add it. You have to go back into the board to claim it though
---
Yeah..All the damn time
---
Yess, like an event where either the Raiders or settlers have you go to a death claw nest that has been making a certain area dangerous, so you and some other players go to there nest and have to destroy there nests and the pack of deathclaws thete, kind of like the quarry in new vegas, where there is the alpha and all that
---
If you want I can teach you how to speed run it but it‚Äôll involve doing a simple glitch if you‚Äôre alright with that and if you‚Äôre on PS4
---
I haven‚Äôt tried this event yet but will as I still need to revive some players for the achievement. Only be playing for nearly 1000 hours so should probably get this achievement out of the way.
---
So, youre saying those serve some other purpose besides rage quit inducement?
---
Solution: disable fast travel and bump up the mine outside spawns by 5-10x. Good for flux and good for testing noobs coming through in a hazmat suit. 
---
If they have to walk there they won't get in.
---
Or just drop all your items somehow
---
That and having to wait for the barrel to stop moving completely before being able to use a stimpak. I don't use PA when I decide to mess around with gatling lasers and plasmas. Or miniguns lol
---
Crown is for the boss enemy. The strongest one there. The skull was for enemies you couldnt fight at your current level.
---
I‚Äôm at step 90 hoping to get 91 and 92 done today do nearly read got the suit
---
Yep, that's the address.  Convenient toilet the fissure site is too!  My concern is that the main tower is too empty on the outside.  No detail, but I don't know what to add.
---
Make it drop lunchboxes, 4 flux, and actual viable cursed weapons (a pickaxe seriously?) And it might be worth the 5k bullets and 100 stimpacks i have to use. Maybe.
---
Perhaps I should post my own that sits on an actual in-game dump site. I used the fuck out of those rad barrels.
---
I do seriously hope we get more of the items we had from Fallout 4, but also more world items. Just a rusty barrel would go a long way to adding immersion.
---
Because people are dumb. Its the best one.
---
That, and if vampires. Even better. And if a v e flamer, even "more" better lolll. Can heal your teammates and yourself too
---
r/angryupvote &gt;:(
---
Xbox, sorry
---
Kellog's whole backstory is that he is cyborg, a human mercenary who was enhanced by the institute. That's why it's not too far of a stretch to have that in fallout 76, just create a new faction.
---
They come centuries later.
---
You a Bloodied build?
---
I had mentioned in a different post that I believe there should be a minimum level requirement. Reason being is that the event is meant to be end-game content. This being said, players should at the very least be level 50 because at that point, you'll have maxed out your special and can use max level weapons. I would push further another 10 or so levels because even with perk packs, everyone is more than likely to not have gotten every single perk they wanted for their build. The 10+ levels after level 50 would be for the "fine-tuning" of a character. Sure there may be some players in their 30-40's that deal pretty good damage in comparison to a 100+, but that rather unlikely(if they're not using exploits or hacks). 
---
Many MMO's have level requirements to play certain activities. It's not because of discrimination or anything, but more similarly to a "recommendation". With the minimum requirements, it has players meet the "recommendation" and gives everyone a better chance for success. If players were to constantly fail, everyone would get burnt out and give up on even trying. 
---
You could compare it to a job. You're not going to have several people work who know nothing about the job, are simply interested, or just read up about it. You want people who know what they're doing so they can get things done.
---
and frustration
---
I once saw a picture of a legendary Regs I think, from Vault 79. Wonder what he could have dropped if killed? ü§î
---
Flux, 2 legendaries, 8 treasury notes, massive amount of ammo,exp and junk not to mention epic fight, you're right cant see people going to it anymore soon ;)
---
I feel yah there. I wish there were more things to put on the outside of our houses to help fill in the space a bit
---
The Institute hasn‚Äôt been set up yet, how could they have started the Cybernetics Program a century years before they existed? Plus the Program was trashed in favor of synths iirc.
---
Not sure about budget. I feel the current amount is more than sufficient. I also run a three-tile camp which prides itself on minimalism. 
---
I also appreciate that there are people who love this aspect of our game more than the game itself. If they spend up with atom cosmetics it's only right they be able to build to their hearts content. A large private instance would serve this better than an overland one. 
---
Also, I feel some people try so goddam hard that it's a glowing neon eyesore and I just want your vendor so I can buy three single bullets quickly and leave..... 
---
I don't need to be molested by Sex-Slave-Sofia or Beckett in a dress with Willy Wonkas glasses while navigating a technicolored hell hole.
---
So you have my vote for larger private instances. We all win.
---
Same here lol
---
I've also learned that running silos solo tend to also be easier because it seems that the number of enemies scale.
---
This is clean pls add
---
Exactly
---
Yea sure shoot me your psn I‚Äôll be down to help but I can‚Äôt use my cards I‚Äôll have to let you use yours since I‚Äôm low on them from doing colossal
---
Ok, thanks for your reply.
---
When. When did they say this and where? Because they have to do something about it. There's just too little room to properly decorate and give a unique experience to visitors. I'm trying to design a full fledged museum with exhibits and everything.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt the Children of Atom accumulate no rads? More like wannabe ghouls...
---
If you can bring me along I‚Äôd appreciate it
---
Just no, if you don't wanna do PVP don't take a workshop.
---
Wanamingos are returning? It makes no sense for them to be named that, since they were named after the mine they were found in. Ones found elsewhere were called aliens. And before anyone tells me that became the name after the events of Fallout 2, I should mention that 76 is set a century and a half before the events of that game.
---
Ranting aside, it does have potential to be an interesting enemy. I'm just worried it'll wind up being another melee based bullet-sponge.
---
Lol, sorry, meant that I could help too
---
I have some cards saved up because I always shoot the cargobot if I hear anything flying around and I haven't started any scorched earth events in a while. I usually also try to wait on opening the crate so my teammates can grab a card too
---
Since he doesn't have nerd rage I'd assume not
---
&gt;And no, they can't loot the boss if they don't deal enough damage to said boss.
---
Even if you do enough damage you can't always loot the boss - especially if he's dematerialised, glitched through the floor or just disintegrated.
---
I don't even worry about it anymore. If I get to loot him great, if not ... meh.
---
I try to keep my health up during that event otherwise I'm going to die way too fast. 
---
The only variation is the Gauss Shotgun vs the Combat Shotgun and I'm just trying to figure out why the numbers are higher for the Combat Shotgun when there's no logical sense behind it.
---
Oh lol yea that‚Äôs fine as well I always shoot them down too if they come by but I usually buy them or trade for them since I‚Äôm to lazy to farm them
---
Um this post encourages more pvp in a controlled way and has nothing to do with your point.  What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
hey I have some greens too! So weird, I must have grabbed them right as the event was ending or something
---
Lol, that's why I was asking. Was gonna say to get that card.
---
What‚Äôs this backpack plan y‚Äôall speak of ?
---
What are the perks on them?
---
What are the perks on the guns and are you firing in VATs?
---
I did loot near a power armor station, but they wasn‚Äôt a frame stood available. 
---
But normally you have to enter into the frame to claim it, none of these happened.
---
Once again, new factions,new lore, new enemies.
---
I feel like more people would do it if Bethesda traded in a few of the treasury notes for improved repair kits.
---
I mean... yeah. That‚Äôs quite literally what they are.
---
Wait... What?
---
It's under floor decor. Think in the same row as the gorilla's
---
Right??? I really want a lil' green bat plushie with some big ol' ears and some cute widdle fangs.
---
Is there any steps I need to take on the Bethesda.net side of things?
---
No, Just change your psn username, Your Bethesda account is unaffected, I changed mine not long ago.
---
Awesome, thanks for the help.
---
On an unrelated note, remember that cool marine armor from Fallout 4 that had that children of atom look to it?
---
They should add that to 76, in the form of an atomic shop skin or plan or whatever. Give the marine armor a cool skin that isn‚Äôt that sad excuse for a ghillie skin.
---
Steel Dawn Fatigues will be worn, even though I'm a Lancer in my RP and the Flyboy outfit fits better, the collectron is something I need, purveyor sale will hopefully get me a decent Bloodied heavy, meat week will give me a use for all the arrows I find.
---
I think they did it so bat momma gets some loving when we run low on kits XD
---
Perks are listed in the build, but...  
---
 
---
Gauss Shotgun   
---
**Executioner's**  
---
\+50% damage when your target is below 40% health.  
---
\+33% VATS hit chance  
---
1 Perception  
---
Combat Shotgun   
---
**Stalker's**  
---
If not in combat, +100% V.A.T.S. accuracy at +50% AP cost.  
---
10% increased damage while aiming  
---
The damage difference is without VATS, while aiming
---
Yeah, those issues are annoying. I have a mobile 1 foundation tower build on almost max budget. Its built to be placed like the 1st tent in 1 second. Ofc sometimes when im trying to replace it on a busy server or next to an event it can happen that it bugs out and i gotta rebuild it from scratch. No problem at all, its blueprinted part by part and is finished again in 5 mins. But equipping the vendors again was always a pain.
---
Regarding problem #1 i most times just go thru my stash and get everything out i want to sell. And THEN i go to the vendor and put it in piece by piece, from my inventory directly. Also im using a tiny little mod that allows me to put in prices with the numpad. Both saves alot of time.
---
The other two problems are a pain in the ass i gotta admit, but i just don't buy anything im not 100% sure what it is. I think items not shown in the vendors still has something to do with the connection to our stash and the "buy from stash" bugs we had months ago.
---
No worries, PSN has a list of games that might be affected &amp; F76 isn‚Äôt one of them, My account is all fine, Glad I could help.
---
Yeah, by adding a whole bunch of unnecessary shit that would be riddled with bugs and never fixed. Guess I could always look forward to the 100's of posts that would pop up on here bitching and complaining how broken it was. üëçüëçüëç
---
Nananananananana thicc batmom!
---
Why? I just created an alt and they have none of these plans.
---
If he dies, he dies.
---
Definitely not going to farm them haha
---
If I ever try, I end up literally sprinting after them halfway across the map because for some apparent reason the cargobot decides to fly off instead or just circle around me as usual
---
&gt;People do not do the other events as much because there is a protect portion of the event, 
---
Exactly.  The babysitting aspect of events like Free Range and project paradise are annoying.  Also, Project Paradise suffers because they took away the ability to activate it manually.  We used to get 12 people or more from our discord and meet at Arktos Pharma and start the event.   Plenty of people working the troughs meant getting level 3 creatures that were easy to protect.   It's an event that requires organization and planning, but Bethesda took away your ability to organize and plan. 
---
But some of the OP's observations are just plain wrong. Encryptid still happens and people still show up for it.  I successfully completed it tonight and got the Impostor Sheepsquatch  helmet for the first time. 
---
And CP is a fantastic screw farming method. I am a Fallout First member and grab every single thing that isn't nailed down on my farming runs.  On a typical day, I have thousands of steel, gears, springs, and aluminum, but have maybe 30 screws.  Since I started farming this event, I have over 300 screws in my scrap box. 
---
And the event is just damn fun. There are plenty of reasons to keep farming this event that just don't apply to the other events he mentioned.
---
I may be irradiated, but I serve no "god", just High Elder Maxson himself. Ad Victoriam.
---
Oh so all new content falls under this category, might as well just stop playing the game if you feel this way.
---
Seems to be brighter than the standard PA headlamp.
---
That mail box ain't gunnu fix itself man
---
Try using your Gauss in VATs and you should notice a huge difference. Your Gauss is magic and the combat isn't but you're getting a 10% damage increase because you were ADS with the combat. Hope that makes sense.
---
Armor perks are also in the build in case I've got some weird armor combination that's causing a glitch somewhere
---
Completely forgot this was still going on
---
With five characters (mules) the limit is 150,000. And you can buy things as a cap sink. Mutations serums, etc. Or ammo sells 1-1 for caps. Caps aren‚Äôt really that  important, high level gear is trade only....
---
They made it so ward is always in his office now
---
&lt;Laughs at your 10mm SMG&gt;
---
Nah, not really. The shit coming out now has been planned and needs constant fixing. But sure, let's get the already incompetent staff to start work on something completely different.
---
I‚Äôm the opposite, I can‚Äôt get rid of them fast enough. 
---
I sell them in my vending machines at less than 50 caps for 100% cores. 
---
Last night yet again I dumped quite a few. 
---
I often get a insult bot saying my prices are too high, I can‚Äôt off load items fast enough as they weigh me down.
---
Are those bots having a laugh.
---
Thanks for the idea, if I run the event and low levels come in, I'll just share a level 3 enforcer and have the low levels cripple everything lol
---
But yeah, I think that low levels should stay away from the event but there's no need for the bullying.
---
Just teammates.

---
Yeah but what damage did you do ? I would think that lvl 382 made up for his deaths in damage.
---
I think you can do more but there's a long cooldown. Don't know how long but I feel that it's probably an hour at the very least.
---
I like this idea, but honestly I wish it would spawn everyone with predetermined items (For example: Handmade, Pistol, 90 Bullets for each Weapon, a set of Armor and a few Aid Items). Otherwise people will just use their Legacy Weapons ans we‚Äôre back to the reason why PvP sucks.
---
Yea I‚Äôm sure nobody wants to wait for a cool down
---
Stop playing the game please. 
---
You clearly don't have any faith in the dev team and you don't have confidence in the future of the game. 
---
So the best advice i can give you is to stop playing.
---
Thank you so much
---
ü§£üòÇü§£ I'm done with you. It's been fun.
---
I used to love healing in WoW, the mechanics that exist in fo76 are just LAME. Would be extremely easy to create a syringer that allows you, in fact only, targets friendlies and allows you to turn a cylinder on the weapon that switches from a stimpack/time release heal/armor boosts/resurrect/aoe heal grenades. 
---
The healing and tanking aspects of this game, can easily be fixed. We just need to think outside of the general or other MMO box.
---
Get yourself a piece of armour that has 15% less limb damage n vats head with shotty. I one shot most things with a vampire ffr combat shotty.
---
I've been sharing a level 2 Team Medic. If they can't damage anything they can at least heal.
---
scrip
---
every single person who plays this game had exactly the same thoughts at a stage.
---
it's a fundamental mechanic to keep us coming back and invested.
---
you will learn to play and live with it.2
---
Please remember the above when you want to post about stash limit. have fun.
---
I have TOO many weapons to scrip. For the one primary character I play z I need about 3-4 other characters at lvl 50 to scrip and roll.
---
To be fair it‚Äôs a waste of stims to revive anybody in this event. They spawn right above the shaft and they don‚Äôt lose their stuff
---
Tbh this is one reason I love Colossal Problem. Scorched Earth and Colossal Problem are both suppose to be End-Game battles that only level 50+ (although let‚Äôs be fair you‚Äôre probably not gonna do well until level 70ish) players are suppose to do. Scorched Earth however is often flooded by Level 10-30 players. This isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing and probably helps people get some better loot and XP, but I like how Colossal Problem is an event that is truly exclusive to high level players. I think a good way to phrase it is that Scorched Earth is a Raid Boss type event while Colossal Problem is a High-Level Dungeon Boss. Raid Bosses classically have a lot of health and are fairly tough, but if you have a lot of people taking it on then you can do it. Meanwhile Colossal Problem being a Dungeon Raid means that a limited amount of high-level players must work together to take down a tough boss with a lot of minions and hazards.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but I think Scorched Earth and Colossal Problem are two very different events that draw from different boss archetypes, with SE being somewhat beginner friendly since they can kinda just hide behind higher level players while CP is try for high level players only
---
Yeah, well, we all know you're *supposed* to read those things, but we also know damn well that nearly everyone doesnt.  It's like an EULA or a cookie popup, after you've seen a few, you stop paying attention.  The game devs above all others should have known this and implemented something further.  As usual, it's Bethesda's fault.
---
I would love it if more low levels run this, means I can run luck of the draw and save on repair kits then
---
Definitely Halloween, just like last year. Mischief Night. So many explosions you'll think it's the 4th of July.
---
I was actually going to suggest this, but then i would get dog piled by all the people who worked hard for their items and want PVP to remain exactly the same, but yeah it would be cool if we had a halo style forge mode for custom workshops where you can place spawns/items/weapons and change around rulesets.
---
one or two deaths you back in the fight almost instantly.
---
die less.
---
nothing wrong with respawn timer.
---
I know it's a mechanic to bring us back over and over, but it's brutal mechanic that just forces a player to discard legendaries or not even play long for that day.
---
What's better, increase the limit/remove it and let players play as much as they want. Or force a player to hold legendaries, get on to sell them and leave after 10 minutes./them dropping those legendaries just to pick up more later to do the same thing. It's a lame mechanic that just cripples the player.
---
[I miss this noise so much already.](https://youtu.be/hqe3MRb3StY)
---
just test yourself on enemies.
---
you will get a sense of whats hard hitting.
---
you can also change your settings to display damage numbers.
---
BUT..AFAIK...Junkies is magic in VATS
---
PlayStation‚Äôs do the Brrrrrr as well? I‚Äôm on Xbox. I know that sound
---
Ding. Rewards are garbage and the quest design shows zero originality or nuance.
---
Despite playing this game for a solid two years I‚Äôm not too sure what a Food Build is. Can anyone elaborate?
---
I barely pvp anymore because it‚Äôs just legacy and Tesla rifle spam so now I just make it so you can‚Äôt activate the workshop so they can‚Äôt take it over even if they wanted too
---
Gonna try this, thanks!
---
Nope, it‚Äôs for the buy/sell 3 items from players
---
Unfortunately this still exists on the PTS and is a nightmare in daily ops.
---
Well, IF dedicated tanking in this game were a thing and IF you didn't want to carry a set of armor for each mob type (or wanted to tank Earle who AFAIK isn't assigned any of those mob types), then Vanguard's plus Stimpak spamming would be a possibility. But really, Sentinel's is still so much better that it makes Vanguard's/Bolstering all but irrelevant.
---
Look up Angry Turtle shotgun builds on YouTube. He can definitely explain far better than I can.
---
Enough I‚Äôm sure as we finished. At FYI, I‚Äôm over 300 as well. 
---
Just pointing out that level doesn‚Äôt always mean anything. Tis all.
---
That explains why moving feels heavy.. I've been eating way too many Fancy Lads Snack Cakes and Sugar Bombs, hell, i still carry over 30 of them on my inventory...
---
They are purchasing 1 round at a time to complete the daily challenge
---
They‚Äôre just doing their daily challenge  of buying  3 items from people‚Äôs vendor unless they‚Äôre doing for kicks and giggles then they‚Äôre trolls
---
*\*rolleyes\**
---
Hahaha #Guilty
---
That's a pretty nice idea too. I forget what level it was but sometimes if a low leveled player jumped into the public team I was on while I was at Whitesprings, I'd pull out my low-leveled explosive shotgun and cripple all of the ghouls. Nice thing is that since ghouls can't recover from cripple and can't attack you when they're downed(there's a weird bug that allows some to rotate and still hit you though), you can cripple them and have a low level player tag everything easily or let them go ahead kill everything on their own.
---
That would be way too OP, I'm on 600 armour so that would be 60% damage resistance. Parlir that with perks like serendipity and dodgy and players using bloodied builds just wouldn't die
---
The other day I did ACP with a bunch of randoms and me and this random dude were running trying to escape the mine. Well out of nowhere a shite ton of Windigos pop out and down this dude next to me. I just kept running cause one swipe from those things will kill me since I‚Äôm a bloodied build, a real ‚ÄúF*ck Billy, Billy‚Äôs dead.‚Äù kinda moment. 
---
Well I got pretty far away and remembered the several times I died trying to escape the mine and how much it sucked... so against my better judgment I went back for him, killed 5 windigos between me and him and revived him. We both made it out the exit with seconds to spare. Sent him a friend request, he was really grateful, and after that we decided to hang out. A few days later we‚Äôve successfully done several ACP events together. (At least over 10.)
---
Now just think, if I had said ‚ÄúF*ck that dude he‚Äôs dead‚Äù and kept on running. I would not have done those ACP events (Because he launched the nuke for most of them.) and more importantly I would not have made a friend. Little kindness goes a long way.
---
Literally just disconnected 4 times in a row after joining a new server each time.
---
Awesome! Would it be worth swapping Adrenaline for Action Boy at that point?
---
Good one
---
Fuck that I'm closing shop, till this stupid shits over maybe permanently.  I can make 1400 caps a day just from farming water.
---
Obvious.
---
I'm surprised that since they are up at night that they don't see the thief that sneeks in each night to nick stuff.
---
Where's our insult bot plushie
---
High Confessor Cromwell lived in peace with the residents of Megaton. Do not judge our faith on the actions of one of our other members.
---
Can we fix the perk frienfly fire it literally shoes a flamer on the card but only the shishkobob works
---
Ok see you tomorrow
---
I would but I don't have the junkie's combat shotgun yet, and they're pretty expensive so I'd like to know before I waste the money.
---
Hahahaha, nah. I'm not gonna laugh about some posts to gain sympathy.
---
Or you know just make it a feature in the game instead of a pay wall
---
Honestly hate when BR games don‚Äôt have solo mode, looking at you Apex, I don‚Äôt want to fight continuous 3v1s, me losing doesn‚Äôt reflect any lack of skill, just whether or not people have friends
---
Breath. Together we'll get through these tough times together.
---
Does that ‚ÄúTM‚Äù mean tomorrow??
---
Play around and see which one fits you. If you're on Xbox, I'll be on whenever it finishes re-downloading, could help a bit more looking at my own layout.
---
Ward use to act like a normal NPC but people bitched that he would take a few minutes to wake up or wander off, so BSG decided to change things so he sits in the room 24/7 so people don‚Äôt have to do anything to find him and interact with him.
---
Thanks I would never guess that ...it very ugly
---
Thank you Bethesda for fixing but not really fixing something. Where did you write inside the game that I need to re-claim the box?
---
I'd rather have an honest shitty society (raiders) than a lying polite one (foundation).
---
Is ultra light in the same category as buttressed?
---
I‚Äôd like guaranteed 3* period.
---
Agreed, I feel sorry for the lower level players who just want to try the event and subsequently get bashed for it but it's really just the truth that they can't handle it. Even high players need to pull a lot of weight, low level damage just cannot cut it
---
Only if you know the plan for it.
---
Also, what makes it "magic?" The VATS hit chance or a combination of the perks on it? I've been trying to figure that out but the only thing concrete I've found is the 15% less limb damage on armor
---
PC, feel free to drop additional suggestions!
---
People are such assholes sometimes in this game. I could care less who joins as I mentioned in another post that people didn‚Äôt like either. 
---
Nonetheless. Did the event earlier with two lower level players within the 8- one level 17 and one 43. Revived them once, but had to revive my level 368 team leader at least 6 times. But yeah...level means everything. üôÑ
---
Saves time. That's about one minute less they'll be helping to hurt Big Earle. If they're not helping I can see your point, but I feel like every second counts in this event depending on the group you get. 
---
I'm going to attempt to solo it and lmfao at how dumb an idea it was later. üòÅ
---
I buy 3 of the cheapest plans for sale, then drop them by the machine so the seller can sell them again..
---
Just for the daily score.. üëçüèº
---
Will do, just can't remember all the cards I have where. Lol.
---
I logged on today and found Grahm attacking my camp again, which told me Meat Week was over since he‚Äôs here trying to burn my camp down instead of standing at the Meat Cook.
---
Just swapped the Cloaking Right Leg for a Vanguard's with the 15% less limb damage and increased AP refresh speed. Let's see how it goes with that, too
---
The Fallout 2 Enclave stated that they were going to use the Jet Stream to use their modified FEV-2 to cleanse all of America and there's the lore that Mariposa got hit by a nuke which arisolized FEV and those two pieces of information suggest all of America got hit with FEV to some point or another, not to mention FEV's roots as a bioweapon and confirmed fact it was being researched in multiple locations across the states, it's a fair conclusion FEV can lore wise be the cause of anything anywhere.
---
Not to mention all the mutation serums are FEV based which means the naturally occurring mutations would have FEV roots and imply all of our charaters have been effected to some degree.
---
I think is not Grahm, is Bethesda those who doesn't understand what a week is XD
---
What were you expecting? Balloons? A parade? A line of protections singing to you? It‚Äôs a board game. 
---
I dunno about you but when I play a board game in real life, when it‚Äôs done it‚Äôs done. Plain and simple. You got your rewards. And now your done. Enjoy the time to relax before next season.
---
I too am on ps4 and can help launch a nuke just hit me up on here
---
Wastelandangel, when I was a young boy at a low level on Fallout 3 I had went to the super duper mart. I went because you could cross the river towards the raiders and mutants would spawn. I would kill them soon after. There is a bus on a road right next to the mart. I had got back on the game and suddenly took damage. I turned around and in my two years of playing the game over and over, I seen the face of the devil. The infamous deathclaw! I scream like a coward and lit it up like there was no tomorrow. I won. Then I died cause I shot up the bus since the deathclaw spawned between me and the bus. I killed it again. In conclusion, you are correct. Those things are great for jumpscares. Also, for any of those who played Fallout 3. Who else tried to avoid the Fallout 3 version of what is basically the lottery winner from New Vegas in Nipton? The kid with the ant problem. I hated him personally.
---
Wasnt it 5 days?  Started Thursday ended tuesday.
---
At this point, I'm confused on how people still ask about this. I mean, this season is almost over too with maybe a week left? On top of that I'm pretty sure the challenge has been one of the daily challenges every day for a while now.
---
Its actually pretty easy solo done it quite a few times now. Similar to queen in that the more players are there the tanker the boss becomes.
---
Save your wood if you're on PC.  I'll be happy to drop some off for you.
---
Few hours ago a friend has shown me a spot where Earle can‚Äôt reach you.
---
It‚Äôs easy to solo the event on a private Server, have done it twice before he showed me the spot, few minutes left and it costs me a lot of ammo, used bobble heads, magazines and chems, but it is possible. I agree that the respawn time is ridiculous but with the right build and armor it‚Äôs nearly impossible to die.
---
Half the replies here already did but yes, why not.
---
Food build is a term invented by PVPers to describe builds that have QoL perks and aren't solely focused on damage optimization.
---
I find gun bashing can't let you fire off some more rounds. I don't mind too much as I run PA and Gat Laser which often only auto-reloads below 5 or 10% charge.
---
What I don't get is why some full plasma cores are 500 and others are 250.
---
Look, they need to raise the scrip limit a bit, not that much, to keep things balanced and people hooked. 250 scrip per day would be fine.  
---
Otherwise another possible solution is to low the scrip income you get from 3 stars pieces; weapons sell for 40 scrips and that's a bit too much if you consider how many leggos you can get in a normal, boring day.  
---
If they lower the price of the 3 stars at something like 25 or 30 scrips, like the armor pieces, it would be ok. Much more things to scrip, less space in the stash/inventory used, everyone happy.  
---
The main point here is that most of the people that do high level grinding find hard to log in the whole day if not when the reset happens, just to free some space and gain a bit of value. And from a population of the game standpoint, that's a bad move.  
---
How much does a 3\* Armor piece sell? 24 scrips? Do the same for weapons. Since scrips are awarded in events and dailies as well, there's no point to keep the price so high.  
---
At least thats how i would fix that. Let's balance out things:  
---
\- level the scrip sell price of the 3\* weapons the same as 3\* armors  
---
\- boost up the daily scrip to 200 (not even 250, to make them happy)  
---
\- profit
---
Is it weird that I saw BBQ and immediately thought Borchbeast Queen?
---
tnt dome 3 / pylon v13 a note on a corpse. It is a non marked quest if I recall.
---
tnt dome 7 is more difficult it required 2 keycards hidden in very specific places if you want to find them search on youtube. The guys who figured this out are geniuses.
---
Tnt dome 2  requires a key from a safe in pleasant valley.  I don‚Äôt recall the how-to.
---
I don‚Äôt know if you played New Vegas but there is a area by a river that has more than 10 deathclaws. When I seen them all coming towards me I ran. Also, for any of those Fo3 players. Who remembers the kid with the ant problem? I found him annoying. There was also a time where the game spawned a deathclaw on me when I was a low level. And I mean out of Megaton ready to start the actual game low level.
---
Like why doesn't it have the interface of the brewing stations?  Dump a load of ammo in one side and wait for it to procure into selected ammo type
---
It is too bad that we are unable to put that poor guy's soul to rest. Instead of a taxidermy stand, maybe we should have gotten a tomb or some other memorial to honor the memory of this tragic figure.
---
2. If you select buy it will come up with the confirmation window.  In this window it states the full name of the item :)
---
I never knew the name of the song- thank you!
---
I don't know it's maybe just luck, but when I go to do Encrypted or Radiation Rumble, theres always people. Although last time doing RR only one athor person showed up before the event launch, who traveled away after a while, but as soon as I started the event alone, within 15 second like 8 other player showed up.
---
Have an up-vote ... this would be perfect.
---
I wonder if Good With Salt will keep my leftover Prime Meats fresh until then. ü§î
---
You probably need to server hop then. Riding shot gun has a one hour cool down that is tied to the server, so someone probably did it just before you tried.
---
8 Treasury Notes, 100/200 caps per average, i wouldn't call it "bad". Yeah as from the exclusives drops you can get pretty much everything in 10 runs, but the rest is worth it, much more the Queen imho.  
---
Also is exciting, needs coordination, keeps my adrenaline rushing all the times.  
---
And what about junk farming? Loads of screws and stuff to get.  
---
Pro tip: once Earl is dead, assuming you killed alot of wendigos, don't rush outside. If you need to farm junk and ammo, just clean the area and be sure to not get killed by debris. Take your time. The only thing worth to rush outside is the small room just before the exit that has some stuff like ammo and meds, but that's about it.  
---
Even if you die, you're still considered in the event, that means no junk lost/drop, you'll just spawn outside with all your stuff plus the rewards of the event. Everyone happy.
---
Bad analogy. You really got the heart to look at a dying dog and be like, "Get fucked you're not worth the money".
---
I saw one of these in a players camp earlier and I was both horrified and delighted at the same time. I must get my hands on one someday. Its sick and awful but holy hell is it well done. Bonus points if its teamed up with the rug lol Whoever the dev was that dreamed it up deserves a beer.
---
I dont trust you, no offense...
---
Ward...I gave you half the gold. You know what, I don't trust you!  Sending me out to fetch an osmosis kit that was supposedly the last one.
---
I would like a T-65 Nukashine too.
---
I wouldn't mind Blackbird as an alternative, but I'm more so just crossing my fingers for a APA mk II (Enclave) skin like Liberty Prime and similar full model skins.
---
How would the Plague Doctor mask work? I wear one with the Silent Shroud outfit and it looks good as a Secret Identity thing...
---
Ah I‚Äôm on Xbox :( I forgot to put that
---
I've only managed to complete the event three times. First time I got the heads, second the plushie, third another plan for heads. üôà
---
How do mules even work because when I think of making another character I'm reminded of the grind it took to even become viable? Game was really slow below lvl 30
---
Shit I love low levels cause when I sprint waist deep in Earles ass they come running like a bat out hell to res my stupid Chad ass
---
Since now it was always smooth for me except of one time i pretty much had a similar experience like you.
---
What caused that lag for me was a player with a tesla, killing off spawns. I started to see little black pixels everywhere at first and it got worse pretty quickly with heavy lag. I think i also encountered this on a few other events like line in the sand or radiation rumble a few times. There, its annoying. But it seems on ACP it can make the event unplayable with so much going on in that cave.
---
Not sure that's right. I didn't make one when I got it months ago BECAUSE it was known to be useless. As in, cosmetic only.
---
please no, I already have way too many of them!
---
I too want T-65 Nukashine.
---
I'd settle for Blackbird, though I'm crossing my fingers for APA Mk II (Enclave) full model skin like the Liberty Prime skin.
---
I've heard that the Hellfire skin works which almost makes me want to grind to Overseer rank 100, if if didn't take so long.
---
You really have no idea what's going on, do you?
---
Definitely. All those people saying "it's a permanent event why you paying good stuff for the helmet!?!?" well, you'll see...
---
The reward is based off damage given at least you can dig one hell of a ditch.  I'm just kidding that sucks tho
---
Omg a Bethesda Employee, Thank you for all your hard work !
---
I did enough damage to the queen level 25-30 to get loot from here as a melee character, as you prob know melee can only do damage when she lands. I remember this because I made a new character for wastlanders and there was a 2x xp weekend, went in level 25 and came out level 30. That being said, I think there should be a level cap. High level events and areas gives you something to work towards. A sense of achievement.
---
I hit 3k steel in stash every couple of days, and bulk it up and sell it, or drop it on the floor until I'm down to 500. I never thought about rail spikes... \*Facepalm\*
---
If the mine is already in a nuke zone, drop one on the fissure starts both ACP and SE... Then you can do ACP, and then join SE...
---
As a player who is happy to heal the targets I get disappointed when I'm the only one that shows up if I don't call out the event on Discord.
---
Hi mate, same builds for this run :)
---
Just go to that one place with those three ir something tents.
---
Whats next? Meat Week, A Second Helping (Sept 22 - 28)
---
Then probably Mischief Night in October and Holiday Scorched at Christmas.
---
Sounds like Treasure Hunter will be back at some point to - maybe November?
---
The weapons could always be sold for caps at a vendor, no? Better than just dropping them, IMO...
---
but he isn't dead tho, just ask .Ward or .Paige on PC

met them both during our assault on Colossal Problem
---
I have one you made at the workbench and in the pip-boy it says Protects against Airborne and Waterborne Diseases. When I hover over it on the armor workbench it says Protects against Airborne diseases.
---
aah...i see you met our good buddy Colonel Gutsy.
---
he is all about that glorious life in the US Army, and kicking asses.
---
Gotta love him.
---
Had a level 358 ask me why I was attacking the brahmin in riding shotgun. I was like 'look at their health'. And then they were just all 'oh'
---
Osmosis kit... Makes me so mad
---
3000 hours!!???? Shit I stoped at 126 hours
---
Sounds decent as a weapon to help a new character level a bit.
---
I like all, but not Grafton Monster Lamp, kinda lazy done.
---
That comb over is where it's at tho
---
I know I had to redeem the stash box from the Atom Store
---
I'm gonna play those numbers
---
3,000+ hours? Cripes, you got your moneys worth!
---
daily caps limit
---
Or shotguns with the sane traits but only when using vats.
---
Plasma my baby
---
Shotgunner, mostly because they seem the most fun.
---
Totally agree. 
---
I think dailies should accumulate if you don't complete them. Maybe just let incomplete ones accumulate over the week, and then remove them when the weeklies reset?
---
That way if you only really get time at the weekend you'll be able to do most of the dailies for the week, as well as the weeklies.
---
Same here. I had power armor and decided I wouldn‚Äôt need to put it on before the fight. I ran and jumped and only then did I realize what I did. I almost landed on a platform but still missed and died as others looked at where I died. I died from fall damage and from embarrassment at that point.
---
I never encountered this bug myself, but nonetheless im furious about my fellow vault dwellers missing out. Its makes me mad. 
---
That said, can you somehow track back your steps? Like, did you do anything unusual playing, or logging in? Or did something act weirdly but you didn't rly think much of it when it happened?
---
There must be some kind of trigger, and i bet BGS knows what it is and just cant fix it without breaking something even larger. Probably the same with the fast travel bug...
---
There was a grill master bundle that had two BBQ grills like the ones on the raider fallout 1st tent. I think that‚Äôs what their asking about.
---
Yeah at 1.2k hours I'm finding myself getting a bit board. But I still love the game, its hard to leave haha
---
Sounds about right.
---
It's so creepy haha. Love that it drools and twitches
---
The mullet üëå
---
Prickett‚Äôs Fort as well! Tons of wood up there, more than Helvetia
---
Automatic combat rifle with 18 shots. Reloads with 4 still in mag. Makes me mad since I died a bit by that.
---
I love the colossal event, and that mad dash at the end really makes it!
---
From what I've seen/heard it has something to do with the game being unable to properly calculate damage and applying a furious like effect where damage done seems to accelerate or 'magically' jump. Shooting the same spot/limb seems to help trigger it, and explosive reduces the minimum firerate for non-shotguns below 200.
---
Reminder: Like with lagacy explosive energy weapons, don't constantly hog kills without letting other players get tags in, and more specifically remember to share legendary enemies with nearby players.
---
If stimpacks had any value id be more inclined to agree with you, but i tend to hold onto about 400 - 500 at any given time
---
*laughs in 7 tenderiser plans*
---
I guess i m the last to know... hahaha
---
The event can be soloed. 
---
If a team of 8 can't finish it it's not the fault of one or two low level...
---
Oh fuck who‚Äôs she aha what‚Äôs her snap I wonder if she shits with that ass
---
Sad thing is that I have enough lead and gunpowder but not steel.
---
I get that. My gripe isn't the difficulty. My gripe is it lags/bugs so bad you die incessantly. It should be challenging *and* fun.
---
Any PC players from Singapore?
---
yes visual bug. It goes down to zero if you keep an eye on it but while reloading a number is shown as if you started reloading on that number.
---
Same weapon but not magazine. 4 bullets left. Gun bashed. I fired the last four.
---
Yeah see this is why you don't have a job in game design.
---
There‚Äôs a very similar one you can buy for 1650 (or thereabout) bullion from the bunker guy who sells the secret service armour plan etc.
---
Why are you using that many resources üò±
---
Welp, i don't rly feel like the rug made from his skin makes for a better tombstone.
---
It's a box full of dashed hopes and unrealized dreams. Deposits only.
---
My full health food melee build is just as OP as my bloodied melee. My food melee was so OP infact I completely stopped using chem buffs and only use food and drink buffs for bos battles like SBQ.
---
I really like that you have put thought into it; maybe 1% of whole F76 player base participates in any meaningful workshop combat.  Though infinite ammo on something like J/B25 Tesla... Ouch.  
---
You know, if only devs boosted workshop defender's HP, Dmg and DR by 200, 300% and upped the rewards for attackers (by which I do not mean 10 Purified Water and 5 missiles), it could have been so much more fun for everyone.
---
um okay?
---
yep. and that is great for ensuring your team gets in. There is always one that still has to repair this, get that.
---
It doesn't though.
---
It only SAYS that it does.
---
That was the glitch: a typo.
---
You can put it on and stand in water and you'll still get a Disease.
---
Got you. Have done it on public servers too but I haven‚Äôt seen any bugs so far. Even after the 3rd time on the same server in a short period of time the event ran smoothly.
---
Yeah I fucked your mother in her fat ass wtf fuck dude you following me or something
---
It‚Äôs a rare drop from the new event A Colossal Problem mate!
---
And it glows and twitches every so often!
---
How can you not know this is about a daily challenge by now? Jeez
---
Collosal problem event
---
I don't even know how many Wendigo Spawn I have killed, or how many times I thrashed Earl with my Furious Gatling. Please participate? Kill me for a rug for all I care.
---
Sound advice
---
Failed miserably with my bloodied commando until I swapped to my Vampire's Handmade
---
That's... not how it works.
---
Thank you!
---
Can the Strangler armor use any Ultracite Paint you've unlocked? I've never checked. And does it keep the vines?
---
1400 caps! Wow, you could buy 1400 bullets with that! I mean... one by one ofc.
---
I also asked for the same a couple of weeks ago.
---
That is a very nice sledgehammer.
---
Build around it.
---
The railway gun as backup at distance and for choo choo fun.
---
If you paid but can't get into a private world you need to open a ticket with Bethesda support. Make sure you have proof of purchase and a week to kill.
---
Yes it uses any paints that work on ultracite armour. If you crafted it before wasetlanders it does not keep the vines. If you crafted it after the vines show threw the paint (am not sure if it's a crafted thing or when you learned the plans have not crafted a second set)
---
I feel that way toward Herd Mentality now that public groups are a thing. I've been using that mutation as soon as I could and people were still debating which if any mutations were good. I also love being an Empath and am not sure why I don't hear about others running it. I never liked the sound of Speed Damon's increased survival needs, but understand why it's in almost everyone else's list. I've heard Egg Head disables the Barbarian perk, but since I'm in PA the extra INT is nice. I think Scaly Skin is also worth it's cost in most build.
---
Also don't forget the perk Strange In Numbers.
---
You gotta trade a lot in order to get into PvP; takes up quite time and effort. That doesn't mean you can't kill serious pvper (players are squishy), but in the end the dedicated gear, skill and build will prevail, as in any MP game. If you're not into it, claim a workshop and get out asap.
---
I think it's already reaching that point on PC from what I've seen.
---
Although the Monongah region is fantastic for Cobalt Flux, unlike the Whitesprings or Cranberry Bog.
---
I've had a lot of crashes on PC.  Not all the time but every 3 hours or so.
---
I've had some hit and miss. I think the Teslas are to blame. There were only 5 of us I believe and there were one or two Tesla users and then it was a wrap. It was like bullet time from Max Payne...
---
It‚Äôs not it is always the same red color
---
3000 hours of fun and you're bitching about no more entertainment ?
---
Go on then, go back through your game library and pick out the games (apart from skyrim) that you've spent even *half* that amount of time on.
---
I dont get it. People buy an online game and expect it to entertain for life?
---
I have this problem many times (on PC). Changing server always helped.
---
It's a daily challenge as part of the legendary run. Literally every day. It will likely continue as a daily challenge in future seasons. Again, practically every day.
---
You might want to smash the shop up, as oppose to temporarily closing.
---
I think I'm a food build. I use butchers bounty to get more meat from my hunts. Then I use superduper to get more steak and ribs (they stack melee damage). And good with salt so they last my play session. Then I wash my steak and rib diner down with whisky, use party boy to triples the effect and professional drinker to manage my alcoholism.
---
Oh I see you have our missing property... 
---
No Ward that's not how it works.  The moment it was stolen was the moment it became their property.  This is the wasteland.  You should know being an ex-raider :/
---
Thru-Hiker is Agility which I use to carry 200+ cans of Dog Food (Good Doggy is great) but I admit I don't need this much Dog Food on me at all times and 100+ Purified Water which I burn in Power Armor.
---
Ha ha ha ha.
---
No. Or we'd all be atom millionaires.
---
YES.
---
Only if he is on the quest will it complete if someone else in team does it. Till he is on the quest he can do 1000 SBQ and still have it upcoming.
---
Cool. I bet the Vines look pretty good with the Atomic Onslaught paint. Or maybe the Outcast paint from NW.
---
It has not. It's only being tested right now.
---
Then re funnel the resources until the game works.
---
have played around with it.
---
Lots of fun....but consider it Hard mode.
---
Can it be done on a friends private server?
---
I'm right at the same 1200 range and am down to finishing the pland and rare outfit collection more or less
---
Easily management fix. Re funnel all/most resources into making a working game before focusing on nerfing/bugged and geris my lagging minor content additions.
---
Not sure why people don‚Äôt understand this.
---
I told her her father changed to a big monster and I carpenter his skin and use it as a door mat.
---
That's the reason I only got 60 caps? Man I thought this would be fallout
---
I thought throwing a doll on the grill. BarBieQ
---
Yeah. 3-4 3* legendaries per day.
---
You can easily get 1 or 2 stars like a trash, then you either go crafting gold recepts, or roll boxes. And you sell back not needed ones, and you pretty much wasted daily limits...
---
That's my fear - the expenditure of ammo &amp; stimpaks outweighs the rewards, particularly once you have all the uniques. I can do a mats run and expend far less ammo for a similar return. Until/unless we all figure out how to do this efficiently (like SBQ) people will eventually stop doing it.
---
Server (PS4) I was on last night (for 3 hours) nobody did it. I had other grind stuff to do so wasn't going to kick it off.
---
Irritates me that nobody ever turns up for PP and RR as I'm still trying to get some of the plans and uniques from them - and can't find anyone on PS4 who is selling them.
---
If it would really upset you I can also post a clip of shooting 30-40 rounds out of a 10 round railway rifle without reloading (not using the auto reload perk).
---
Smells like BS to me.
---
If we are successful with collecting 250M glass, there will be another chance to get the remaining items with the second helping meat week.
---
(I'm also on PC, run the event about 60 times, got every type of reward, of which 2 tenderizer plans and 4 salad plans, sold out pretty quickly.)
---
Grahm needed at most 5 Wood per hour for six days didn't he?
---
Gulper Plushie
---
Should've ask him how it feels to get his ass handed to him by a food build? And if you're a food build what broken build he is that he can't even kill you?
---
yes.   Skeetshooter in perception.
---
The most overlooked but mandatory mod for any decent  shotgun build.
---
What platform do you play on though?
---
Ps4 that's y put itvin ps4 help ha ha
---
I dont do dailies,  never have.  And dont really care about this new reward system. It a J.O.K.E, a waste of time that give you no useful items to help with game play. Like ammo, chems or food and water. Just cosmetics. Eso daily login every 24 hours actually gives you useful items to help your game play, fucking stupid ass Bethesda gives us crap.
---
I see it as players who have alot of weight reduction perks myself. Tending to over carrying everything especially food.
---
What your game tag?
---
I just meant for players to not use up their ammo when going into workshop battles. So defending your workshops doesn't cost you anything and can be fun.
---
Stormer133
---
yes its satire. 
---
If you think 2 low levels ruin the fight then you really suck.
---
I could probably solo it if I tried but always had one other person in my instance when clearing it.
---
I've cleared the rest of the place just cant di the wendigo
---
I call my character a food build and I shall keep on doing os. I use butchers bounty to get more meat from my hunts. Then I use superduper to get more glowing steak and ribs. And good with salt so they last my play session. Then I wash my steak and rib diner down with whisky, use party boy to triples the effect and professional drinker to manage my alcoholism.
---
I see, why not.
---
Thanks for the heads up. I claimed mine. Without reading about it here I would likely never have looked at the board since I finished the run a few days ago.
---
Given that theres only a couple of weeks or so left for this Season to run before the board becomes inaccessible forever then its pretty shitty how they have gone about "fixing" the problem. I predicting a fuckload of players are not going to think to go back to the board to reclaim it and will as a result never have access to the helmet which should have been there from the start. They need to do something better about either getting the word out or making it available via the atom shop or something.
---
Swamp Plants can be gathered from Strangler Blooms with a 50% chance. Those, contrary to all the numerous rumours about them, really only spawn in the river near Dyer Chemicals when a character who is at the right stage in the quest An Organic Solution enters the area. After which they persist until the server shuts down.
---
Your best bet therefore is to server hop at Dyer Chemicals until you find a server where they are blooming. Also, equip Green Thumb before you go there to increase your harvest.
---
Below Vault 76, the wood mill place. Go to the Mothman lighthouse and walk there and you'll have 20 wood collections before you arrive.
---
Sounds to me like you're still tripping.
---
It's a problem with the event not the players.  If they wanted it to be a high level thing it should have been level gated, if they wanted lowbies to participate they should have made the adds something they could handle, or some other way to participate.
---
Got your camp is good as you want it withing build parameters?
---
Got all the goodies from Regs?
---
Changed your build around to try other weapons and find some more fun?
---
Have you ever just said ...this week I am a raider and see how high you can get a bounty on yourself before getting taken out?
---
Recipes, Bobbleheads, Magazines collections complete?
---
etc
---
It's a sandbox world...you can make your own fun.
---
Yeah, it does. That lvl 17 wouldn‚Äôt do any damage to anything
---
How was I being condescending? You said it was an obscure phrase and told me to use a different word so I thought maybe English wasn't your first language or you from a different part of the English-speaking world to me because that's not my experience of how people use it at all.
---
You responded by telling me to 'say something normal' so I'm wondering who is this random internet person who wants me to adjust me language to fit his own expectations. Now who's being anal?
---
For the record I've still no idea how someone from the UK can be so unfamiliar with 'anal' being used as shorthand for anally-retentive.
---
I know that jumping servers fixes the event,thats not my point, there are dozens small bugs like that that ruin the game,if its not crimson prospect it will be kerwood mine,if its not kerwood mine it will be the fast travel bug or something else,is it so hard to have a team looking and fixing those thing's?.
---
Meet me round the back of the Red Rocket stop in 5 mins. Don't wear armour.
---
It's kind of silly that stuff like the PA mod and Berry Mentats can detect Robots, AKA Non-living things, but can't detect dead bodies.
---
They should just make those effects also highlight dead bodies in a different color, like Blue or Purple.
---
It certainly was a bummer to finally be on when it started and to end up with me (250) another 200, and 2 sub 70.  Everyone left after the health refresh, and the event failed.  üòî
---
You don‚Äôt need them to be viable. Create a new character. Walk them to the nearest train station and build a camp beside it. Then use a friend or courier to load caps, stims, weapons onto the mule. I have 5 characters and am sitting on 400k 5.56 and max caps on all....
---
So i can place it in my unlit acid cave as a guard.
---
I suggest trying it for a month to see if you like it. You get to keep everything. If 1st runs out you can take things from scrapbox but not deposit.  I got a year's subscription and now wish I hadn't. Now I feel like I have to play since I paid for it.
---
Did you ever play eso? I was wondering if they did this because they are scaling up low levels damage like they did with one tamriel.
---
No they are.
---
It's terrible, but you'll notice time gating is thier go to method of stretching content.  Probably won't change much.
---
yeah 2 level 50's and yourself. That's a tough ask.
---
Player vendor.  Any junk 3 star will sell for 300 or so pretty quickly.
---
Crap...I missed loads and kept finding my prime meat disappear üòÇüò≠ I should have put much more time Into it...only saw the bunches of plans on the last couple days üòÖ
---
First make workshops something worth fighting over again
---
Bruh spend 9 points
---
Because I'm tired of seeing them.   I'm glad someone's still collecting them.
---
If you us the .50 cal you will always be short on steel since it needs 5x as much as the other ingredients.
---
Are u on PC my friend?
---
I have several magic guns (Limb Minigun, Bash Minigun, JE 50 Cal, Limb LMG) which do't do magic damage in ACP, possibly because the framerate inside is too low.
---
However, I recently got a Suppressors Limb UGL that does work its magic (4 minutes solo, 7 minutes w/ team).
---
Yeah for real haha
---
This is good news and I am very pleased to hear they have listened to past criticisms and tried to improve it.
---
Im not on PC so cant access the PTS myself but can I appeal to those who do to please provide feedback to the effect of making the Moleminers hostile this time around? I know I'm soft (in the head probably) but one aspect of the last one I hated was the fact the moleminers actually seemed frightened and wanted to run away. Mowing them down in cold blood just to steal their treasures didnt sit right with me (and a lot of other players at the time)
---
1. Try leveling up to 300 so you can unlock 6 legendary perk slots on all your characters and also build reputation
---
It's 40'ish days of 3 minutes worth of quests. For an online game, that's just... Not grind...
---
ULTIMA Onlines Doom Gauntlet says hello. WoW raids snicker in the background. Lineage 2 laughs in Korean.
---
It's a set amount per hit.
---
Its not, congratulations on calling me out haha
---
Poor thing its already occupied by mister skelly so you cant enter.
---
Yes. Started happening to me since the Colossal Problem.
---
Why look at most players as "just bad" versus some players as "really good" or "exceptional"?  
---
It's stimpaks, not steampacks.
---
But why the hell it never happened to me until I got a bloodied build? It's infuriating honestly.
---
Thanks.  I will keep this is mind.  I need to learn the event, I guess.
---
It's a timegating mechanic to keep players logging in. That is not a drawback for the owner. The owner has not to make a choice what to equip. 
---
You got good stats gear as a reward for beating the RNG. You want extra rewards for being lucky enough to get the right traits? Maybe they should add an I-win-button on your pipboy aswell? So you can nuke the entire wasteland around you and only loot dead bodies?
---
gonk
---
You're doing well!  :)
---
They're aware of that one too
---
So this will be the new cap sink, getting rid of these things?   I guess the people with alts who want them should start buying them up.   ;)
---
To be fair, I would pike the heads of my enemies if I could in today's world. Just something gratifying about trophies...
---
I'm sure you enough Overseer points to buy it.
---
Doesn‚Äôt look terribly console friendly
---
For sure, it‚Äôs pretty broken all around. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If you get it and use it, in a way you never kill her dad then. But like..mmm declaw him lol. so he cant hurt no one else ever again, she could come visit him i guess lol
---
Oh did my idea make too much sense? My bad
---
" hasn‚Äôt leaned into another build " do you mean not focus on a build? Wait so my unarmed heavy weapon sneaky sniper is also a food build?
---
I do this event alone with my 2nd char. A lvl 80 sneak build and just 1 shot wendigo's until i fail the event. Never get seen and get at least 600 screws.
---
It sounds like once you do the event often enough to learn it (which could be anywhere from once to several times, right, depending on the person's individual learning curve), we can go back in bloodied.  I hope you post when you do it with the shotgun build and let us know how it goes.
---
I too was AFKing the event but keeping an eye on it as I was working. Making sure to never fail it if not ugh people showed. I too, was there when it all faded out.
---
I know they increased the spawn locations to cover the entire map, but I'm not sure about rates. I feel like I heard they did, though.
---
I think the event description says very hard on difficulty.
---
This is why we can't have nice things, because people can't look things up that takes 2 seconds to.
---
Actually it needs to be 15% less damage while blocking....
---
I agree.   Did you see the one recommendation to take health up to 40% and then do it?   I don't know.  I still think I'm going to do it full health the new few times and try to learn it more, then maybe try that suggestion.
---
When is that guy at the foundation ever going to finish fixing that damn mailbox?he has been hammering it for years.
---
Yes but to use Tesla on radiation rumble or colossus is a criminal offence
---
Need on IRL so I can boot it across the room
---
I never got the sign, actually. Never showed up in the Atom Shop to claim.
---
The treasure hunter event is now in PTS
---
Heard a rumour that the magic has been fixed in patch 22 ... might be fake news
---
Nice.
---
Only downside is when the event is over. At least in WS and HF enemies respawn. BUT you will have most of the server there spoiling your run though.
---
So I hear, with new drops, better drop rates and lower costs too.
---
I could've sworn it was a full week. It started on Wednesday and ended on Wednesday, right?
---
Well I‚Äôve got that on the torso already
---
Dont forget to check player vendors!! I got that plan for 300 caps!!
---
to buy it? ü§∑ can you buy perks? üò±
---
Having 900 ballistic defense shouldn‚Äôt be as good as 400. It makes making a tank pointless because you can still be killed. I‚Äôm sacrificing damage cards to be a tank. I should be able to shield myself from bullets.
---
I am bloodied and will be bloodied forever! I am killing colossus in 2 minutes solo without die and successfully escaping all the time
---
Five for me.
---
yes, every time you get doubled card in NW you'll receive overseer tickets os something (don't remember the name). Then you go to missing cards section where you can buy missing ones for those tickets.
---
Biggest good guy. How does one award karma?
---
Once someone has done the events a hundred times why keep going ?
---
yea beccouse people buy that
---
Exactly but for some reason we‚Äôre getting downvoted for sharing our personal experiences
---
I do too as long as I have time to do it.   If it's just me or two of us, usually go for XP.  Any more than that, and I'm gathering ore.
---
Ok , should be good to go then
---
Yeah happened to me when I helped a friend do that quest
---
Very generous and kind person right here OP is. My kinda people. Ever looking to help others or like minded individuals. Look up PKOA. We are all about what you are doing for others my friend.
---
Truth and the amounts of ammo you need to put in are off numbers which don‚Äôt make sense, as well as how after you go through converting, you have to back out of every page you‚Äôve gone through to get off the screen
---
&gt; I find that people tend to not bother when they do not feel there is a chance of the event succeeding
---
This.
---
I've only done it twice, once on each character, and didn't have any issues/bugs.
---
Damn! It was intense that first time!!  
---
I doubt I'll be jumping into it every time I see it pop up becaause it was quite a drain on ammo for a pretty casual player.  I will be preparing for some more visits to the mine, though, for sure!
---
The issue with SBQ, I feel, is that SBs as an enemy type are an annoying novelty. Flying enemies are cool at first, but once you sit there for 10 minutes waiting for them to get close and/or land it starts to get boring. Of course, part of the issue is that people aren't running the event how it's supposed to be done - the SBQ is coded to land in clearings and stay in the nuke zone, not impale itself on Survival Tents and burrow beneath the bog canals just outside. I've run a couple Queens the way it was intended and it's far more enjoyable than the popular method.
---
Perhaps you could appear more delicious? ü§î
---
But really I‚Äôve had the same thing happen. ü§ô
---
Ah yes, the daily routine.
---
Bloodied works in there, but you need to stay hidden..
---
It‚Äôs an event that happened a while ago where you hunt down special mole miners and get pails (similar to the holiday scorched)
---
While we‚Äôre on the topic, make Vault Steel unlimited to purchase. Having to connect to 2 Servers for each piece of armor I want to craft is just daft design...
---
First of all, no one pvps in this game, so anyone who says how their build is big dick pvp build I just laugh
---
 Go play with the 12 people who pvp then.
---
 2nd. Bloodied died off for me. I stopped using bloodied and switched to junkies 8 months ago. Best move. The dmg is almost the same.but I dont get 1 shot so...  I laugh at every event when some cookie cutter bloodied just keeps getting 1 shot. Then proceeds to bitch or justify how he can 1 shot everything. 
---
Here's the truth junkies can 1 shot basically everything to. And with the right drugs junkies can actually out put more dmg then bloodied and my junkie build is tanky af in PA.  If you enjoy the high risk playstyle of bloodied, awesome I did to but getting owned got old.
---
Legit had like 220 power left in my gatling laser at queen and it just started reloading
---
PC?? Aw man, I'm on ps4 üò•
---
Yup!  Also hoping it's laid the foundations to utilise the 'Arena' that came with Wastelanders too!
---
Yeah, when I first saw it I thought it was perverse. You're right, the engraved name really makes it creepy especially after you've talked to Maggie and all. "Oh by the way Maggie, I killed your Father and have his decapitated head(s) on display in my home. Wanna see?"
---
Tha hell is a food build?
---
Because joining cults is for commies. 
---
"Democracy is non-negotiable!" -Liberty Prime
---
What.. WHAAT!!!!!!
---
have adownvote
---
Wait did I miss meat week with slacking for like 3 weeks?
---
I told her that I used his swollen testies In my display and still got that but I did give her the watch
---
And the vault 94 gold icon
---
I didn't knew that ü§¶ Thanks a lot ü§£
---
I didn't knew that you can buy perks ü§¶ü§£
---
--close
---
you're welcome :)
---
That's pretty ugly.
---
Low framerate was my initial reaction and explanation for the effects not working aswell. I still have few weapons i didn't bother to test. Among those all my energy weapons. Have to give them a go..
---
Can't agree more tbh
---
Why wouldn't they want stolen property back? It's the wasteland, he can just send us to raid it back, Wasteland rules.
---
Legendary effect weapons that are no longer in the game explosive energy weapons for example
---
11 topics? Are out of your mind?
---
It's a weapon with certain affixes that do unintended amount of damage. You can easy find few videos on YT where it's commented and elaborated.
---
Damn thats some my 600 lb life shit right there.
---
Ok, is bash damage one
---
Not everyone rocks OP builds and has god tier weapons nor should they feel like they need too.
---
Oh, Earl. What a guy.
---
Spotify.
---
yes, but it works on weapon with high firerate, like Ultracite Gatling Lasers, LMGs, Miniguns etc. Not every gun with bash damage is magic.
---
I have a bloodied bash damage minigun, is that magic
---
Legendary effects when mixed with a fast enough firing speed that make the game think you are doing WAY more damage then you actually are. +40% Bash Damage is one of them.
---
It‚Äôs a weapon with a special specific set of minor legendary effects which break the game (ex: medics minigun with bash damage and the faster mod) as long as it has over 200 fire rate and certain effects  the game does not understand the dmg calculation and makes it insanely overpowered. PS watch [angry turtles] video about them and how a gun becomes (magic)
---
not in general, its a little bit more complicated than just 1 affix. [angry turtle explains it quite well](https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs)
---
I found Medics is better with certain weapons. I found harpoon and shotguns are great for it. Marksman wasn't that great i could hardly notice any difference. As for weather its broken atm. Probably. Lol. Maybe try one of those weapons i suggested.
---
Those are legacies
---
Also you posted this 8 times.
---
In all Bethesda game I turn off the radio and in game music and just have the ambient sounds. Feels more immersive.
---
It also keeps the radio fresh when I end up near a camp or something.
---
Yes, it may work as magic, but I don't have one to check - I got Bloodied, 50% Limb damage one Primed and it's indeed can kill SBQ or Earle with one magazine.
---
This has been debunked so many times, it's not funny any more. Nuking the area is apparently intended to spawn Strangler Blooms but doesn't work because the evaluation order in the data files is wrong and all strangler pods are converted to glow pods first.
---
Heart of the Swamp has nothing to do with Strangler Blooms and never did, regardless of the time of day. Neither do Verdant Seasons, although they do give a 33% chance to harvest an additional bloom.
---
That‚Äôs a legacy
---
Ah thanks I was mistaken
---
I've never been able to place a full camp from a blue print. I've always had to scrap the blue print and start over
---
No worries üëå
---
Rip
---
So what are the magic prefixes or would I be best just going on youtube?
---
Yeah thats why the outside of the " box " is highlighted. So on console, you just click on the box insted of the " join event " button. Probably could be done better but this was just a rough draft of what I had in mind.
---
Go on YouTube look up Angry Turtle and there‚Äôs a vid on magic weapons he will explain all the details for
---
Visited once and there was a crowd of scorched wandering around shooting the place up. Nobody paid any attention.
---
Blueprint from the move as well.
---
The effect scales poorly with certain weapons, currently weapons with innate multihit or spread like shotguns and rocket launchers provide the most healing per proc.
---
 90% players are Childern of Atom because they are strong!
---
Why is this man getting downvoted? Those are legit questions I‚Äôm asking as well.
---
If you have combat shotgun you can mod it to -6 range ans turn it into a sniper rifle, with 95% vars headshot chance wherever the mob is
---
Hmm could be a buffer issue or something. I‚Äôd log out and log back in and try again
---
Its not... At least on PTS
---
Rule of idiocracy, welcome to Reddit. Apparently Subtiliser's post there is a problem too.
---
thanks for the advice - ill give it another try next time the legendary purveyor gives me a medics shoty
---
Excellent
---
Hey there, I'm on Xbox. Would be happy to help walk you through nuke silo. Both speed glitch, and the regular way (your preference).
---
I can also complete the new event A Colossal Problem with you (I can solo it, as I posted here - I'll show you how). I can assist with Queen too if you want but I'm not able to 2-man it with you, we'd only complete that if the others on the server came to assist.

The camp version was taken it in beta, but the workshop version is still available.
---
I sadly can‚Äôt get past the assaultron down there while chasing that evil little girl lol
---
Do people really conplain about builds? I've seen people complaining about SBQ melting and that kind of stuff, but builds?
---
I'm level 55 went in with a group of level 200 plus. Got myself a cursed pick ace with great stats. No regrets.
---
Then that speaks for the balance of the game. I've explained this before, so if you want you can check out my post history.
---
If you want a better time fighting Earle, make Bethesda have all optimized (or even half optimized) builds be viable to do _some_ damage.
---
I.E fully modded junkies gauss pistol should be able to help against Earle just as much as a bloodied commando/bloodied lmg in full gear.
---
Haha, those asshats ain't getting anything from me.
---
It was worth a shot. I'll just rebuild it. Itll take a while but maybe I can cut back on space this time around. Thanks for the help though.
---
I must be lucky cause I haven't encountered any of the issues people have been complaining about.
---
No problem, I ended up scrapping my giant base today and made a treehouse and it‚Äôs a lot nicer tbh
---
This is what I do as well. Like you said, feels more immersive, especially in the mire.
---
explosives plus that event don‚Äôt mix
---
Yes. I keep hearing a lot of that shit on area chat. It's annoying, especially since it's usually the complainers who will yell and scream for help when they happen to die during events. 
---
PVE is not PVP and a lot of people still don't seem to understand this.
---
You are perfectly right, some lvl 150 does less damages than some lvl 40.
---
Oh and they have to be in a close proximity
---
Not that strange. The legendary enemy spawns are RNG so unless things have been tagged not to be legendary there is a chance of it.
---
Lets call that chem "meatpiller".
---
I've been using my BE Flamer and LMG on Australian internet and the event has less lag than the rest of the game.
---
Strong argument here. /s
---
But we do carry a lot of radiation on us, we launch a lot of nukes and stay close to the nuked zones. We thrive off of high rads to the point of near death.
---
I know. I‚Äôve heard of a fair few myself. Tbh, I try not to read up too much on the PC mods as it‚Äôs too frustrating for a console player. As you say, you guys you have literally had perk loadouts for two years. So even if the devs were clueless on how to make it work, they have a template sitting right there to copy off of. At this point I just want to grab them and shake them until the fillings rattle in their teeth.
---
I'm gonna preface this by saying I'm a new player(lv16), but why would less limb damage be a good thing?
---
üòÇ‚ù§
---
I am honored. üòä
---
The next time before you move, do a test run.
---
The key is make sure the vending machines are not connected to each other by wire or connected to generators. They have to be isolated and placed on the ground, not foundations. Same with displays. Then move your camp. The first thing you do when you place your camp is look under blueprints. The vending machines and displays will be there. Do not begin building. Place the vendors and displays first. Then build. You can move them after. If you don't place them first, there's a chance things will disappear from them, mainly the displays will be affected.
---
I've done this every time I've moved and it worked. I'm on Xbox.
---
Hope it helps. üëç
---
I use a je gat plaz and I crashed twice
---
no, ultralight is the category like deep pocketed
---
Unless your alt is also dropping the nukes maybe leave that slot for someone else. Your low level alt is still low level, broken guns or not.
---
I *am* delicious; you have no idea.
---
If you weren't doing pylons you are just as at fault as the 512 you seem to be blaming. Pop some radaway and use up some of the stims you can hoard as a bloodied build. I say this AS a bloodied build myself. Everyone wants to be the big damn hero that crowd controls or kills the boss, somebody needs to be on pylons.
---
Take some responsibility.
---
Maybe not much, but he did take care of the windego spawns and kept them off us so we could shoot them and take care of earl.
---
Display bug, that's what's been fixed in the patch.
---
Old ones still display the text, but it has no effect, no protection.
---
You are among the best players out there.
---
GTAV have that thing, both on their website and ingame. It has everything. I love it.
---
Thanks!
---
Japanese players had to wait to buy atoms forever, they called themselves the children of Atom while they waited haha
---
You people have enough plushies! I just want some placeable junk for my camp.
---
You can stand anywhere in Appalachia and you'll get a disease
---
oh no my dude, feel free to run around naked using berserker weapons for all I care. If you start getting emotional like this we can't really have a discussion ;)
---
Same! Except, the last time I somehow went in not realizing I had only one stem pack on me. I bugged myself!
---
not with a small guns build, 10mm smg is broken in FO2.
---
&gt;I'm Bloodied build so I'm not so great at the pylons.
---
&gt;I'm Bloodied build so I can't collect ore during Radiation Rumble.
---
All this is just excuses. I remove my rads and take as many pylons as I can (usually it's all 3) and I'm going for the ore everytime during Radiation Rumble and I 'm a bloodied build aswell.
---
it's bad because they are giving us what we want but as is usually the case, we don't actually know wtf we want.
---
So complaints before it's even out.
---
It‚Äôs a weird collection of prizes, for sure. Very niche. Still, at least it saves me from grinding this event again. I do still kinda want those circus trailer doors, though.
---
thx - interesstet in an medics explosive hunting rifle? :-P
---
Does putting a fish bowl on your head protect you from poison gas?
---
Nice. You can solo it as a stealth commando just playing normally too. Tis why I dont understand all these guys complaining about low levels showing up and causing them to fail the event. After a few runs its pretty easy to figure out how to beat it.
---
Add clearence is important in this fight. Keep it up. Its only a problem when you do nothing
---
This ancient weapon of war is our salvation
---
Had to fix my neighbors mailbox in the middle of the night cause my gf was drunk and knocked it over.  Sometimes you just gotta fix that mailbox no matter the time.
---
You're not alone, I hadn't played NW for ages. Opened a load of packs but nothing... Then was informed I could buy perks.. I'm old though so I have an excuse.
---
Hitting the melee button is what i do when the laser gatling starts reloading for no reason (the only use for this melee as a heavy gunner build i guess). At least as far as i can remember. Should be faster than stashing/pulling the gun?
---
Your just that fast at retrieving
---
Now im lvl 45 but the one run i did i did atleast an 1/8 maybe a 1/7 of his health. But guess what, there were 2 FUCKIN 2 lvl 256's not doing anything but shooting now and then. NOT EVEN KILLING WENDIGO SPAWN. So please i ask you to rephrase "low lvl players" to "pieces of shit that dont do anything" bc it makes ppl think that all thier hard work is for nothing just bc they are a low lvl. I have been grinding for 2 months to save up ammo so i wont have to grind again and i used it all on fucking earl
---
Doing encrypted can be a challenge if you don't a have a good team , I have come to understand the best way to not fail the event when there's only a few people around is to take all 3 pylons by myself hit the boss a few times and let the others kill him while I keep popping stims , I run bloddied and it's a bit annoying removing rads everytime but have a few toxic goo always on me for that reason :)
---
I was under the impression that Cursed weapons drop as max level only?
---
Got a pic?
---
Assuming the number of wendigo spawns grows with number of players, I could see it being obnoxious having 2 or 3 players who can't kill wendigo spawns flooding you with them.
---
Honestly though I found actually struggling to manage the massive amount of wendigos to be a welcome challenge. Made me have to do something other than shoot Earle endlessly.
---
Also of note: Ceiling embers deal damage to wendigo spawns. If you can take wendigos to the face you can stand on the edge of the embers and they will eventually die from it. This was my first planned strategy until I got feared into the drill, and finding that 6 wendigos plus earle's melee hurt quite a bit, and I didn't want to put on the blocker perk.
---
It only says it does, it never protected you from waterborne diseases.
---
I got waterborne diseases all the time when wearing it
---
well done. now to get to the meat of the game.
---
I want some moth man faction items. A flag. Allyship so I don‚Äôt have to kill them all the time.
---
It should've been "15% less damage while blocking" I think, but I'll answer your question anyway :-)  
---
The 15% less limb damage is on a piece of armour, not a weapon. It's a defensive bonus. 
---
As to the other effect, it seems there's a glitch in the code (shocking, I know...)  that makes a few effects ("15% less damage while blocking", "+33% VATS hit chance", a few others) that interact with high fire rate weapons and shotguns (because of the pellets counting as separate hits) and do metric facktons of damage. Thus, "magic" weapons.

Only 4600 more hrs to get them 80 Atoms!!!

Hello,

I've been getting reports since yesterdaY .

It's getting massive, use the MFA to protect your account

Spotify Playlist that has the songs from every fallout radio.
---
I think I speak on behalf of the community here when I say, no... A resounding no.
---
BTW your profile tells me you actually don't play 76, so now I'm going to assume you're bored and/or have issues that need addressing.
---
Private Servers "die" if you leave and not return for 10 or so minutes.
---
Gotta love Bethesda, they really do run a tight ship. Are there ways for a low level player like myself to acquire any of these magic weapons? I know the armor effect comes from the third star on an armor piece which I can only assume means really late game shit
---
I see thank you
---
"Todd MHoward"
---
Magic weapons haven‚Äôt been effected by the PTS nerf. If anything, it‚Äôs made them even more effective compared to everything else.
---
As i said in another thread, there's some possibile solutions (suggestions) to make this whole situation better.  
---
\- Raise the daily scrip limit to 200, while lowering sell prices of 3\* Weapons to match the value of 3\* Armors. In this way the more you play, the more legendarys you get, the more you sell  
---
OR  
---
\- Raise the daily scrip limit to 250 daily   
---
Most of the time i run overcumbered by how many 3\* i have with myself not even counting the ones stored in the stash, and most of them are because i crafted pieces or weapons. At this point it's not THAT much about the quantity of scrip, is to remove unnecessary things from the stash, recliaming weight and space.
---
Think you have a point. The bug went away for me after I stopped being a bloodied build.
---
This may be a bit of a dumb question so I appreciate you taking time to help :3
---
a week ago i would have said no.
---
But after 3 play sessions on a private server ( online friend has one) and having blast zones to myself...well it's just lovely.
---
Add in scrap box and atoms, it's a good investment if you going to be playing the game for a while.
---
On PC, nothing to report. Servers stable, no crashes.
---
I remember when I first started the game and I was constantly looking for wood. I never felt like I could find it anywhere. Now years later I have over a thousand scraps of wood and never feel like I need to collect any more. It‚Äôs one of those things that makes me feel like I really came along way as a character
---
I heard that in an alternate universe, they bottle it and call it Mountain Dew.
---
I understand that, but this boss is clearly intended to be a group event. Despite how easy it may be for certain builds with certain gear, I suspect this is designed more for teamwork and community involvement. I finally solo'd the SBQ tonight and it felt great, but not quite as cool as doing it with a server full of people who are contributing. I'll sound corny saying this, but there really is a sense of accomplishment when you're part of a large group effort.
---
That said I still intend on trying Earle solo at some point. Ratty Star on YouTube has a crazy video of him doing it in a little over a minute. That's ridiculous, but inspiring.
---
It makes noise?!?!
---
For me, it depends on whether the BOS collectron talks. If that thing is silent, I will donate all my resources to make it a reality.
---
No. Where‚Äôs out insult bot collectron.
---
Really awesome job, simple but super creative! Thanks for making it!
---
Because you can be bloodied without rads
---
Not just this event, ive had no problems with radiation rumble till last night.
---
I'm on ps4 and the back of the event was so laggy it was practically unplayable, reload took a dark age, picking up loot off corpses took minutes each. You  shot where an enemy used to be and miss.
---
I honestly don't know if it had anything to do with the collosus event being implemented but i had no problems with this event before it was put in and I've done it countless times 
---
I also think the teslas were an issue, there were at least 4 people using them at the event out of about 6-7 of us ( couldn't exactly tell how many of us were there)
---
*Slaps wrist with ruler* scavenging for wood is a fun gameplay mechanic everyone enjoys doing. Have you done your daily chores? Cough* challenges ?
---
Aye. My gauss shotgun makes short work of them spawns. I too help with Earle until the wendigos start coming thick and fast and then I'm just like pew pew pew.
---
UV flairs for the flair gun. To highlight blood like in the CSI shows. Legendaries could highlight more or different.
---
&gt;Foundation though?  They are worse than the raiders, minus the heads on spikes.
---
Man, no offence intended, but there is so much I disagree with in almost everything in that post that a day on I don't even have the energy to get into RP mode and write out the length needed. I'll just point out this is a ludicrous statement.
---
Stockpile legendary scrip from day one. At 16, do every Leader of the Pack event you can, and be on the lookout for legendary enemies that you can handle. Turn in everything for scrip at the legendary vendors at train stations (unless something turns up that fits your build) and hoard it until you find the Rusty Pick in the Ash Heap (South West part of the map), then get about thirty to forty legendary modules (you'll need them late game) before spending the rest of the scrip on weapons and/or armour. Pray to the random number gods (Tzeentch works for me) to get good stuff from Murmagh, the vendor there.
---
crowd control is not the smartest decision at this event
---
I use the bots with my vampire Tesla as an efficient remedy while holding all 3 pylons
---
Of course, this only works as long as there are bots from which the lightning can jump to the next bot
---
So the next time you sit on the roof and think killing bots is the only thing you can do, let it go, others need the bots to complete the event successfully
---
Why can't they just have an autoloot function that allows you to loot everything within a certain radius
---
Thanks for clarifying that, I've been reporting this issue on the past few PTS forums but could never tell if the info actually got through/the issue was being investigated.
---
Thank you will add you soon
---
I get the impression that most players I seem to encounter are between 50-150.  It doesn‚Äôt bother me if one or two low levels join the party. Six or seven higher level players should be more than enough to cover the event.
---
The only advice I can give to low levels is to do your best to survive, so it doesn‚Äôt impede the other players that are dealing the damage.
---
I was hoping for a joke lol
---
i am 80% sure serendipity does not work in power armor, assuming you are using PA due to stabilized
---
exactly the same thing happened to me ü§£ now I'm happy that I'm not alone lol ü•¥
---
The AA might be ok. I‚Äôve had crap luck on them too. I think I‚Äôve probably crafted 30 or more at this point trying for a bloodied and nothing yet
---
If you have at least one wallpaper available, you can change the wallpaper on the wall and it'll store everything attached to the wall.
---
Ouch, Do it‚Äôs not just my luck then, Are u on Ps4? If I roll a bloodied I‚Äôll keto it aside for u
---
I can confirm it does not work in pa
---
Now you get to do what we all do. Buy expensive plans you don‚Äôt actually need just so you can avoid the cap.
---
No problem. ;)
---
760 now
---
What a Champion! Just don't forget to bring way, way, way more ammo than you'll think you'll ever need.
---
yo can do this solo very often - "swamp heart" is the best place to find players dying in water
---
Area of effect looting? Sounds good. Maybe piles could combine into less piles, but slightly bigger.
---
I‚Äôll keep my eye on that one, thanks
---
You cant trade them
---
Oh right, I forgot about that :/
---
:(
---
Already upgraded!
---
Um, I don't have a build per se. I take QOL stuff but I decided back when Biv came out that my character was an avid drinker. I have the Stamina perk that prevents her from getting the Alcoholic penalty, I take quack doctor, and party girl a lot of the time. Sure I suck at PVP but at least I enjoy the game and don't treat it like a math problem and complain every time someone changes the damage calculation.   
---
Also can't forget the bonus luck for being drunk... Goot times.  
---
(Also please Bethesda, can I please get a weight reduction perk for rifles. I don't need massive damage but when I can carry, 3 miniguns, a missile launcher, a fat man launcher, and an old-timey Gatling gun in the weight of one well-upgraded hunting rifle. I feel discriminated against as a rifle user.)
---
His stompy feet and those ceiling embers shred üòì
---
I'm only level 28 and don't do events Higher than my level. The only time I did was during meat week at the primal events. I figured out that they all had something I could use to get off the floor so reduced the damage I was taking by 90% at least. Then just heal when low health as could still be hit by projectial attacks and do a bit of damage to try and help.
---
I think this raises the age-old issue of why we can't just modify underarmors in the workbench to work as outfits.
---
I would have loved to wear for the past 300 levels my Vault 76 jumpsuit over my armor to show the number on my back, given the opportunity.
---
It kind of does.

Holy fuck lost at it at she could come visit lmao. If I could I'd upvote more than once ü§£ü§£
---
I show up to all those
---
Folks need to leave their Tesla‚Äôs at home for this one....
---
I say jump in and just try to get a couple of hits on each enemy, run and hide and do your best to survive if an enemy agro‚Äôs you.  Public events are for everyone, regardless of level.
---
üëçüèª
---
I‚Äôm am, but yes unfortunately not tradable. I‚Äôve had good luck on Gauss and secret service armor, so I can‚Äôt complain too much. I should add, instigating is also good for these, if the last wasn‚Äôt LD the could be good.
---
Please film that and upload to YT
---
Level 3 tenderizer maybe instead of strange in numbers. Maybe you can have a teammate share strange in numbers since level 1 perks are easy to share.
---
* You have been removed from The Champions Circle.
---
I‚Äôm going to keep crafting for something better, Thx for your help anyways, It‚Äôs appreciated.
---
Placing another factory will clear that ghost budget after a couple of relogs. It will decrease until it's gone. I have helped some people stuck with 35% ghost budget this way. The only downside is that you're then still stuck with that one ammo factory or, after moving the CAMP, 0.5%-1% ghost budget.

Here is the stealth/rifleman build I used to use.

---
Start by showing us where your current SPECIALS are allocated and what perks you currently have. I assume by non automatic build, you mean rifles? So you'd be looking at using the rifleman perk cards in perception.
---
It's extremely common outside Site A. Ever seen a Scorched Behemoth or a Chameleon Deathclaw? Those seem to be the most rare.
---
it's just a costume. you wouldn't expect a cosplayer to have any extra protection, but you might be able to wear a protective helmet underneath it, like you can with the main outfit.
---
Grahm: "I don't feel so good..."
---
Does a piece of cloth protect you from virus?
---
A single star bloodied gatling gun is a great add for you. They sip ammo and hit hard. You can upgrade to more ammo hungry options later. 
---
Are you thinking Power Armor or normal?
---
I dont give a fuck, English is not my native language, and my game client have different name for stimpaks. Its like calling some people exceptional, for being able to breathe.
---
So you're a neo-nazi
---
I've not encountered this bug yet, but I have seen so many threads about it. Is this something that is just affecting the console peeps, or is it happening to PC players too? I reckon I've fought Earle 40+ times now, only had him glitch out one time where he ragdolled, but was still alive. It was hilarious.
---
Ah okay thank you, I shall remove this!, any tips on where to move the points to?
---
I dont give a fuck, English is not my native language, and my game client have different name for stimpaks.Back to the point, its like calling some people exceptional, for being able to breathe.
---
I'll have to keep an eye out for a magic heavy gun as my BE 50 cal.  was barely denting Earle, which didn't make me want to do the event again just to waste a ton of ammo on a bullet sponge enemy.
---
I shall look into these changes, thank you
---
You should have a character made after you if you get to 7600 hrs of game play. I'm assuming op is playing since release. 3000 hrs in 2 years. So nearly 6 years for 760 atoms. Hopefully power armour skins will be reduced by then.
---
I guess
---
i personally love swimming in fusion cores, so you could move the unused luck into INT for batteries included
---
Alright its on my profile
---
Swift or stinging. I prefer swift
---
I am sooo sick of those thorn bushes. I had to move far away from any random encounter spawns. Now my new neighbors are a couple of Blood Eagle shaped stains on the asphalt near ny camp. Srsly, 4 heavy laser turrets, they last 3 seconds whenever they spawn.
---
I have a pistol character but right now its bloodied guerilla. 
---
When it was gunslinger I actually went full health and used plasma, gamma and gauss ... sometimes a tweaked 10mm.
---
But I'm sitting on 15k .38 so spending that down in the meantime. I only have one bloodied 10mm did it has crap for the other stars; if I had a b2525 I'd stay bloodied geurilla longer.
---
Mine is set up so I can largely switch between full health and bloodied as well as gunslinger and guerilla by changing gear and moving cards.
---
I'm still chasing a few dream weapons and armor options. This is the grind.
---
I also build camps, so that's a nice distraction.
---
That's not very Brotherhoodly of you soldier
---
Yeah was debating batteries included.
---
How about this after moving things around a bit: [Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d334e8b&amp;d=sb2sq2s32sr2pe2ei1cu2ip2ir2a04ls2lt2l71eu0lu2ce0ic4a72s20s12&amp;w=sx2s72ii0p10pa0p80p90c52i30ia0i50iq2ie2in1ih2id2if2i71im1i61ij2ag2a12lm2at1c62eh2&amp;m=051c29fe87b3&amp;n=Bloodied%20Heavy%20Wep%20Team)
---
I see you have lots of perks to see you weight for food and chems, so i would recommend getting a chemists backpack upgrade off raider faction, when i equipped mine it gave me like 100+ lbs of weigh. It was better than possum badge upgrade for expanded backpack mod.
---
Might be worth your time since it reduces weights of  the same as level 3 traveling pharmacy does and adds 30 lbs to your weight.
---
Otherwise i think your pretty well off.
---
Dude...this is what i do to craft my damn "RadSheilds" üòê

You need to harvest them as soon as "Heard of the Swamp" event pops. If you try after the Strangler Queen died, you'll find nothing. I sometime didn't find anything, i presume it's a bug, but most of the time...day or night...as soon as the "Heart of the Swamp" event pops i find what I need.
---
Thank you to try for yourself...
---
üòê‚úåüòë
---
Thank me later !
---
Lol what's your problem, I did this event solo a couple of times, so If I have people with me, I don't care if they do or do not do something. Why so many people cant just get proper builds, jeez
---
There is a second run. And all the rewards are already know for it (they're in the pts)
---
I believe the second season starts 2 weeks after this one finishes
---
I have a lot more fun in NW than campfest COD WZ
---
As a non heavy gun build who uses one occasionally at events like SBQ and ACP, this is insanely infuriating.
---
The other night during ACP I switched perk cards for heavy guns, including power user. Gat lazer, shows 999 shots, starts to reload at 700 and something.
---
There has been numerous videos on YouTube about the next season, what I've recalled its already visible in the pts with the estimated date around mid September
---
Eh I can wait
---
Slightly unrelated, but what is the deal with ash piles? 
---
I am so sick of missing out on loot after line in the sand or radiation rumble, just because theres ab enpty pile of ash covering half of the meat piles.
---
Make just one character.  The faster to level; less need to spread out the best weapons you get.   You can still each join each other in quests.   There's a special button that lets you join an instance "not in solo quest" or something like that.   Also, this game can get pretty grindy.  I have two characters that went through Wastelanders, but I can't bring myself to make the second one allies with both factions like I did the first.   
---
Far away is better to save on caps for fast travel.   You can always just hang out at one particular camp.  Sometimes my camp isn't deployed at all if it can't be placed but my teammates are online.  I can just use their camp(s) as my own.  Just put down two beds/sleeping bags so that you can both get the "well rested" perk for increasing XP.     
---
For a newer player, getting a good melee weapon will save you so much hassle in the endless quest for ammo.  If points are in strength, you can easily switch that over to heavy gunner.  The gatling is fantastic for packing a punch with little ammo.    That's advice for your wife.   For you, if you prefer stealth sniper, go for it!   Just figure out how you're going to handle getting back into a corner in a small space by a bunch of fast-moving ghouls.  (I haven't gone that route, so I don't know--but I'm sure someone does.)
---
U r right, less damage while blocking
---
A jelly donut
---
Well, you know what they say about opinions.  
---
I get it.  You really need for there to be good guys... but that just is not the case here.  Foundation is just as bad as the Raiders, if not a little worse (in my opinion).  Both are pretty awful groups, petty and selfish, but at least the Raiders own up to it.  Foundation tries to cover it up under a veneer of "helping".  Except they only help themselves, and are all too glad to kill anyone who doesnt fall in line.  Sound like anyone else in the region?  
---
Reply or dont.. I know folks are getting triggered here.  Prefer one faction or another all day long, but trying to prop up Foundation as the "good" faction?  I mean, in the Raiders eyes, they are the good guys too I guess.
---
What is your armor?
---
An option to consider for all rifleman is a plasma flamer. A vamp can keep you healed.
---
If you're on PC I have spare Plans from the ACP Event. You're welcome to have them for free
---
MOIST
---
IMO tenderizer isn't that good past level 1, id recommend suppressor instead to weaken would be hostile's damage.
---
The problem with armor and weapons being worth the same amount is that they cost different values to buy from the purveyor so that's why they're base 3 vs base 5.
---
You can add me, I'm Lamorak\_2000 in the game and I'm usually online between 0930 and 1300 (Mountain time) Sunday-Thursday, and more on Fridays and Saturdays.
---
Add me JustDanny. I'll help you do it if you're still online
---
Added. Thanks!
---
I still die fast if I'm caught :) avoid is the best option for me (and an asbestos chest likely)
---
Aight. I'll be online in 5
---
It‚Äôs a shame they don‚Äôt seem to carry that same disappearing after looting physic that the meat piles do. Hopefully they‚Äôll get a general fix soon
---
More likely a thumper (because that's the sound you hear when their body hits the ground). I tried this event on the PTS server at level 150 with my magic "hacked" 50 cal bloodied explosive with the scattered mod attached, almost made it through but the last time I died it glitched (I assume) and kicked me out of the mine. Just as well, as I had ran out of 50 cal ammo. Was doing good damage on Earl til that happened. Kept alternating between my bloodied plasma caster for the other lesser swarms and switching to the 50 cal for Earl.
---
What level should you be if you want to join the event?
---
All of that extra animation would crush the servers in this game.
---
Should swap some points from agility then i guess
---
Yeah, the hilarious thing is Veil of Secrets (technically a piece of cloth) is indeed protect you from airborne hazard.
---
Now you know why, if you view Reddit on the phone app, the sub for this game is littered with adverts for mental health and councillors. You *need* therapy after this shit.
---
I would love this!!
---
level doesn‚Äôt really matter. Your guns and armor matters. If you have handmade that does 100 dmg, you should just upgrade your damage first.
---
I regularly attend riding shotgun with my team. It's an easy legendary
---

---
Toxic Valley,  the most abundant part of the wasteland in terms of wood, radstags meat, and that terrific acid we all need to make those bullets to feed those auto weapons we'll need, aluminum, copper, and black titanium.
---
Yeah no rush, weekend maybe best for both of us then
---

---
I'd day 50 is a good start. Then youd have max level gear at least. That being said anyone is welcome to join, it's not that massively hard of an event. Though it does kinda stink picking up the slack for others. But it's meh imo whether low levels show up or not (sucks when people leave because of it though)
---
No... it doesn't.  Cloth masks don't actually "protect" you from anything, they just reduce the odds depending on a whole lot of other factors.  It's still entirely possible to get the virus while wearing a mask, just like it's still entirely possible to inhale poisonous gasses because you have a movie prop strapped to your head.
---
If you want guaranteed protection from diseases and gasses you need shit that's actually airtight and has some sort of filtration system or enclosed air supply, that's not something you're going to find from a cloth mask or a movie prop helmet.
---
Yeah, legendaries have a nasty habit of disappearing sometimes. Its not that you can't see it, its literally gone. Nothing could help that except BSG fixing the bug.
---
Why not both I would pay atoms for that
---
Big Boss DLC Confirmed.
---
I didn't think you could use backpacks while you're inside PA though?
---
I get that my "build" might not be an actual build but I'm going for a heavy gunner white night kind of build, I don't really like wearing power armor unless absolutely necessary and I only carry the excavator power armor for when I get overcumbered, and I don't carry any other power armor, I'm level 85, and just decided on some sort of "build", I don't even know what this build would be called lol.
---
There're various eccounters with settlers all over the map in wich the might show annoyance if you enter the place during the night
---
Okay thank you, but do you think this is a good general all round heavy weapon build, so can still loot / scrap / etc with it okay?
---
Don‚Äôt revive them...let them learn on their own.
---
Check out da big brain on dis guy.. heres your upvote
---
Aside from getting what they were owed I don't get why people were so big on even having this helmet... just like the Nuka Girl costume they had to give it that stupid cowl so there wouldn't be clipping issues with any hairs and that just kills it for me.
---
if you are hurting for carry cap, Calibrated shocks will be your best friends. Excavator PA with calibrated shocks if you STILL need more room
---
GET THEM OUT LADS, HE DID IT! ;)
---
In bloodied and now I know the event better have not died on a few runs, if your not stealth, the main square column in the middle go to that platform and peek a corner at Earl, then as he moves you move and just keep circling. This stop you running when scared, and there isn't many environmental hazards to deal with either.
---
I've got her wearing a harness.
---
Yeah I was going to go with Calibrated shocks on maybe Ultracite PA
---
If your such a bad ass it shouldnt matter if lower levels join , stop crying and just play the game
---
I think that makes sense
---
5 wood per 30 seconds for 2 or so minutes per hour
---
Ultracite Shocks are VERY HARD to obtain currently, they can go for a lot in trades, and you would have to know the plan to use them on the Strangler heart PA later on.
---
This. Means I can donate once. Grahm &gt; BoS
---
The Aa larger capacity
---
On me profile
---
Sold those back to Grahm (well the food before it spoiled)
---
Go on.
---
you do know it‚Äôs a team event where all 8 people need to do something? just quit the game if you can‚Äôt do one event lol
---
No, you're not wrong. That's literally how it is.
---
We always get a good laugh out of those enthusiastic little ones who run straight at the queen the moment she lands to introduce her to their lvl 20 Ski Sword or whatever. 
---
Scorched Earth is a fun event that all 24 people on the server can do, no matter their build. No one is excluded due to it not being instanced and that's cool. SE with low levels can be a lot of fun because you can just revive them without fear of getting swarmed by a group of lvl 75 Wendigos.
---
ACP, on the other hand, is fun BUT hardcore. If you're running at Earle with your lvl 20 Ski Sword out, you die. If you get cornered by the adds, you die. 
---
Dying during ACP can be costly if no one bothers to revive you because of the respawn timer and I can guarantee you that even I, who usually revives everyone because we're all in it to win it will reconsider that policy if I have to revive you every 5 seconds.
---
Low levels joining ACP means that there is one less player on the team that can hold their own, it's that simple.
---
I can understand why people get annoyed when low level players show up to ACP and I hope Bethesda changes this. The last thing we need is high levels being toxic towards low levels because the devs didn't attend "Instanced Dungeon Boss Raid 101".
---
I prefer it's blood.
---
What if they had a deathclaw plushie
---
OH damn you are right i forgot about that.
---
I'm imagining that little deathclaw from new vegas DLC
---
Or remove script and just have gold... have the mole miner upgrade and say fuck script... no need to have 6 different currencies.   FO76 isnt an MMO no matter how hard yall try.  It is a shared world shooter, much like Borderlands.
---
Bold of you to assume I have friends. It was a joke - I don't need your weapons and I really don't want to lose any of mine so just relax lol
---
It seems to be the actual place you want to travel too that's bugged. As if you don't have enough caps to travel to it. Cause if I try a location close to where I want to go It works first time.
---
I thought the intention is that you shouldn't be able to control yourself OUTSIDE of Power Armor.
---
Otherwise the Fear mechanic doesn't have as much significance.
---
I was wondering if this was intentional or not. Have Bethesda come out and said anything in regards to it yet? Would have expected it to come in testing and get fixed before going live.
---
Food builds are just the best
---
Why struggle with carry weight i say
---
I am a food build and im proud of it and i dont care about what the overencumbered assholes have to say about it
---
But do we know an estimate of when patch 22 is arriving? I'm guessing that's going to come first, or at least around the same time
---
I don't get why we have to get less ammo out than we put in? If anything, converting the same type of ammo e.g. ballistic to ballistic it should be 1:1, but if you were to convert from ballistic to energy it would be 2:1
---
FIX - THE - RESPAWN - BUG - ALREADY
---
So this.   I have low lvl all the time in my instances and no one complains.   And US high lvl players have no problem taking Earl down with them.
---
yes, but they block the high level players from the event
---
Yeah I think with ACP higher ammo count they should give us the rare plans in a pool from the other events at a slightly higher drop rate like ultracite calibrated shocks.
---
I‚Äôve yet to have 8 people at a single event.
---
If required, I put the event on my own shoulders and make sure it succeeds.
---
Had a couple level 40s, a level 38, and a 10 last night. We still killed Earle with plenty of time to spare.
---
Good point, but I think that prices can stay the same. Things needs to be pricey, so you need to stack up more scrips or sell more weapons to reach the limit. Point is of my suggested changes to sell more and more legendaries (specially when you start to craft them) to manage better weight and stash space, while the 200 daily scrip nets you a bit more value than before.
---
This in turn will promote buying plans for legendary items, this farming, treasury notes redeem (also I would increase daily TN to 40), junk farming, events participation etc. It's everything related in my head; once you start giving a reason and a comfortable objective (and reward) people will feel more involved in the grinding. Imho naturally.
---
Another possible solution could be to raise daily scrip limit to 250 AND the scrip quantity you can carry to 2000. In this way no prices will be touched leaving the system as it is.
---
In fp view I fire my 50 cal and look down I see all my spent shells rolling away they make a thunk sound when they hit the ground too.
---
I'm all in - it would be nice if you could choose whether underarmor will work as it or as outfit - without any modification (non-modded) it should work as outfit, with any mod installed it should work as underarmor.
---
It doesn‚Äôt but look at how many stim packs you have on you. Do you really need more than 15-20?  Same for other chems. If you only pick what you need can free up perk cards. You can always pack around the backpack and use to fast travel if you get over weight by exiting power armor
---
Where exactly is that inside the cave?
---
better for Vats is Swift
---
I hate the fact that a lot of these dam helmets remove my beautiful porn stash.
---
But that just proved my point
---
Thats the point of the fear.
---
Did you get anywhere with this?
---
Had the same issue, deleted the game and all save files. Not the PSPlus ones though...
---
Reinstalled and painstakingly updated... And rebuilt database. 
---
Couple of days and a few hours of gameplay later it happens again. Specifically triggering when opening the build menu. 
---
Trying a second time, this time I also deleted the Plus files and rebuilt database before installing.
---
I'm guessing the plans are very expensive too?
---
Maybe i'll stick to a lower PA instead of Ultracite until I can get these haha
---
Never need to hunt three legendaries or level up every day ever again
---
was that yesterday on PC ? :) Cause my base was suddenly in a blast zone when I returned from a hunting trip XD
---
I'm with you. There're better underarmors and the BOS fatigues work better as outfits, at least visually. Now even more with the BOS beret
---
If you can legendarily mod gear you craft. Murmrgh could then give you a chance at getting gear you doen't have the plans for.
---
Had a little kid with a mic in one my instances last night. Kid was legit asking for people to drop ultracite plasma cores for his legacy gp. He was also like lvl 22 so everyone was like uhm what? The rubble cleared and this kid proceeded to literally run around doing nothing. We managed just fine with one less player contributing to the fight but I could only imagine if there were several more low lvls that would have sucked. They def need a lvl floor for this event. It‚Äôs not bad with scorched earth because the whole server can show up but with this 8 person stuff it‚Äôs unfair to whoever dropped the nuke if they get stuck in an instance full of low lvls.
---
Yeah, unfortunately, would have been a great help if it did work.
---
So think i've got it to a good position without the backpack, I believe.
---
The respawn bug prevents people from being able to control their character after dying. Reving is every handy until Bethesda fixes this annoying bug.
---
What platform are you on?
---
What do you consider a low level? I‚Äôm level like 74, is that high enough go do fine in this event?
---
Was there someone using a tesla during the event?
---
Ah good point PS4
---
Fun detected. Initialising 'fix' protocol.
---
To the right side of the cave (relative to where you drop in). It's a U-shaped alcove with that big yellow machine in it. There are some of the bright barrels in the corner and a big red thing on the back wall.
---
I'll make another clip for getting to it from the drop entrance.
---
I cannot tell you how many fucking times this has happened to me for both scorched earth and collosal it is so fucking annoying.
---
for Standard use, i recommend the T51. in rad zones you can rock X-01 until you can get those Calibrated plans, or just shoot for the T65
---
I literally show up to every single event that you just listed
---
Weeeell free range sometimes run out before i get there üòè
---
Yeah, this all reeks of exaggeration. I mean 3000 hours? Their Xbox literally exploded from a game crashing?
---
Fk off, seriously.
---
If he wants something to do, I'll nuke his base. That'll give him something to do, by repairing his base and it'll also clear out his stash a bit.
---
Get two birds stoned at once.
---
I'm not sure the method exactly qualifies as fun. It's definitely in the category of "very effective".
---
I edited. Sorry.
---
They should put a level limit on it.
---
Yeah good idea, what would you move the points from Traveling pharmacy into?
---
Fair enough, lol
---
Thank you, I haven't played it since before the wastelanders DLC, is the T65 hard to get?
---
I‚Äôve got a bloodied explosive one that can reach around 500+ per shot.
---
Can‚Äôt wait till you get nerfed.
---
There might be a difference of timezones or platform. I've never heard anyone complaining about that on voice chat. Well, I barely hear people on voice chat.
---
On PC.
---
Nah today, on PC, about 45 mins ago now.
---
One of the players fast travelled to my base and appeared to be waiting for me to show up to bitch me out, but as I was carrying too much, I had to walk. Eventually they spent over 2000 caps in my vendors and left, lol.
---
That is honestly such a good idea. Plus that interface looks very good! Definitely something i would see bethesda making (if they make one)
---
SBQ, Encryptid, PP and now ACP are the only events I do.
---
I dont think ive ever done dog wood die off lol
---
Drum...more bullets down range combined with fast reload its a boomer :)
---
Don't think it really matters what level the participants are as long as they contributing  and dealing damage.
---
As long as they have decent weapons and armor I havnt got a problem with them being there.
---
On one play through I had a few lvl 40's there and they were doing a damn sight better than the lvl 348 that bothered to show up.
---
The lower levels were reviving me and my teammates and dealing with the wendigo spawn, often using themselves as bait and giving them the run around.
---
The lvl 348 was as good as a wet paper bag , died constantly and hardly contributed to dealing with the big guy, whatever the stats on his weapon was it was hardly dealing damage to the spawn let alone the collosus. The vast majority of the time he was getting in the way of our firing arch.
---
We managed to finish the event and out of a gesture me and my mate gifted the lower level members of the event some legendary items, stimpacks etc... to show our gratitude for their service
---
Buuuuut you can control yourself if youre not in power armor
---
I think this is a bug
---
I dont think theyve said anything (that ive seen at least)
---
The bug is that you can control yourself outside of Power Armor. You have it backwards.
---
it, and all the plans can only be purchased with the new currency, Gold Bullion. you can only start earning the gold once you complete the main wastelanders story. it is kind of costly, but has the best stats of any PA in the game from a Defense standpoint
---
Ok i only played it with Power Armor, but thats strange.
---
U sure?
---
Are fair enough, thank you, might be a little while until I get that then haha
---
What is the point of this copypaste? The op is currently on hot, no need for advertising it.
---
Yeah on Beta I started adding friends just to have free fast travel everywhere. I have a shit ton of friends but I never thought about this. Thanks!
---
‚ÄúOh and btw, that‚Äôs his Sac in that display case over there. Can I get you anything? Coffee, tea, barf bag...?
---
What a treasure hunter ?
---
Bandolier- 2pts. You‚Äôll have a lot of ammo and it makes some weightless (ballistic ammo). Especially if your using different types of heavy weapons.  Can mix in any 1pt card you like
---
If you‚Äôre good on weight from ammo could do 3pt blocker
---
No they don‚Äôt. Infinite number of groups can run the event.
---
I just think they should make an interface like the scrip machine. The thing would have 2 parts. One where you would deposit ammo similar to putting legendary items in the scrip bin. And one where you would buy the ammo, similar to the purveyor (but i guess someone would find an unlimited ammo glitch similar to the unlimited scrip bug we had a while back)
---
I'm on PC as well and there are days/servers where people talk about everything.
---
Just this morning I had, I assume, a streamer on my team who kept talking about Patreon. I guess it was to inform his followers about the potential rewards but Patreon was literally all I could understand because it was not one of the languages I speak. 
---
Sure as hell beats the lunatic raving about food builds or the chick that sang along to Ring of Fire. Very badly...
---
The Wendigo one sure does. It's adorable. :D
---
To be fair maybe one or two times they didn't realize how much they were in over their head, revive them and give them a chance to run if you can afford to, but if they don't then yeah... Let them die.
---
Speaking of plushies, why is there no Chally plushie? No love for our favorite moo moo?
---
Or a Grahm plushie. One that randomly talks about meat week. :D
---
&gt;getting backed into a corner in a small space by a bunch of fast-moving ghouls
---
This is the worst-case scenario for a stealth sniper. My recommendation is to get  the Marsupial mutation as soon as you can, and perch on roofs, streetlamps, awnings, etc: anything not at ground-level. When you're solo, you can even use the Whitesprings roofs to take a bio-break if necessary - the ghouls and other melee nasties can't reach you there. Yesterday, I was even able to avoid a Scorchbeast's poison gas by being on a rooftop.
---
Your anecdotal evidence tells you that Heart of the Swamp causes Strangler Blooms, except sometimes it strangely doesn't because it is bugged.
---
My anecdotal evidence (and I do my own RadShield crafting, TYVM) shows me that there is no correlation between Heart of the Swamp or Verdant Season with Strangler Blooms. In addition, my own datamining, later confirmed with other dataminers, shows pretty clearly that there is no connection between Heart of the Swamp and Strangler Bloom anywhere in the game and that the only way for them to spawn is from the quest An Organic Solution.
---
*shrugs*
---
Stripe rules. :)
---
Well now you have me thinking about the sanctuary, they should put a sanctuary in 76. Put it at the place on the lower part of the map with the spikes.. can‚Äôt think of the name of it at the moment.
---
Try server hopping. I only had to do it once, but some have had to hop 4 times before it worked.
---
We literally already know the prizes, my dude.
---
Ah I actually didn't realize you could give wood more than once per run. Neat
---
As a fairly new level 25 player I support your decision. If I can‚Äôt even get a shot off without dying then I probably shouldn‚Äôt be there. It‚Äôs a nice gesture but save your stims
---
It would need a pretty long cooldown 'cause i could see people exploting it with their friends just reviving each other indefinitely.  
---
That being the case cooldown would negate the purpose of reviving players in that event to begin with.
---
same, but i liked that for me atleast, Grahm didnt vanish, he just started his walk from the event location \^\^
---
yep just another friday... mondays 2 days away.
---
i had the same thing, except i only got to shoot the boss like once, and game didnt him me any drop form him, cause i didnt do enough dmg
---
Its quicker to solo than group as you get way less robots spawns sometimes I get like 3 spawn and that's it. But tbf I've never done a silo in a group but this is what I hear/see.
---
I got the starburst clock too. Didn't know it was that rare. I feel a little better about missing the Tenderizer plan.
---
there is? im lvl 200 and did not know that
---
Old post but surprised this doesn't get attention towards the devs, Luckily on PC/steam your able to create your own deadzones and response curve to suit your aiming needs.
---
I feel like the Fallout controller community itself just cluelessly plays games or hasn't experienced better cause the controls have been ass since FO3 but maybe they should speak up cause its janky and 76 is supposed to last us years before a next title, I once posted something similar in the steam discussion around the fallout 4 release about there jacked up 1:1 mouse ratio and forced acceleration with the mouse and even commented about the joystick response curve and the large deadzone and they roasted me and half the players in the gaming community had no idea what a response curve was but luckily these new shooters are starting to implement them in the settings and Bethesda just needs to catch up.
---
Only in Fallout 76 can a company ban your account because you don't buy there atoms under the premise that you cheated.
---
That would be sick, I especially like the T-note approach. Like, let us be able to scrip infinitely, but give us "Scrip Notes" which can be traded in at max 150 Scrip per day (or more of course, everybody would have liked that)
---
If you one shot a lot of enemies try Grim Reapers Sprint.  
---
With a two shot gatling gun and [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f35486f&amp;d=s22sq2s32sr2s01sb0es1ek1c62ce0a72lu2l71lt2ls2l12ir2ic4eu0pe2lq0a02&amp;w=ib4lv2p02&amp;m=051c24fb3&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w7&amp;wm=1k2835&amp;n=Heavy%20Gunner) build I solo defend rad rumble no problem
---
That's what I have Sofia in at my camp but I was rocking it too but not any more, back to mountain scout for me
---
I've been launching 5-6 a night lately (can't seem to get the colossal plushie/head). I'd be happy to help you run one, or all. Usually takes me &lt;10 min per silo with "shortcuts".
---
Gt BushMo0kie
---
100% agree
---
You call them crazy but everything they show you was truth
---
Sounds like another console gamer post.
---
Religion has been historically used to wield power over people, using fear of the divine and retribution as scare tactics to control the masses. There‚Äôs also been countless religiously motivated murders. None of this is religion specific, there‚Äôs even violent Buddhists believe it or not.
---
Well done, we need more people like you and less gatekeepers.
---
I saw you out there, sir.
---
YOU FIGHT LIKE A RADROACH
---
You know that would be a client-side thing, not server, right?
---
Where does it say that???
---
Me too. There are so many good foundations that were laid with foundations.
---
Yeah I had a dick head one shot the cryptid boss as soon as it was vulnerable and then he laughed at everyone on the mic
---
some people are just shitty, lol
---
I feel you.
---
You'll never know how much I love this
---
Can‚Äôt be that rare.  Gotten several times through out all my toons.
---
I'm usually not a fan of cutesy cartoony looney outfits in the game. But this pic looks awesome.
---
Fair but I'm always light on AP in big fights since I don't think I'm optimized in my perks
---
I have to move the slider from my 1356 treasury notes to exactly 20 each day.  Smh
---
I personally reached the point where my camp started to look messy with no direction because I wanted to show of every piece of atom shop exclusive I gathered over the last two years. When finally scrapping it and deciding on a style (huge concer stage) I could finally give up the idea of showing of everything and rather make the camp look perfect in its own way.

No this isn't it

Most of them appear to be in the "aboutobe ghouls" category.

I do fine with my bloody build in there until someone runs in front of me and I die to the explosive damage of my gun hitting them.

Because the UK consists of dozens of cultures and dialects and several countries. Anal-retentive is definitely not a modern phrase, and it has been replaced by a much more common usage, which would not fit your sentence since it is a noun. Basically, type into google "anal definition". Your usage of it is not only the last one that shows up, but it literally says informal. Can you see why this might not be the best to use? It would be like me finding some extremely obscure, out of date and ancient definition of "cunt", like "Cunt- an extremely nice person" and going around calling people "cunt" and being confused when I get punched. Either use the full phrase "anal-retentive" so people know what you're talking about, or use a word that has existed in the last three decades.

We‚Äôve been asking for this for sometime now and they won‚Äôt do it.  Imagine the weight savings that could be had if we could get rid of all script crap every day!  Imagine how much more enjoyable player vending will become if all the scrip crap wasn‚Äôt cluttering the lists!  Please limit my purchases instead of sales!

Patch notes from a while back.
---
You should be able to verify yourself with the Awareness perk. Unequip weapon, vats target a mob. Equip, vats again. If it's more than 5% of no weapon then you have your answer.
---
And actually unequip (or use a weapon that is not AA and not  a perk card affected). Stashing the weapon (holding reload) still inherets the armor penetration in vats.
---
I haven‚Äôt been able to control myself out of PA.
---
Please tell me it was at Whitesprings
---
Riding Shotgun is solid. It's easy to solo since the amount of enemies you fight is scaled to how many people are doing the event, you get a guaranteed legendary, and the guaranteed pepperoni roll has a nice +30 carry weight buff.
---
yeah so did I

to collect "you have been insulted" notes, i would use them more than any other item collectrons gather nowadays

I only learn from the best! HeHe

If you turn the mouse, you can move the direction in which you run, I can make myself fully loop around and run back in the direction I was initially running away from.

---
Do you have the handmade plan?
---
As a long-term player I aplreoctwe what you're trying to do here, but I think we really shouldn't encourage low levels to do this event. There's not really ways they can meaningfully contribute, they're going to be constantly swarmed by Wendigos they can't properly damage, and forget about doing anything to Earle.
---
For a low level character, this even is even worse than the first time I went to a queen fight, which was horrible for me because my weapons didn't scratch the Queen and I kept getting killed by the small mobs. It was frustrating and awful.
---
For what it's worth I, a full-health no-Junkie Commando build, can barely scratch Earle, even at level 175 with an AA/FFR Handmade. I can't imagine how it would be for someone who can't even wield a Handmade. 
---
What I think we should be doing is leading these low levels onto a more fun path. They should be running the main quests and side quests until they hit at least level 50, for the love of Todd they should spec into heavy guns before they get emotionally attached to a rifle or pistol, and they ahould make sure to grab a full suite of damage-increasing perks along the way.
---
I recommend that we keep low levels out not because they hold us back, but because the event is just no fun for them.
---
I'll also reiterate what I said the last time I saw a post like this: I have never actually seen a low level at Earle, so I'm pretty sure we're in a good spot anyway.
---
OP, if you want to achieve most of your goal, you could drop your event rewards for low levels. That way they get the one thing low levels can enjoy about this event without any off the frustrating/impossible gameplay.
---
After One Wasteland, things may be better in there for low levels, but for now I'd rather save them the frustration.
---
No sorry
---
Anybody know when the ounce of prevention is going to be fixed
---
So fyi, we have the same problem at the end of Beckett's so far, not sure about the other Allies.
---
I guess I only have another 500 hrs before the boredom sets in. In the meantime, I'm trying to optimize my full health build/weapons to do more damage for ACP, experimenting with junkies build, stocking my vendors, leveling for legendary perks, looking forward to Season 2 and the BOS return and patch 22,  reading player complaints on reddit, etc.
---
Dude gtfo out here man, fucking troll....wtf
---
Someone in Bethesda was a Lilo &amp; Stitch fan.
---
If I was that guy I would of just used explosive bait on your entire base since you want to be a Fucken prick I would of been one back :)
---
Goddamn are you the worst kind of multiplayer person.
---
I am fine with that, I enjoy the PTS a lot.
---
Is it ok that I bring my level 24 friend?? I tell him that if he doesn‚Äôt do any damage then he‚Äôs getting kicked. And I also tell him I won‚Äôt revive him when he dies. But the reason he want to do it is because he‚Äôs trying to do a heavy build
---
Im looking for a few rare plans lmk my gt is Gypsynj hmu
---
yes.  Craft the underarmor, the lining is a mod to it.
---
I love helping low levels but the other day I had to solo earl because the only other guy was a lvl 30ish. Howed I solo earl well it was a hellish  10 mins of using 40+ super stims and using 6k 5mm for my magic mini gun which I hate using (and yes a magic gun is hard to use when 9000 windgo spawns are eating your ass) so long story short this is the first time I've wanted to reach through my screen and punch a low level
---
Do you have a circus wagon plan?
---
Mole Miners with loot pails and a random legendary weapon or armor. They carry big sacks on their back and make a noise that kind of sounds like a metal detector.
---
Would be grant if you could also forward them the issues with the wrapped cap
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ibp8v7/bethesda_please_fix_the_wrapped_cap
---
Happened to me other day.  Its how I learned I could solo Earl. =)
---
I offer you putting a bunch of scarecrows, it helps A LOT. The enemies often, especially molerats attack it and then I easily finish it off ü§î
---
Why arent they glowing with that much rads?
---
Ok yes this also happens on Xbox.
---
This isn‚Äôt gonna be what you want to hear, but sometimes less is more, you know? Not everything *needs* to be a cluttered mess of a house.
---
Wich is an awesome outfit but a bit too common
---
Are you referring to the treasure hunter event? Basically there are special mole miners all over the place you can kill to get special rewards.
---
That's true. I did it solo yesterday as a bloodied stealth commando using a bloodied primed handmade, nothing fancy.
---
Took me 10 mins because I died once, got hit one of those acid spits... but once I was on a good spot, the rest is just a matter of patience.  Wendigos didn't bother me, luckily stealth works fine on this event.
---
Oh cool
---
Why have everyone spec into heavy guns? That sounds like the exact opposite of fun.
---
You should put them for zero caps in the vendor. And have your camp nearby starter locations. People, especially high levels won't take any regular ones unless it's rare or they have alt account. I can already see it ü§î
---
I mean, getting 8 treasury notes for only ~10 minutes of work is pretty nice. 12 notes, if there‚Äôs already a nuke on the mine and go for the Queen first, and finish her before the mine closes back up on the outside.
---
I like to revive people at events, paying it forward for times when higher levels who don't know me from Atom have saved my behind.
---
I'm just waiting for the mole man uprising. Mumbles has amassed an arsenal of legendary weapons and armour. To what end?
---
Taking a whole new meaning for PC
---
Did not know that thanks!
---
Because it‚Äôs the sort of event that you need planning for, they should have just left it so you could trigger it
---
Timer starts on first kill, when you start first event or going into silo? If the 'killing' part is the only important thing then I think it would be manageable to kill queen and colossus within an hour from killing imposter.
---
The event description from when it was on back in May. Apparently this next time around the will be all over the map, not just in one region like before. Its like the Xmas Scorched hunt event. 
---
" it‚Äôs Open Season on ‚ÄúTreasure Hunter‚Äù Mole Miners, who have been observed surfacing in the Ash Heap to scour the area for riches. Head there to search for these special Mole Miners, and then take them down to claim their loot for yourself by picking up and opening the Mole Miner Pails they drop.
---
During the event, Vendor bots around Appalachia will also sell you Empty Pails for Caps. Use them at a Tinker‚Äôs Workbench to craft your own Mole Miner Pails that are full of loot. You can then trade them to others, or keep for them for yourself.
---
After a few days, the Mole Miners will realize you‚Äôve caught on to their activities in the Ash Heap, and they‚Äôll put their hoarding on hold. "
---
I can‚Äôt put any in the vendor as my stash box is full, and my camp is close to 76 but thanks for the advice!
---
I am bloodied and I don‚Äôt need to hide! I am heavy gunner power armor build and I am always stand in front of colossus and hitting him very very hard üòä I am very bad devil for colossus and never had die !Completed about 25 events so far
---
I had to move my CAMP after colossal came out. I was over a sweet lead deposit by Sunnytop Station. After two days my CAMP was caught in 4 bomb drops.
---
I equipped covert operative, mysterious stranger and someone suggested revenant. Didnt think it would proc with mysterious stranger. I run bloodied with PA and now i share team medic. Even If they don't rez me when stranger doean't proc, they'll be forced to heal me now lol
---
I also havw a magic shotgun for the wendigos, kills them in 2 hits but since i run PA the fusion cores go down faster because of vats
---
They really need a rework. So boring looking for that one dog that's ran off through the forest.
---
Should be more dangerous enemies. Why would I abandon a workshop to molerats? Now a pack of deathclaw or assaultrons...  I also think that if it is more than two waves then the last wave should have a legendary.
---
But the biggest change should be the enemies should just run straight to the red workshop the second they spawn. Full on agro mode. Stop putting the spawns outside the edges of the workshop, the enemies just stand around having a cigarette break.
---
Also mark all the enemies on the radar from the start. I want to enjoy holding the workshops but they are so boring when you can't find the enemies.
---
It‚Äôs called armor ace
---
Gotta love enclave soldiers
---
so, a Nazi and a Communist duking it out  hmmmmmmmmmmm i wonder what that reminds me of
---
I just want to praise glory to Atom.
---
Im still looking for the plan lol
---
Yeah, all donations had a 30 second cool down but most other things people didnt have ready that fast
---
Actual tip: I'm lvl 60, not that high but I have weapons that can deal damage to the colossus, but for the spawns use a db shotgun and VATS to easily kill them.
---
Wow I never knew that. Thank you, that changes some stuff lol
---
Well, my Commando build can't really deal damage to Earle. When we have people with Heavy Guns, he dies; when we don't, he doesn't.
---
As far as I can tell the only Earle or Queen viable build is Heavy Guns (though melee may work on Earle, I just haven't seen anyone do it yet).
---
Warde I'm almost starting to think this stuff doesn't belong to you.
---
Probably because while most of them seem to use rads to set their health low, given that the majority of player characters would have at least heard first hand growing up what the world had been, and while there probably are roleplayers on bloodied builds, I'm not sure it's common for the reasoning to be a Child of Atom angle.
---
Then again, I'm really bad at trying to run bloodied builds, so I probably don't know what I'm talking about.
---
I‚Äôll come!
---
In like 2 months when I‚Äôm lvl 100
---
Well, once you get it, I suggest you use it! It's really great!
---
Assuming spawns increase with players present, and my main issue is FPS, I just like 4 players or so all able to carry their weight so we dont get too bogged down by FPS issues from dead spawn
---
Indeed, many use it for afk workshop protecting for plan farming.
---
Sylvie and Sons Logging Camp. All wood, all the time.
---
Yeah it's not really existant and for good reason. In a game like this the PVP is inherently flawed with no way to balance power issues; it's absolutely bound to happen in a game where you're objectively stronger the more hours you put in. I'm level 70 or so and I generally dont like to fight anyone over level 100 or so because chances are very very high they just have a one shot build which is 0 fun to play against
---
Right! But probably won't get to the SS ghille level ha
---
Confirmed, had the same result with Beckett.
---
Do the ESO and other MMO thing, you loot a corpse and everything nearby is in the list. I‚Äôd go for an auto loot feature, too, and just dump/sell/scrap whatever instead of picking each individual thing per enemy
---
I'd like a power armor plushie
---
What is scrip
---
I put myself with my back against a wall...doesn‚Äôt matter if I get feared at that point.
---
I'm not sure it's outright "centuries" since only 2 centuries later they're pretty established, but yeah, thinking even the early phases of that Cult are likely not begun yet at this point.
---
Bringing a Tesla to ACP is just asinine anyway.
---
You have too many points in perception and charisma. Drop perception down to 3 and keep skeet shooter. Move some of those points to agility and luck. As a shotgunner you should be running enforcer. Put some points into better crits.
---
Your not wrong, and the two are certainly correlated, but in this case we just want to be powerful and do so without believing in atom.
---
I hate to be that negative guy but they can't even accurately track whether or not you have killed  The scorch beast Queen for the purposes of a challenge that gives you atoms...
---
Yeah, I noticed when selling that if I sell the item on the top of my list, it tries to raise to the next higher item. Since there's none higher on the list that's visible, it jumps to items on the prior list (item tab to the left). Mine seems to jump to notes, though, and most of those are not sellable so it stops.
---
Not only that if your actually brawling around and use headphones you want to be able to tell where the enemys are
---
Hats off to you, nice thing to do.
---
Not attempted this myself as a lever rifle build at level 118.
---
Or that one thief near buried mines
---
You can buy the plan off the vendor im Watoga but I guess it's rare and the plans also drop off the prison patrol event.
---
Vault-tec conspiracy theory!
---
I finished last weekend so I have a 3 or 4 week buffer before the next one. Id like to say i dont care and I kinda dont but Im weak and goal orientated so I daresay Ill be back cranking when it starts up again. I hope theyre a bit kinder next time round though, specially to casuals. I dont mind working toward a goal but it shouldnt feel quite so much like an obligation. Other games do it better
---
I‚Äôm going to report him to MODUS
---
Eh, some of them don‚Äôt take rads but others seem to be able to metabolize it so it‚Äôs kinda confusing whether it‚Äôs an adaption, a blessing from the Atom, or if it‚Äôs somehow involved with the confusing Interloper plot
---
The most enticing reward among lots of enticing rewards? Yeah I agree, it's awesome!
---
I'm sorry, that sort of sucks. Its alright, wish it didn't have the huge tire at the bottom
---
Download it as a separate game in Beth launcher
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 I can launch a nuke for me you and one of my friends
---
You are the Joker to our Batman. Gotham needs you
---
The rewards on this game always sucked.
---
I has the one with 20 bullets but the best armor penetration on my AA one and stinging on the others.
---
Same, it sucks cos they put 1 item that you're gonna want close to end so you grind for it. Then since youre at that point you're like May aswell finish the season.
---
I just want that green house building set. Bet it'll be a rank 80+ reward haha
---
The main issue is not even low lvl players. I played a couple of time with them. The main issue is the fact that players can't stack together in the middle of the room, as exemple. Players need to stack to getter to have a more precise fire power on the Earl and maximise the team dps. He actually needs to be relatively close to you if you wanna maximise your dps, so standing in the middle of the room near the consoles is your best option as a team. Once Wendigos pop in the room it makes it even easier to clear them as we happen to stack them near us.
---
I just melt the last 25% of Earl's health on my own, with my Bloodied Laser Gatling because these dudes were to busy fighting Wendigos in every corner of the room.
---
We were two lvl 259, one lvl 80 and one 91. And the other lvl 259 has been as useless than the other two players.
---
I'm not kidding...stack together guys !
---
There was a mattresses with a barrel tied to it as a backpack reward from the Meat Cook
---
It's only been out for a short while, I'm sure someone will place it on youtube eventually.  I've also seen some interesting game music on spotify lately, could check there too.
---
And not to nitpick but it is not bloody builds taking earle down so quickly, its "magic" weapons that dont rely on any spec or even perks, they bug out when used in vats to hit the same area multiple times in a short period of time dealing massive damage.  If you removed bloodied entirely from the game you would still have this problem, actually probably worse since the meta for high dps builds would then shift from bloodied to "magic" weapons.
---
I thought it'd be cool to move a space as a DAILY LOGIN, and the challenges maybe give *half* the atoms they used to (I know they'll never give back what we used to get.....).
---
That way people with commitments only need to log in, and if you want the atoms them you commit to the grind which is fair for those looking for more out of the game and have the time.
---
Arguably the closest the brotherhood ever gets to nazism is in fallout 4 but even then it‚Äôs just militarized authoritarianism. The nazi class simply comes from them wiping out super mutants and ferals without impunity which isn‚Äôt really being nazi when those creatures actively threaten everything in the immediate area
---
Well rested is nice but when u get start getting into the triple digits u need more then just well rested buff. 
---
U can join a public building team.  Give Intelligence- boost XP. 
---
U can use mutations like carnivore or herbivore and XP foods buffs will be double.  Pair it with strange in numbers perk in a group and it bunps it up another 5%. 
---
Then u got leader bobble heads, path of enlightenment quest for more XP.  
---
Give a run through west tek, harpers ferry, the burrows.
---
Even better to break the Season grind cycle!
---
If you don't want PvP (in its current form), don't take workshops.
---
I just felt like it really
---
I wasn't strong enough to complete Prime Cuts on my own, the timer ran out seconds before I finished the last kill.
---
But at the same time I also had people one shot the final beast a couple of times.
---
Both situations were frustrating as hell. But I don't really blame the players. Several posts recently have discussed having the drops be available to all people who participated in the event and I think that is a good idea.
---
They already have videos of entire thing with rewards. Green house is way towards the end.
---
You must not have a good weapon for a commando build, they usually deal more damage than heavy guns
---
Not sure if any of the names of creatures are used by actual in-game characters though, except for e.g. The Grafton Monster or Scorched. But anyways, nice knowledge of lore you have there
---
You don't even need to be standing.
---
Yeah thats pretty much top of my list. I cant actually remember now what the rewards datamined were tbh apart from the BOS Bunker. There were a couple of things I wanted though.
---
Are you on Xbox? I have spares
---
glassed cavern, around fissures, scorchbeast wings, mines, lode barring etc, ..
---
stuff is actually everywhere
---
If the legendary run was any indication these events will continue to be reasonably attended in the future during Seasons. It's because they are good sources of xp.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I'm level 703, a full health build that started experimenting with bloodied due to the XP bonus.
---
I see people at most of those events all the time.
---
It‚Äôs an instanced interior so there‚Äôs an 8 player max per group. If you‚Äôre the 9th player to show up you‚Äôll be by yourself.
---
Even better if there was a submerged X-Wing somewhere down there.
---
'Always with you what cannot be done.'
---
I just finished season 1 yesterday.  The current model is not at all sustainable.  People are going to drop like flies in season 2 unless it's very different.  I cannot imagine effectively starting season 1 all over again in like 2 or 3 weeks. Fuck that. I like BOS, but not that much.
---
Can we get ceilings? Just as wallpaper that goes on undersides of roof and upper floors.
---
The Sunny's are holding them all hostage. It's a dystopia.
---
That has consistently not been my experience. My friends with heavies always hit way harder than I do.
---
I use an AA/25/25 handmade, and it does up to 52 damage on a headshot when I have full Adrenaline. Even a whole clip of those does nothing to Earle's health bar, but when a friend draws a heavy his bar moves noticeably, and they can shoot for a lot longer than I can before a reload.
---
I've tried going Bloodied with a borrowed Bloodied Handmade. My damage numbers go down without the AA. 
---
From my perspective, it looks like heavies are the future.
---
yes, but if there‚Äôs 10 people in the server, and 8 people fits in the first group, the last 2 may not be able to kill Earle, event though they are trying their best
---
Equip the scrapper perk, clear out westek and collect and scrap their weapons along the way. One run can yield around 600 steel
---
Other than ammo converter and lunch boxes there was nothing on the board that was worth the grind to me.  I‚Äôm maybe level 20.
---
An angler, maybe?
---
I think it sucks that theres nothing to be gotten once you finish the Season. The SCORE should revert back to atoms again. Even if its less than it used to be. But Im completing SCORE now in the course of other activities and getting zip for it. I logged on today wandered around and realised I had no idea what to do so logged off again. If I dont have something to work for then there doesnt feel a point. If there were still some reward attached to the dailies Id at least keep doing them. I dont feel like theres a reason to log in now. And thats probably a good thing because some time away might refresh me for the next big grind
---
Also a great idea!
---
I literally felt relieved when I saw the rewards list. There's nothing on there I wanted so I knew in six game board tiles I was done for a few months.
---
Phew! :)
---
Make sure you check players vending for this if you dont want to farm the event.  I put 4 sets of the plan in my machines last night before I went to bed so I'd assume there have to be others doing the same.  Not my caps, so do as you like, but I wouldnt pay more than 150 caps for this plan or the rug, they are fairly common to get.  Loot table on Earle was poorly thought out.
---
Why should use of a particular item be banned? Bethesda should test and fix their shit before throwing at the public. They have a PTS don‚Äôt they? People are fed up of their shit not working and it‚Äôs not occasional anymore it‚Äôs every.single.update. This is not any players fault, it‚Äôs not the players who should be penalised, throw your ire at Bethesda.
---
It was very unlike an angler, it was grey and more tentacle like
---
What do you want to do? Damage with Sneaking or Tanking? VATS or ADS?
---
The mire is a perfect missed opportunity for Star Wars references
---
Cults are a very american thing
---
Pretty much. Most of this seasons rewards will never ever be used by me. The handful of things I liked were spread out the entire damn length.
---
They should collect insults and offer you nukashine pretending it‚Äôs a refreshing beverage
---
Oh yeah?  How do you manage that?
---
I feel 50% of the SCORE earned is added to the next season. Fuck even 25%. You'd start maybe a week ahead? Atleast it'd be something and make it worthwhile.
---
Put a nuka cola one that plays the nuka world jingle (instrumental) and I'm complete.
---
'Massive life form readings though....'
---
ADS, sneaking (would that work in ACP), full health as I‚Äôm accident prone
---
Some two weeks ago an other player which shop i visited just gifted me a vampires automatic handmade with limbdamage and faster reload and ideally modded for vats. just awesome. lead to modding all my other rifles on this character to automatic and perking to full commando. cant say THANK YOU VERY MUCH enough! :D
---
Frustration's gone. Sorry.
---
So i'mma make a video and link it here later. I promise !
---
Unlike encrypted, characters have to complete the event in order to complete the associated quest. I think we‚Äôll still see the event quite commonly, but not non-stop.
---
Also, I see radiation rumble happening rather frequently (with Players doing it), and riding shotgun doesn‚Äôt even appear on the map without a player activating it, to my knowledge.
---
Thanks everyone!
---
Seems to go to the highest DPS for sure. Only a few times have I seen him bounce between me and someone else.
---
Thanks üëç
---
I‚Äôve sent a friend request
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 I‚Äôll be on tomorrow but what level are you. I‚Äôm planning on farming Earle. Only 7 people.
---
I unironically use the Ghillie Secret service armour. It takes it of the menu for when I scrip stuff I wear outfits on top of it usually
---
They hide in the water with the tentacle thing on their head poking out.
---
Thank you üëç
---
Yeah that would at least be something
---
I got it dropped for me tonight on the colossus event :)
---
I've been using the **Nuka Girl Helmet** with the **Captain Cosmos Outfit**. It matches the **Space Monkey Backpack** (because the monkey dude also has a similar helmet with a similar sheen). This also allows me to wear the blinking **Prisoner Collar** and eye-wear underneath. The **X-ray Goggles** match the crazy monkey dude's eyes best. Rounding this out, I wear the **Wedding Ring** for a grand total of 6 cosmetic items.
---
And I look fabulous.
---
Yeah, they look like a lure reed. This was very different.
---
Nope Xbox but thanks
---
Are you me? This is almost word for word what I said to my friend yesterday
---
I'd pay scrip for rare mats in a heartbeat. In fact, I'd farm legendaries and buy them from camp vendors when at a reasonable price.
---
Just let them die, at least they can work as really shitty decoys
---
Is it just me or are they getting better with communication? The game is still a hot mess, don't get me wrong..but damn, I'm getting that impression.
---
If you're on PC I have a spare set of ultracite PA from that quest. Hasn't even been repaired yet.
---
Extra Crispy!
---
Go to a build planner site. These helped me out a ton when I first started. If you don't want to make your own build, there's a bunch of suggested builds on the sites too. I prefer [falloutbuilds.com](https://falloutbuilds.com) but [nukesdragons.com](https://nukesdragons.com) is good too.
---
Would be cool if Beth were sneaking new stuff in but the other more plausible answer I can think of is glitching scenery.
---
I remember hearing about a silent change to medics a few months back that really nerfed it. Can't recall any details though
---
The problem I had back when Bethesda took 60 euro from me for a game not even in a state of an early access, just to reduce the price to 25 euro a week after, was that fanboys actually defended them. 
---
To state Tod himself about this game, you can play as you want and be who you want and do what you want. I didn't expect this to be entire true, but the thing I was sure about when I heard him saying this, was at least to be able to swap my fucking build. If anything Bethesda games have done recently, is the fact that you can play what you want and equip whatever weapon you want, and this is the entire oposite of what they have been saying. I am saying that this is the reason I am quitting over and over again, this is my point of view.

 I don't wanna get told I am playing it wrong in a Bethesda game that is being promoted that I can play as I want. I have tons of other games worth my time compared to replay this game from scratch. You cannot be for real when you are saying that it's a healthy and clever game design to have to replay it all just to be able to equip a rifle on my character, which btw gives rifles to me as drops.
---
It also doesn't make sense that you should lose your strenght and swap it with a different special. At least give me option to just get another special so in case I in the future want to swap back to my shotgun build, I don't have to level another 20 levels again.
---
I don't know what is more sad, this build system or the fact so many are defending it. It's beyond my understanding. You know what? Give me a free respec seriously, I think it's worth those 60 euro I payed to beta test and bug reporting a tripple A game that was supposed to be 100% ready.
---
You definitely seem to be able to aggro him in my ~10 event experience.
---
I'm a heavy gunner as well, and I *highly* recommend the Born Survivor perk. Maxed out, it'll automatically use a stimpak for you at 40% health with a twenty second cooldown. It's saved my ass more times than I can count.
---
Combine with Lifegiver, field surgeon and first aid perks for maximum tankiness.
---
You're so anal :/
---
If it's alright with you I'll carry on using the language I was born and brought up speaking and which all my friends use and not change it so that some random internet guy feels less triggered.
---
I lolled.
---
Why. Just why. 
---
Don't forget your rolling pin while you're at it
---
they should just add more insults to the collectron bot and then theme the insults by the type of bot
---
So I am right? He aggros on the player doing the most dmg
---
Earls reward needs to be sent to our inventory automatically.  The way this event is setup it‚Äôs just asking for all these post.
---
&gt;nt guaranteed protection from diseases and gasses you need shit that's actually airtight and has some sort of filtration system or enclosed air supply, that's not something you're going to find from a cloth mask or a movie prop he
---
The same logic can be applied to all the gas mask and space suit helmet / Chinese Stealth Suit Helm in the Fallout 76 game if we want to discuss such topic in the detail - or does it not?
---
I hope you are not trying to convince us those space suit helmet / Chinese Stealth suit helmet / Gas Mask in Fallout had come with invisible life supply subsystem of any sort (which probably comes in a backpack form, so technically not "a part of the helm" itself) to provide the airborne hazard protection, not to mention the need to replace filter ... Metro franchise does cover this, but not in any modern Fallout game I'm aware of.
---
Now if we want to argue that those existing helm / mask / veil are bundling some mystic kind of life support system to enable those airborne hazard protection, then I don't see why a cosmos captain helmet can't do the same (unless you are telling me the cosmos captain is fighting evil force in a galaxy far far away without the need of breathing oxygen). 
---
Just want to point it out that I'm not asking something new; mask/fishbowl type of helm with airborne protection does existing in game long before the legendary run; costume gas masks coming from various event (such as the one from the Colossal Problem) do that without problem; excluding cosmos helmet from this kind of hazard protection will force players to use different kind of helmet in hazard environment, so just don't use it at all if they find switching between different mask/helmet a hassle.
---
Tons of games have this, that you gain xp for everything you do. Doesn't make sense to be able to get a card that make you pick twice the flowers just because you killed some ghosts. Or that you suddenly now after killing, can repair your weapons better. Non of this makes sense and more and more games rewards you for everything you do, but in different ways. You killing? Then here is some xp towards guns and survival. You picking flowers and crafting? Here is xp towards those.
---
It's an open world survival exploration and base building game. Literally. It's not hack and slash.
---
Both behaviors are toxic.
---
No, my base is south West of whitesprings, the nuked area was just east of the train station near Rose and the ski resort.
---
I swear I've seen one at someone's base in a pod
---
Why would you block the two most active chats then say chat isn't active? EU was never really used and was a place for non English speakers to type without clogging global. There aren't nearly enough people with the mod installed to have an active conversation in local (which has a small range anyway). Unless you're specially playing with people from the mod there's no reason to use local lol. If activity is your issue then encourage people to download it rather than shitting on it
---
I do enjoy the raider one wishing he could burn my camp down. Great idea though the insult bot is great!
---
Disagree. I get terrorized by Bloodied users on a regular basis
---
Indeed. I wouldn't mind someone nuking my base once in a while to change things up.
---
I done the event many times runs smoothly(PS4 pro SSD) except for that one time a clueless guy pull up a Tesla to tag. Luckily the event was almost done but I got so nauseous, had to just quit the game afterwards.
---
Yes. Stealth fixer and he will run towards me while I'm still hidden. Attacks others but agros towards me
---
Woah woah woah, we arnt going to destroy acadia are we?
---
Ok lol. Thought I was going crazy. I like it tbh. Now I don't feel back for getting downed by him constantly lol.
---
Go ahead, if it makes you feel better. My base is south West of whitesprings.... Have at it.
---
Allow us to pick an insult out of a big list and send it to a specific player
---
They're for Mutations, not Addictions.
---
I swear this must be a console issue. I've never seen or heard about pc players griping. Not saying it isn't justified, but that I never see it.
---
My bat ‚Äúdrunk midnight fun‚Äù and I are the backstory why he is always fixing it.
---
Sounds like a plan .. I‚Äôll move away from 100% energy weapons though .. that spin up time is a PITA
---
Probably not, I had agro for a while in my first fight and my dps was trash. My build was janky and I had no buffs, I was hitting his head for like 4
---
It's slippy out!  YEAH!
---
They're pretty clearly all early gen synths that have only been programmed to repeat the same half dozen lines anytime a human gets within hearing distance.
---
I mean, you're DEFENDING your workshop so...no...
---
Thanks dude! I got what I think is a good build
---
It is .. terrible against SB‚Äôs though
---
Imo you wasted a lot of time, because why play 3 Strength characters when you can just switch perks? 
---
Bloodied Heavy Gunner and Stealth Sniper
---
A jelly doughnut?
---
Not defending it at all when a feral ghoul is standing on the other side for an hour until I log off
---
You telling me a workshop can't be considered "Overrun" when I spend 12 minutes searching for one last molerat that got stuck behind a couch?
---
Sold a plan for 1 cap yday.. people on fb be offering legacies etc for them
---
Just like the SBQ.

---
This is the way that I'd build a base rifleman. You still have some points do add to your special stats and the mutations can also be adjusted to fit your needs. 
---
I recommend the Junkies legendary effect for your weapons as the penalty to being addicted is far less than the damage that you can do. If you do not want to be addicted to drugs however, instigating(2x damage when target has 100% hp) works just as fine with a rifleman build. 
---
As for armor, chameleon is really your best bet here seen as it allows for great stealth.
---
As another person mentioned, level doesn't matter. I've had friends who are level 200+ and don't really have an optimized build, and still struggle with high level super mutants and ghouls. I'd personally rather have a level 25 who is able to pull his own weight than a level 200 who dies every few seconds. For the most part a level 17 isn't good at events, but a lot of people like me who have several hundred hours in the game are capable of making low level alts that can dish out a lot of damage quickly. Even without a glitched laser, I still have plenty of godrolled low level items he can use.
---
I've done the fight about 9 times and he's done it every time expect once when a guy was using a magic gun witch melted him. Earle aimed for that guy.
---
They sort of developed that way over time , got fed up swapping perks so built them so I wouldn‚Äôt need to.
---
Never had the right perks when I needed them
---
Thanks! Now to lvl up
---
They take up a spot in the encounter that another who could help could be taking.
---
I don‚Äôt mind em but I‚Äôd carry at least one ballistic damage weapon and a energy damage one for different dr enemies. I‚Äôve heard good things about the plasma caster
---
Are you talking about like Nightstalker  and Snallygaster type of monsters? Those are Frankenstein type animals. And that‚Äôs why I said it shouldn‚Äôt take place in WV, it should be somewhere where there would more likely be one of these groups doing that.
---
How bout the trio of big John. Big bad John, little bitty big john, and cajuan Queen NY Jimmy Dean
---
Hey, I'd love to join for the nuke process. My in-game name is DarthKittie and I'm level 50 but still kind of a noob.
---
I beg to differ.  Tesla lag effect PC users even with beast machines.   Had a crew trolling events with tesla a couple days ago.  
---
My frames went to shit.   Did the only logical thing.  Nuked their bases.
---
Slot unlocks are account wide, Upgrading legendary perks are character specific
---
Well this is good piece of information. Glad to hear that!
---
Had a tight one last night, 4 of us 150+, 3 guys ranging from 65 to 114, then one dude at level 38.
---
I want to Deathclaw hunter hat
---
As far as my main's views on making sense of the word after Reclaimation Day, Mothman is an agent/tool/assistant/sign of The Morrigan.
---
So, one (character) firm believer in the Mothman as at least semi-devine, scaffolded onto stories growing up in the Vault not of "the world you're going to try to remake but better" but mythologies passed from both parents. (Celtic heritage is very common in many parts of the Appalachian chain.  Celtic folk music is probably the largest single ingredient in what became American Bluegrass and I'm getting way off topic, so I'll shut up.)
---
I had one of the scorched officers there last night. Just wandering around the middle of town with his backpack beeping and blinking.
---
There is a mod that shows all the values. Most of the camp items (walls, floors, furniture, shash boxes etc) take the same amount, 20 (out of 10k total). The biggest budget eaters are displays with items. Bobbleheads or magazines on the rack EACH takes 20. Weapon displays takes 20 for the rack itself and 60 for the weapon on display.
---
All light sources are costly too, 40 each. Every crop is 40. Any kind of sentry, brahmin and chicken coop are 200 each, insane. And you know that small steel letters, every letter is 20 too, like its a huge bed or something.
---
yeah the plasma caster is my go to on all the heavy characters who have got reputation, prefer it to the gatling gun which i used to use as a daily driver.
---
False, everyone knows that the Mothman is the herald of Ug-qualtoth.
---
That‚Äôd be cool.
---
They really need to add more fundamental RPG roles/abilities like tanks/taunting and healing
---
I made the horrible mistake of killing insult bot the first time I ran into it. It now haunts me and I swear I see it every other day coming to make fun of me.
---
Oh I like that.. I am glad my husband convinced me to go bloodied build. I love it.
---
maybe tie it to the event reward pool, a fixed amount given at event completion for making a revive during the event only
---
Tough enough for me to keep them alive, no time to try to get ore
---
Fair, I‚Äôve only done it 3 times and disconnected during the third, your information would be more accurate. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was topping dps or something but maybe I was the only one shooting him at the time?
---
I'm really hoping they're like freighter interiors in NMS. Just a small room, but you can add rooms and corridors and what not.
---
Turn on dmg numbers
---
I also though the timers where bit much first time playing. but with a switch from full unarmed melee to a full heavy gun  pA build that I can switch out as needed. Good to go now. Just rad back up after the event.
---
Bethesda, I would be your cash cow for this.
---
I think I need to complete every season. Once legendary perks launch those extra perk packs are going to be a huge boost to upgrading you legendary perk cards. The amount of extra levels you need to grind to make up for missing them is going to be pretty sizable. 
---
I might as well do my chores everyday now that I am in the habit and enjoy the little time I get off at the end of each season to just play.
---
Cool. I prefer spin up fast fire rate heavy guns and have no problem getting ammo for em
---
Yeah it's an unfortunate thing that it's not mentioned more directly. It's not unreasonable that it does that, just a pain especially for newer players that it's not obvious you're not getting the benefit you thought you were.
---
Ill quit using my Tesla when others play nice and let everyone get hits in on enemies at events.
---
Spoiler alert: Neither of these things will ever happen
---
If you put a piece of 15% block armor on, your quad shotgun will do I think full damage per pellet in vats (called a magic gun).
---
I have a friend who has one and it 1-2 shots level 91 deathclaws.
---
However, if you're not interested in magic and you just want a side-by-side quad and junkies, I would stick with the quad. They are reworking how damage is calculated and junkies is getting a nerf.
---
You monster.
---
Tried to solo project paradise. Dumped like 50 into a collector, never got past 0/3 rating for it and the other 3 collectors stayed empty.
---
Still got a few legendaries out of it
---
I said slots. Were you just adding to what I said?
---
I'm like 80% he does. I use mostly heavy Weopons with constant dmg. He only ever attacks others while I'm respawn.
---
you're probably foregoing on a lot of important perks for those 18 points, assuming the perks are maxed up. generally you want either strength or perception.
---
better to make a second character.
---
I think the max earl capacity per instance is like 8 and then it opens new one, it is possible you were 9th and 10th.
---
Most likely what you said but there is a legit melee bloodied build that you can do ~30k per crit on the queen, so I assume close to the same on Earle. It requires lots of buffs and extreme luck and skill because you 100% die if you get hit by anything. I watched a guy use a similar build tonight and he let everyone get their damage in, but he took down Earle in 4 swings. I even traded him after to check out his gear. Just a bloodied/power attack bear claw.
---
i don't know whats worse, a Synth or Children of Atom, both make me wanna shove a Fat Man where the sun don't shine.
---
Pricketts fort. Easy 500 wood with woodchucker
---
Holy shit, Thanks for the details. I have max out lights might have to rearrange them and lower the amount.
---
Oh shit..  is that a thing? That they open a new one after 8? Wtf!
---
This is one reason I'm still unsure of my like for multiplayer.  I'm level 81 but I still like doing stupid embarrassing things without an audience to it  LOL.  Anyway I'm way off this - I still escort Mr Messenger and guard those plants and take that body back to the grave.
---
So the old treasure hunter rewards are BACK? After i paid 20K caps for one plan...thinking it never comes back ? Why can't some rewards stay only for some time and never come back, making the plans worth a lot more this way?
---
The Glass Walls and Ceilings look fantastic. You gotta get way up in the Ranks to get them though.
---
Well, someone's triggered.
---
You act like I used some sort of exploit.
---
Well guess what? That's a game play mechanic. The nuke was put into the game for more reasons than to farm legendaries to sell for x5 their actual value.
---
The developers designed it for targeting each other, it was their main advertising gimmicks for having the ability to use in the game. Nuke teams, fight one another.
---
But now because you want to play the game as some koom baiya laser show in a ball of fire, dressed as two headed cows and unicorns, suddenly me playing the game as it was originally intended.... ONCE.... Makes me a massive cunt.
---
Right. Thanks for clarifying your position for everyone.
---
I think it's more meant to be a Fallout version of GI Joe?
---
I saw the exact opposite yesterday.   Guy looked like a slenderman.
---
I want to know this 5 min way ;p
---
used to be they were dependent on your armor class (light, sturdy, heavy) but apparently even after almost 2 years, a lot of people don't understand armor comes in three different tiers.
---
so they changed to that. a massive downgrade in my opinion.
---
Yeah. It's actually pretty useful for a boarder like myself who hasn't seen the number 600 in my stash inventory since I started.
---
Aye but it overlooks the key point: Bethesda doesn't want to give you stuff for free, they want you to give them money for stuff.
---
Bad luck it only allows 8 people and then creates another new event for the next 8 people witch was just you if you look up the event details it will explain it better than I have
---
Plot twist: the mailbox guy is the thieves' inside man.
---
One instance filled and you were the unlucky person to start a new one.
---
Oh my God this happened to me today too!! There were a team ofile 4 or 5 400+ players and I was like SWEET... nekmminut im solo and died a shit tonne of times before giving up. RIP
---
Flux is lost to the ether if you die with them on your person after you beat the SBQ.
---
I read that as you were meaning it per character, don't get you knickers in a twist.
---
yes please beth increase scip
---
Yes. Armor/Outfit displays were datamined.
---
Speaking of the fatigues, anyone know why some weigh 1.1 and some weigh 1?
---
Limb damage
---
Bash damage 
---
VATs hit chance.
---
How appropriate - you fight like a brahmin!
---
You never can achieve a perfect Utopia, Batman. You cannot have order without the chaos, I mean, c'mon, Bats.... How would you even know order without chaos, HO HO HE HEE!!
---
I can just imagine some dude just giving off a generic scream and hearing his bones snap üòÇ
---
Arrrghhh. So stupid! No wonder so many people are complaining about this 8 person rule!! Damn it. 
---
Does anyone know if you exit out and fast travel away, then try to enter again will that help or depends on the players on the server? 
---
Also, would not being on a team until im in the event help out or na
---
Oof. I had no idea
---
if you can't reliably solo Earle then unfortunately you'll have to depend on other people. maybe tweak your build a bit? or hope you get paired up with someone using a magic LMG.
---
I prefer to do it alone, this way I can manipulate the AI to my benefit. impossible to do that with multiple people running around and shooting at him.
---
you deserved the nuke then
---
Secret service arms and chest,  having zero luck with legs I want.
---
Looked through my stash and have a vampire handmade and lmg
---
Made a few gauss miniguns trying for a vampire one but then realized its 1 2mm round per shot and will burn through that ammo in 30 seconds.
---
Have a gauss vampire shotgun I use for big game like sheepsquatch when I solo project paradise not sure how well that would work
---
There are going to be people who agree and are unwilling to put in that much effort again...but who simply must have the rewards or just can't let it go unfinished because of their psychology...and Bethesda will be only too happy to let them finish by paying money.
---
Unyielding not bloodied, and do you only have one character?
---
Appreciate the help...an ATOM shop or upcoming season thing?
---
Yep. It sucks. So best store all your junk after you receive them...but make sure you clear up mobs before you do so...I‚Äôve made the mistake before and ran straight to a tent to store my stuff..not paying attention to creatures on the way there...of course they kill me. üòÖ
---
I also do radiation rumble as much as possible regardless if I'm alone or not. I go for the loot, xp and most time I get multiple legendary stuff. That's easy script to me. When I'm in a group, I wave to try and get the other players to come but, if they don't come by the time my 4th wave ends (pending on how much time left to start the event) it's there lost. I'd rather fail doing it alone than fail with several players there.
---
Is anyone else interested in a communist vendor?
---
No absolutely not. Using the budget to it's maximum does not even slightly mean that your place is a "cluttered mess". I set up a shanty town on a bridge that consists of a multiple buildings. Each one is neat and themed and very cool but my budget is maxed out. 
---
Just because people have hit max budget doesn't mean they just made a cube and put 800 Santa Crashes inside
---
Bunker and greenhouse are a must for me so here we go again... on a side note I thought the apparel mannequins and power armor displays were gonna be rewards for season 2 but Beth was smart to save those for atomic shop it seems. Gonna spend some on those.
---
Where's the fallout twist? Fallout always have a dark twist. Do the robots attack you? The anticlimactic version sounds more like fallout than some pomp and circumstance.
---
Bethesda: ‚Äúthe team is definitely looking into this‚Äù
---
when season 1 started I was more or less ignoring it but about 2 weeks in decided to take it seriously. never again.
---
these inane chores sucked all the fun out of the game for me. I'm actually playing less since this stupid thing started.
---
Lol, I only just got down to 632 today. It'll be back up soon enough.
---
All I'm doing is bulking and selling to bots for caps. I'm frigging farming and I'd simply like to have an alternative use for all the excess besides turning into a full time merchant.
---
Have a nuke coming but a good spot? Leave the server? Maybe I won't. There's my new challenge for the day: rebuild in the middle of a nuclear fire.
---
Not everyone wants to play stealth or cheese the boss. I really don't in my melee build
---
This was the second time Meat Week happend. I am pretty sure of that. Correct me if I am wrong.
---
Mod it according to [this source](https://fed76.info/a/zerovats/)
---
But yeah, you want quick or swift.
---
This. I got 18 collections from the woodpile at Helvetia alone.
---
This!  I'd give my last piece of Bacon to a dying dog to ensure he goes out happy.
---
HOW DARE YOU COME INTO MY CAMP AND INSULT MY PUBLIC TEAM.
---
I went in last night and it was just the three from my team, looked at the map and saw 2 others as well in the area, but they werent with us. Seems like it splits the people at random amounts, not just 8.
---
It‚Äôs happened 3 years in a row and it happened every year so that‚Äôs 3 times, but some guy on Facebook is claiming it happened 4 times in 2019 which sounds like BS as I was playing during that time
---
[obligatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NFv5IGP2uA)
---
My recollection is there have been 3 meat weeks.
---
I started playing in Jan 2019, did not get to participate in the first meat week b/c I was badly over encumbered and never in the correct area - IIRC, this one did not happen in a fixed location, but in random spots around the map.
---
MW 2 happened, had weight under control, was fixed outside Vault 76, and could participate.
---
Last weeks events were my 2nd active participation.
---
&gt;8 Treasury Notes, 
---
everybody already have to many of them XD
---
&gt; 100/200 caps per average, 
---
caps are worthless :V 
---
&gt;i wouldn't call it "bad".
---
true its worse then bad 
---
the amount of ammo spent on this event is already worth more then its rewards :V
---
That's so frustrating.. why not just let us all in? Teamwork makes the dream work haha
---
I thought that he went for the highest DPS until i ran in with a two-handed melee build. In the event there was at least one or two bloodied builds. Everytime i got close to him he would aggro on me. The char i went in with is lvl 71 and the max damage i was doing to earle per power swing attack was 300, still working on build. I just find it hard to believe I was doing most dps. Is it possible he aggros on closest detectable regardless of DPS?
---
Finding a few pieces of gear which knock 20% of chems, ammo, or food/drink is good, IMO. It saves perk point which I can use for something else.  
---
Herbivore means I can save it up and sell it.
---
I just noticed that sometimes dmg is around 600, others 300... Prolly they detect me and I loose the 2.5x buff
---
They have us by the balls either way.   Play the season to get a meager stipend of atoms or buy atoms for money or buy first for atoms.  Either way Bethesda wins.  I guarantee you the atomic shop is going to get a lot more interesting with enticing items around the time season 1 ends or season 2 starts.
---
Couldnt imagine it being like the sbq in that small of an area. Seen an entire server show up to the sbq, likely trying something new to "help" with people ensuring a drop.
---
You can clip through doors, walls and laser grids using power armor or photomode.  There are quite a few videos that show how to do it.  If you clip through the right doors you can be at launch prep in around 1 minute.  It ends up being the only part of the silo you actually need to do.
---
I don't think so. There was 2-3 melee builds there and he hit them both ran past them and straight for me so idk
---
I think it's a bit of a glitch between outfits weighing .1 and under armor weighing 1 and it being changed back and forth but I don't really know
---
I'm waiting for it, that's why I'm there. But my base is just always on the edge of the nuke zone. Nobody ever just clicks a little more to the left and down..
---
Come on, give it to me. I've been playing since two weeks before Wastelanders and not once have I had a nuke my way, I even ran into an explosion at the SBQ this week just to see wtf it was like.
---
I need it hard baby. I need my nuka cherry popped.
---
sneak multipliers don't work in events like ACP and scorched earth, by the way. you can remain hidden, assuming you build your character and gear properly, but your damage will be the same as if you were standing.
---
that's because sneak multipliers don't trigger if your target is in combat with anything else, including players. so unless you're soloing Earle in a private server, something you'd have a hard time as a rifleman anyway, you won't be seeing that 2.5 multiplier.
---
Melee does work I guess since I've seen one guy solo it with a power fist, no clue what he was running aside from no pa and marsupial
---
Ouch. I just jumped on bloodied builds for the ops missions and colossal problem. Besides those I‚Äôm just a reg lol
---
Would love to be able to send it to other peoples camp.
---
A communist collectron? There is one
---
Don't do it anymore tho cus everyone's seemed to calmed down and it was giving me too many legendaries lmaooo
---
8 people per instance.
---
If on a team, only 1 member needs to get in to 'reserve' spots for however many others are on that team ( 2- 4). Regardless of them joining it will hold their spots.
---
So if on another team, and your team member does not join, you will need to leave team to join event. If no space in that instance will place you in new instance, Hence you were alone or with few.
---
TIP: You can hover cursor over event marker when active and just move it slowly around event marker edges. You will see different instances show up with number of players in it.
---
Ha, always loved that.
---
This would be great, a collectron that only collects Nuka Cola. I would absolutely buy this.
---
Alright, fair enough. I played most of last year and can't recall that. 
---
But my memory isn't as good as it used to be apparently.
---
I play my low level since it was in it's 20s and now its almost 40. Never failed once. I help with the wannamingos, sorry, wendigos.
---
? I placed a bunch of stuff in mine and it is not floating. I've seen this mentioned before though and wonder if it has to do with your placement of the bunker maybe.
---
That's a very popular camp spot. The road going alongside Pleasant Valley station is some of the flattest ground you'll find in the game. There's also a junk pile there, and an acid deposit not far away too.
---
I'm camped in the vicinity myself, but closer to Big Fred's BBQ Shack. I haven't been hit yet, thankfully.
---
I get that, but at least team people up with others so we don't die solo and alone lol
---
It‚Äôs not a lvl problem it‚Äôs a people problem and there‚Äôs no fixing that unfortunately. It‚Äôs just a game only pixels but there are people who take it way to seriously. At the end of the day the only solution is the block button.
---
Yes, along with PA displays including one being an award from the new season.
---
I've done it 5 times and killed him in 5-10 minutes each time with out problem. The last time even had a guy using a tesla which apparently is really bad down there
---
No a vendor. Like the Slocum Joe vendor. I love the communist collectron, and now I want a communist commissary lol
---
Good point about the perks packs. Just finished the run last night. Good news is that I feel like I can take my time in Season 2 and still get pretty far in the ranks.
---
Sadly I'm on PS4.
---
Surely they wouldn't sell anything? It's all for the party
---
Twice last year is what I remember.
---
This is how I will become the most Wanted player for the murder of countless collectrons.
---
I thought that as well, I placed it as far into the ground as it would go, and placed it as high as it would go.
---
One time I too accidentally killed it, he was caught in the crossfire, poor sou- ehm algorithm
---
This would be its purpose.    
---
We should also send BGS suggestions for insults so the person who voiced it can make the audio. I would work on getting some caps for that.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be selling. It would be sharing for a price.
---
Can't remember where I saw it...
---
You'll be even more disappointed that a similar bunker will most likely be an item in the next season board for free
---
What tab are treasury notes under? Do you only get them after doing a certain quest cus I don't think I've gotten any
---
Once you finish the wasetlanders quest line
---
There are literally dozens of us.
---
It never even popped up for me the rest of the night :(
---
Which is why you use a vampires heavy gun of your choice and completely bypass the problem entirely. I've been rocking a Vampires Ultracite Gatling Laser and the only time I am open to take damage is when I am reloading. Even that is a non-issue because with marsupial and bird bones in the time it takes me to jump and land I can do an entire reload in midair. 
---
Been comfortably sitting at 15% HP for each ACP by using that Ultracite Gatling and a Psychobuff for the extra health as a cushion for when I lose control of my character because our Colossus friend decided he wanted to scream.
---
Project paradise is the only one on this list that no one comes to.
---
I always have Appalachia on. I like the songs and I like listening to Julie. I wish we‚Äôd add a new song or two in on occasion, but it‚Äôs got a good mix.
---
I'm on Xbox, and I haven't seen a floating issue in the other two I have entered in. Could it be you are on something else and there is just a bug that needs to be addressed for those systems?
---
Eh, the atoms don‚Äôt bother me. This is the only game I spend money on.
---
Oh ok. When can you start trading with sam?
---
Yes, but the prices need to be different than the other vendors, with simple stuff being even more ridiculously expensive.
---
Everything is basically free in my vendors... I would totally buy this, comrade.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4... could be
---
Last week I was doing some Daily down in The Cranberry Bog (I think it was the Remove Squatters one) anyway, I was in this shack, and I hear The Insult Bot outside, I'm killing Scorched so I didn't have the chance to go down and collect my insult right then. A few minutes later I'm done, I get my reward for doing the Daily and I set off and I can see the Insult Bot in the distance (honestly, he's not that far away but eh poetic license) so I figure, why not? I have no idea how large Bethesda's Insult bot database of insult is, but I frequently get one I hadn't heard before.
---
So I chase after him, and once I catch up to him, I activate him, waiting for the day's zinger and he says "Sorry, I am off duty. Try again tomorrow" or words to that effect.
---
I'll admit, out of all of the insults he's hurled at me over the past almost two years, this line surprised me the most. 
---
The idea that Insult Bot is just like an average Joe, punching a clock and when he's off duty he couldn't care less about his "job". I love it!
---
Wah I cant be carried if I have to carry people!
---
I've done hunter, crossbow and athlete ones in all my characters.
---
Your service to the party is noted.
---
After you finish the wasetlanders quest line.....
---
Wow thank you for the in depth reply! I'm going to figure it out and add these for sure.
---
What I find funny is you running around with the second most OP commando gun and have no clue, stay stealth move around and learn your environment. You have the right gun do Solo Earle in a few minutes and have 30 min to your disposal. Never sneak out in the open area if you don't know exactly where every hazards can spawn. Don't stand still because Earle spits at your direction even if he can't see you.
---
The communist bunker, doesn‚Äôt have any marking, that I can see that make it communist themed, except the door is called Communist bunker door
---
K
---
The legendary armor perks were removed in the PTS though?
---
&gt; Does anyone know if you exit out and fast travel away, then try to enter again
---
If you leave, you can't re-enter. It's a one way trip if you bail.
---
Were they? I didnt know
---
I keep my raider collection for just this reason.
---
Sometimes, I think about burning this CAMP down.
---
I would pay 1200 Atoms for a pack of plushies that include the following: Scorch Beast, Chally the Moo-Moo, German Shepherd dog (FO4 easter egg) Grafton Monster, Yao guai, Deathclaw, Mutant Hound, Fog Crawler, Mothman, Angler, and the Sallygnaster.
---
Lol, it's literally been all over here for days.
---
Yes they are coming, anyone else wondering what's going to be wrong with them yet lol?
---
I'm either going with they delete the armor after you log back in, they walk away like the skyrim ones do or there will be some kind of glitch/dupe bug and they get taken off again
---
I guess we know now how they began.
---
He actually had the invincibility bug :/
---
Red health bar, not moving, not taking damage
---
Yes but you ruin FPS and create lag for everybody making the game unplayable
---
This was implemented quite a while ago because some people always tried to bait/trick others into pvp after SBQ fights so they could loot their flux.  There are almost always some 1st tents in the area after the fight, so it is a good idea to store at least the flux in your stash.
---
You get them from events (exclamation mark) and from dailies from both factions, along with endgame bosses.
---
You must complete the wastelanders main quest tho.
---
Those are listed under "various".
---
I'm assuming colossal problem event is fixed and wont end soon?! so new players still have time to get there priorities in order before doing the event, getting to know the military strategies makes you tough and can handle anything that the wastelands through at you.
---
I don‚Äôt get it why u getting downvoted
---
I‚Äôm chillin man. Just a misunderstanding
---
That's what I get for expecting the game to provide me with necessary gameplay information, rather than scouring Reddit. Shame on me I suppose.
---
Because life is a constant stream of disappointments.
---
What we need is player guilds so I can be in a *real* Mothman cult and go on purging raids against those false believers who keep shooting at me even though I am clearly wearing their gear.
---
Wise Mothman one true God.
---
Nice I hope they got their camps destroyed
---
Thanks for the tips!! Hopefully I can try again tonight if someone does a nuke!
---
Requisition officer
---
Did you expect more from Bethesda? Lol
---
I don't hold down the trigger and empty the whole 60 round clip.  I shoot it in bursts ONLY to tag enemies once.  This does not create lag and FPS drops.
---
Dang that's annoying. Good to know! Thanks
---
Good to know! I was wondering how I could beef up my stats a bit =)
---
Yep, I'm already skipping it, just not worth the time/effort and I haven't yet gotten anything worth keeping from it.
---
I wish there were some violet flux in that area though so at least I could go farm the nuke cloud :-/
---
He's a liar and got dozens of osmosis kits!
---
You sir, are my favourite person right now! I guess I'm gunna go watch some videos and do some learning haha. Cheers!
---
Most likely but it did seem quite intentional
---
I have the red rocket bar and setup a liberator lamp by a terminal sitting there like a cashier near the vendors
---
Looks great to me
---
Stop and think. Would Bethesda monetize such a thing?
---
Then, start saving your atoms.
---
No.  You will be fine.
---
I mean 70% pen is still really good but yeah that's considerably less than I thought I was getting
---
I had the insult bot turn up at an event in front of 3 strangers. Can confirm it is far more humiliating than a solo ripping. I also shot it in confusion, outrage and shame. Looking back I can see it was an inappropriate reaction, he was only doing his job SMH
---
If you can come here to complain, you can come here to learn. Don't get mad at us because we tried to help you
---
Can you? Probably. Will you? Probably not
---
Why is everybody calling them toons all of a sudden instead of character
---
There are never enough plushies, never
---
I have they weapon. It works for me even on my own.
---
Strange.
---
On the contrary, my house isn't all that fancy and it's at max budget because of having to layer two walls to place wallpaper properly.
---
Yeah, after initial player feedback. There‚Äôs been quite a few changes actually
---
Ps4. Tried 6 or 7 times, completed each time. You've definitely had some bad luck there.
---
\*angry upvote noises\*
---
I learned that lesson the first event I ran. Looted Earle, but missed out on the event rewards.
---
The second run, I died with a 60 second respawn timer right before Earle died, and respawned outside of the mine, so got the event rewards, but didn't get to loot anything.
---
That's understandable. I would like to see the final list of legendary perks though before they release them
---
The poison and fire resist perks still require a matching set of armor.
---
He used exploits
---
Is ti just me or hase the game crashed a lot recently?
---
Unfortunately my current character is level 73 so I don't yet have all that offensive capabilities, so I try to rely on stealth attacks (stealth commando) so I can deal a good amount of damage.
---
I try and keep the wendigo spawns away from the other high level players, so that they don't have to stop shooting at Earl and revive everyone as soon as they go down.
---
I am still far from being able to complete the event by myself unfortunately
---
Ha ha!
---
Dont disagree. May have sometjing to do with the public team you are on. The group we saw at the run was in a full building team, and we were too. Although only two of the other team showed up and the three of us.
---
If you're really that worried submit a ticket explaining what happened so at least it is on record.
---
Thank god. The RNG still isn‚Äôt great from what I hear but at least it‚Äôs better.
---
As we've seen with the Secret Service armor and gear grind, it's still a pretty long road to get the specific effects you want.  And that's fine.  You'll likely go through dozens of crafts.  But knowing you can get the effects you want on that specific piece *eventually* is what's important.  Right now, the system is so heavily RNG that completing a specific set is practically impossible without relying on other players.
---
Did it last night, and farmed the flux for it!  Thanks!  Now just gotta grind out the rest
---
I love this post! If you don't fill up with 7 low levels and want some help or if you have more and want to bring a second group, I'd be glad to help with the CET run! I love helping new/newish players out!
---
I laughed out loud when my Raider collectron told me to get out of his way today... thats what I get for standing near his station I get
---
He's got some sass to him
---
I disagree. The difference with all of those is they all have some other arguably tedious task(s) you have to complete in addition to killing. Be it shaking a shepards crook, rescuing friendly creatures, mining ore or holding a pylon... With A Colossal Problem, you just need to kill.
---
Personally, I like the additional challenges, however most people don't partake of these events either because they don't want to deal with the extraneous bullshit, or they feel like no one else will so why bother?
---
Because people don‚Äôt realize that Tesla‚Äôs don‚Äôt do anything to assist in the event.
---
Sure, they can tag the spawns, but they are only doing that to get the loot.
---
I did the same when I was a low level.
---
I was at the SBQ event and I was like what the Fuck am I doing here?
---
Came back when I was high enough to do something useful.
---
I agree ,there should be a cap at minimum lvl 80
---
Using perk cards should never directly reduce the effectiveness of a positive game mechanic.
---
+10% damage per mutation, maximum of 3-4.  
---
There‚Äôs no need to make it overly complex.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know Bethesda had one of those. I‚Äôll be sure to if I get my account back.
---
The effect works per pellet so is great with shotguns but fairly crap for most other things.
---
Yeah, and having it in game would be cool too
---
That makes sense, I just couldn't think of a good way to have another draw back. I like the idea of it being 3 or 4
---
Oh wow I didn't know it's coming back.  Where is the schedule for things like this?
---
I've actually got a bunch of vampire heavies for one character but haven't even played the event with that one. It means I'll be using much more ammo but also dying a lot less, if at all though
---
With psychobuff though, when it wears off on my bloodied characters it seems to quickly drop the health buff down before resetting it to its original pre-buffed amount, killing me in the progress. You might not notice that with vampires weapons constantly healing, but just thought I'd let you know
---
The only reason I did radiation rumble (even though I think it‚Äôs a fun event) was so I can get that radiation barrel. I‚Äôve done the event about 20+ times and never got it. 
---
The other day a random guy at the meat cook wanted to trade. I had a lot of spare cow outfits and cow masks and he requested it. I realized the had the plan for the radiation barrel. I offered the outfit and mask for free. Hoping that would make him consider selling me the plan. I would‚Äôve been fine if he charged me 100-1000 caps. And he gave it to me for free. 
---
So luckily I have the plan I wanted. I don‚Äôt really need to do that specific event ever again.
---
Should be able to find it at Whitespring.
---
Dat underwear tho
---
The game has not been out for three years. We aren‚Äôt even at the end of the second year yet.
---
Ohhh wait, you‚Äôre talking about funky duds and sizzling style. I thought you were talking about the initial armor perks from the early iterations if the legendary perks, woops lol
---
I'm having trouble with all my medics weapons. Been happening for over a month now. Had to bench him until its fixed.
---
Why does it have to be the Atomic Shop? Why can't we request this as in-game content or something to be added to the next Legendary Run?
---
Here's a medal son üåùü•á
---
Never stop flexing!
---
This game came out 2018 lol.
---
The game wasn't around 3 years ago.  The first Meat Week happened last summer.  According to the wiki, it happened twice.  Then, there was the one that just finished.
---
I can personally attest that it happened twice last year, because the second time around was considerably less interesting than the first.
---
Yes I am talking about funky duds. That perk alone would be super helpful for the SBQ and ACP
---
I see where you're at, but honestly, I think there'd be some magic lost in one you can see all the time. It's special when you first find them.
---
Now if you want it to insult other players, that's reasonable.
---
Oh it did.  Dude never fixed it so I hope they didn‚Äôt have materials to.  Lol
---
I regularly draw aggro, and he ignores everyone else around me.
---
I'm fairly sure it's based on damage. Commando build, and I'm hitting him for 70-80 dmg per shot with continuous headhsots
---
Loot guns &amp; use Scrapper perk on a ton of them if you didn't already know
---
That and he collects chems and booze
---
I have always tried to play each character a different build/style. My secondary character started as a rifleman then a commando and I went pure heavy guns, now I have a hybrid. [This](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e643e78&amp;w=sr2s32sq2sg2s01pl0pk0pd0ee2eu0cu0ce0cr0pp2id2ir2ic4a12a00ip2lu2lt2l71an2) is one of my hybrids for heavy rifleman while in PA, my other is dropping stabilized for serendipity. I prefer living in PA with a bloodied build having dodgy and emergency protocols makes you feel so tanky.   
---
I only use my rifle as an opener though and the sneak bonus makes up for the lack of 3 stars in perception.    
---
Overall it has been effective but it is not perfect and it is not min/max, it is fun though and it adds variety.   
---
Also testing a 1 star perk style heavy/melee I love my bloodied swing speed str cattle prod. It kills level 68 scorched in 1 hit without perks, so perks could be overkill but requires a bit of testing.
---
Exploit game first started there was a glitch that would jump you 5 lvl or more each time you did it was very easy to do. I didn't do it myself as I wanted to earn my lvl .
---
There are some rare plans out there. If you ever encounter the Responder Vendor Bot out by the Charleston train stop he should sell the Nuka Cola Clock and Cuckoo Clock plans. If you are lucky he may also have the Hunter's Long Coat or the clean space suit!
---
It has happened three times now. 
---
- August 1-8, 2019
---
- September 26-October 3, 2019
---
- August 20-26, 2020
---
Basically, once you complete the vault raid, and decide how to split the loot, you gain access to the gold bullion currency. At that point, you unlock the earning and spending of gold bullion.
---
Meat Week did not happen in 2018.
---
Not enough people were playing it so they got rid of it and added Nuclear Winter instead.
---
Same. It bugged out on me a lot! When I went to the meat cook the one time it literally ended and failed as soon as I spawned there! I missed a lot unfortunately.
---
Hmm good point. Next time I'll go in without a team and team up once I'm inside... ahh what joys we have playing fallout eh?
---
Are the plans in the chest? Cause I have yet to make it out and find that in time
---
Easily spent ten minutes looking for a mongrel only to realise the stupid thing was stuck in a dumpster that I had to scrap in order to kill it. Next wave, it‚Äôs cousin had the audacity to get stuck in the dumpster next to the first one.
---
It wasn't popular enough to keep the servers going. So it was cancelled. Most FO76 players are more interested in helping each other.
---
That's suck a great idea!
---
Try fast traveling. I do the same with my floating camp all the time
---
Okay, that makes sense.
---
I see now, my bad. I haven‚Äôt used those myself- I‚Äôm a bit of a sucker for the utility ones (ammunition factory especially is gonna be tasty maxed out, stacked with ammosmith n super duper)
---
Yeah, I did complete it. It could be my hardware is not processing as fabulously on top of the external issues on Bethesda's end. I have an Xbox one S one floor beneath my wireless router.
---
The pixelated graphics would be charming if it weren't for the fact that it can be indicative of overload to the point of crashing (which has happened to me a few times with SBQ events) or artifacts indicating graphics card failure. (Which is highly unlikely but not out of the realm of possibility.)
---
No need to be mean, people are just playing a video game and trying to have a good time. The game itself isn't great about explaining that only 8 people can be there at a time, or the recommended level
---
I did this as a low level with my best friend. Extremely had and fun.
---
I made a vastly on popular post not long ago comparing the hardcore bloody user to a cult in the sense that I'm constantly trying to be indoctrinated by them telling me my build could be better.
---
Or.... now here me out..... 1 gigantic food crop.... You see how farmers produce giant pumpkins for fairs and festivals? I say give us the ability to produce 1 bigass tato, mutfruit, corn. Granted it would take much longer to produce but it would yeild 10x the product for lets say 2x the normal budget for a regular crop.
---
I wish they would do this. But they won‚Äôt. They want you to hoard. They want you to buy fallout 1st for more space. Anything that will deter anyone from fallout 1st will never be implemented. In fact, they‚Äôll probably make things even shittier from here on out to try and boost fallout 1st subs. I wouldn‚Äôt doubt it if they raise the price of fallout 1st a couple bucks and add some more stash space to entice even more people.
---
GRAHAM IS FRIEND.
---
GRAHAM LOVE HUMAN.
---
and allow us to spend 100 caps to send the bot to a random player
---
and for 250 caps you can pick which message
---
and for 500 caps you can pick which player and message. it would be a nice, fun, and funny cap sink
---
Aww yes I remember destiny when I could join the end game raid with oryx when I was sill at the stranger mission...
---
Wait..I couldn't.
---
With good reason.
---
If you can solo Earl,the game is definitely broken. Anyway. I'll be at my camp farming my ammunition factories.
---
It was removed in October 2019. 
---

---
Ricochet is a perk you want to try on the luck special
---
Alright. Well damage is damage anyways, I‚Äôll still hurt it when I get to lvl 90 or whatever the recommendation for ACP is
---
in case you aren't aware, sneak multipliers don't trigger if your target is in combat with anything else. including other players.
---
Just curious if this cowboy merch moving?selling?
---
No, I do not get into lots of arguments about out of date phrases. Again, I'm not triggered, you just can't handle being a dingus.
---
I don't remember for sure. I have only done it twice and one of them did have a Tesla for sure.
---
In this particular instance, I was far away from Earle and other players being beaten on by several Wendigo Spawn.
---
Mhm it is also nice coming across other players who genuinely want to learn more about the game as well
---
Oh I alreqdy do that, I have like 2k Steel but I‚Äôm waiting for the perks to gib more ammo
---
I use a JE Western to smoke low levels and save 45 ammo. But generally speaking, not one bit.
---
Glad I could help. Anyone that says they‚Äôve played through four meat weeks is... mistaken.
---
Viable yes, meta no. Next patch they will be able to benefit from the tank killer perk card meaning they'll get added armour penetration which will make them abit better.
---
Same happens to me but there was 4 guys w me before the mine opened up they all took off.i took his health halfway twice before I ran out of 308 and died..smh
---
I believe it was being used by players as private servers, camp it long enough and everyone else left. So they found a way to recover investing in a game mode noone really used and just made them into private worlds w fo1st. 
---
At least thats my opinion on how it happened üç∫
---
Don't forget Calmex, Overdrive or Psychotats and Ballistic bock. And if you don't have max sneak perk card, take with you smoked scorchbeast lung(carnivore mutation) or steeped Melon Blossom Chai(Herbivore mutation) And look up for optimal Commando perk and mutations build if you don't have one already, good luck!
---
Played it the first time this morning.  I was in a team of 4 and I think we were all in the same event.  We had no problems taking him down.  No glitches encountered, no lag, no issues.  I had a blast.  I was level 250 using a stealth commando build at full health and using vampire weapons.  My other team mates were heavy builds.  
---
I just followed the team to the start location and after we killed Earl ran to loot his body and then followed my team to the loot box and then out of the mine.  So, I was lucky to be on a team that had done the event already.
---
I‚Äôm on xb1, and things float in mine.
---
Yeah its a pain in the azz finding a place flat enough for it to sink into. They should have made the foundation larger like how there are two versions of the Greenhouse domes
---
Oh c‚Äômon don‚Äôt cheese ol Williams! He deserves a fair fight put on your big boy pants and fight him like a man! All joking aside, I love Earle but after several events it‚Äôs already monotonous.
---
I only use my tesla in Uranium fever, to tag around corners.
---
OK, maybe in feed the people, cause I can cover two consoles at once with it.
---
I normally use a gauss shotgun uncharged to tag in Line in the Sand, but when I start seeing people use energy weapons or plasma (ash and goo makes it had to loot), I break out the AutoGrenade launcher.
---
What mods can I use on the 50.?
---
Not really. The nerf will make them even worse. The added armor penetration doesn't make up for it.
---
Totally different looking bunker though including the shape. I kind of hope we can have 3 of each in our CAMP that way you can make a mock battle area with the trenches in the bog, camp designs are one of the draws for me.
---
Lmao
---
Some are  viable - I have an Instigating, Explosive, Faster Reload Single Action. I can make it work.
---
Problem is, those attributes on a lever action or hunting rifle would be nearly god rolls, on a pistol, it makes it barely "viable".
---
"Err'bahddy aert Ferndayshun jest needs to do der jerb!"
---
I feel that! Let's hope its better next time we attempt it!
---
Yea, but even that was a fairly recent addition, it wasn‚Äôt like that upon original release
---
Good suggestion. Was thinking if you're building a Slocum's Joe diner, they should have some Rockabilly music to go with it. Throw in some Cash, Orbison, some obscure songs like Peanut Wilson's (born in WV) Cast Iron Arm, etc etc.  Might as well have some new music while you're doing the C.A.M.P build dailies
---
I have an exploding western revolver that I like killing lower level ghouls with. Pistols are a lot of fun I wish they were stronger tho lol
---
Pistols/revolvers are not OP, but still viable and far from junk - and a lot of fun. You will need a special playstyle to make it work, though - have a look at this [post/guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eurg4r/big_iron_midroadss_guide_to_the_full_life/) for a good start
---
Oh nice I didn‚Äôt know that. Maybe I‚Äôll keep some around to mess around with
---
Yeah, totally true. I was just going by the hair patterns and the eyes going black on at least many of the followers. I was also trying for a cheap play on "wannabe" LOL
---
Isnt' that the one that  he says to you after you bring it back, "Oh we have a bunch of these, but it's the principal."
---
Thanks for the build reccomendation man First time since playing 76 I have considered changing my stats around. Big guns really go Brrrrr
---
lol. Salty guy didn't get the workshop and reported. I love guys like this. If you want to be really save submit a ticket to Bethesda explaining what happened.
---
I will check it out, thank you!
---
The automatic teslas are currently bugged and cause large framerate drops and pixelated graphics.
---
I assume a vendor bot? Is it a specific one or any may have them?
---
The effect works as a set amount per pellet so single bullet weapons like rifles are crap. Shotguns or modded lasers are the only viable medics weapons.
---
There's still a difference between viable and unusable though. You can easily do most content in the game with a pistol it'll just take you longer.
---
Oh it wasnt?.. hopefully somebody over at Bethesda reads the reddits, clue them along to changing it.
---
it didn't survive
---
Yeah Stabilized + AA Lego is still the closest you can get to completely ignoring armor on guns that tend to trend towards lower damage per shot, and higher damage per second of firing. So it still meshes incredibly well with every heavy gun except the Plas Caster/Gatling Gun really which benefit more from Two Shot
---
We‚Äôve been saying this for months...akimbo a couple Westerns or 10mm pistols would be a lot of fun...
---
Just looked it up, Responder Bot should have it. White spring or Camden Park.
---
I think that‚Äôs how the algo works, same as the queen, always sonic attacks me not the low levels
---
Despite all of the raging bugs in this game, the devs decided to nerf damage. The same team 'banned' dupers, then let them back with all of their misbegotten gains.  
---
If they're dense enough to think that was the best way to address things over all of the other bugs, you're probably going to be just fine.
---
Yeah that would be rather cool to see, shame the portholes can't be used or seen from the inside
---
But won't you lose junk then? Or are they not counting it as a death?
---
Ye I think so. I hate it but I love it lmao
---
gauss is, so is an auto 10mm. you may be able to make a .45 pipe revolver work, too.
---
relying on sneak and, come patch 22, armor piercing, coupled with a decent legendary, you'll be able to dispatch average mobs no problem.
---
but bosses are a different story.
---
Who uses the word Dolt? Haha. Maybe that‚Äôs your problem then you use words that no one gives a shit about. Speak proper English , stop trying to be some smart little ego driven idiot when your just some toxic gamer looking to ruin it for lower level players because why, you can‚Äôt help them, your not good enough to carry them.. 2 high levels can do Colossal Problem no worries.
---
I mean, technically, the game did provide you with the necessary information when you fast traveled out and learned the hard way that it doesn't work that way.
---
You live and then you learn. We've all fucked up and learned the hard way at one point. Now you know, and you'll be cautious the next time.
---
Damn you are a bible of tips!!! Thank you!! Gotta write all this down haha
---
It would be nice but since everyone has a handful of mutations already, this would be like a free gift for everyone without drawbacks.
---
Don't really understand why you are talking about nightstalkers and snallygaster when i am talking about cyborgs with laser beams and what have you.
---
K gotchu
---
Why is anyone surprised? Lode bearing is a preexisting event that used the same "tunnel is collapsing" mechanism it's even timed the same way. If events that use this mechanic autocancel if you teleport it's really at fault to the person who didnt pay attention to the event prompt.
---
You can change the programming of any Collectron to collect whatever options you have unlocked regardless of appearance using the terminal on its pod.
---
The first time I encountered insult bot, he commented on the pile of junk at my camp and asked when I planned to start building. 
---
But it was the ‚Äúboom. roasted‚Äù mic drop moment in that monotone robot voice that cemented him a special place in my heart forever.
---
You should stream this! I think that would be the best way to show new players and not worry about adding IDs/responding to messages.
---
Ive found all of those events are usually heavily populated...mabye its the time of day your active that is the issue?
---
Could be worse, could still be a solo only game that actually ends. I think it was the only part i hated about 3 and nv. 4 just kept going and never had anything new. I really hoped when 76 came out it would be like fable where you could join someones instance as part of their world as an ally.
---
That means someone did it before you got there. Try your private server if you have fo1
---
Well if your shallow and use the wrong defenitions like SJW's do and you think belonging to religion and being patriotic is a cult. Then sure.
---
YES lol
---
All our times have come
---
Here but now they're gone
---
Seasons don't fear the mothman
---
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain, we can be like they are
---
Come on baby, don't fear the mothman
---
Baby take my hand, don't fear the mothman
---
We'll be able to fly, don't fear the moth
---
Baby I'm your -man
---
...La, la, la, la, la
---
I‚Äôve encountered what you described many times, relatively higher levels (200-300+) go to events with a revolver, pipe gun, black powder pistol, rolling pin, etc. They struggle to land a hit then die repeatedly, makes me scratch my head and wonder what‚Äôs going through their minds. Role playing? Testing new gear? Either way the contribution to the success is minimal.
---
No be sad, human. Grahm and Meat Week live on, in your colon :)
---
Well one thing is that do you notice something with all the mentions of cyborgs you brought up? Not a single one had cybernetic weapons like chainsaw hands or laser eyes. All of them had ones that helped perceive things faster, extended their age, or just something simple like extra strength. Not a single one got the ability to shoot death lasers, unless you decaptiated someone and put an assaultron in the skin suit lasers being shot from eyes seems implausible without killing the person (note how the assaultron head produces radiation when fired). I‚Äôm just saying going to the point where people could shoot lasers and still be alive is seems out of place.
---
It just morks.
---
I lucked out and got both, and extra on my first several turns on the spits.
---
Like three ways over, I'm pretty sure you're my Reddit hero for the morning...
---
Hello mate.
---
I rebuilt the database first but that did nothing, so I deleted and reinstalled it.
---
It's been fine so far (touch wood) . . . but I've not been extensively into and through my whole build menu yet.
---
Although, I did check to see if it was crashing at the same point, which was about half way down 'Floor Decorations' and it scrolled up and down fine.
---
I wish you all the best, Seven Six.
---
Tentacle?... from what Ive learned watching Anime and... well yeah. Tentacles can either be a good thing or a really really bad thing. Ussually the later.. in alot of ways. Although a Giant Mutated Irradiated Squid fight in the Mire sounds like an awsome fun time. Imagine your comrades all being held in the air by a giant squid tentcle or being tossed away like how Earl screams and you go running.
---
Which LMG works? I tried a stalkers limb damage, it had no effects at all. I thought magic was fixed in ACP.
---
This is the problem with MMOs. People complain about everything. Game is too easy? Add a new, harder event. People cry they can't solo it easily.
---
We know
---
He's playing it wrong...
---
Sorry but your gonna just have to accept that cyborgs fit the aesthetic of fallout perfectly since the developers themselves have used this asthetic multiple times in references to lore ,perks and upgrades.
---
Don't really understand your issue other than you don't like it and are trying to find an excuse to justify why it would be bad.
---
It's really a matter of opinion, anyone can come up with reasons why things don't work.
---
On the flip side anyone can come up with new lore and reasons to justify anything being added as well.
---
Oh, and just to clarify, I didn't delete my cloud save files as I wasn't sure whether I'd lose my progress or not. :/
---
Yes! But when you squeeze it says ‚Äúdemocracy is non-negotiable!‚Äù
---
REALLY depends on your loadout...
---
But Radicool is one point in END and gives you STR bonuses based on your Rads. Perfect for Bloodied builds.
---
Its all the tesla trolls downvoting.
---
Radicool
---
The only thing you'll share between your characters is the rewards. Sorry man.
---
Saddest part: it's working. I can't go to a single vendor anymore without seeing a Scrapbox, meaning they've at the very least paid for it once.
---
Already got that one
---
I never thought my lazy ass would have a problem like this, but thanks to Meat Week notes I'm in a similar, if not way less deep boat.
---
Please, Bethany Esda, let me get more than 1/5th of the price of a good item a day
---
I've seen a few in the watoga train station
---
Already got that one (took wayyyyyyyy too long to realise how good it was)
---
A better option would have been a random chance, once you hit a certain percentage of Rads, that your character would become a ghoul.
---
You‚Äôd acquire 100% immunity to rare, but 1/2 HP and 2/3 AP
---
Good luck.  Changed my outlook on doing nukes for sure.  Used to be something that wasn't really hard but just too tedious for me to want to do often.  Now I will do 3 scorched Earth's a play session some nights.
---
I‚Äôm not too worried anymore. I‚Äôm new to the game and really don‚Äôt wanna get banned or have to start over. And I heard people getting banned for other strange reasons
---
I just don't like dying lol
---
Better yet make a challenge to be insulted 100 times and unlock it for free, additionally make it only collect you have been insulted notes to complete the jib.
---
If you‚Äôre trying to run those together, someone may consider that a food build cause you‚Äôd just have an assortment of random perk cards that don‚Äôt help each other. But it‚Äôs more of a term for players to go use QoL perk cards a lot. Green thumb, lockpicking, good with salt, etc. 
---
That‚Äôs the core idea of what a food build is, but many people can use the term very loosely as an insult. Some may think simply not having optimized your build to its peak combat effectiveness will make you a good build. 
---
Personally, I don‚Äôt think you are one, but it really isn‚Äôt a bad thing even if you were.
---
WTH my bloodied gauss barley go over 70 on This new encounter and SBQ
---
So yeah floating is an issue...I just moved mine and everything popped and I can't get them to go back level.
---
From my own experience it is not. Its pretty common now and not too popular. I usually just sell them to a train vendor now when I get those outfits.
---
Is that Don't Fear the Reaper?
---
Gun Fu 1. Takes a little getting used to but even without the damage bonus it‚Äôs a very useful perk.
---
no, it hasn't been fixed. not even in the PTS. stalker's should work.
---
apparently it's tied to your framerate though, so that might be why it didn't trigger.
---
If you‚Äôre a mutant and like public teams, strange in numbers?
---
Perks are a mechanic, they don‚Äôt change your physical appearance or anything, they are, for a lack of better words, not cannon. Yes, cyborgs have been introduced in all shapes and sizes (super mutant, robobrain, Kellogg, dog) but but things such as eye lasers have never been shown other than on assaultrons. 
---
But I guess we will have to agree to disagree.
---
Damn boi, he sexy af
---
He showed up once while I was in the middle of killing a scorched and legit interrupted me, hardly had health left. I had no idea he could do that
---
There were a lot of people who were banned and came on here to post "but i didn't do anything!" And we would look back at their old posts and they were talking duping and trading duped items.
---
 Nope
---
I keep doing for the junk and ammo.
---
depends on what you already have and whether you want/need more QOL, damage, or defense.
---
IMHO, bandoleer, glowsight, class freak, tank killer, green thumb, good doggy are all good choices.
---
Can we just balance and fix everything please we don‚Äôt need more things to buy this is why the world ended in the first place goddammit
---
Explaining to me how the game works or telling their are mechanics doesn't make think how this is less of a good idea, also it's complete lie that you say things are not canon when kellogg and supermutants have existed with cyborg parts.
---
Regarding Enforcer, since crippling the limbs don‚Äôt seem to do anything, how useful is it from a damage output perspective?
---
It‚Äôs the main reason so many people put their FO1st tents down there, so they can dump their flux as soon as the Queen dies.
---
This is not true for the Communist collectron
---
You are onto something here
---
Where‚Äôs the fog crawler plushie at tho
---
That's the perk where it allows you to stay in VATs when you kill someone right?
---
You're better off making a NW specific character if you're planning on spending any time in it. On the plus side of that, you'll eventually have a leveled alt you can play around with. I have a level 170, and a level 120, that haven't even started the overseer quest.
---
Gave me a chance to play around with heavy/melee/shotgun, and junkies builds without having to mess with my main.
---
I also leveled an overencumbered mule to lvl 60+ in Adv from NW xp.
---
I have a VATS/Pistol/Grenades build that holds her own.  It may be under-powered compared to other builds, but you can still solo most everything.
---
For VATS, you want quick or swift, but swift has more capacity. Aligned barrel, aligned grip/forceful stock, reflex sight, and powerful or tweaked automatic receiver for commando or hardened for rifleman. This is all according to Angry Turtle's video where he tested the mods and their VATS cost.
---
The first rank of Adrenaline is more important than the other ranks. Same for Tenderizer IMO. Escape Artist if you're stealthy. If you're running on public teams, Strange in Numbers is always a safe pick.
---
Check the server (Public Teams can give you a good snapshot)...if you don‚Äôt see a reasonable number of high levels, don‚Äôt nuke Monongah.
---
I tend to play solo and use Lone Wanderer
---
Hmm, I wonder how it wouldve gone on the survival servers if workshops were reversed there to be nonpvp zones.
---
I specifically said perks because they don‚Äôt change your appearance or anything. I stated earlier they are just mechanics. I‚Äôm not lying when I say that. What other characters have are actual cybernetics, not perks. They are actually part of the story and not just a mechanic.
---
Come buy some shit from me. I am always low on caps.
---
You'll find that the problem of getting wood only gets worse as time passes...
---
‚ÄúType‚Äù so a full set of combat armor works, even if they are different tiers
---
I did this event this morning and the lowest level was 150 ish.  The rest of us were at or well above that level including me at lvl 356 and a couple of others close to lvl 400.  
---
Realistically, you can be very well equipped and perked by lvl 75 but honestly if you are below that I wouldn‚Äôt participate.  I run an AAE auto handmade hitting almost 150dmg per shot given perks and chems and colas and this event is no joke.  I didn‚Äôt die, but ate up a number of stims not unlike Encryptid.
---
They always go after nuclear generators too. They should attack the first thing they see.
---
I need more Nuka Cola. I carry 200 bottles of it on me at any time. I don't even drink any. I just collect them.
---
Were you using any chems or other buffs?
---
I like this idea, actually.
---
Taking this as recommendation to start using the .50 cal, thanks to the 3K steel that I have in my pockets at all times.
---
Omg. He is SO annoying I couldn't keep him in my camp.
---
Its a really bad event. That is really boring, and offers incredibly average loot. The miners are really rare and hard to find unless you live in game all day long. I really didnt enjoy the last one they ran.
---
yes, please
---
Yeh it's just the card itself still says set as its description. I think most people would probably think that meant like full combat/metal but some would orbs still get that mixed with sturdy and others.
---
You may want to consider trying public teams a little. There are some good team mutations and perk cards that you benefit from even if you run a solo public team!
---
If not, I know it isn‚Äôt a popular one by I actually like have the reduced cap price fast travel card(char) or glowing sights(per), most the enemies I need a dmg boost on as a bloodied are glowing
---
You can also try any other dodge chance or dmg % reduction perks. Those are always useful no matter the situation
---
Oof. Duping shit isn‚Äôt right in my opinion. Ruins the economy and just doesn‚Äôt ruins the experience of getting a rare item. I feel small glitches like the ammo factories are fine and infinite stash box capacity (not player carrying capacity, that‚Äôs wrong) and other small things. The factory is slow anyways so it isn‚Äôt that bad of a thing. But duping and gaining rate items for nothing or anything that gives you a significant advantage over others just isn‚Äôt right. Personally tho I‚Äôm too lazy to do any glitches or exploits
---
Ideally something different depending on the kind of entrance you use; or an option you can toggle for "room type"
---
I thought this was a dirty joke
---
Contacting the burn ward for assistance
---
Everytime he pops up, my goal is to kill him before I get insulted. When the fiddler bot walks by I shoot it and watch the radrats wonder around aimlessly. Lottobot gets a bullet before I get a prize. At Sutton Station I wait till the scavenger that spawns by the dumpster to check the cars and then set them on fire. Afterward I go looking how far the body flew.
---
Yes, it chains over to the next closest target, so long as you still have Action Points left. There also a +10% damage bonus but it‚Äôs the auto-retarget function that is pretty nice, especially if you can one-shot most enemies.
---
Buy low, sell high.
---
That would be cool.  You can kind of make your dweller look like a ghoul with all the damage, grime and markings but the character's nose just ruins the whole thing.
---
I like to leave a insult pamphlet at janky camps. Put some love into that home folks. Your idea is awesome.
---
Strange in numbers. Switch lone warrior to inspirational and level up.
---
I use a quad ex single action revolver for low level areas, it's so much fun to use, not a very viable weapon in most areas and the reload time is rediculas lol. Not so much with the firework glitch ( going to miss it when it's finally patched ‚òπ)
---
What numbers do you throw up on Earl with those two weapons.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll give it another shot today. The whole ‚Äòmagic‚Äô thing has always been a hit and miss, often times it has little to no effect, occasionally there‚Äôs an ‚Äòoh shit‚Äô moment but it‚Äôs impossible to predict whether it will work or not.
---
I reloaded my minigun yesterday midnight with a real annoying scorchbeast (was just sitting at the edge of my effective range lobbing attacks at me).
---
So emptied the mag, reloaded, started firing again, it auto-reloaded after 2 rounds.............
---
To hell with divine command theory
---
This has been happening since there were legendaries and player vendors. Not a thing wrong with it.
---
Any idea on Daily challenges? It'd be nice if using a NW-specific character still cleared the daily NW challenge for my main (I assume Seasonal progression is shared between characters so stuff like Atoms can't be farmed?)
---
https://ibb.co/P589g99
---
My daily driver weapon is a non primed AAE auto handmade with drum magazine.   Without chems and colas I‚Äôm pushing 125dmg per shot and juicing things up gets me close to 150dmg per hit.  I was doing pretty decent damage to Earle but it helps when others were contributing  with explosive heavy weapons or explosive auto rifles.
---
I hate how you're bombarded by NPCs in Fallout games. They should have quieter voices when you're not talking to them and they're doing their own thing. It's the players fault for not talking to more NPCs but them talking like that is annoying.
---
You were originally meant to be able to play as super mutants or be changed into one at one stage in the game however this was scrapped at some point. Would have been pretty cool but hard to balance I would imagine.
---
Is that the same bug as nuclear winter when you loot a crossbow off somebody and it has all your crossbow ammo listed as loaded in the mag?
---
Cause 200 shots with a crossbow without reloading is not only broken, but way too common of a bug
---
I mean I'd probably want to spend some time in Adventure so I can get those SPECIAL points faster. I assume it'd be faster to level there than NW (especially with my skill level lol).
---
To them Humans are the superior "race" and they'd stop at nothing to wipe out everything else. They seek to destroy sentient, peaceful creatures such as ghouls (non-feral) and synths (ie Dance who had done nothing but help their cause but theyd kill him if you don't intervene). Not to mention the Nazi-like coveting of all technology (or art) to keep for themselves and "keep out of the hands of those that would use it for their own gain or corrupt goals". Sure FO4 is the main source where they get *really* bad (ie telling you to wipe out the Railroad simply because their goals dont align with their own; wiping out all the synths) but they showed this in the earlier ones too.
---
Drop repair kits like the SBQ and you'll get an even nuke drop distribution I think. Although the whole instanced gamble might keep people away.
---
thats how you make money in this game. Buy low, sell high.
---
Scrapper...lol
---
That looks wicked.. nice
---
Normally 40-70 on his head for the plasma and 22-50 on his head for the utracite. With high voltage hefi and some more buff higher
---
Why does this bother you?  Depending on what you were selling and what your prices were, that player may have felt they were seriously underpriced. 
---
Buying stock to resell it is a very common practice. When I‚Äôm above 25k caps (or near max capacity in my stash), I list many items at about half my normal prices.
---
If someone wants to buy my serums for 150c to sell them for 300c to a player or 500c to a vendor, why would that bother me?  I made the money I asked for in the original transaction.
---
If you are spec'd for rifleman, stay rifleman. Don't bother with other weapons. Commando is technically stronger, but you're still plenty strong enough - don't worry with shotguns etc.
---
A plasma rifle configured for a flamer barrel will use rifleman perks, for one. If you find you keep getting popped out of stealth one of these may keep you alive better. It will sure burn down any beastie as well (if you're full health look for Furious or Vamp, ideally - though suppressor wouldn't be bad).
---
Also, what are your perks / special load-out?
---
For armor, less the type (SS) and more the mods and legendary is what I'm asking for.
---
I remember the first time I found the insult bot, I was just exploring the map and all of a sudden I stumbled with him and started insulting me. It was so funny and unexpected, really cool encounter
---
Why does other mechanics or perks even matter?
---
I am trying to suggest something new for enemy types. i never talked about perks changing your appearance. Nor did i ask for you to look for lore reasons about why it couldn't work because you are angry about cyberpunk 2077 or some bullshit reason which makes you think i got my idea from there.
---
The only reason i brought up these examples is because of how dead wrong you are about cyborg's not fitting within fallout's aesthetic and world when they make references to them and had characters embody these traits.
---
Also effects like glowing or albino or w/e change appearance on creatures so cyborgs can be another variation like that.
---
He will be back soon... The Brotherhood has worked out a deal with him if we donate.
---
Thank you.
---
He is awesome for a explosive/blood sucker build
---
Jokes on him with my 10 cursed shovels for 200 caps each :-P
---
Np
---
How do you only do 50ish dmg with a handmade?  I‚Äôm a full commando build with tank killer and other auto rifle related perks to maximize damage and my B25 FFR is at 96dmg without any chems or colas.   I‚Äôm 120+ with the right combinations.
---
It was meant more as a joke.
---
I do call this character of mine a food build. I use butchers bounty to get more meat from my hunts. Then I use superduper to get more glowing steak and ribs. And good with salt so they last my play session. Then I wash my steak and rib diner down with whisky, use party boy to triple the effect and professional drinker to manage my alcoholism.
---
Looking at you perks, which are [here](https://i.redd.it/lmr7slhizij51.jpg) btw so other folks don't have to go looking for it, you have a lot of quality of life perks equipped that don't help you in combat. Things like picklock, ammosmith, super duper are good to have, but you should only equip them when you need them. Replace them in your load out with things that help deal damage.
---
You also have a few commando perks that you don't need if you go non-automatic. You are going to be better off going full rifleman or full commando and not in between (I personally recommend commando over rifleman due to the rate of fire). You also need to give some more information about how you like to play. Do you want to use stealth? VATS? These have an impact on how your perks should be spent. Rifleman or commando builds will typically have more points in agility and less in strength due to the perks available like covert operative for stealth damage boosts. If you use VATS, luck is good to give you more critical hits.
---
I got a Instigating Explosive Lever Action Rifle as a reward for a fasnacht event. Couldn't believe it. Been my edc weapon since.
---
That's an interesting choice, is the mutation benefit and XP boost worth the reduced damage and AP regen?
---
That's the one... I tried to kill him the first time I heard that!
---
That would be super helpful with my Lever Action, had to constantly hit LB to target the next enemy
---
I got a two shot, explosive western revolver that can kick some ass but I never remember to use it. Might try and use it running around today.
---
I bought a TSE Minigun in a player machine for like 2500 caps. Sold it for over 30k about two hours later. Am I supposed to feel guilty about that?
---
Yes, unless they come through on their promise to do more balancing before releasing the update.
---
The prizes for completing project bravo are as follows: 
---
Donating 150mil wood = Steel Dawn Fatigues
---
Donating 200mil cloth = Brotherhood of Steel collectron station
---
Donating 175mil leather = Purveyor 50% off sale
---
Donating 250mil glass = A second helping of Meat Week 
---
I don‚Äôt know if this will be the last event of its kind but for now it seems that this is the only one.
---
I tried to get that to happen on purpose with some trash legendaries when I no longer had the daily vendor currencies left to sell them. Was hoping someone would realize they could sell it to their vendor at twice the price and save me the trouble lol.
---
Just add yourself to a public team and play as normal the perk works great for a mutated player.
---
The day the event dropped I ran it 8 times fail 2 times got all 3 camp items the shovel and mask
---
I didn‚Äôt, but now I do!
---
Why are people on this Reddit so ignorant? I just want a better version of workshop PVP because i think the current system is hugely flawed and undercooked.
---
Because i don't like certain seafood(which i rarely eat) i should stop eating food? That's basically your logic, my idea is all about promoting MORE PVP by the way.
---
PVP is something that happens so little in this game outside of nuclear winter, and one of the major reasons for that survival mode's failure, was the lack of balance.
---
sell for what you want. personally i sell junk for what i find it worth to trade for script which i do within a day. try to understand the market and what is valuable. if they sell higher from goods they bought from you maybe learn from that and see the rate of return. their profit from buying and time spent or even holding for there is a limit to inventory can effect real profit especially if you rotate inventory often and have a high sell rate but depends on difference and sell rates of both of you.
---
Still say a Mr. Fuzzy, or Camden park theme would be great. Really anything more for mr. Fuzzy
---
*You‚Äôve Been Insulted* has been added to your inventory
---
Welcome to capitalism
---
I would have believed the damage thing.  I literally did 0 damage to Earle during the event.
---
I blue screened a few seconds before the debris cleared to go down to Earle. When I got back into the server it spawned me at Poseidon Energy Plant (it was another active event I had at the time).  I couldn't get back to Earle but the game left me in the event, despite being all the way over at Poseidon, so I got the rewards when it finished.
---
The way you have you SPECIAL points set up in your Adventure Mode character determines the number of perk points you've got for cards in NW. EX - 10 Strength in Adventure Mode - you could equip perk cards in NW that total those 10 points, whether you filled up all seven slots, or not. You could have all Strength cards in NW in all 7 slots, if you had the points in that skill. Same applies to all of the skills, 12 Agility, you could have Frog Legs at 9 pts and then another 3 pt card and still have 5 other slots.
---
The cards you have in NW are for that NW character only.
---
All of the above, obviously, plus something unforeseen to keep things interesting.
---
That's where the heck 50 fusion cores with maybe 9% charge is coming from. 
---
I was in my PA and kept hearing the Core Ejection Replace buzzer waaay too often and couldn't figure out why I had so many of these darn drained batteries. 
---
Please can we get an acknowledgement on this bug?
---
It‚Äôs the healing factor mutation in combination with your bloodied build. Your stats are changing (healing) even when you don‚Äôt think they are, so the fast travel thinks you‚Äôre being hit and in combat, so the fast travel pops you back out into the world instead of traveling you. This is how it was explained to me. 
---
Get rid of healing factor.
---
This needs more attention. It‚Äôs bullshit.
---
Some 1v1s in Survival mode really got my heart racing. Also, one session I was at the top of the leader board for at least 3 hours and this was when you had a big target on you on the map.
---
I would love have Mr handy just sweeping in one spot in my camp
---
All it would collect is "you have been insulted" notes and the plastic clown toys
---
The lever action has nearly the exact timing to shoot Just when gunfu switch target, perfect weapon - perk synergy
---
Would be nice but they might mess something else up with the patch for it
---
Gotta wait 175 years before you can worship Atom I'm afraid. However if you start walking to Los Angeles now you might be able to join the Children of the Cathedral and worship The Master.
---
While I'm still trying to figure out a proper build one of my strongest guns right now is a Furious Exploding 10mm auto pistol, buuut it kinda eats through ammo extremely quickly.
---
Love that dude.  The post insult dialogue is what makes me laugh.  It once told me he would call the burn ward or something like that.  10/10.
---
Yes ! And a gift box
---
I am a Capitalist cultist thank you very much.
---
Is the team aware that it‚Äôs caused by the healing factor mutation and bloodied builds? Someone explained that to me, I removed healing factor, and the bug went away. I had it bad, I could never fast travel unless I clicked 5-6 times on the same place. Removing healing factor got rid of that.
---
I'm about to make all my plans for free. I keep getting ones my main already knows so easily that 1 cap is too much. IMO, either get rid of them or get them to an alt or a friend.
---
You could always just go here if you wanted to be insulted...

You won‚Äôt get an answer. I never do. Which means it‚Äôs rumored bullshit until a link proves otherwise.
---
Is that one the golden one? Or is that the prize bot? Either way I definitely agree, an insult bot (that‚Äôs gold) would be amazing!
---
The worst is when you feel it coming...ugh
---
Same mate, but the good thing about public events is that you can always respawn at the event for free and you don‚Äôt lose your junk.
---
He fell through the floor for me yesterday.
---
Yeah definatly something unforeseen, I deffo didn't think the grelok staff would disable all the legendary prefixes of the weapon it's put on, that was a new one
---
Or the ss underarmor not using ss underarmor mods but the casual
---
I remember fallout 4 I had a 10mm that stacked bleed damage it was wonderful. I miss it lol. I wouldn‚Äôt mind exploding 10mm
---
That does sound like fun, I didn‚Äôt know it could have quad
---
Also applies to real life.
---
Some people don't want to play with the same "build" that every other person has though. I agree with OP it should be considerably better than 10%
---
You can get quad on most of them, my mate has a quad explosive western revolver which I've tried getting off him but he won't part with it lol
---
If you have a few AP regen armor pieces you won‚Äôt notice it.
---
.45 pipe revolver can double dip into pistol and rifleman perks üòè. Or could last time I used it damage output is great.
---
Only gun I‚Äôve gotten quad is lever rifle. I wish I‚Äôd get a quad pistol haha that would be fun
---
That one still pisses me off. Like, "We've got a bunch of these, and we don't care if the people at The Crater(Who I used to know) are unable to have fresh water"
---
Excavator+All-Rise+Thru-Hiker=Food-build. Also this post is wrong yes there is the PVP version but also this type of food build one A.K.A The Virgin Milk Drinker Build I described it in my first sentence. I don't want to get to much hate but I'm just saying that Food-Builds can't do a lot of damage you and your cranberry relish and thru-hiker should stop existing
---
Welcome to adulthood mate that's how it works buy cheap sell for profit. I often sell legendary weapons cheap if my stash if full knowing that will probably happen but then I sell at normal higher prices when I've got space or no caps.
---
If you have fo1st it goes really well with the ranger armor outfit!
---
Lord-Anthos
---
The red mothman cult
---
The enemies at tyler county dirt track defense LOVE the dumpster on the side of the building...
---
The thing had bothered me was that the items sale price are above 5000 caps when he sold them and they weren't really good legendaries. They were one stars.
---
Water-cooled Bone Saw? Oh and I suppose you want some stripey paint followed by a long stand too huh?
---
I'm guessing you're not old enough to remember dropping 25¬¢ on a two minute long experience to play Pac-Man. 50¬¢ a day for an unlimited scrap box is nothing 30 years later. I dont understand this complaint I keep hearing. Hell most if not all MMOs required a monthly subscription. This isn't any different except you don't need it to just play the story. It's only needed if you want to go crazy with the game.
---
Why even have scrip? Just use treasury notes for both and raise the limit.
---
I‚Äôve only seen it twice.
---
First time me and one person got into the second group by ourselves. Couldn‚Äôt even dent the thing. 
---
The second time got in the first group with eight people. Got about 3/4 through it and I got kicked to the dashboard on Xbox.
---
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get some more shots this weekend.
---
I used to love the .45 pipe revolver. It was my favorite when I was low level
---
Same.  Definitely a feel-bad moment that took me out of the game.  My character would never do that.
---
I have a bunch of god tier 10mm pistols and they all suck. My build isn‚Äôt pistol, but rifles do so much more damage....
---
Ha. Omg. Am I too old to get it?
---
Thanks for the offer!  I‚Äôm on PS4 though.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll find them eventually, it‚Äôs actually kinda fun plan hunting
---
It is fun only in low level areas because it mostly one shots them and it's quick firing in VATS, I mostly use it for tea time and campfire tales events and can usually VAT things before anyone knows they're there lol
---
The red M√∂thman cult I think you'll find haha
---
Ah misconstruing my words. I never said I was upset at Cyberpunk 2077. I was just saying it has things similar to what you are bringing up and that you might be interested, but I wasn‚Äôt interested. That‚Äôs all I said. 
---
And I never said Cybrogs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fit the aesthetic of Fallout‚Äù I said cyborgs with fuckin lasers beam shooting eyes are implausible since the lasers can‚Äôt be formed from anywhere in the human body‚Äôs other than the brain. They would have to be lobotomized, have their brain filled with the parts to shoot the laser, and pretty much become Lobotomites in order to become what your saying. I already said things such as strength enhancers, perception enhancers, etc. are all plausible, but a knock off assaultron is not the kind of cyborgs the series have shown. Hell even the Lobotomites who have had everything replaced with mechanical parts never shot lasers out of their eyes. 
---
As for the different variants of animals, I‚Äôm confused. Why did you bring that up? Each one has their own explanation as to why they are they way they are, none of them change drastically because of it other than the Chameleon Deathclaw. The most I could imagine is someone having their brain incased in one of those robobrain helmets and attached to their body for extra protection against head shots or whatever.
---
Go outside. Play later hahaha
---
Been using both Blocker and a Vampires FFR Pump Shotty in conjunction with a magic armor piece to great effect. Typically I‚Äôll go it and tag him with a magic Minigun to help kick off the fight then go on add control for the remainder of the event. 
---
For a clustered group of Wendys, an Auto Grenade Launcher works very well. I‚Äôm that guy that is on add control most of the time. 
---
So many screws to be had.
---
Turns up the radiation for the guitar solo
---
In general I find it weird how much freedom you have in communicating if you're on mic, but how little you have when you arent.
---
Like, please, add a text chat. Gift and comment systems would be really nice too, but if nothing else, I just wanna be able to talk without having to have a mic set up.
---
I sell those for 15c per scrip value.
---
That would take years to implement. It would be better to have it go to a camo and set it on fire
---
Switch server?
---
What are BE predators?
---
Raider bot already insults you but give the insult bot more of a GLADoS type personality and I would buy it in a heartbeat.
---
Weapon displays have been broken since the last patch. No clue about the lights, though, and can‚Äôt replicate the issue. Wall type/light type?
---
No, you‚Äôre not.
---
The problem is that the collectrons talk too much with too few dialog options. If it was a random pick of 100 different insults and only spoke every 30 minutes it would be way nicer. I would also like them to add an option to EVERY talking/noise emitting item that allows you to turn the sound off. That blood eagle statue looks cool till you hear the flames go off for the 50th time.
---
Somebody check the levels, if we're not careful that deep king that signed on for backing vocals is gonna run right over the bridge.
---
Idk...
---
What's Bridge Day? (I'm from the UK we don't have that one here)
---
A quick sometimes-fix is to exit build mode and immediately go back in, without moving the camera. The build interface seems to get confused when dealing with small details and this clears it out. 
---
If that doesn't fix it, I'd say just chalk it up to unfortunate design decisions on BSG's part. The build interface is clunky as hell, and you'll be pulling your hair out over this one a lot.
---
Blood Eagle Predators, tried server hopping, same spawn same enemies
---
I think that‚Äôs the best answer lmao
---
FYI...just because your high-level doesn't mean you're a good player
---
Really? So I can use say proletariat mode for the raider?
---
Can you give an example of the one-stars in question?
---
Ultimately, these items will sell for what someone is willing to pay. That‚Äôs the basis of a free market.
---
I leave those notes along with some spoiled meat on player beds and doorsteps when they have overpriced goods in the vendors. I would love a fresh and endless supply of the notes.
---
Anglers never dropped acid, just adhesive and asbestos.
---
I was still getting honeycombs from the honeybeasts during primal cuts events, I think they're just slightly rarer than regular honey
---
Magic Vampires Double Barreled Shotgun! 1 shot them damn wendigo's and per pellet healing. I love it!!
---
Reload your game.
---
I join a public team right before I send the nuke. Then emote like crazy and join the event right away and not from running into the mine, but from the icon on the map.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll give it a try
---
Honestly, yeah, I'd log out for a while. If they're spawning with you wherever you respawn, that's a pretty serious bug. Log completely out and give the sprites time to "get bored" with your character; maybe that will help.
---
I literally was thinking the same thing last night lmao
---
It crippled limbs quite fine. It‚Äôs great in events to slow down enemies. Only pellet needs to connect for it to work. Now it doesn‚Äôt work on the queen and from what I can tell it doesn‚Äôt work on the colossus either. But it works very well on the spawn fodder that comes with them. Knee capping the spawns works, and anyone else in the events will thank you. As far any damage increase I don‚Äôt know for sure, or if there‚Äôs a quantitative value attached to it for that matter.
---
Main reason I can‚Äôt say for sure about a damage increase on enforcer: I run a bloodied shotgun, my friend runs a full health shotgun, and both of us are single shotting just about everything including sheepsquatch, mirelurk queens, behemoths and scorchbeasts. I keep enforcer on for the off chance that I don‚Äôt kill something in one hit, which actually happens more often with the gauss shotgun than I expected because it suffers from the gauss effect from time to time. 
---
Here‚Äôs my friends shotgun build (probably more applicable to you than mine since I run bloodied/not judging-just sayin): 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4355ae&amp;d=sd2su2sg2so2sp2pc2pe0eh2cr0ce0cu2ib4a72am2as2lu2lt2l71lv2l12&amp;w=a30
---
And even with this build I‚Äôm sure other players may say different.
---
Define pistol please.   
---
I have a pistoler build I use the broken pipe pistol trick for stacking pistol and rifle though I have swapped to a broken ultracite pistol build with sniper barrel and beam splitter since "magic", still not as effective or super viable as pretty much any other weapon build though.
---
Honest beasts drop honey and honey combs. But I noticed glowing ones drop it a lot more often.
---
It‚Äôs the neon lights
---
As someone who has done QA, lemme tell you.
---
Video games is hard.
---
Walking in a straight line? That's a goddamn miracle that it works.
---
(My point is improvements are always important to work towards but "is this so hard to fix?" is usually a question to which the answer is "a lot more than you'd think!". Be nice to Programmers and Community Managers. This is why I blame Todd for everything that doesn't work :\^) he doesn't actually have to deal with the chaos that much)
---
Join it immediately. Don‚Äôt hesitate.
---
Only if it collects those f**king mr fuzzy tokens along with the commie wacker and cotton candy bites.
---
My only real issue with bloodied in the wendigo fight is the random stuff falling. If it spawns on me I die instantly. So far that's the only thing that has killed me and it's killed me quite a bit. It's always instant too. Just suddenly drop dead with no warning.
---
This is a risk worth taking IMO haha. 
---
I understand why the event was cancelled this year in , but having something(anything) in game would at least allow us to celebrate in one form or another.
---
At the very least, I'll be joining up with some friends in-game to celebrate and Base jump.
---
I actually watched a mole rat destroy it a couple days ago. Didn't think that was possible.
---
Is the ss underarmor got the camo skin by chance? If so it changes the requirements from the ss mods to casual.
---
If not I have no clue why it's doing it
---
But what they are using isn‚Äôt even sufficient for basic events, say swarm of suitors or guided meditation, how long does it take for a revolver user to reach level 300?
---
BE 50 handmade, B2525 handmade, BE 25 fixer, B2525 fixer, BE laser and the same but junkies all suffer from it. Also my TSE QE AAE and Fancy shotgun. Basically my 3 chars that use Vats...
---
They did say that we're going to visit other places outside of Appalachia, so fingers crossed for an actual Nuka World themed patch. (Loved the expansion). If not that, I can easily see a Nuka Themed season being made.
---
That‚Äôs how an open market works. If someone thinks you are selling too low they can buy and resell for market value. If they are wrong the items won‚Äôt sell. If they are right they make some profit. Doesn‚Äôt effect you one way or the other. You judged the price of the item as such and sold it. 
---
I do this all the time for poorly priced items. If you want to sell me a 5k item for 300 caps or a trade only item for 2k caps I will gladly take the deal.
---
Now kill it with a flamer
---
I'd love one
---
I am playing with cable
---
Not all heros wear capes.
---
I think that was part of the original concept for FOOL/Project V13 by Interplay, not Fallout 76.
---
I don‚Äôt think anglers drop acid, it‚Äôs the crickets, yao guais and snallygasters you should be looking for
---
~~2 tenderizer plans~~
---
~~2 peppered plans~~
---
~~1 salty plan~~
---
~~3 spicy plans~~
---
~~5 backpack plans~~
---
~~1 Tato salad recipe~~
---
Infinite chally outfits
---
Infinite chefs hats
---
Yep. That‚Äôs me.
---
I would totally buy that. Those shovels weight nothing and are 40 scrip a piece. 5 caps per scrip is around half to a quarter of market value.
---
It‚Äôs another method that keeps you coming back to play the game, so long as you‚Äôre invested in it. 
---
Some people have so much treasury notes that they can trade the daily limit for months without a thought of earning anymore. If they allowed the same system for scrip, there would be less and less people doing events over time as they hoard scrip. Simply put, the way the system is now can be the main reason end game players still play the game. Not everyone aspires to build a jaw dropping C.A.M.P., but everyone aspires to have that one gun that can quickly drops jaws on the ground, literally. 
---
You know what‚Äôs better than one person in a bakery? 10, 20, 50, even 100 people. The more people that stay in that shop means the more likely it is that someone‚Äôs going to bite that cupcake, and that cupcake is a fallout 1st subscription.
---
I am from the US and I don't know what that is.
---
Edit: Found it.  [https://officialbridgeday.com/](https://officialbridgeday.com/).  Apparently it's a day that people celebrate the New River Gorge bridge.  Jumping off it and such.  Looks pretty fun!
---
I mean I imagine the QA team has access to stuff like this. Sometimes you need a couple thousand players to mess around with a thing after it's launched to find its problem cases. Or you have a deadline to meet. Delicious, delicious deadlines.
---
I was about to do something very similar the other day. I have a LVL 15 character that I made recently to use for easy leveling during the next Season, and I took him to the Meat Cook, and there was a group of LVL 280+ players there who started attacking that character for no reason. So I checked the map and they were all clustered together on the map, sort of near the general area you're talking about. But, by the time I got through the silo with my LVL 298, they were all gone, so I nuked the [Cop A Squatter Daily](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/ifl9xj/gotem_chief/) instead.
---
I've only just got to  Level 17 (S.C.O.R.E.\* that is - I'm a Level 66 character!) as just returned to FO76 abut 2 weeks ago.
---
It's a slog, a real slog.. and some really naff rewards at the end of each level..
---
What I really hate about it is the board - it is sooo sluggish, it takes an age to move the crosshair onto what you want to redeem.
---
So I'm already just going to do 'em if they look interesting or if I happen to do them as part of my usual playthru..
---
And don't get me started on that damn Ammo Converter...
---
\* Anyone found out what this really stands for  - some of the community suggestions are quite funny!
---
If he does, this makes me feel a lot happier about my dps.
---
My main is lvl 440 and plays with all guns. I have 1* cards for every type of gun boost as three 1* perks give more boost than one 3* perk
---
Yup.
---
Don't know why I thought they dropped acid, I'm clearly loosing it, oh well.
---
I see the cursed shovel on your back üëç
---
The reason i brought up different variants for animals was to show you that there are labels attached to creatures that change appearance. Every creature could have new variant that is explained by new lore from new factions.
---
It should be 50%, there's no reason to limit people to using 2 legendary effects. "Balance" is just an us vs them argument people use.
---
Haha all good, maybe you were thinking of snallygasters?
---
The letters? Those are effected by what seems to be the same bug. I‚Äôve only tried them on the exteriors of brick walls and found that certain central spots just do not work, but peripheral ones do. You can sometimes place outer letters first (if you judge your spacing right) and have the more central ones snap in correctly.
---
A tip for the weapon displays, in the meantime: they won‚Äôt place if you‚Äôre hovering them next to the wall. Keep your region of placement steady while backing up‚Äîat some point they‚Äôll turn green, and if you hit place, they‚Äôll end up on the wall. Works 80% of the time. Usually takes some reajdustement, but damn me if I‚Äôm not gonna get that Bear Arm on the wall
---
I just delete the foundation drop your body underneath it and place the foundation ontop of it again, problem solved.
---
Well, with events I don‚Äôt really recommend fast traveling out of the building. Because you‚Äôre essentially leaving the event. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you fast travel outside the building, or all the way to vault 76. You‚Äôre basically abandoning the event and leaving. So I figured That was common sense. 
---
The only event that I know this works in, and still rewards you is lode baring. How do I know this? Because after completing the event I was way over encumbered. I didn‚Äôt realize I had a time limit to get out. So I placed down all my power armors. Took a few drugs and alcohol. And managed to be able to run again. But by the time I was able to run, it was too late and I only had 12 seconds left. So I got pissed and decided to fast travel to a teammate. When I spawned by him I got the reward for completing the event along with the experience.  I don‚Äôt know if fast traveling works in lode baring always. Or if I just perfectly fast travelled right before the event ended so it gave me credit for it since I basically didn‚Äôt get crushed to death. 
---
But on a side note. What happens if you die inside the cave and don‚Äôt escape? You‚Äôre technically in an event. So you shouldn‚Äôt drop your junk. Wouldn‚Äôt it spawn you outside with all your junk? And you‚Äôll still get rewarded for completing the missions? Or does being crushed to death mean you failed?
---
Less than 50%. No reason to make it the same as junkies without the addictions. That would just make people run mutants rather than junkies and we are back to a 2 build system again.
---
It's a festival surrounding the New River Gorge Bridge where they have have a bunch of Base jumpers jump off the bridge into the gorge. 
---
Taken right from their website:
---
"Bridge Day is West Virginia's largest single-day festival and one of the largest extreme sports events in the world. Held annually every third Saturday in October on the New River Gorge Bridge in Fayette County, West Virginia, this is the only day each year thousands of spectators can walk across the bridge and watch as serious BASE jumpers get their chance to fly 876 feet into the Gorge below and rappellers ascend and descend from the catwalk."
---
The bridge is impressive too. It's the second longest single arch bridge in the world. I was thrilled to see that they included it in the game :)
---
stop pissing off the Blood Eagles would be a good start
---
I don't know about directly on top but I had an issue where wall items couldnt be placed above the display either, which I was able to work around by placing the wall item first then moving the case in.
---
Why don't you post your build so we can actually help you....
---
Shhh ü§´
---
What if they had a system where when you purchase a legendary you get the option to immediately turn it back into scrip - and this doesn't come off the daily total? 
---
It would let you buy a number of items to see what you could get then if it wasn't anything useful (like yet ANOTHER 3\* pipe wrench) then you would turn them in and get your 40 scrip without touching the daily 150.
---
That seems like the easiest answer.
---
Why? Because people are too dumb to use their brains? Lol
---
Main food I use is toxic goo.
---
Gets you back into bloodied range fast.
---
No game would be interesting after 3000 hours.
---
How can you sell something for over 30,000 caps? I thought 30,000 was the limit.
---
I do that all the time but generally not on the same server that I purchased the from
---
It is, I currently have it scavenging ammo and weapons.
---
If I get a good roll on a junkies I'm not going to use the lesser version just because it's mutants. It's about casting a wider net so good gear is more readily available. Junkies being magic as well it's not like it'd be abandoned by most people.
---
The paintings and beer signs are the same way. Place between two windows (which is between two separate wall pieces) and it gives the same message.
---
I built a new house this week and noticed this change in behavior as well vs the last house I built.
---
They made it gold when wastelanders came out be
---
It wasn't always gold
---
The whole point of Fallout is lore. There has to be an explanation for almost everything. And I already said ‚Äúagree to disagree‚Äù and you persisted. Why resort to insulting my intelligence? I explained multiple times over trying to get my point across but you seemingly missed it half the time. If they ever introduce mods again, you can have your laser shooting chainsaw hand wielding Cyborgs.
---
That was my response to your original comment
---
I already said this. You kept bringing up perks as a point the cyborgs are in the Fallout universe, and I simply said that the player is only Cyborg in NV (forgot to mention NV), never in the other games. Yes cyborgs exists, and enhanced humans would be interesting, but dollar store assaultron wouldn‚Äôt make the cut. Cyborgs are not a different variant of human, they are a different type of enemy if your going to make them attack in completely different ways. If ‚Äúcyborgs‚Äù are ever added, then it would probably be best to make them ‚Äúenhanced humans‚Äù which are like Kellogg.
---
Then what‚Äôll happen is he‚Äôll sit on those for a long long time, taking up his stash space. No need to sweat about the caps he‚Äôs not really making.
---
Nukes are easy. You can just look up the codes of you don't feel like deciphering it.
---
Haha yes
---
Mounted Grafton monster head too!
---
Tho given the potential logistical difficulties that might pose how about something like those elephant foot umbrella/ashtray stands or a lamp.
---
not me.. there would be huge lines for a single loaf of bread.
---
I definitely want one
---
I have a cap mule (a second character that I only use to store caps). She‚Äôs Level 3. My main is Level 440 I think.
---
I was joking :-)
---
I usually buy them if I see them for 200 caps.
---
I'll try this, thank you
---
Unlike the queen, when you travel to the event it doesn‚Äôt mean everybody will spawn together. There‚Äôs a limit to 8 people per event. So for example if 16 people joined the event then 8 people will join ‚Äúevent 1‚Äù and fight ‚Äúcolossus 1‚Äù
---
Meanwhile the other 8 players will join ‚Äúevent 2‚Äù and have to fight ‚Äúcolossus 2‚Äù
---
UNFORTUNATELY, that means if only 9 people join the event, 8 people will be on one event, and the 9th person will join a different event on his/her own.
---
I sold the outfit for 400 caps a few days ago
---
aqua boy keeps the rads away when swimming which i would think extra rads as a bloodied is not good. it cost one point in endurance. which depends on how much you swim if not much you can switch to it when needed.
---
Nope you do not.  Someone else can launch the nuke and you can join the fight and finish up the quest.
---
I was upset cause I have literally launched 1 nuke and that was the required one.  It just not fun IMO.
---
That's would be cool and it would saythings like
---
Hope your having a good day
---
If there's anything you need let me know
---
I often wonder if there is life outside this camp
---
I always join SBQ, ACP, Encryptid, Rad Rumble, and Line in the Sand. The others, I'll join if I'm not doing something else (dailies, lead/steel farming, etc.)
---
I had a bug where the two equipped weapons I entered a server with would never leave my quick equip slots. No matter how many times I tried to change the load out, they would always reappear when I cycled through them. 
---
A quick alt+f4 and some time cleaning, after my dog decided to s*** all over my carpet, did the trick. When I logged back on, it was fixed.
---
I‚Äôll second the recommendation for Gun Fu when using a lever action. This is the way.
---
When you're that salty
---
Probably the biggest issue will be having to delete 80% of your camp to fit just 1 in with clothing.
---
Been needing them so bad to complete my creepy silent hill nightmare experience.
---
Id say make it a percentage base.  Something like 1-1.5% damage boost per mutation.   U have 19 mutations.  So u can get roughly 19-30% damage boost.
---
I‚Äôve never seen a bigger community of bratty players. I get It‚Äôs a online game but that‚Äôs all it is, a Game. 
---
What A$$PwNr69 is doing with 100 ammo factories is between him and Bethesda. There is no reason for you to shut down reddit just for catching him. His actions don‚Äôt harm you, his actions don‚Äôt take away the value of your work. If you have an issue just server hop and continue about your business.
---
Same goes with dealing with Bethesda at this point. Most of us have known since we where 10 Bethesda games are buggy and no amount of complaining/boycotting is going to change that long of a track record. Especially right now where most their employees are still required to work at home and many parts of Texas still doesn‚Äôt have high speed internet. Enjoy the game when it‚Äôs running good, laugh when it isn‚Äôt and find something else to play if it‚Äôs game breaking. I think at this point we have all gotten our $60/$30/$10 worth of game play. If you have an issue with ATX don‚Äôt buy it. If you have an issue with 1st don‚Äôt subscribe. No one is forcing you to spend money and there are a lot better ways to suggest changes instead of rioting on Reddit.
---
At this point other players owe you nothing, Bethesda owes you nothing. We all knew what we‚Äôve gotten ourselves into and everyone eventually had the option for refund.
---
Because the children of atom doesnt wear god tier unyielding armor sets?
---
Yeah I was the same, so not really feeling like doing it all over again, but good to know I can just join the event!
---
Last time is saw a insult bot I killed it lol
---
But if a character can't have more than 30,000 caps, how can they buy something at a vendor for more than 30,000?
---
I guess this must have been some arranged sale and not at a vendor?
---
Get yourself a set of Troubleshooter's armor and use Nukacrypt. 
---
Then, you can use that armor at Encryptid as well.
---
I will agree with you, it is a bit ridiculous, given the drain on your resources to get through the silo, then drain further to do any good at ACP.
---
I was planning to avoid going the magic route. 
---
If I'm understanding it right it will be a pretty hefty nerf - right now I think the damage multiplier for weapon perks + bloody mess + junkie's would be 1.6 x 1.15 x 1.5 = 2.76, post nerf they all get added instead of multiplied so it's 1 + (0.6 + 0.15 + 0.5) = 2.25, or about 18% less damage.
---
I rolled a junkies/aim damage gauss pistol on my first or second try but maybe I'll try for an instigating one and skip the addictions altogether.
---
Yup there is a holotape in there that you can listen to and then return to Maggie to finish up the quest.
---
Nuke silos take about 15-20 minutes (or less). Look the codes up and once you do one silo, you don't even have to enter the code the next time you run the same silo that week.
---
If you're spawning near the golf club/hotel can you kite the blood eagles close to the robots? I used to do that with ghoul mobs.
---
Why on earth would you bother getting the codes? Once for the heck of it I can get I guess. But more than that is just crazy
---
I still miss how new vegas did the deathclaw thing. I was scared poopless entering that area.
---
The raider one does constantly say it‚Äôs gonna kill you so that‚Äôs close enough
---
omg he got emoted at! the horror!
---
Too expensive to maintain and develop. Nuclear Winter became the priority.
---
Yeah I realised that about half way through my first run through for the main quest - had about half the codes, before I found that out..
---
The real killer (literally in my case - god knows how often either ) is clearing the silo.   
---
Not sure I want the pain of repeating that experience..
---
like all things in the game, if you have a build for it, then it will work. I have a gunslinger build that can hit for 2k damage with a 10mm pistol and 4k damage with a .44 and you don't want to know what the blackpowder pistol does.....
---
So I should find you everytime and retrieve my cores ü§£
---
I'm not a bloody build so I suspect it'll take me longer, if at all, to solo him. Still, this does give me hope that the stealh hits will work. Many thanks for this.
---
This is the way.
---
Burned
---
I've only done this event once, and there were only 3 of us.  I'm right around level 200, there was one other around my same level, then a level 35 dressed in full golf gear.  I thought it was hilarious the 35 was there, but honestly I was too busy running around and spraying prime .308 to pay attention to how he was doing.
---
IMO this event is easier and less frustrating to complete than the ISS one is.  You don't need to rely on others to do things, you just show up and shoot anything that moves.
---
Murloc plushie!!! Cool
---
Same with the laser musket from F4. Vault boy has o e on his back for a frame from legendary run.
---
NCR armor skins have been better then all the crappy things have come out since then. Literally a used rug? Wtf!
---
except for some stuff like gauss pistols, shotguns and miniguns, and secret service armor, it's completely random.
---
and even with those the only thing you control is the weapon/armor type.
---
Thx to foodbuild 1st ;)
---
A fatman or a fatman? Becouse both are the same but different, both can be shoved where the sun don't shine but one feels good while the others just painful
---
The problem is that Bethesda wants to make it feel like its needed. We know it's not, but the feeling of pressure for Fallout 1st is always there.
---
You're right by the way, I'm not that old as it just very recently became legal for me to drink. I just feel like a game we've dropped money on already shouldn't require (or beg) us to spend more money. I love the idea of the Scrapbox being a storage unit separate from the main stash, but I feel like it should've already been there, y'know? Something to add flavor to your C.A.M.P.
---
Nope. You can't roll for specific anything. It's all rng. The closest you can get is stuff like the ss armour or gauss mini gun that you craft as a random 1-3* legendary
---
Cool, will see if I can track some of that down next time I'm in the game!
---
Is the 3 head thing rare?
---
After a bunch of events so far, the only thing missing is the heads totem camp item, which I don't care about anyway, except to 100% the plans collection.
---
I got a ton of shovels and pick axes which I just sell cheap.
---
The only thing I haven't got yet from a drop was the plushie, which I ended up finding for 200 caps in someone's vendor and snagged that immediately.
---
The plushie is the only thing I cared about, he's hanging out with the plushie crew watching TV in my living room.
---
Nice. The most I've gotten was three in a blast zone by Whitespring and they all left the server. My camp got nuked shortly after. Good times.
---
It shouldn't take that long to clip in. I've never been able to transplant a camp successfully, even flat builds. My camps nowadays are multi levels built into the environment, so they're pretty proprietary. If I move camp, I assume I'm starting from scratch.
---
Clearly didn't read post properly they  kept getting gun bashed and shot at as well as all the emotes for nearly 4 mins.
---
Last time I did the silo it nearly ended in divorce (I kid you not.. The Mrs almost went Nuclear on me that night...)
---
This morning I got a Vampire's Ultracite Galting Laser with 25% FFR and 15% faster reload. Doesn't suit my current build, but definitely hanging on to it.
---
At camps with outrageous vender prices I leave a bag with one raw fertilizer and a Molotov cocktail on the doorstep If the prices are really high I add an ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been insulted‚Äù. If it‚Äôs prices like 10mm rounds for 7 caps or mounted radroach plans for 500 caps then I leave the bag  on the bed so they know it‚Äôs deliberate.
---
Once you learn the layout it becomes very easy. If you use 3 ranks of hacker you can shut down the turrets and turn off some of the robots. If you have 3 ranks of Lockpick you can bypass the reactor core part all together.
---
Ohhhh gotcha, well that sucks :( 
---
At least you got some pictures of him though! That‚Äôs pretty nice bc you didn‚Äôt have to worry about being attacked.
---
Let's go
---
I just need to know where to go after we kill him. I have been unable to find the exit twice now!
---
I'd hold on to it.  You never know what's going to change on the PTS.
---
The last few weeks my Medic Handmade has only worked occasionally. I do critical hits all the time with my Medic gun, so it‚Äôs not user error. 
---
Just last night doing A Colossal Problem the Medic‚Äôs Legendary effect neither healed my teammates or myself. Going to retire my Medic Commando until it‚Äôs fixed.
---
It‚Äôs only at workshops currently. They removed it from camps due to traps and such
---
I wish there were more information about the Wendigo Colossus. Since it has 3 heads, does it require 3 wendigo/people to form 1 colossus? If one of those heads is Earle, who are the other two heads, or are they all three Earle?
---
Thanks! I'm just stoked that I have a My Bloody Valentine cosplay ready for the Halloween event
---
I'm not Bloodied or even Junkie's, for one. Don't use chems either.
---
I think there's something wrong with energy heavies. can't confirm myself, but I think the heavy gunner perks aren't being applied.
---
could be a stupid bid to nerf legacies, who knows.
---
I second the others that commented on playing on a team. Use the Builders teams, you get 4x XP from nearly everything if you get a full group. I still solo, as do the large majority of the "teams". Its rare anyone has their mic on too, and you can mute those that are talking if you just want to solo.
---
The single best XP event and the reason the groups are important (and the builders group especially) is the Line in the Sand event. When you have 4x on your team and the mobs start spawning directly over the sonic generator in a big group, 2-3 shots with a weak explosive weapon tags every one of them. Once they die, you get 1000's of XP over the course of the entire event. I'm a higher level char, and I still level at least 1-2 times on this event if they are spawning in this manner. Even if they spawn at the fence lines, you can still easily level every time you join this event with a quick explosive weapon hit to tag everything before they die.
---
Ur right, I‚Äôm still gonna do it, but ur right
---
Thanks for the PTSD asshole
---
Merry fasnacht, happy fasnacht. Hooray!
---
Damn that's awesome luck! I'm still missing the skin rug and meat pile but I'm hopeful I'll get those soon
---
Nope, you wont lose your junk. As soon as the escape timer expires you will load right outside the mine and the event completion will pop up. You will be in the nuke zone though, so either be in PA or a rad suit/stealth suit because if you do die after you load out then you would drop your junk/flux.
---
Re: My husband convinced me to have sex on my period. Hence, *Bloodied*
---
Since ACP was released, every time I've logged into the game, there have been at least 2 nukes launched to run the event (PS4). People are launching them as often as possible. 
---
Point is: no, you don't have to, because someone else will.
---
Interesting theory like becoming one with RNG
---
If you're on XB, I've got at least 1 piece of it I put into my vendor yesterday.
---
What were you aiming for?
---
I'm on Xbox myself so if you ever need someone to run it with I do it every time I can. It's a ton of fun with the right group and I've managed to pull it off with a group of 3 and 4 now.
---
Can you please send me your perk loadout? (nukes and dragons is a good way) I've got to be missing something here.
---
Adult dwellers unite! Together, we can rule 34 the heck out of 76! 
---
Oh, wait... Sorry, my bad. Reading titles and skipping the post is never a good idea, eh?
---
I'd say the vault dwellers are pretty united. As is the same in all communities, the small, angry minority, is usually the loudest. The folks that are just playing the game, enjoying themselves, minding their own business have less reason to post on Reddit than AngryGamer343 that "did once see what a person with glitched shoes GRRRR!"
---
I know what you did there.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know that haha. Was there a gold bot somewhere before? I feel like I‚Äôve seen one before
---
Nocturnal at the proper time gives same boost as junkies but only for a very short period, i have a nocturnal ffr tesla that absolutely melts for about 5 minutes a day
---
i need support when i get need support. try mounting heavy machine gun on classic colum. will go on edge no problem but when you center it on colum, needs support ü§îü§®üò°üòñüò≠
---
Dude, you should totally start a reddit/social media page to promote your own event!!
---
Be funny watching video clips or participating in large groups, jumping off together !! Successfully or... well fail also lmao
---
LOL an efficient miner always brings a backup
---
I get so much shit I‚Äôll take anything good at this point üòÇ actually looking for TSE LMG.
---
Pretty sure you can just buy it in the enclave bunker
---
Vault 94 will be open for exploration in the next update.
---
Idk I just know they made the insaltbot gold with wastelanders release
---
My gunslinger build has one. Head shot wendigos (crowd control) instead of attacking Earle.
---
My heavy gunner perks are working fine.
---
I tried this with a low level character last night and just couldn't put the damage out to finish him. Got him about 60% of the way down. I am sure I can do it with my bloodied commando or my HW guy now though.
---
Wow that sounds amazing if I ever get over the pond I shall keep it in mind
---
Depends on the weapon and your build.
---
I have a bloodied explosive 10mm that's ridiculous.
---
Also a have a sweet instigating explosive western revolver
---
I generally buy anything that's bloodied and has either the instigating/explosive/2shot modifier in addition. They won't be main weapons, but are great for weaker mobs so as not to wear your main weapon and ammo down.
---
a cheap explosive 10mm or other fast shooting/reloading handgun is excellent for tagging enemies in big group battles (like line in the sand, or scorchbeast queen and hitting all the mobs all over the place).
---
Will do, thanks!
---
So I was waiting for this.  
---
I'm lvl 28 and I saw one of my team freaking out last night.  Being a good vault dweller I fast travelled to help them. And find myself stuck in the goddamn event.
---
I stuck with revving players and tickling the wendigo with the best weapon I had.  I blew through most of my ammo and stimpacks just to keep trying to keep alive so I could rev other players.
---
It's certainly a rough transition from FO4 grab everything you see to memorizing what's in each scrap and only take those. I can definitely tell when a FO1st member has scrounged through an area or when it's a non FO1st. Completely cleaned out or just missing lead and oil items.
---
the raider collectron is the closest we have so far.  it'll tell you to stop and to get out of it's way.  It also mentions that it wants to burn down your camp.
---
According to a datamine posted on here around a week ago the heads have a 9.5% drop chance and the mining mask has a 5% chance.
---
in the PTS I mean. can you confirm heavy gunner perks are actually adding damage to gatling plasmas and lasers?
---
Was Bethesda support any help with this bug? I have the exact same problem.
---
West Virginia is a beautiful state! Definitely worth a visit.
---
Oh On the PTS. I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what you meant. In that case I have no idea.
---
Well crap.  I was going to do a photo series of my current CAMP build in the next day or two, now I have to try to remember to link it in a reply on this...
---
Luck doesn't give you better odds unfortunately.
---
Considering a large database tracks most things in most games and other software, they can tell if you created it all or not. I wouldn't worry about it.
---
Not all of us are as delusional as this... member. Modus will deal with him properly.
---
What if there was a place with all the zip of Nuka-Cola? 
---
Wouldn't that be the cheer-cheer-cheeriest place in all the world!
---
Where the river's made of Quantum, and the mountaintops are fizz. 
---
With fun and games and rides for all the moms and pops and kids...
---
I was so happy to find the plushie makes a noise when you activate it haha. I actually really like the colossus heads totem for some reason; might be that they twitch every few seconds. Very creepy.
---
I've gotten 3 cursed pickaxes so besides keeping one for a collection the others got scripped. The 90% reduced weight actually makes them a great source for scripping cause of the 3 star exchange rate but minimal stash hit.
---
Yes it didn‚Äôt do anything special for me the next day
---
Option for push to talk is there for a reason people
---
I'm in the boat of cleaning things out, not because I can, but because I have to as of now. I played FO76 B.E.T.A on the PS4 and got tired of the main game there, but due to a couple friends and my S/O taking an interest in playing games together, we saw FO76 on sale and said "why not?".
---
The screams of my enemies
---
Or appalachia radio, i like to switch
---
Oh so that's why. Thank you a LOT. I'm going to get rid of Healing Factor.
---
I've been doing that event for a while, and I usually just sit on the pillar next to the Bridge. I feel like the event was somehow changed recently, before I could sit on that pillar and let all of the ghouls focus on the bridge speaker. But, I've been to a few of them and the ghouls seem like they're more all over the place now. But, I can still complete the event easily by chanting a calming phrase until my mauve-colored cloud goes away and focus on my pillar at the bridge. 
---
I can't seem to meditate enough there to affect what legendaries drop, though. 
---
Only RNGesus can do that.
---
Thats game logic my friend have you ever played Elite dangerous?
---
I first learned about the story of the wendigo from the horror game Until Dawn (HIGHLY recommended!), I was so happy to see them in this game too. Such an awesome supernatural creature.
---
What is the colossal event
---
I was hoping someone else thats on ps4 sees this and helps you, and someone already dide, awesome!
---
Have you completed the A Colossal Problem event before?
---
because the children of atom dont exist yet. that is unless there is a retcon coming at some point.
---
Yes always
---
With all the camp changes, I'm surprised this isn't the case yet. Your character is able to break into pre-war military bunkers, befriend every faction in the state, launch an endless stream of nuclear missiles, create any weapon you can imagine by hand, construct mansions by hand...but cutting down a tree that isn't already turned to logs is beyond our comprehension, it seems
---
I posted a suggestion a while back that would work perfect with that, it was a drop bag skin the was a flaming paper bag. You know, that way you can really let them know how you feel.
---
There was a time that doing stuff in adventure mode gave you packs for nw. When I first played nw, I had like 60
---
I would love something like this. If I see the owner came back later on, I will go back there just to emote some love for their camp in front of them. I enjoy when people do it to my camp while I'm there too.
---
If lowbies visit my camp and show it some love, I drop a ton of stuff for them as a gift.
---
Do you know if there's a FO76 subreddit that might be better for creating a social event like this for players?
---
It would be great to get a bunch of people together even if it's an unofficial event.
---
I concur, but I've definitely seen the same vibe on Destiny and ESO subreddits. It's everywhere, no matter what, unfortunately. My only post was an apology to someone that I thought was a potential hacker, but they likely weren't at all. Other than that, I peruse for interesting information since I only started playing about a month ago. Carry on, Vault Dwellers!
---
Would definitely be fun, maybe not useful, but fun. Lol
---
Playing with friends is great. Two of us have FO1st so they dump there junk on us and we all just share.
---
Nope. Did all their troubleshooting steps including power cycle, Nat/connection settings, reinstalling game, deleting saved game file. They have escalated the report to a specialized tech team apparently.
---
I'm lvl 86 and I only tried the event twice, I didn't feel prepared and don't understand how lower levels continue to try
---
Nope all major rewards are given at the end. The trunk will give you caps and ore
---
She still hadnt found her dad and you are trying to hook up. Thats some shit there.
---
Nice, hoping the One Wasteland change works well, it certainly sounds like a great QOL on paper.
---
Eh, 8 treasury notes cuts down on the grind. SBQ takes just as long and only gives half that. Legendary rewards are better from colossal problem, too. Idk about actually launching the nuke, but if anybody starts the event I'll join in
---
I do not sorry, just fire off the idea as I saw your post. 
---
But I imagine if you just search any and all groups would pop up.
---
That's a good use for it! I never thought of the capabilities of just sharing an infinite amount of junk.
---
Yeah come on my bed, ignore the plushie of your dad
---
*This* is why I prefer the Enclave over the BoS. I mean, yeah, Enclave did some wacky stuff too, but you can almost see why they did it.
---
Not on consoles that im aware of.
---
I used to come just to revive people if I die I respawn I do tag but now as a level 55 10 of those levels are from scorchbeasts I wreck them with my flamer and Gatling plasma if they die do not revive them but do not push them away I mean you always give them a bunch of gifts (one time some dude gave me a fat man when I was outside the vault) this is effectively a free gift
---
Username checks out
---
Lay in front of the fireplace on this rug made if his skin....
---
I often don't know what's good and what's not, so I may be pricing my things low. Not bothered if it's worth something and someone sells for higher. I got it for free, and I am not wanting for caps, so I say feel free. 
---
Did have someone buy something from my vendor, only to give it back to me. Didn't think it was that good, so I still don't know other than just being nice :P
---
Making everything upgraded to be the same as other broken builds is not a good idea for balance esp. when things are too powerful as is.
---
How will they even add 4 of 5 star weapons when weapons are already godlike at 3 star?
---
Do you balance the game around bloodied unyielding or do you balance content around everything else like mutant or nocturnal?
---
For example if you make it balanced around bloody unyielding then all other builds will have a very difficult time winning making it so players will run bloodied predominately. Everything else will be seen as too weak.
---
If you balance it around everything else then bloody builds will make almost everything in the game esp, boss battles too easy since most people run bloodied.
---
So balance isn't really a "us vs them" type of argument, it's something you have to consider when deciding  damage thresholds when designing content for the game.
---
Otherwise players will blow through your content making it too easy for certain builds while making it too hard for others.
---
Finally boosting all effects to be as powerful as bloody or other builds will just make the devs have to boost health of enemies so they can actually pose a challenge, making the buff pointless.
---
Would be great if it did do more! Just gives you more Condition on Weapons &amp; Armor you find. Boooo!
---
It does? I guess kinda.
---
I just run for Earl to grab the loot, and if I die, I die... I still complete the event. Making it out doesn't matter since you don't drop your loot in a global event anyway. Making it out doesn't grant you anything extra, and dying is just the quick warp you were looking for anyway LOL.
---
I guess the only thing you should be concerned about is if you died enough times that the timer goes long and you miss the event completion. I had this happen once, and someone was kind enough to run BACK IN and save me! (not even on my team).
---
Its like 6 or 7k caps.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve done it three times. Is that the reason?
---
Pull the string of the plushie, it's the sound your father made while i was shooting at him multiple times
---
thanks man, I really appreciate it!
---
r/Angryupvote
---
It's an old old wooden ship. Used during the Civil War.
---
Is this why I also have 60 fresh packs?
---
It's a glitch that rolls around every so often. You just get a bunch of Card Packs.
---
You didn't do anything malicious, they just messed up and gave you a bunch of stuff for free.
---
I thought it was the scorchbeast
---
Thank you! I always do :)
---
I've been playing with One Wasteland in the PTS as a high-level character, and it's awesome. Enemies in the Forest, Ash Heap, and Toxic Valley all scale up to level 50, so you have sooo many more options for grinding XP without worrying about West-Tek or Whitesprings already being cleared out. Grafton Steel is a great spot now for example, and events like Lode Baring or Collision Course or even Back on the Beat are more worthwhile now.
---
I haven't played with it as much on a low-level character, but it seems like the midgame hump where the difficulty spikes around level 30ish is gone too.
---
On PC? I have a bunch on an alt.
---
You might get banned since you clearly abused an exploit intentionally. You knew you were not supposed to have and proceeded to open up 60 packs ‚Äúby accident‚Äù, which gives you advantage over others players by ranking up.
---
Send a letter to Bethesda and explain the situation, see what they can do for you. You better off explaining the situation than waiting for them to discover it later
---
No karma needed, thank you! :)
---
I too like the weight reduction, but just don't use slower melee weapons (bloodied long range build). I guess I could start swapping some of the older weapons out for a shovel or pickaxe for just the weight reduction, like scrap a powerfist or sledge or something.
---
You actually do get XP for all that stuff. It is just such a trivial amount that it is not worth the bother
---
This really piques my interest, because i am a vampire heavy build.
---
I have a super optimized stealth bloodied commando With Bffr less vats cost fixer does it take you a while to Kill earl or is it pretty fast and about how much ammo do you need for a run if you don‚Äôt mind me asking. I was thinking about trying this tonight
---
Scrap stuff
---
It occurred every hour at the top of the hour.  Did you just go to the location? I can't believe it never showed up for you as I never saw a server without it.
---
I assume this is recent right? It just started happening to me in the last day or so. What‚Äôs worse is you have to quit the game after it fails to join. 
---
I guess I‚Äôll file a ticket as well. I‚Äôm just worried support will break my account. I hope your problem is resolved.
---
Now come and stroke my sac.
---
I miss you survival mode! How I long for the excitement of trying to sell at a train station without getting ganked. The thrill of trying to buy from another players vendor when they had turrets to try and stop me. The rare compassion  shown by those who tbaged you but left your junk behind.
---
Yeah, that's how I got mine.  I think it's 7k caps.  It's not cheap, for sure.
---
You didn't send him a message telling him to mute?
---
Oh wow thank you!
---
I just posted a question asking for these numbers specifically thank you
---
You really do not need crops I just have them to gift the low levels in fact most of the time one small water purifier pretty much is all you need
---
So that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs no level cap in ACP. It won‚Äôt be needed with the next patch.
---
While I agree with you, the best way they would see that would be for themselves and that is my goal here, let them experience the event and decide.
---
I am actually excited about that. Can finally show off your rare stuff... 
---
... that everyone in the game also has :(
---
"wow do you have something in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?"
---
"Yeah i've got my gatling gun down there, couldn't drop it, 3 stars"
---
Friend of mine told me about the beauty of using born survivor 1. Seems I‚Äôm not going back now
---
Wow.... yah.. I‚Äôve heard all kinds of stuff when people leave their mics on.  I heard one during line in the sand, where it sounded like someone was being scolded for not washing their hands after they‚Äôd been out and about.  Couldn‚Äôt tell if both of them were playing or the dad was behind him scolding him.  I don‚Äôt have a mic, so it‚Äôs a little funny to me.  A couple days ago there was this duo messing with me at the cookoff and then another duo at someones camp while I was vendor hopping.  I just pretend I can‚Äôt hear them.... makes it funnier.  The latter was convinced that the reason I wasn‚Äôt responding was because he had his mic turned off...
---
I love Ace. 
---
"Get. Out. Of. My. Way."
---
How disgusting is to buy something and do whatever you want with it? Gotta be the most disgusting thing imaginable.
---
Keep at it. I saw someone mentioning it took them 44 tries to get all the new loot.
---
Thanks for the idea!
---
Guns and bullets 3 and 7
---
Edit: i am officially an idiot
---
I don‚Äôt actually, I was just using the analogy cause it fit (it was a good one tyvm.) But no, I fucking love dogs, and giving a pupper one last treat is most certainly not a waste.
---
This year? I only see it referenced from last year.
---
I have seen a post about 3 bloodied commando guys killing Earle in 12 seconds with b2525 and unyielding sets. No magic or hacked guns. I have also seen my buddy hit 800+ with AA/40P Grognak Axe. They are definitely viable, just needs some buffs/foods!
---
What exactly is going wrong? Ive seen a lot of people say that specific task is pretty messy and I think they're planning on fixing it in some form.
---
The nice thing is you don't need to follow the game's main plot, so until this specific issue gets figured out you can just explore and have fun elsewhere without it holding you up.
---
Don't throw away the fact that if you can still join and 1-2 shot wendigo's that this helps those guys that stand there with tanky builds and the melting canon weapons to survive. Everyone benefits.
---
I also only join the event if there's a busy server and people seem to be going to all the big events.
---
Second this. I‚Äôm obsessed with having a Mirelurk King as my pet.
---
I just told one of my gaming buddies about it he said it happened to him too.
---
I honestly didn't even look at his name.  I was going about my business.  He wasn't at the console anymore as he clearly had walked away from the game his character just stood there not moving and I could hear him walking around.  I am not sure he would have gotten it in time anyway.  But I will do that if it happens again.
---
No there isn't one on console, but most mics these days have a built in mic switch or a push to talk button on their cord. Also a bit easier to pull the cord out of the controller than a PC when the cord is plugged into a specialized port in the back of the PC.
---
I play both formats, not a fan of having to crawl under my desk do unplug or plug in something. Getting too old for that crap. Lol
---
My headset works for both PC and console which is a win.
---
The intended meaning definitely fit just... poor dogs
---
Its a Nbashfr, but still couldnt lose the 40 scrip....
---
This is an important aspect of Fallout. The Dream Vault in FO3 really stuck with me. Also the unfinished one with the Ghoul Overseer that is a workshop in 4 was awesome.
---
Some people didn‚Äôt get even banned for duping last time around so why would this get him a ban?  It‚Äôs not like they seem to care too much about nuclear winter or PvP these days anyway.  No he doesn‚Äôt need to write a letter... He should take the W and move on.
---
I will definitely let you know, thank you!
---
Ah okay glad to hear I‚Äôm not in any real trouble, thanks.
---
I‚Äôm telling you, it doesn‚Äôt allow it. You might have the other options of collectron unlocked which allows it, but if you‚Äôre like me and only have the Communist collectron, you can not select what it scavenges.
---
Edit: I‚Äôll send a screenshot later today showing the terminal only having the singular option.
---
Would that make him a ‚Äúscorched scorched scorched conquerer?‚Äù
---
Yeah I‚Äôm saving them for when some new LTO NW items drop for the extra XP they award.
---
Bc they children of atom aren't around for another 180 or so years.
---
We decided to go with Disciples of the Glow.
---
He‚Äôs just being a troll, don‚Äôt bother with him.
---
I bought a turtle beach when the console fist came out 7 years ago, so no ptt on it. Last nught i kept having coughing fits while playing, so i just pulled my mic out. Almost like a ptt, can just yank my mic when i dont want people to hear me.
---
Oh so they fixed the weird level 25 scaling issue in the lower level regions?
---
You can still toggle your headset mute on/off.   Source: i play on xb1 and every pair of headphones ive ever used has been able to be muted either directly through a slider/button or ingame options
---
This sub is so different from the fallout expirence it is get gifted 20 power armour chassis full to the brim with the best armour and 10 legendary guns from a lvl 300 then go kill a Earl then raid a whitespring nuke zone have a laugh by sitting on the wasteland loveseat  with no clothes or armour equipped and inviting that lvl 300 over then repeat
---
And then as you‚Äôre just trying to do the defense event because no other events are popping someone comes along and kills you for poops n gigs...couldn‚Äôt just wait for the event to end and then retake so people get another bite at the event apple.  Maybe Im just over-sensitive though.
---
Truly, I can‚Äôt even imagine the jackass who came up with it. Probably lacking in the empathy department.
---
Fair enough. xD
---
Strong disliked that
---
I believe it is. I played NW last night and also had the 60 packs. Only difference is that it was after my first time completing ACP. Given how many people on here have mentioned the 60 packs recently, I think it's gotta be tied to ACP somehow.
---
Or just keep moving. Or stand on top of the outhouse.
---
Do it, lol. Im planning to get signs and letters to spell out dont fear the mothman on my barn church
---
I'm really excited for One Wasteland. Uranium Fever will be so much more popular once this hits. :3
---
Exactly, I use a hyper x, been using it for 5 to 6 years myself, it was a way better headset than the TB I had on 350. But it also was much more expensive.
---
I've seen this suggestion and maybe it works at workshops, but it doesn't seem super effective at CAMPs. I have 6 scarecrows at my CAMP, unless you spawn inside my home, you can't get to any of my stuff without walking past a scarecrow. All the enemies stroll right past to destroy my collectron and junk collector instead.
---
Yeah, yesterday is the first time since launch that i unmuted the chat volume.  At launch it was filled with people yelling and such so I just turned it all the way down and that's where it's been since.  But 2 guys in pub team were chatting so I turned it on to see if they were off somewhere they needed help.  They were like 70 and 19.  Then one guy left to mow grass.  So I went to camp to finish up when all this went down.
---
It seems like if you don't have the mic icon people just assume you can't hear them.
---
There's a tunnel with EXIT sign, even though I did it multiple times it still takes me a circle run to spot it. You do not actually have to run away to get rewards by the way, game will automatically teleport you out when timer runs out. So far I did not lose any junk but I can't say for certain that you won't.
---
Very excited for one wasteland. As a level 380 it'll be great to have more of the map to get back to exploring, also a lot more events to do that'll be worth while
---
Ha! You petrified corpse.
---
I like this idea so much that even though I took a decent break from the game, I'd buy atoms with cash money for it.
---
They should come out with a Nuka Cola dispenser with a robot charge station attached.
---
Thank you, you should definitely come join and experience the event yourself.
---
I feel like the extra heads are really just there, and connected to the same "brain"  like theyre basically just extra sets of eyes and mouths.
---
Mostly getting this vibe cause the heads never seem to disagree with each other.  You'd think that one of them would be trying to eat while the others are like "kill this fool".
---
Of course that's all speculation and it could just be the bethesda didnt want a boss that fought itself as much as it fought you.  As fun as that might be.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ me too
---
I have died twice after the event when the ceiling fell on me while I was looking for the exit. It put me outside and I still got the rewards, but I want to try to get the chest in the future as well.
---
Correct. I sold it through an online trading forum (no RMT transactions permitted).
---
But I bought it initially from a player‚Äôs vending machine.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs related to other items in your inventory,  idk just a guess.  How much stuff you got on you man?  Those dudes with WWR sets are almost impossible to trade with.  I‚Äôve seen some of ya‚Äôlls inventory. I‚Äôm literally afraid to open the trade window
---
&gt; Should be more dangerous enemies. Why would I abandon a workshop to molerats? Now a pack of deathclaw or assaultrons... I also think that if it is more than two waves then the last wave should have a legendary.
---
Now that we have Blood Eagles, I think they should exclusively be what takes workshops now. It doesn't make sense that molerats would take over my workshop or even attack it. I'm supposed to believe that molerats want to destroy everything, but they ignore most of the world around them. They won't destroy the house placed by Bethesda in a workshop, but they will destroy a house I made. 
---
I get why that happens of course, but it doesn't make any good sense. And now we have a great out, Blood Eagles would certain want my workshop, and they would certainly wreck my shit just to wreck it. I guess waves of robots could make some sense too. Just really sick of animals that seem to want to mine lead taking over my workshops :D
---
You should join for colossal event as well! I'll do the first run in approximately 2 hours. Will add you as soon as I get on.
---
Full stop. I can change it from junk or scrap, to other options? What is this sorcery?
---
I'm in the same boat... Must complete all the things!
---
I just finished the run a few days ago and took the time off from questing to build a new super detailed house, sort junk, re-think my inventory/selling/gathering daily chores, etc.
---
I'm considering skipping the dailies now until the next run starts since I don't think we get anything from them after completing the run?
---
Is that against Earl?
---
Alright, I'll try and get on and join you if I can make it
---
I would definitely buy a flaming brown bag drop skin at full price as soon as it was available.
---
You can't actually get her to come to your camp right?
---
September 10
---
No, just a little joke about impaling her father's head
---
Not mentioning the Gauntlet, the Power Fist's little brother that nonetheless is better because I can make 40 of them until I get a nice shiny one.
---
What's FOMO?
---
I have the Signs and letters plan I‚Äôd be willing to trade the right items for. You on PS4?
---
Omg. My response.... so sorry. Yeah, I get it now.
---
Gotta keep starched genes on the distortion eq
---
This x1000. This sub would be better if certain things were filtered into megathreads or outright deleted. There should be a huge megathread with common ‚ÄúBethesda plz‚Äù requests, and another where people can just go mad with complaints. The way this sub goes I doesn‚Äôt even feel like moderators exist.
---
You know what, when I was on last night it didn‚Äôt reset for me either...
---
No, you really don't get me.
---
I think you're on the right track. Some items seems to take up more resources, might be another item in a different section. I had to get rid of everything that I had that was optional, and it did get better.
---
Electrified Gauntlet with sneak attacks
---
Someone from the PTS told me that heavy gunner perks were not working on the plasma.  I sincerely hope this is the case as I own a lot of plasmas.
---
Dunno, I have a bunch of scarecrows in my garden outside because random Radstags and molerats kept nimbling on my crops. It stoped, now they attack the scarecrows, and they get attacked by turrets, so my crops in my camp are safe it seems ü§î
---
If you are helping others in some way, I'm all good. Just please don't hide in the corner.  ;)
---
Fear of missing out, I believe.
---
That's because you need to buy the other collectrons to be able to select other options lol
---
That isnt the same as ptt, and my headset, nor the headset that comes with the console, has this feature that im aware of. In game muting is slow in comparison to me just yanking my mic out, which is a separate one from the headphones.
---
redownload the game. the update literally corrupted my data files but after redownload it‚Äôs working a lot better
---
Im not a food build im a bloodied commando and i was using a bloodied tesla and he was using a explosive gat plas so i waited for him to reload to attack so he didnt have time to attack.
---
Yup it started for me about two days ago. I also have to restart the game after I fail to join and the error message pops up.
---
I was on drums and had people starting throwing grenades at me. Dumbasses. Then about 10 of them ran around trying to kill all of the same creatures.
---
When you turn your back to them, they'll appear right behind you and suck the life out of you.
---
Exactly! That seems to be the case. I'm interested in seeing how they balance the "they can meaningfully contribute now but it will be tougher for them so there's still merit in leveling and getting good gear" dichotomy of this change. Either way, besides ACP, I'm also hopeful that this will revitalize some dead events in the game. I'm itching for a solid Project Paradise run.
---
Best suggestion so far
---
It did make me chuckle.
---
Yeah, make leveling up harder still.
---
I'm free tomorrow and I can tank for you if you want! (t65 heavy guns max health build)
---
Ign PC: Gaeus
---
Gillman lumber mill in the forest?  I was having trouble yesterday and I accidentally stumbled upon it.  Inside/outside, there was a ton!
---
If you were helpful, then you were doing your job. I'm ok with that, it's the players who storm in and do no damage/no reviving or healing that upset me.
---
Yup! Changed it a couple days ago on PTS from what I've seen.
---
But the true MVP is the Communist Fence
---
Go to the right of the island, there's a little shelter looking thing, that's where the bobblehead would normally be. Alternatively, use that bobblehead perk in Perception to home in.
---
I‚Äôve never seen one from MODUS
---
Yes I am enjoying the fence
---
I thought that too, I tried it and it made no difference which lead to me being even more confused lol
---
oh cool! Thanks for the heads up :)
---
Sleeping in the wrong bed will guarantee a disease üëå
---
I put all turrets on the ground because of this. Easier to deal with.
---
Haha, that's me alright. I emptied 99% of my inventory out thinking of that issue and it's still going
---
Aww, I escorted him &amp; Chally away from the area and helped him fight the Liberators near Vault 76. üòî
---
You're one very dedicated man. Try to put this in the pts, Bethesda reads it more.
---
Thanks, I'll get looking and dropping stuff!
---
The neon sign plans are from vendor bots. Just have to keep checking them
---
Get a few shots in on Earle, then concentrate on the spawns and reviving any "heavy hitters" who may go down. Kill enough spawns and loot them afterwards, and you'll wind up with more stims than you started with, no matter how many times you revive someone.
---
Correction: The bonus for making it out is the loot box near the entrance that opens up after beating Earle. Other than that there's no extra reward, and I don't know if its loot pool is anything special or not.
---
On XB1 and have been having this issue since launch. Sometimes the inventory bugs out and doesn't show the actual items when I'm scrolling through -- just the names and data -- and it's hella faster. This suggests it's likely chugging trying to load all the graphical assets for stuff in your inventory/stash. Would be nice if they'd put in an option to disable that, because at this point I know what a fucking mole miner's gauntlet looks like.
---
Thanks my man
---
Ahhhh I didn‚Äôt fully understand your original post, my bad. Somehow I missed: 
---
&gt;whatever options you have unlocked regardless of appearance using the terminal on its pod.
---
I got mod plans for the Tenderizer but never the weapon itself.
---
Same.
---
For me it's aid that is extremely laggy.  I dumped a lot and it still happens.  None of the menus are actually crisp or nice to browse.
---
I mean, sort of, on lower level enemies, under the right circumstances? Revolvers are simply not viable in the end game, even with a good build. The gauss pistol is pretty good, but it has really short range. So you can use that in some situations fairly effectively. But like taking on a SBQ or ISS or WC with revolvers? Nah. Even the gauss pistol sort of needs a min-maxed build for that to work
---
My issue is DC and people not pulling weight on the spawn and leaving it to 1 person
---
And I wondered why I had more than a hundred a month ago, while being level 25 in NW... I have around 500 lvls on 3 toons on Adventure mode. I've unlocked every cards in NW and I still have 30 overseers points.
---
I thought the event marker went away if you did not make it before the 8 players filled up.
---
Sorry, was posting on my phone. I have added my build to the main post.
---
Yeah, I'm on XB1 too, I was wondering if it could just be like an asset overload, simply too much for the xbox to handle lol
---
Interesting, wonder why it is delayed anyway
---
Yeah he explodes. And for me anyway, I see people kicking around his body parts making it hard to find haha
---
Now you've gone and done it. They will update that in a patch note that he finally fixed the mailbox and this sub will implode from comments about how they fixed that but not the fast travel bug.  :)
---
Yeah, big oof. Hopefully he's alright.
---
In the next update Vault 94 will be open and they already mentioned that they have plans to open the 51 and also make it explorable
---
ahhh okay that's probably why, i'm still doin all those. been taking my time so i just did the "speak to overseer at level 20" at level 66 lol
---
Nope it was there from the beginning
---
the lowly xbox.  I have a one x as well as 76 on an external SSD and still have these issues.
---
What kind of weapons have the best affect on it? I have a bloodied Gauss shotgun that one shots pretty much everything except the very top tier of enemies. I probably could have taken it down eventually with it but it would have taken probably over 2k rounds to do it.
---
Let me share my upvote with you comrade.  
---
Wait...wrong communists...ohwell, still, take it.
---
Yes! Hoping for a FAT event revival
---
Earle didn't want to eat his already dead friend to survive and cried about doing it. All he deserves is a swift end. A true disgrace to all of us proud cannibals!
---
No but you are a mofo, grats!
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; What A$$PwNr69 is doing with 100 ammo factories is between him and Bethesda. There is no reason for you to shut down reddit just for catching him.
---
To be fair, that can lag the shit out of a server.  Still no reason to come on here and start a witch hunt, but they should be reporting that nonsense to BGS.
---
Much literature and dramas have explored this topic, what do when your loved one got turned into a monster. FO took a brutal approach as expected lol
---
Def. This. My medics double barrel works great. I'm not sure but I think automatic lasers work pretty well too, seems like the crit is on a group of beams.
---
I got it at a low level when I was desperate for lead... It didn't even drop any...üòî
---
They didn't do anything for the World Scout Jamboree which took place in West Virginia last year, and they had plenty of time to prepare a Pioneer Scout update, I doubt they would take the time out of Update 22 to make anything major on such a short notice sadly...
---
Or one of those stands from fallout 4 that bring in traders
---
I played around with it a little bit. It might be worth reworking my build for.
---
I'm starting to wonder if it's an Xbox related issue, not strong enough to handle the inventory assets. Someone else mentioned it could be an asset overload
---
Wait, really, so if 2 players from 2 different teams join an Earl fight, literally no one else not on those teams will be able to join that instance? That explains a lot.....
---
The Neon Letters can be found in the Whitesprings shopping area, at the brown store with two bots and BoS mentioned on the sign outside. Finally got mine last night, 9200 caps with full Hard Bargain.
---
At the end of the day do what's fun, but right now not having a public group is basically penalizing yourself.
---
You don't actually need to do anything with your group, and just for being grouped you get:
---
Herd Mentality for +2 to all stats even if grouped alone, +3 with Strange in Numbers (+4-6%xp)  
---
More fast travel points  
---
Up to +4 intelligence (8% xp boost)  
---
25% stronger mutations if someone else has them, and almost everyone is running several  
---
Often free shared perks  
---
Free caps when other people finish quests  
---
I think a tiny bit of free XP when other people finish quests  
---
If someone else is in the group, you can slot inspirational for +15%xp  
---
So, if you are built right and hit a well built group just in terms of XP you're looking at 6% (3 int herd) + 4% (extra 2 int from strange+egghead) + 5% (extra from strange and xp food) + 4% (2 extra int on food from strange)  + 8% (4 int from building group) + 15% (inspirational), and I'm probably missing something.   
---
That's more than 40% bonus XP just for being in a group with the right buffs, compared to solo.
---
No lie I‚Äôm sure if a guy named asspwner69 is playing FO76,  that‚Äôs probably exactly what he‚Äôs doing right now xD
---
SAVE THEM FOR THE UP COMING LEGENDARY PERKS.
---
But will Daily Ops and Legendary Perks also be coming in the next update?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs likely ‚Äúwhoever did the most damage in the last 5 seconds‚Äù or something like that.
---
Okay Mods, why you don't remove this post because of rule10 but my post that's almost the same I've posted yesterday?!?! I call bullshit

---
I love this spot, thank you for the info. Didn't die.
---
On the rare occasion I use my mic I have the one from the PS4 Pro that comes with it.  It's 1 earbud type thing, but there is a mute switch on it.  Yanking it out works as well, just everything blares over my sound system.
---
I'm not sure if you know this,  but the perks work in power armor too but if you're melee unarmed,  I can see that being a problem .
---
The mods here are either inactive or lazy as shit. I've called multiple times for megathreads and they never reply, so when something big happens (like issues with Collosal Problem) the sub gets flooded with dozens of redundant posts instead of keeping all the chatter on that topic contained.
---
Grahm had Signs &amp; Letters but I didn't have enough caps so I sold him 2 serums &amp; then he cleaned me out. For blue neon lights I'll probably never use. But... plans. Must. Buy. All. Plans. ü§ì
---
 The Colossus can definitely have the SBQ for breakfast any day, lol.
---
I have been doing it with bloodied melee, at \~20% HP. Most efficient way. Did it in public 5 times on the first day. I can solo it and pretty fast, no bullets, but definitely needs a strong melee build. The colossus has not been able to kill me so far, and the wendigos don't really do noticeable damage on me, so I normally ignore them but their stagger can be annoying. The only thing that can sometimes kill me is fire and acid. It can also be done with a really solid commando build with specific perks; I just did it 3 times yesterday in private with a friend and his friend, both commando. I had never seen anyone do that much damage in public servers with random players. We took it down in about 1 and a half to 2 minutes each time.
---
...Until the nerf comes in.
---
I can help you do this anytime if you shoot me your PSN.
---
If you're on console you can click the triggers and move the slider 25% at a time.
---
They should release a free CAMP item that basically reuses the assets of Book Chute from Old World Blues.
---
Basically a useless device since we can already recycle burnt Pre war books, but the dialogue lines were just too funny. Also the irony would probably kill the Commie Protectron.
---
Which one? There's like 4.
---
There's a possibility that all the explosive effects are causing lag on your system, are you running close to your PS4's drive's capacity?
---
I hate that thing. I always shoot him before he can get close enough to deliver the insult and make me waste time dropping his stupid piece of paper.
---
I bought a turtle beach headset about 7 years ago, most comfortable headset I have ever had. The mic plugs in separately, so when I want to mute, i yank the mic out and set it next to me and still have the headset on.
---
sorry havent seen mail was changed. 
---
Dont give up on CS updates; it might take a bit of time though.
---
I really want that Grafton Monster mask that's in the new treasure hunter drop list.
---
And if you have Empath/Class Freak and are in a real group with another person, you'll take about the same damage as if you had Lone Wanderer solo.  If you both have Empath and Strange you'll take even less.
---
Why it doesn't start at 1 is a real mystery.
---
Fast traveling more than normal?
---
That's probably what it is to be honest.  We can only hope the new system will run the game better but it's just poorly optimized for consoles
---
I know at least one of the guys in the 3 man run was a bloodied commando build but honestly the one who had the highest damage output somehow was a tank build with a gauss minigun. When he started shooting the boss' health bar dropped at a steady rate. We killed him with 13 minutes to spare so pretty fair run for 3 people.  
---
I run a full health heavy guns PA build and my two best guns right now are a Mutants Explosive Minigun and an AA Gatling Plasma. Now that I've got Demo Expert maxed out the ME seems to do really well against Earle and is a HUUUUGE help with the Wendigo spawns. Combined with the contextual ammo drops on them I stay fed with ammo too but I'm still going through around 4k on average if not more.   
---
My Gatling Plasma does great damage to Earle too but can be hard to reliably land all the shots on him while he's moving and definitely harder to guarantee hits on the mobs when they're swarming me. Plasma cores also don't drop yet as context ammo from the spawns so ammo return hurts there too and last run I bled 7 cores dry before it was over. 
---
I'll have to pay more attention when I run it again tonight to see how comparable damage is. I have maxed out stabilized, heavy gunner cards, bloody mess, and demo expert so aside from legendary prefixes and chem buffs my damage output is about as high as I can get it so I'll have a good basis to come up with a definitive answer.
---
So, first thing you need to do is get rid of lone wanderer.  Swap that for inspirational and strange in numbers and always share strange in numbers.  Even if you like to play solo, perk points are important and you don't want to waste them on things you can get from armor (AP Refresh &amp; Damage reduction).  When you cap all your legendary perks at like level 800, then you can switch those out.  Always join a public team even if you're playing by yourself.  XP is important and you can get 15% from inspirational, and when you join a team and have either herbivore or carnivore and you eat either cranberry relish or tasty squirrel stew, you will get an extra 15 on top of the 10%... so all in total you get an extra 35% xp all the time.
---
That said, as your build is now, I would just get 1 more point and put it in born survivor.  You don't want the higher ranks as a bloodied build, it works rather well below 20% hp whenever you get hit and allows you to do more DPS because you're not having to stop and stim yourself.
---
When legendary perks come out you will be able to expand more on your build and I'd recommend swapping your STR perks for the defensive perks when using rifles and vice versa for heavy weapons.
---
If it helps here's my build going into the next patch.

In the mean time you can consider that you'll have additional perk points to spend to flesh out your build the way you like once you level up your legendary perks.

But like...

Yea I got a reply already confirming my ownership of the account. It happened on Tuesday though so I‚Äôm more worried that my character or items have bene stolen/deleted
---
I'd also like a thigh rig backpack skin or the ability to hide backpacks so that we can see the back of our outfits
---
Seriously. I only have 90 notes, but I typically make 20 a day. At this rate I'll never spend those 90.
---
Confessor Martin as well.
---
How nice of you OP..I've started playing just 3 weeks ago and I love this game! Already level 55 and by no means a juggernaut but I can pull my weight in events. My IGN is ... VulvaSlayer
---
Yeah, i got them no perks last week for 12k.  I am guessing that is full price.  I forgot to slot the perk before I went in.  I had just sold a high value wep and just wanted to dump some caps.  Love them though!   Glad I bought them.
---
It's an event that happens when you nuke Monongah Mine similar to how you summon Scorchbeast Queen. Nuke will clear out the rubble and you can go inside, fight a colossal wendigo called Earle. Come join us today if you are on PC!
---
On your side note. Yeah it's an event, just kill spawns and grab sweet, sweet screws. Just remember the exit of the mine is in a rad zone. I forgot the first time I played it and didn't have time to jump in PA so I died. Thankfully another 76er was there to grab my junk and teleport away on my way back.
---
You should turn on your mic and just chant Todd Howard over and over. I'm about to start doing that to mess with anyone who joins haha
---
Sorry on Xbox and will not play until tomorrow
---
I feel like it would make the random encounter significantly less special
---
I wanted to find junk so my sensors kept pointing me towards you...
---
Thumbs up for so much tears üëç
---
I ll definitely let you know if we do another run!
---
Scrapper
---
That's manly what I do since with my weapons it is difficult to reliably deal damage to Earl
---
I'll take a look at this and see what's going on!
---
Radiation Rumble always gets played, also I feel like Riding Shotgun never pops anymore
---
It is fine for it to be better than it , but it should not be as good as something like Junkies that has the down side of addictions.
---
I have a copy for ya. Am on PC IGn Nukathulhu.

I find myself always leaving 1 left of an item if i am about to run out for precisely this reason lol.

---
 &gt; I'll take a look at this and see what's going on!
---
If you roll three stars on secret service the first time, you keep rolling threes I found, during my rng based meditations. If you roll one star first time, the server is not a very nurturing one and don't roll again.
---
Mutations do have down sides, and having 10 means you might have to take some mutations that are generally considered bad or just not so good.
---
So I agree, 50% it is, as long as it is 5% for each mutation.
---
Um no... there was a bug when wastelanders came out that awarded people NW perk cards for actions in adventure. Had nothing to do with an exploit.
---
Didn't know that thanks
---
Some people got so mad at ppl cooking or drumming. I liked it get on a drum before the event starts if 6 people were there doing it before the event actualy started the event would auto complete in about 35 seconds after the start. So many people were anti cooking and drums I just don‚Äôt understand lol.
---
The bad thing about this is you will lose all your photos :(
---
For some reason the two shot tesla is the best against the spawns in my rifleman build.
---
Any new drops in the loot pool this time?
---
Completely agreed. Sometimes you load in and your CAMP can't be placed, but you want to dump some scrip/caps and get the vendors to reset, or you're looking for a specific event. They support it when you first load in, it's not like they can't implement the same feature to be done dynamically. I guess that just makes server-hopping easier and adds more load to the servers? I am grasping at straws to justify why it's not present. As well as the "Join previous world" option suggested here too.
---
It's your spot, you're not getting the same server over and over again that many times.
---
Unfortunately I can't since my fps already drops a ton inside the mine. You can join us and stream if you want?
---
Extra dailies and weeklies. Everyone has them automatically.
---
i was so upset when i found out i‚Äôm not really a photographer but all my pic were with random people that had a mic and we launched a nuke or went hunting for hardened mass. great people, great photos, but now they‚Äôre gone :(
---
A chance to reuse a bunch of Fallout 4 DLC assets? How could they pass it up? We might get Maine, too.
---
You can make a million dirty outfits and give them away....
---
Nothing worse than going to loot his torso only to have it kicked halfway across the cavern by some dude running in to loot XD
---
That's what I did the second time I tried.  
---
Basically I was running around like a crazy person reviving players lvl 200 and up and shooting spawns.  
---
We still failed and I haven't tried since, I'm pretty low on ammo so I need to prepare for next time
---
That‚Äôs good to know but I thought intelligence did that
---
I hear ya.  I found the exit only once, completely by accident, and came close to dying more in the tunnel out than the main event.  Running, you're not hidden of course, and the wendigos waiting in there swarm in.  A lot of rabbit hopping to get the hell out.  Ended up with a 3\* bloodied light machine gun with explosive damage, 90% weight reduction, and I forget the last trait...VAT accuracy maybe?  Anyway, not useful for my build so I promptly sold it.  :(
---
Get out of here commie chump
---
I bet if you polled this sub on how many mutations they ran, more than 75% would have 5 or more. So if your choice is 5 mutations plus junkies (50% dmg) plus addictions or 5 mutations plus mutants (50% dmg) why would you ever choose junkies.
---
Mutations also have a downside that can be severely or completely negated. Addictions do not.
---
Glad you asked, had no idea either
---
I've only encountered it once in the swamps, was literally sneaking up on it to pull off a nasty one shot when I saw it's name and got curious lmao. Really glad I didn't go for the kill.
---
Yeah. Same thing happened to me regarding Jen‚Äôs mom and the SS ghoul. Even on the raider side Ra Ra says I was mean to her even though I chose all the nice options and convinced her to open the locked door for me.
---
I hope they buff damage on slow firing weapons before this goes live.  Otherwise, end game will be 100% full auto.
---
Don‚Äôt the heads twitch around and move a bit?
---
You are the real hero of this thread.
---
Happens in pc too.
---
Although I do still have every holotape and inert bomb I ever found so in there....
---
Hell, just approach some of the well known builders/youtubers and have THEM test! They will tell you in nanoseconds what's wrong and how it needs to be adjusted.
---
Adding you now first run will be in 2 hours
---
That same spot; you can jump on the front of that yellow machine where the wendigos can only hurt you by screaming at you just like my mother-in-law
---
Time traveller Maine xD
---
I frequently spawn in at the train station and see the same player running around. If I select "Stay on this world," I can see that the same C.A.M.P. is there as was there on the initial login.
---
Like I said, it's a popular spot, so I've gone through this process enough to test my hypothesis. It's not always that extreme; most of the time it only takes two or three reloads to find a server.
---
Yo I'm also on xbox if you both ever need a 3rd to run with
---
You get 5 servers your able to hop to, until you hop on either a private server or join a friend, you'll keep getting the same 5 servers
---
Hahaha. 50 Mirelurk Spawn pop out of a gift box and instantly give everyone the whoopsies.
---
Thanks a lot OP,  I'll make sure I'm around then!
---
&gt;The only exception is Paradise for some reason, no idea why.
---
In order to keep all 3 critters alive and get the only rewards worth having you need a coordinated team of at least 3 people. That was easy enough to accomplish when you could organize an LFG or post on a discord and trigger the event at will, but it's practically impossible now that it's on a random timer.
---
Oh really? That's .... ridiculous.
---
&gt;VulvaSlayer
---
I can't find any VulvaSlayer in bethesda, maybe it's written different?
---
Sure?
---
&gt;  I am super FOMO
---
Makes no sense to me, but then I am too old to get the short speech kids use these days.
---
I moved into the savage divide two months ago and have only had my camp location used by someone else one time since.
---
People say this after every update but I never notice any difference.
---
No no im the one making bad jokes i apologize lol.
---
It's goofy but pretty easy fix, or what I do, I soawn on without my camp, do some stuff with my friends and use theirs, and wait for that person to leave.  Relog on my friend and I have my camp
---
Well, not much new. I hoped to hear more about their plans regarding damage adjustments. The change of the damage multipliers is a good one, but that's just one step. The next step needs to be adjustments to builds that were hit too hard by this change. It would be really reassuring to hear about their plans in this regard...
---
Correct, your Season progress is account-wide
---
everyone needs cores my man. workshops are essentially pvp arenas, the resources are secondary.
---
Riding shotgun pops up once every hour
---
Stuff like this is what the community needs! Love to see it. As someone who originally was also vocal about disliking low levels joining the event I realize I was making a mountain out of a molehill and it can still be done with a couple people tagging along for the ride. Huge shoutout to OP!
---
Wasn't trying to disprove it.
---
Mutations alone give enough of an advantage, you dont need more damage, how about something for the folks who dont want to shove FEV in their veins and turn into Centaurs.
---
But its not a fair fight since I keep getting shat on by level 300 people.
---
Oh I think that's just my character name...so sorry...it should be **freakedmind** then. If it doesn't work I'll try adding you.
---
Look! Some more trash! Yes, I am talking to you. You are trash. Hah.
---
90% Weight reduction is the last trait and B/E/90 LMG is a god-roll weapon. You are very lucky my friend! I hope you got something good for it!
---
lvl is of no importance once you've reached lvl 50.
---
Everyone over 50 has the same chance to survive or die.
---
So... You didn't need to hear his story but you are broadcasting it to this entire reddit? ü§î
---
You must HATE the stock market
---
I sympathize man , honestly wish they wouldn't make these pvp zones it's literally a magnet for level 500 players to just come dump on you and just camp it
---
Not me
---
I run a Ultracite Gatling Laser and a Gauss Minigun which both work very well for all content.
---
Bite marks and injuries? Could have been cave cats.
---
Literally the only pvp areas on the map.   Even pops up a warning saying hey don't take this if you don't want hot plasma in your ass.  Cores are literally lying around the map waiting to be saved by someone like you!  He doesn't want the stupid cores he just wants to "try out his kit on a food build".   Also vendors and the markwt are alot better uses of your time when searching for ammo or cores.
---
How do you have enough keycards? Is there a farming route for them or just pure luck
---
Added you now :) Sometimes friend list does not show requests if that is the case add GenericVaultDweller
---
Exactly! How am I supposed to defend myself from people who can basically finish me off in one hit.
---
"1 bigass tato" is going to give me either the giggles or nightmares for the next few days. Thanks! üëç
---
What mods do you use on the UGL?
---
Wait, so if I click stay on this world and don‚Äôt place a camp, my old camp comes back when I relog? It doesn‚Äôt all stash?
---
Some weapons come with a reduced weight perk.
---
Being a bloodied build i always considered myself a ghoul b/c all the rads i always have
---
For the Gauss Minigun I use the tri-barrel and tesla coil capacitor.
---
Thank you for the kind words!
---
INT gives you more Condition when Crafting. More materials back when Scrapping and more XP!
---
I'm OK with the grind and RNG, because at least I can control it a bit more than buying from mumbles. If I spend 100 scrip on a ranged weapon I could end up with anything from a single action to a broadsider. There's something like 30 different weapons in that pool, and as a commando only a couple of them are worth keeping.
---
On the other hand, if I spend 100 scrip on modules I know that I'll get a legendary Gauss shotgun or 2 pieces of USSS armor. It'll probably be crap, but at least I know it'll be a weapon or armor piece of my choosing.
---
What do you mean by stash? Oh if your talking about when it says you can move your camp, it does but you don't have to.
---
This quest is prerequisite to the Wastelanders questline. No, you don't need to follow the quests but this glitch is blocking any progress. No idea why they felt the need to alter it, it's not like it was either difficult or particularly time consuming. Blame lazy/dozy fuckers as much as Beth on this one.
---
I‚Äôm 35 and I‚Äôve known that term for a decade. It‚Äôs not new at all.
---
There's been some chat about Bethesda removing that from the game sometime.
---
Well...the arena damage happens cause 1) a nuke just hit the mine and 2) the mine is collapsing, it wouldnt make any sense to turn it off just cause he is dead.
---
Keeping it on forces u to manage between ur health and looting...and to me...that's part of the fun
---
That event is easy enough...why make it easier??? 
---
You dont even have to leave the mine to get the rewards...so y have an escape counter....I stay and loot the spawns till it forces me out
---
Haha! Love it.
---
Because you have a ton of mods on it
---
That would be pretty cool
---
Maybe they mean super FEARFUL of Missing Out?
---
Yeah Its lame honestly I wish they kept the survival mode servers for people like them . Feel most people on adventure servers are just having casual fun and trying to get through the grind.
---
I always figured if I stayed on the world all my camp would go into my stash and I‚Äôd have to build everything all over again.
---
If you are still working on the legendary board this lets you earn extra score.
---
What inherent disadvantage are you at?
---
The solar and thorn armor are guaranteed 3 stars, but since you have to buy 10 vault steel plus the modules they're more expensive to craft.
---
We're getting legendary perks in NW?
---
Cheers man!
---
At level 58 you have access to the same weapons and perks as them. You are both max level. 
---
...also you consented to PvP when you took the workshop.
---
Except for the weapons, armor, perks, and build setup, that's exactly right. But thankfully weapons, armor, perks, and build setup don't have much effect on gameplay.
---
That‚Äôs not why
---
This. Straight up this.
---
That's y u run in a team...or on private server
---
Savage and brilliant.
---
Not being good at the game
---
Damage output isn‚Äôt getting nerfed by 81%. Where did you even get that number from?
---
We'll add your name to the list.
---
Don't think the point of your question was understood.  The broadsider should be much heavier; that's the reason imo.
---
You don't rebuild it again, its blueprinted if you wanted to move, but you do not have to
---
Raider collectron does that.
---
Very much appreciate that ... and the reply üòéüëçüèº
---
There already is healing
---
Nah, not triggered, partially RPing a little, and also confused by the strange way people could ever see raiders as in any way good. By definition they are ' a person who attacks ... in order to steal'. In no society in the world, at least one you would ever want to live in, is this seen as a good thing.
---
On the land claim topic; Raiders never held Spruce Knob, nor any legal claim to Appalachia (they are visitors too, the originals, rich elitists who were on vacation when the bombs fell), for the Settlers to be 'taking' it from them (or anyone in fact). Most of the current raiders are from 'up north' too. Spruce Knob was free unused land, they didn't kick anyone off it, and they were refugees from the Pitt which we know from elsewhere in the lore was worse than we even saw in FO3 before. They are made up of families, women and children amongst them, who have set to work actually building things.
---
And sure, let's talk about Ward. An ex-raider who realised the destructive lifestyle he was living an decided to do and be better. There are traders and abandoned hospitals all around Appalachia, no need to break into a settlement and steal from them. If you do you are breaking their laws. Do you see any functioning prisons in Appalachia? Frontier justice it is then. It was a thing for a long, long time. If you let theft just happens, raids, then criminals become emboldened.
---
On the topic of ghouls and super mutants; ghouls are typically feral, so Penelope is concerned that they \*might\* shoot her on sight from (understandable) prejudice or just mistake her, and when she arrives they welcome her, Paige sitting down for a nice interview, and one person trying to be disdainful getting corrected and shamefaced. Foundation also has ghouls as generic Settlers as the norm, so they are actually clearly very welcoming. We don't have enough unique friendly super mutants to really say, as they are even rarer to find sane, but Grahm has Foundation on his trade route. On the topic of Crater; IIRC Lou isn't particularly popular, nobody particularly cares about Gail or Ra-Ra, and I don't \*think\* (please correct me if I'm wrong) that raiders can spawn as ghouls? So which of them is more open and welcoming to strangers and mutants?
---
I'd also point out they aren't good, but they are just normal people trying to rebuild something resembling a society anyone would want to live in, rather than a crime infested junkie filled anarchist hellhole. A criminal junkie seeing himself as the good guy is by most of the civilised world considered to be incorrect in that assumption.
---
Yes I agree. The ps4 community is quite toxic. The survival server definitely should have been kept.
---
When I have some friends I do, but I‚Äôm just playing and it pops up... of course I‚Äôm gonna join
---
Just like real life.
---
What? You think a pipe AK weighs less than a naval canon? You‚Äôre mad...
---
Nah it would reduce the amount of people vending legendary weapons because they would just bank them. Also you then couldnt take advantage of rng of servers and sales etc by saving up to 1000 and then spending them in one go.
---
But you can buy levels with atoms! Problem solved. Everything works out for Todd.
---
Oh well. Workshops are pvp areas and you not being better than them isnt something they can control
---
I can‚Äôt seem to find Earle‚Äôs note #1 and the holotape that‚Äôs supposed to be at the mine entrance.  Anyone know where they‚Äôre located?
---
Welcome to Capitalism, lol
---
Does One Wasteland have any level caps? If every enemy at every location in every bit of the map is level 50, I don't think it'll be possible for me to maintain enough ammo since I don't bother with any meta builds.
---
I just switched over to a Refrigerated Backpack after getting a full set of Food/Chem WR Secret Service Armor (The legs were a massive pain, but I did it!) two days ago and I haven't experienced this problem. 
---
I will double check once I am able to login later today, but I haven't noticed any issues that were glaring.
---
You can do it with Sofia ü§î
---
Welp, I'm changing my outfit tonight.  Fieldhand outfit and a tinfoil hat...and maybe a few scars on my face.
---
Any suggestions for the backpack?
---
Dont forget, "I like you better when I'm drunk".
---
This reminds me of those old marijuana PSAs.  
---
"Cannibalism: Not even once"
---
Maybe the higher levels should take a moment to consider that maybe they are taking on someone who doesn't want to grind the game and just have fun playing it casually instead of just one-shotting them.
---
This was the answer I arrived at also.  
---
I wanted to show off every cool item I had all at once.  It started to look like a junk yard after a while when that wasn't the theme I was going for.  On top of that, I was always annoyed because I was at the budget limit.
---
 Lately I've been rebuilding my camp at least once per month.  Doing that allows me to enjoy certain displays and themes for a while then change it up to something different.  There are also benefits and new build ideas to trying new locations.  You can always go back to your favorite one.   I make sure to take a picture or two of each setup to remember things I liked and then combine ideas over time.
---
If you haven't scrapped and rebuilt you camp in months, give it a try.  It feels pretty good and you realize you don't need that giant Mothman sign after all.
---
Try building smaller.  Smaller detailed camps look and feel much better than huge empty boxes.
---
Cost a lot of supplies to rebuild!!
---
It‚Äôs a public PVP zone. It directly tells you while you‚Äôre claiming it. If you don‚Äôt want to get killed either find ways to defend yourself, stop claiming it, or buy a private server
---
Just look for a camp with 200+ plans and you're almost guaranteed to find them selling mounted heads. They came from holiday gifts and treasure hunter pails. The owlet comes from a side quest.
---
Maybe you should realize it‚Äôs a PvP area
---
That‚Äôs a risk of PvP.  There‚Äôs already a mechanism to prevent such an occurrence if you so choose.
---
Yeah I understand that it's the fact Earl died in a place no one could loot that's all.
---
Why are you rolling up to town at 4:40 in the morning, walking in like a walk of shame, looking for a quest or work no doubt.
---
These scumbags keep walking in Foundation at all hours of the night acting superior.
---
Shame really. should send them back to crater where they belong!
---
Exactly what I was thinking! I hope lower level players don't out DPS higher level players from the scaling... it would just make it seem like such a waste to get to higher levels or trivialize the effort we put in to make higher level characters.
---
They didn't design workshops to ONLY be pvp zones, pvp in workshops only exists to prevent hoarding workshops.
---
I would, but I don‚Äôt know how to do that lol
---
Hey, it‚Äôs got 90% reduced weight and shit perks so either keep it for the grave daily where u need a shovel or scrip it
---
Yeah just my luck.  I contemplated changing my build for half a second and realized how life draining that would be after the amount of time I've put into my rifleman (lvl 197 currently)  I've been trying to get a god-roll rifle for ages, but end up with energy and heavy weapons 90% of the time and bows the rest.  :)  I sold the LMG  for 3000 caps, which some would say is insanely cheap, but I don't like to price gouge (I sell all recipes for 5 caps and stable flux for 30 caps).  Hoping good karma will come my way.  Cheers!
---
At least for the next few days you might want to consider Woodchucker.
---
Turn on pacifist and your camp will be safe.
---
Oh well, i don't have that anyway. I've got Bloodied Ultracite 250DRWR Laser Pistol on the second try though!
---
Colossal Problem is a permanent event! Wont be going anywhere
---
Since you've experienced it on PTS, does One Wasteland have any level caps? As someone who doesn't really use meta builds, I'm concerned I'd probably run out of like, all my ammunition if every enemy everywhere in every bit of the map was at max level.
---
Oh that's what I was looking for lol...if you don't have 1st my PSN is the same as here come use my private server you can take over all 3 power plants if you want! I'll be on in about an hour
---
While I can sympathize with anyone's need to keep their guns or PA fed, workshops have always been intended for PVP. If you want the convenience of having cores made or resources extracted you have to be ready to fight for it because so do a lot of other people. 
---
The only guaranteed fix is to take workshops on private servers only if you don't want to have them contested.
---
You're at rank 98 right now, so I think you should still be able to make it to the end. Not saying this should be happening in the first place. But I wouldn't bother stressing about the missing points now since they are totally worthless once you are done anyway.
---
Except once you mod the rifle, it weighs 18 instead of 22.  The weightless effect is only good for weapons without many mod options.
---
Hmm, all this time I never knew that! Thanks
---
He‚Äôs pretty much paying the person that kills him to destroy your camp, considering a hefty bounty is placed if they destroyed your whole camp. It‚Äôs funny because you don‚Äôt know that bounty hunter either.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I‚Äôll give you a bunch...have duplicates of nearly all.
---
As many times as that mailbox has been pounded upon, it should be smaller than a crumpled soda can and the approximate density of a small black hole.
---
InnovSurvivalist, a YouTuber tested everything on the PTS. The Gatling plasma got the highest nerf at 81%.
---
Lol...hot plasma in your ass....
---
How is this possible?
---
Either use the rug trick or blueprint the single items you want to place. For some reason blueprints seem to have some weird priority over regular items. This also work for placing items under stairs.
---
I don't have fallout 1st.
---
the prosnap camera randomly removes itself from my favorites basically every day.
---
u can get the mods by scrapping but remember than certain mods can only come if u make max level weapons and scrap them
---
Literally 99% of the camps on the map are selling them. Keep in mind that those presents were duped by the millions, so don't overspend. If you shop around you can find people selling them for less than 20 caps each.
---
Riding Shotgun should have a server message like the rest of them. it is so easy to miss it since a few other non-public events appear there. it also doesn't help that it is at the bottom of the map and is very easy to miss. 
---
I love the event, it is a nice and relaxing shooting gallery with a guarantee legendary spawn.
---
Private server?
---
Let‚Äôs hope it stays that way for you üëçüèº
---
They didn't design workshops to be only pvp zones, pvp in workshops is designed to stop players from hoarding the workshop so others may get the resources.
---
The viewpoint of resources being secondary is the player's opinion based on players individual goals.
---
**But the primary design of workshops are resources, that's why it shows you what resources it gives you when you highlight their icon on the map. It's irrefutable the primary function is resources.**
---
This is why it's bad design from Bethesda when players come to your workshop and don't want to take it over for resources, but instead just destroy everything with overpowered builds that are hard to counter even when you have the right gear/perk and consumables.
---
The pvpers like to bully everyone who says otherwise. They are still bitter that no one played survival and it got canceled.
---
There's no good reason. Same as the tenderizer mods. All 3 add a seasoning shaker but one is weightless, one adds just under 2 pounds and the last adds like 11 pounds. Some things just don't make sense.
---
No....has to have some sort of other fun...if u dont want to be pvp'd..use private server
---
Wow. So ruin everyone‚Äôs day for your own gain. People . I just got done helping another guy with a few tasks and as soon as I went back to my camp this person was there and killed. Not the guy I helped obviously.
---
I learnt all bar 3 mods for my UGL by building and scraping them. So, yes you can. Just not all of them.
---
Which ones are those?
---
Noone said ONLY
---
Too much????
---
Yeah I'm on Xbox and that same mindset is present.
---
Cool thankyou because honestly its never really been clear out stuff like that and it's been bugging me
---
PS4 isn‚Äôt nearly as bad as it was at launch and even a year ago. People who had never played Fallout bought this game just for the pvp aspect. I thought it was telling and a little sad when Pete Hines admitted that Bethesda was quite surprised pvp wasn‚Äôt more popular. It‚Äôs like they have no clue what the true Fallout fan wants. We like engaging stories with real consequences for our choices. We like depth. We like sticking to established lore. We like nerdy humor. We don‚Äôt like pvp because there‚Äôs usually plenty of stuff already trying to kill us.
---
depends on the weapon, but generally the better ones
---
If you dont want to pvp then drop by player vendors and buy cores.
---
Other than that you get given clear warning you are in a pvp zone so you have no room to complain that other players are playing the game as it was INTENDED TO BE! 
---
Man you would have seriously cried when slap damage and destroying camps were a thing.
---
There is alot better, more efficient ways of getting lead....and easier to buy cores from vendors ...I sell mine 1 c per %
---
Well the invitation stands. And I promise none of my friends or I will take over your power plants for as long as we're on. All we're going to do is colossal problem and queens ;-)
---
&gt;  You may also wish to start stockpiling cloth ... to help the community work towards additional rewards over the coming days
---
Just for a little while, Mr Prize-Bot, you get to live. Just for a little while...
---
Mobs in the ash heap, forest and toxic valley locations will be limited to level 50 to accomodate highest available reward drops. Other parts of the map will scale mobs up to lvl100.
---
If you're PC, I'll give you some too. I don't sell them in my vendors, but I've got a decent stack of them
---
I like the beta wave receiver mods. They add burn damage.
---
Well your math is wrong, I said 5% per mutation.
---
They limit the number of crops because they're an easy source of caps.
---
Bloody with an automatic weapon is still top tier.  You‚Äôll still be shredding through the map if you fully perk into damage.
---
Only slow weapons like sniper rifles, harpoon guns, etc got nerfed hard.  Commando and heavy guns are still great.
---
Sure pal. Whatever you wanna think.  But thanks for partially trying to answer the question.  My GF also had a weapon go missing so I know it‚Äôs not just me
---
Is there a source for this
---
Todd: hey let's put the insult bot in the atomic shop around April.
---
Guys:ok. Why?
---
Todd:it's 1200 atoms but when they buy it. Just leave a permanent sign stuck in there camp that says you have been insulted. Make it 50% camp budget. They'll love it! Haha how do i come up with these things. It just works.
---
Maybe you wouldn't mind if I tried colossal problem with you guys sometime. I've kinda wanted to do it for a while but I just recently got a full set of ultracite.
---
Pets should just be marked as essential the same as your ally. It would solve everything, and my level 1 beaver would still be alive.
---
If it's any consolation any scorched pet is buggy and will constantly attack a part of your camp (without doing damage). I saw one guy with a deathclaw endlessly attack a razorgrain bush and I had a mirelurk hunter who would do nothing but spit on my collectron's pod.
---
No dumb fuck. There's a good amount of us but bgs hates us because pve players complain and whine
---
I mean not everyone has the luxury of a private server. I understand the opting in when you take a workshop I just  think on adventure mode things should be a lighter more chill environment. I honestly think the ridiculously high level players sometimes do the most toxic stuff for no reason other than boredom.
---
No no. I should have gotten that... ha.
---
My guerilla character, with a bloodied 10mm pistol does just fine with anything up through a level 80 scorch beast.  Beyond that I can handle it, but ammo consumption goes up rapidly.  Ultimately, I don‚Äôt find this character as much fun as other builds like the comando and PA/heavy.
---
Actually, if you're able to see the Colossus wandering around, it looks like each of the heads is trying to pull it in a different direction. Widgeon TV has a pretty good video showing this
---
Been worth playing since day 1, my dude.
---
I feel your pain. I have yet to complete the event, because the same thing happened to our group. You'd think them delaying going live on this event meant that bugs like this were fixed, but sadly, this was NOT the case.
---
Is it playable tho?
---
Would be fun...but no...cause then ppl would make and sell
---
no...?
---
The moment u reach level 5 it tells u this.
---
I'd rather it stay that way for everyone, but yes, let's hope XD
---
alot less bugs than before, but some still lay around, but myself since i myself started playing again have not encountered any game breaking bug, the only one that nags me is sometimes i have to repeatedly press the location i wanna fast travel too, so definetely give it another go
---
Any luck ?
---
Well it‚Äôs good to know. Shows how much I paid attention in the beginning! Lol
---
Yes, you got my point.  The broadsider is a massive cast iron shaft about a foot in diameter with hydraulics for lifting it...the handmade is wood and a bit of steel.
---
Just an observation really about the silliness of the game mechanics.
---
Well if you find another weapon like that give me a shout, I might have some rifles you might be interested in! There's also a website called fed76.info which is a super nice website to figure out pricing :)
---
If the bugs are mostly gone then I‚Äôm sold, thanks man
---
my 1,100 hours played seems to confirm that as a "yes."
---
Exactly :D
---
just my own experience from scrapping hundreds of level 10 hunting rifle not getting a single mod, scrapping 10 max level ones and getting 3 new ones
---
Oh, forget to mention, sorry. Notes and holotapes can be part of the problem, you might want to ditch some of those first.
---
I‚Äôve never noticed before. But it‚Äôs definitely going down faster. I was crafting some guns the other day, only did about 10 and he was suffering dehydration the end of it. I‚Äôd started with almost full bar. It‚Äôs crazy.
---
Yes since day 1
---
&gt;are the level limits on weapons still as painful?
---
They never where to begin with. You can use any weapon at its max level (45 or 50) and it can be used fine for anything endgame related. Even my off meta build can kill anything just fine.
---
Would be nice to get them from Earl, I've got to use 1 or 2 per fight haha
---
Been playing since beta and I have never heard that max level weapons make any difference. Where'd you see this?
---
I agree that it sounds strange...you have to read it in quote, unquote fashion.
---
Seek and Destroy \m/
---
I would pay caps to send insult bots to players I choose with a preset message.
---
Nope. They escalated the issue to a specialized tech team and haven't heard from them in a day
---
Check players camps with a lot of plans and suitcases around train stations.
---
The first time I did it with my friends, it was a real pain and then to top it off, we get the silo cleared and some random guy runs in at the last minute and steals our launch. That put us off doing it for a long time. Once you get the hang of it though, it can actually be fun.  As some others have said, troubleshooters gear is great since everything is a robot.
---
Otherwise, Monongah Mine will be a popular place for nukes from now on and it should not be too difficult to catch that event from someone else's nuke. Kind of like it is with Scorched Earth.
---
Mobs will cap at 50 only in forest, ash heap and toxic valley, they'll scale up to lv100 in other parts of the map. You still will encounter weaker mobs but it's gonna be on a rare occasion.
---
YeH oK üëçüòÇ
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Hmm. I don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôm a fast travel whore. I probably fast travelled less during meat week than any other time.
---
Not true at all. Any armour or weapon can be crafted and scrapped at the min level to learn any of its mods (be aware that some mods are plan only)
---
Remember workshop areas aren't designed to be exclusively pvp areas, they are resource gathering areas.
---
They only have pvp so people don't grief others by hoarding workshops.
---
So from the beginning of the game I can get a good weapon if I manage to find it?
---
I‚Äôd recommend furious or vampires, TS has such an accuracy nerf. My BE shreds
---
I have no problems with it the way it is. You want higher lvl mobs, claim it in a higher lvl zone. Like with any event that comes in waves, you should already know to scout the perimeter and look for any stuck in their pathing
---
Ok, I wanted to give it a try
---
There's a trophy for killing 20 players.  
---
  Outside of workshop PvP, about the only way to earn that trophy is by taking out players with bounties.
---
Recruiting another (trusted) player to help each other earn it is not unheard of.  You can either take turns killing each other, or randomly pillage other players stuff, gain wanted status, then kill each other.
---
Nah, Bethesda is too busy making new atom shop switchblade camos to flesh out cool and interesting aspects of gameplay.
---
Gold bullion weapons can be crafted with legendary modules. Otherwise go 2 stars until you have a decent weapon and 3 star armor, then 3 star everything
---
I initially done rifleman. Literally the only difference were the Perc. perks. Switch the three commando for three rifleman snd thats what I soloed him with. Dont remember my hits as rifle, but commando I was hitting 100-190 with vats crit.
---
You lolking for outfits, guns, armor, odd collectibles: pick your poison! Im egg. Psn egroegy
---
Yes for sure, as a new player, it will be a blast ... for us veterans it is a little boring, but I still play daily as it is enjoyable.
---
I have no luck with the gas mask, its the only thing im missing from him...
---
Omg I dropped one like that by accident a few weeks ago and was absolutely devastated! 
---
If you are ps4, I will give you ANYTHING you want for it!!
---
Great laugh tx
---
i have been scrapping hundreds and thousands of level 10 hunting rifles not earning a single mod, but as soon as i scrap a high level one i do, one time i had 40+ hunting rifles all level 10, did not yield a single mod, then some time later i scrap 5 high level ones and gain 3 new mods, and this has been consistent with all other weapons i have tried this on
---
Yes and it would only give Insult notes, raw fertilizer, and spoiled Brahmin milk.
---
In the old days people used to be real dicks and if they found your camp, they would generally destroy it and you would have to log off. People would love to still that today, trust me ..
---
Also if you able to move your camp, mom of us can't, it will restore it your camp as new.
---
especially if OP went two weeks without playing, I'd say points are not a challenge for them to earn.
---
&gt;fed76.info 
---
Ha!  I just entered the specs in that site you gave me and it said the gun was "impractical to sell for caps" because it's worth a lot more than what I could get in caps.  Someone got lucky then!  :D
---
Raiders.... They are always breaking something.
---
Bethesda doesn't know how to balance pvp, so everyone stopped playing it and it was removed.
---
Total PITA and then you have fifty 5% full fusion cores to lug around.
---
Would recommend it giving 90% like rank 3 Good With Salt.  
---
The other packs mimic other rank 3 perks for reducing aid weight and such.
---
Hmmm. I‚Äôll Keep my eye on this.
---
Yeahhhhhhh
---
Whatcha got? Lol
---
Ok, I‚Äôve never played, I didn‚Äôt want to in 2018 bc it looked like a shit show, but even in back then with the terrible reviews the game looked beautiful, and honestly I‚Äôm cool with nothing to do I just want to see that fuckin map
---
Yup! If you‚Äôve got more than one Collectron from the Atomic Shop, you can change its collection parameters. Chinese one collects either tools (hammers, etc), soups, foods, and meds, or grenades, Chinese Officer Swords, and propaganda flyers. Raider bot collects either drugs and alcohol (and empty bottles) or random ammo and pipe guns and double barrel shotguns. Not sure about the rest, think Santatron collects toys and coal? Sadly, I missed the Faschnacht one, but I think it collects honey, bottles, alcohol, toys, and other stuff, from what I‚Äôve seen in collection bins? 
---
And these collection parameters can be changed to anything regardless of the appearance of the Collectron. Just use the little terminal attached to its charging pod and the collection bin. Very handy. 
---
However, this only applies to CAMP Collectrons. Workshop ones just collect whatever their model collects by default and cannot be changed.
---
I mean in a way that can actually fulfill that designated role, all healing, shy of stimpack diffusers, requires that the healer be lower than max health in order to heal others, and vice versa. And the Medics affix itself is incredibly underwhelming and ineffective, especially since it requires VATs crits to proc. Team Medics range is also a huge metaphorical kick to the nards.
---
But believe me, I tried it myself. And had a good bit of fun, I was able to compensate for needing to be lower than max HP by staying at the front in power armor with a heavy weapon. And when Medics used to proc outside of VATs while using Overdrive, that was amazing. But in its current state, player healing isnt at a point where someone can play a designated healer/support role.
---
Totally agree, just 10% seems kind of lame when even the enemy specific ones give 30%, those ones should just be removed though, too many times they ruin what could have been a perfectly good weapon across the board. And who wants to carry around a weapon for every different situation you could be faced with üôÑ fair enough for single player when you can make your chosen walking backpack carry them for you but in 76 it's just annoying
---
So the "easy" part of the map will be level 50 and everywhere else will have enemies that now scale up to 100?
---
To be honest, that sounds like it fucking sucks. Especially ghouls, level 68 is bad enough, and the thought of level 100 radrats is gonna give me nightmares.
---
Yes and no.
---
If you find a weapon plan you can learn the plan and craft a new one when you are high enough level (level 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) 
---
If you help kill a level 50+ enemy you can get a max level weapon. Also if you look through player vendors you will find many max level weapons and some are real good.
---
You can't use a level 50 weapon at leve 10 but you can keep it till you get to that level. If you are real lucky you can find a real good level 10 weapon which could last you till level 50 (currently known as magic weapons)
---
That's the only thing they are mentioning when they talk about the function of workshops. 
---
People act like it's the only function that matters, when the poor guy wants to be left alone to gather resources.
---
Just open them with NPCs with twisted experiments. Make the vault doors scream! Let us hear the people inside beg for help. That's the sort of vault experience I'm down for. Stop with the raid nonsense, give us compelling story writing
---
Ah, so I have to spend more atoms to get more functionality. Makes sense, there only was the regular and santa ones when I stopped playing way back.
---
The 1st note and the holotape are both near the workbench at the entrance
---
This is really nice. I've been annoyed with all the "Stay the fuck out low levels!" posts because maybe they don't know just how hard it is, maybe they want to at least try, and since Bethesda hasn't out a level lock they have the right to try.
---
I get it might be frustrating for some players, and I think it's fair to not worry about reviving someone who dies over and over again, but I've seen level 100+ players die over and over again at a queen fight because they are bloodied. It happens, it can get annoying, but hey it's a game!
---
I had a camp on an second account near whitesprings just filled with artillery before they limited the amount you could have placed. Then walls built 4 high so people couldn‚Äôt jump into it without a jetpack, if they wanted to get in they had to break in.  I miss the good old days.
---
true, but
---
&gt;The viewpoint of resources being secondary is the player's opinion based on players individual goals.
---
is how this game operates. Bethesda had a lot of ideas in mind that were promptly thrown out the window based on player's reactions.
---
bottom line is that, in their current form, workshops exist solely for pvp.
---
If I'm remembering correctly, the holotape is on top of a barrel straight ahead when you travel in and note #1 is in the next room over (with the workbenches) sitting inside a locker on the right side wall.
---
Hey nice UGL!  I've got an almost identical one, B FFR UGL with 25%less VATS AP cost.  I use Bear Arms so I can carry around all the guns, but having 90% less weight on it would be nice too.
---
When is the purveyors sale coming in September? I keep hearing like it‚Äôs this weekend and keep misinforming my friends üòì
---
IIRC,
---
The first 4 came from the sheepsquatch questline, the rest from the xmas event.  the xmas event drops were repeated for treasure hunt.  Xmas presents have been heavily duped.
---
The xmas present dupe dropped the value of some of the (originally) harder to obtain mounted head plans. (translation : none of the plans are rare, so unless you need to unload caps fast, I would not pay a premium/above list price (I've seen some people listing the plans at 500+ caps) 
---
Anyway, since then, the SBQ head was added as a drop from scorched earth and the SS head and horns as part of a bundle.
---
That happens a lot In this game...:|
---
Interesting, how difficult is it to upgrade basic weapons like the pipe pistol?
---
Got any diseases? That's usually why mine drops.
---
I got the plan and crafted a tenderizer.  The next day I was given a Bloodied 1\* Tenderizer from the event but the damn thing weights so much even before the salt upgrade to make it 30lbs.  It will go on my wall.
---
The reviews were mostly fake, sure there have been bugs and sure there are frustrations that drive us all mental today, but the game is pretty amazing and will blow your mind as a new player. Really depends on what you looking for, what your tolerance is and what type of player you are. For me, I play every day and I still find new things that amaze me and make me smile. Youtubers just posted negative reviews to get views, the game has been awesome from day one, don't believe the reviews, judge for yourself. Don't get me wrong, game isn't perfect and Bethesda are trying to cash in on the game and stuff like the limited stash box ruin the game but hey it is what it is .. it allows me to burn a lot of time and have fun at the same time. Try it and make your own judgement, I bet you will laugh at all those BS negative reviews.
---
Earle....what a dick.
---
I'm on PS4 and have had lag in inventory screens since forever. Most apparent on the apparel tab, but I've also seen it struggle with notes and junk, too.
---
*shivers*
---
Tell me to make deadline like one of your french girls
---
I just wish it'd let me fucking preview the item.
---
To be honest, it means people will actually run those areas again. I'm not sure about now, but before one wasteland the chance of an enemy spawning in legendary increases due to level so more legendaries will be in rotation and a lot less under leveled legendaries so you should be able to curve into the damage faster too by farming events like Uranium Fever
---
.... Mind = blown.
---
I remember back then I was a noob, someone had a camp at the golf club killing all the ghouls, and I was launching nukes at it in pacifist mode, wondering WTF I wasn't doing any damage to it, they ended up killing me I think ... they got lucky ..
---
I did the same all morning while thinking of new places to move my camp today
---
I'd love to explore Valut 51. It's the only thing I like about Nuclear Winter, and you only get a few minutes at a time to browse around.
---
Medics effect
---
Stimpacks diffusers
---
Perk that makes flamer and shishkebabs heal
---
Perks that make players you revive come back with buffs
---
I think what it will come down to ultimately is gear and perks being the thing that separates the meek from the strong. At that point the benefit of higher levels is almost exclusively optimizing builds with perks. Unless there's some kind of background process where enemies that are meant to be harder have a wider "scale" for lower levels so at level 30 a normal set of ghouls and scorched might show up in a 30-35 range but something like a Deathclaw or Super Mutant Master might swing up to like 45 to keep the strong enemies difficult.
---
Edit: After thinking about it, this makes a better argument for legendary perks still needing some tweaking because higher ranked legendary perks are going to be another one of the real dividers between lower and higher level players now.
---
Totally agree with both
---
It‚Äôs not the only function. But it is an explicit function that you actively agree to when you take to workshop. It‚Äôs the only place in the game where you click a button that says ‚Äúyup, I agree and am willing to take part in PvP‚Äù
---
You should probably try to advance the Beckett storyline.
---
Good chance it has something to do with that...
---
Well he is a 10 meter tall monster so every part of his body is bigger. So yeah i agree, what a dick. It's a colossal problem to get it all lubed up
---
Right!? Or even see all of the items name. Can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs an arm or a leg there pal. Not like I really want it but it‚Äôd be nice to see if I did.
---
For real? I might have to try this because that's what I'm using. Love the combat shottie.
---
As a note there are two .50 cal's up in toxic valley that spawn consistently by hemlock holes on the road and by the vertibird .. you can save a bunch of materials by grabbing those each day.
---
It is the wasteland, not Candyland. I miss the days when players weren't so safe.
---
Agreed.
---
Also yeah, I was aware of the endless attack bug, but I figured it'd be worth it on the off chance they ever fixed it lol
---
If you select it you can see the full name in the are you sure you want this screen
---
No. First thing I checked. I seemed to have a spate of just getting them over and over. I keep a close eye though.
---
Hang in there, it'll happen! If you're on Xbox by chance I'm always down to run it with a group!
---
yeah powerful automatic receiver aligned short barrel and suppressor
---
That happened to me the first time I did the event lol very disappointing
---
I almost never pvp in workshops since almost no one wants to engage in pvp, so no..that statement is false.
---
I have never used workshops for pvp primarily, i used it for gathering  materials such as aluminiun/nuclear waste/acid in the background while farming the world.
---
Workshops need upgrades for sure, but they are primarily there to gather resources in a more reliable way. PVP is just there to make sure no one hogs all the good workshops and griefs others as a result by denying access to them.
---
Players who have fallout 1st usually have insane amounts of materials won't think of workshops as useful, but then there are others who need the materials that find them useful who are newer to the game.
---
So a lot of these players are just being selfish by being overpowered bullies to players who need resources and don't have good gear and just one shot players who can't fight back.
---
The only thing you can do is go to another server, since even if you beat them once or twice you will lose a lot of money over time and the player won't even want the workshop, yet they will keep coming back infinitely without limit to bully you since they can just keep re-spawning.
---
There is no win condition other than players don't want to play anymore and quit the game in frustration. Workshops need a better system.
---
I now have to ask: where did you move to?
---
I think part of the reviews were not necessarily the quality of the game but rather the promises that were not kept. The map size wasn‚Äôt a lie but the 16 times the detail was bullshit
---
I'm always looking for people to play with. I play mostly solo; I switched from PS4 to Xbox about 2 months ago and all my Fallout friends were left behind lmao.
---
Easy. Just craft a new one using basic materials you find. Its harder to craft things like energy weapons as they have rare materials but the pipe weapons are just tossed together.
---
So did I. !?!
---
Haven‚Äôt heard that before
---
So does that mean mole miners will get a new level cap? They are currently capped out at level 40 for the glowing version.
---
*our upvote
---
Ol thankyou, does it still have the random unlock system or no?
---
Of course! Keep up the positivity, lord knows the community needs it.
---
That's what I wanna know can't wait for those legendary perks!
---
That is why they will make it explorable in adventure mode, it has many secrets and interesting places
---
you are better off visiting lucky hole mine for lead.  With excavator, and if you find all the nodes, you will walk (or waddle) out with about 600 lead ore, 200 crystal ore, some acid, and several other goodies.
---
Cores can/will drop from events (line in the sand is one, and I've also gotten them from the camden park event), lootable from PA spawns or generators, and there are a few static spawn points around the map.  I've gotten them as loot from bots and ghouls, and found them in ammo containers.
---
Lol I've carried some 30s through was not a big deal.  It is like a harder queen fight. 10 to 12 minutes to spare. Aside from the bugs that is. That is what makes the event hard.
---
So thats the lag I've been dealing with lately? Where my frames drop to the point Fallout could Run on a N64
---
No problem :D
---
The level will adjust based on you level. So if you‚Äôre level 100 it may be a level 50 or 60 Mole Miner.
---
I have a mic, but I'm prone to vocal stimning without realizing it &amp; I highly doubt y'all want to hear me beatboxing and singing Jolene across the wastes. LOL
---
There is a terminal in the whitespring bunker that points you to them.  If it gets used too many times on a server it goes into cooldown sometimes, but it usually works.  Between that and just randomly running into drones every once and a while I keep a decent stockpile in my stash.  Have about 20 stashed away right now.
---
I play at the same time every day and it generally starts 30 minutes before that change over and I ‚Äúknock on wood‚Äù have not had the bug
---
I do that, too! I like gifting stuff. :)
---
Ooooh yes! Gift boxes ahoy!
---
The mods yes, but that's not as bad as you think. Most weapons you find lots of from mobs (almost every enemy carry a weapon)
---
Anytime I have to transfer stuff between my boyfriend's mules, I say a prayer to Todd Howard. Because menu lag is real. üò≠
---
one person using workshops for resources does not change the fact that most players use it for pvp or to grief.
---
otherwise we wouldn't get daily posts like op's.
---
And if im 350+?
---
Certainly fits with my general experience. I don't log on before about 12:15, and I've logged out well before 2 am, without ever having experienced the bug the entire run.  
---
Good isolation. Well done.
---
Thats really great! Glad to hear that!!
---
Yeah.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Equip friendly fire. Grab shisky. Play healer. It's what I did at lvl30 when I first did it on my alt. Kept those dps up.
---
Ya the spot I have is perfect for me. I have my steel extractor set up.
---
Yea all of which are meaningless and do nothing. Your whining about imaginary feelings for someone else.
---
Oooo. Ok sweet. Never thought about that!
---
No need to top up, I jacked up 6 months ago and never took another chem
---
Another win for science. Nice job. üëç
---
The problem here is that not everybody plays in a team (I mean now more people tend to join public teams but still go on minding their own business while gaining party buffs) and so it won't matter, even if it is so. People of level 50 and higher will generally have a harder time to play the game in their own peaceful pace. All in all, it might become an inconvenience for some to have tougher enemies everywhere.
---
you get a pat on the back.
---
Sorry but calling bs it's griefing period. If ridiculously op players need cores that bad they'll go take over monongah or thunder mountain, not Poseidon where they know damn well it's always low levels and easy to steal it
---
Thanks, but sadly im on pc :(
---
did you ever tell it to go to your camp?
---
It sucks because this sub has some great PSAs and usually news on the PTS or Inside the Vault gets posted here quickly. So many shitty reposts and complaints don‚Äôt get filtered and bury more important posts. Shit, I‚Äôd rather run the sub myself than have mods do nothing.
---
Colossal Problem is THE event for farming experience and screws. It is here to stay.
---
I like it better than the scorchbeast queen. Having 8 people makes it feel doable but not too easy. There's adds to kill and they reward you with ammo. There's environment hazards too.
---
There will be skins for every regular armor in the next season though
---
Any tips?what gear did you use?chen's gun?TY
---
That's assuming they have QA. Big assumption given the stuff they send out the door.
---
Ya. I have been on open world a few times. Never had this happen to me until today. I just joined to help a couple people out. Gave the guy on my team a bunch of fusion cores because he ran out and what do I get in return!? Lol
---
Cheers my man appreciate your help. Just need to find a good amount of chems to start the addictions üòÅ
---
Agreed. And even though I skipped a couple, I'll be checking off that last box before the current weeklies are done. So, structure with some wiggle room. :)
---
There will still be level caps based on the area.
---
I've seen others post about it, but I got my rewards when it happened to me.
---
Earle died, then I died during escape. Spawned outside, went to the entrance, waited for timer to finish, earned the prizes.
---
what did you use to solo?
---
Yes, but that is entirely reactionary, and there are severe gameplay limitations to those methods. Not to mention that the Friendly Fire perk is ridiculous, thematically and practically. It's not that healing doesnt exist, it just really isnt at a stage where it can be someone's only role.
---
It definitely isn‚Äôt a certainty and you‚Äôve been lucky so far, this is just what we found with probability and experimenting.
---
You didn‚Äôt get any plans at all? How many did you get a chance to do?
---
Absolutely!!!
---
Nice thanks
---
Does Bethesda ever talk back?
---
Agreed. Griefers grasping at straws who can't hack it or don't like nuclear winter. Players that actually want to pvp can AND DO agree to it and do it anywhere on the damn map not just workshops
---
Yeah, sorry, got perma banned this morning cause reddit lagged, don't know what happened but it was very random
---
This will help : https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Do a search as well Yab did an upgrade a month or two ago
---
Yeah they can't be traded. Survival Shortcut gives you the Survival Syringe: cures all diseases and fully restores health, hunger, and thirst.
---
Brawling Chemist iirc gives you the Super Chem, which gives +3 STR, +30% melee damage, and +25 damage resist for five minutes.
---
I miss Gary.
---
My viewpoint is it is a (heavily watered down) MMO. It should be multiplayer in certain areas. Maybe not everywhere but I like going into events I cant solo. Makes me enjoy the game a bit more
---
My only complaint about the new communist fence, is that there is no gate for it.
---
There is an ini setting to remove the bloody mess explosion.
---
But do places like Grafton steel and back to the beat spawn legendaries?
---
it's mostly griefing, yes. I was just joking. which is not to say level 1000 players don't need cores or won't take poseidon.
---
the point is that griefing isn't against the rules and workshops are pvp arenas. don't take them if you don't want to deal with this bs, or take them in private.
---
The bug only hitted me once. After that, I always logged out 15 minute before the reset (and I completly exited the game) and I logged in 5 minutes after (sometimes more, never less). I always logged in Adventure mode first (so not to NW, not in the Atomshop). It worked for me.
---
Ouch nearly cut myself on that edge coming of there, I wouldn't say that imaginary used a few stimpacks rezzing them called empathy
---
I don‚Äôt know what a banner is, I just want a higher cap for the *God damn* gold.
---
Except you can‚Äôt actually make them
---
Hoping that Daily Ops and Legendary Perks also drop with this next update, would be an enormous breath of fresh air for the game. Does anyone here have at least the semblance of an idea of when this update will drop?
---
I'm on Xbox, is it possible to do that?
---
I just recently began doing this and am kicking myself for not experiencing the ambient/non-radio music earlier. This game has a great soundtrack.
---
First of all, there are an infinite number of worlds.  If you find that the workshop is constantly being taken, jump worlds.
---
Second, there are other power plants...  Take Manonga or Thunder Mountain, or both...
---
Finally here are my Workshop tips:
---
1.  Crouch.  You're icon doesn't show up on the map when you crouch.  Crouch before you travel to the workshop, crouch while you are in the workshop, just stay hidden as much as possible.  Prevents ambushes, etc.
---
2. Never do the Defend event except the very first one when you are getting things going.  Randomly do the re-take event from spawns.  Ignore the Intruder ones unless you want to do PvP.
---
3. Set up your Stash boxes (Fallout 1st if you have it) next to the resources so that you can store junk immediately.  Store junk before you fast travel to the workshop.
---
4. Place the fast travel mat (Welcome Mat under Miscellaneous) in a location near your resources but where it's hard to see or where you are hidden/protected.  This is the spot that the owner spawns in during fast travel rather than the standard spawn point.
---
5. Never stay at the workshop beyond gathering resources.
---
6. If you want to take a workshop back from an intruder but do not want to PvP, look for them on the map and then take it back while they are at the Queen, Collosus, Riding Shotgun, and other events that take time.  They won't notice it until they are finished which gives you time to empty things out and leave.
---
My level 20 buddy joined in, he couldn't do shit for damage but he helped out by agroing all the wendigo spawns and running them around the room.
---
Will do thankyou üëç
---
I'll keep trying until I get the head and plushie plans. I think I'm up to 14 completions now.
---
Honestly this is why I can‚Äôt bring myself to care about min/maxing and creating the perfect build. Like I get that certain builds are obviously more efficient or viable or whatever, but I look at most of them and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúmy character wouldn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù
---
Probably stupid, but whatever. That‚Äôs still the heart of the game for me. I make choices based on what I think my character‚Äôs choice would be. As long as I can complete most of the main story solo, it‚Äôs all good.
---
OH MY FUCKING GOD A WANAMINGO PLUSHDIERFJAIOSDJAOSHJDUISAHNFUSAHF\[PIA
---
I NEED THAT 
---
I ABSOLUTELY NEED THAT
---
That seems to fit with what we found. Maybe completely exiting the game has an effect too. I‚Äôll ask everyone and post an edit if that‚Äôs a shared experience. Thanks!
---
Exactly. I have a story for each of mine and when I play them I stick to it.
---
Thanks for the research and write up. üëç
---
I've only had the bug once, and it was a weekend when I'd been playing all day. UK time, the switch over is 5pm.
---
a lot of people consider the mere act of contesting workshops to be toxic, though. and the line between 'roleplaying as a raider' and 'being toxic' tends to blur.
---
or do you honestly think actual raiders wouldn't resort to calling you slurs or telling you to off yourself?
---
That's a reason why you see a person get booted from a team.
---
I‚Äôve got the shishkebab plans twice but that‚Äôs all.
---
I joined everyday after work for ~2 hrs for challenges and the events. Afterwards I took the drums to help while afk rest of the night.
---
No problem!
---
I was on Xbox, but it usually does that hexagon exclamation. Noper.
---
That's what I said when it was leaked they were all hostile.
---
Why add all this Mothman stuff if there isn't at least one non hostile group worship the wise Mothman.
---
Yeah it was a god-roll only traded with other god roll items, I'm fairly certain you could get a nice fixer or handmade for it. But I also believe you will get more items like that so no worries keep farming :)
---
or Batteries Included
---
Yes please. Also Mothman? I have made real Mothman plushes, which I am getting okay at, but I would like one in the game. I want to fill my camp with plushies because I am an adult damnit.
---
The alien is super cute and funny though. I got him sitting on my coffee table now so when I sit down next to my sheepsquatch it's like we're having a meeting.
---
It may be worth your time to blueprint your set up, claim the workshop and deploy your extractor/generator as quickly as possible, then leave.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the time to repair the power plants, just slap down a fusion generator and power the core machine, lock it and leave the area.  Don‚Äôt do the defend quests, only retake it, less enemies and less time spent there, less time for pvp to happen.  
---
It‚Äôs also worth noting that sometimes lately workshops don‚Äôt show up as owned.  I had a player take a workshop from me recently, (I only took it for the daily challenge).  When I initiated PvP trying to take it back, I got melted twice.  The player messaged me to say GG, and he asked if I was taking his workshop just to practice PvP.  He didn‚Äôt realize that I had claimed it and apologized for taking it, I apologized for thinking he only wanted PvP ( a really nice guy, he offered to help me get better).  I saw similar reports here on reddit; where workshops don‚Äôt show up as owned.  
---
Just stash your junk often and don‚Äôt hang out in the workshops;  and server hop if you keep losing.  Once a week or so I take all three power plants to farm cores for my heavy gunner and I rarely get interference, when I do get challenged I try to have fun with it.  Hope this info is useful to you, I think if you quickly get in and out you won‚Äôt have to fight as much.  
---
Whatever our opinions are the servers are public and we must share with all.  Don‚Äôt let it get you down!  I‚Äôm on Xbox or I‚Äôd gladly share my cores, another option is to make an lfg post on reddit or discord, I‚Äôm sure someone will allow you to farm them in their private server.  Many people are happy to help if you reach out.  Best of luck :)
---
Check the blue suitcase outside Morgantown train station. I leave stuff there (duplicate plans and the like) and I know others do too. May have to server hop a bit though.
---
It would lose the magic SO fast.
---
I'm a ballistics man so it's the ballistic version of the perk for me. All that 50cal without the perk? Lmfao
---
Upgrade this to a donation box and then you will have yourself something almighty. Bring this community closer by helping the new vault dwellers that come into the wilds.
---
Colossal waste of repair kits and ammo.
---
If you're on XBox I can hook you up as well.
---
Would like to know what platforms are involved as well. But kudos on the work. The boys and I will be getting them out in your honor.
---
I died just after Earle did, and his loot menu was loading in as I died... But I didn't get anything out of it before I died.
---
I respawned outside the mine, but waited for the countdown to Escape the Mine to end and then got my loot.
---
I just couldn't loot the bodies inside.
---
It‚Äôs like a survival game with aspects of rpg games.
---
did you not wait for the countdown to finish?
---
If they wanted attract players to come attack them for PVP they could easily just gain a bounty. However that gives the attacker an unfair advantage, like a griefer has a unfair advantage attacking a workshop when someone is in the middle of building...so they won't do it.
---
No idea.  I‚Äôm on PC.
---
‚Äúshut your festering gob, you tit!‚Äù
---
yes.
---
Does One Wasteland include the across the board weapons nerf?
---
It is entirely up to personal opinion if these rewards are considered better. You can go check for yourself on the website, we don‚Äôt have to decide if you like them.
---
At the moment the primary purpose for taking workshops is for SCORE. The secondary reason is to farm materials and ammo. 
---
 No one takes workshops for PVP. PVPer's attack workshops that are already taken.
---
Just checked. Still no dice. 
---
But congrats!
---
Much salt.
---
September 10, per the game's website.
---
Grafton has at least 2 crowned spawns that can be legendaries, and back when I was farming BOTB for handmade plans (close to launch), I cam across them regularly.
---
The best part, is more chances at the rare forest/ash heap outfits, without slumming.
---
There is obviously a line. When someone starts the slurs to the point that it is actual harassment that goes to far. But being a non toxic raider is possible. Just saying.
---
This was gonna be my solution too lol. My friends used to build their camp near a part of the broken fence with a sentry bot. He‚Äôd go off on whatever tried to cause problems.
---
neither, since those are opinions.
---
Yes lord please I wish we could get them to drop from colossal. At least with the queen I always get more than I use which had me at a decent stash of them but colossal is making me eat them.
---
first time i didn't because i forgot a rad suit. but second time i did and the event just stopped showing on my HUD and the event end pop up never showed up.
---
Umm...ok? I just gave you a straight forward answer.
---
Levels are pretty arbitrary min-maxing after 50 so I kinda disagree. It should be 50+ simply because your actual skill-points max out there. It's not like you can add more perk slots, just acquire more specific perks to fit in the limited space while farming for specific gear. There is no clear distinction between a 50 and a 100 besides luck of the gear draw.
---
Don't. Don't give me that hope.
---
Only if you're a nub, you need to get a magic shotgun so you can one shot kill them
---
So what is the truth?
---
Have him check his mutations, that's an effect of one of them I think.
---
The issue is an RPG is much like a D&amp;D game where the dungeon master is the game creator. We don't need much more discussion on how that's been for us.
---
The game doesnt do well in creating pros/cons for actions much like life would or a real RPG would. I have max affinity with raiders and can shoot one in the face with no issue. Likewise if I attack a player and win... Nothing.
---
This is an RPG with very little rules on how you interact and exact change on the world around you. I'd say it's closer to a sandbox.
---
The last time I got hit some of the challenges (weekly especially) were only partially completed. For example, claim 10 workshops was at 5/10 already but not complete. That was in line with what I would have captured over the previous few days, maybe even the previous week.
---
My guess is whatever is monitoring for challenge completion is looking too far back (or using the wrong range) when the bug occurs. Maybe it loses the current date/time? maybe it's a culture thing? Who knows.
---
Either way, there is some underlying cause that shouldn't be magic that Bethesda could track down after weeks and weeks and weeks.
---
My third run he was under the floor but thankfully popped back up after a minute or two.
---
I have no data to support this but it seems like my bloodied character needs food and water more often than my junkies one.
---
HAhha oh how amazing!
---
Yeah Todd! Why are the commie stuff so expensive?
---
Unless it's a mod that fits a naval cannon barrel to the rifle it's still fair to think the rifle should weigh less.
---
You sure it wasnt a dude in sheeps clothing?
---
As of now, nerfs are being tested. Once they're live in-game, then we'll (meaning everyone) know how severe they are. Then it's up to each player to decide how to proceed from there.
---
No you didn't, you gave me a pedantic response. You didn't even answer my question. All I wanted to know was if better items had been added to the list. I wasn't looking for a lecture on what the literal meaning of "better" was. Thanks for trying though.
---
Tell you dad it‚Äôs a sign of greatness all us old gamers have it üòÇüòÇ
---
This\^
---
I never see pvp players who take workshops to engage in pvp. They are always coming to already built workshops.
---
Like reforming said most players do it to complete a challenge or get some resources.
---
Only time i see pvp is from others who attack people who already taken a workshop and is building and needs the resources.
---
Also when you say one person does not represent most players, i don't really get it. Since i am telling you i hardly ever get attacked which means most servers i have been on since april of this year when i started playing never attacked me.
---
So it involves more than just me since i am not playing alone and i almost always take over workshops when i play. Most players don't bother me at all. They are welcome to anytime, i have fought off more attackers than i lost against(when i choose to fight at all), but then you get overpowered tesla users who stack consumables.
---
In the end most times i just go to my camp and wait an hour then head back to workshop and then i will get no trouble and my workshop will still be there just destroyed since they never wanted it. If they come back after that i just log onto a different server and put contractor back on.
---
Out of 5 events- ish. I've completed once and got the plushie. Rest of the times, players just disappear...
---
that's the point of the event, my dude. it's suppose to be a challenge.
---
I‚Äôve noticed it drops faster in CAMP than anywhere else.
---
Sadly yes, it was a 2% drop chance I believe and even then it is random chance if you get the legendary tenderizer.
---
Currently yes but that will change very soon when they release the One Wasteland update
---
I figured as much I don't really try to make an opinion on things until I see it with my own eyes. But thanks for commenting man I appreaciate your time.
---
Thank you
---
Prison is where it is at! One loud shot fired and they all come running at you :)
---
cheers
---
Fuck.
---
I play the same way as well, personally I don't really care if another player steals any workshops I've taken I'm only doing to complete the board.
---
What system are you on? I have a spare and I think a spare grill as well. I can craft the peppermod but that's it. Oh I'm on PS4 btw.
---
There is never enough hot plasma in your ass
---
My point was more I personally wouldn't have been able to contribute until level 100. Not saying that should be the requirement but maybe a reccomend level
---
No. Tried with just 3 last night and you'd need the most powerful weapons and classes in game.
---
Game economy has changed over the past 7 years. If you remember how it use to be, games would have ‚Äúloot chest‚Äù which you could use in game currency (earned from playing) to pay for and when you open them you‚Äôd get a prize.
---
Someone‚Äôs mom sued and claimed they were creating gambling addicts by using this method. Shout out Candy Crush.
---
So now the goal is to get players to log in every day to increase their player population and increase their chance you‚Äôll spend real money on their fake money  (similar to Dave and Busters where you supplement the economy so that only your currency is accepted and isn‚Äôt technically legal) 
---
Gaming companies hire real sharp people to figure out how to maximize their ability to take your money. It doesn‚Äôt cost anything to sell you a gun skin(it‚Äôs not real) so they want to find out how to sell it to you at the highest price that the most amount of people will pay.
---
This is how micro transactions were born. The worst offender is GTAV because their micro economy is linked with their in game economy so you can get a real advantage by paying. FO76 biggest sin is that Fallout 1st deal. Try enjoying life without a scrap box.
---
Personally I‚Äôd like to see them add a Sunset Sarsparilla and VIM one two. Plus physical and verbal interactions if one branded robot encounters a rival from another camp. 
---
That way we could play ‚Äúrock-em, sock-em‚Äù robots for caps! Hell, maybe even get a whole league going.
---
A legendary fixer is definitely the goal.  Cheers!
---
It's due to the influx of newer gamers who haven't already passed the gauntlet of pointless complaints, "bethesda please" posts, and bannination butthurt. They've never survived a mob of RaiDeRz doing 5 points of slap damage. Never had their sensibilities toughened by someone wantonly destroying their base.
---
They're unaware of the golden age of trading, when you could actually buy stuff with caps, and didn't only see stupid "I wanna B2525E252525 fixer for my suppressors board" requests.
---
So my advice? Just ignore it, they'll eventually settle down.
---
what you're saying is that people have to roleplay as a raider while abiding by the ToS. because raiders aren't exactly known for being decent people. harassment isn't above a raider.
---
I just find posts like these funny. where exactly do you draw the line? and why do *you* get to draw the line? because some people like me can't be fazed by the worst the internet has to offer. while others think having their workshop taken from them is a banable offense.
---
the only objective guideline is the ToS, and even then it's largely dependent on Bethesda. like those players on release with slurs all over their camp who got banned, because news outlets caught wind of it. yet I routinely see the same thing and nothing happens.
---
They are being pretty much silent, so it seems like they are either just bad at communicating, or they are pushing the update without any sort of balance pass.
---
Rofl!!! Agreed
---
And let‚Äôs have an option to change them
---
Everything is dependent on the guns brought to the battle.
---
Hence her name ...
---
for the low price of 2500 caps
---
Dude get the Chinese stealth suit the only way to do solo. You get it by helping foundation if you don't have already
---
We are three updates into it in the PTS, and now have a rough release window, and we haven't heard a word so far on this.
---
Ahhh. I‚Äôm on Xbox but thank you
---
Yea...I'm guilty of that...I'll drop a nuke on someone's house or major event just for the lulz
---
But I won't pvp....if I need the workshop, I will ask first...if no, then I server hop
---
I always log in around the same time on weekdays which is about 15minutes before the change. I got this bug the first time last week being logged in while the change was happening. Next day i didnt't logon until 5 minutes after the change and had the bug again.  
---
Had two days whithout autocompletion and had it again last friday - the first day of double score :( 
---
Didn't happen again since then ... I hope it stays that way ;)
---
"You get more XP!" they say, while everything gets a little harder to kill, while gear still has the same (sometimes terrible) durability.
---
What kind of mist? There are a few things that can cause it, some intentional and some buggy. Plague Walker intentionally creates that aura. However, I have also had a glitch where I caught on fire, stopped taking fire damage after a few seconds, but the fire animation stayed on my character so he was walking around like Ghost Rider for a long while.
---
Also hearing about damage nerf but no enemy health nerf
---
Yes I did, I said go check as it is easy enough to go look at all the rewards on the website. We don‚Äôt know what your definition of ‚Äúbetter‚Äù is. It could be scrapkits or outfits, etc. for you but how could we know? Here: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
Meant to post that and will add an edit, was tested on PS4. Thanks!
---
Never changes, as below:
---
**Earle**: 32k HP, 400 DR, 400 ER, 500 RR, Ignores 80% of all incoming damage, immune to radiation and explosions.
---
**SBQ**: 32k HP, 300 DR, 300 ER, 300 RR, Ignores 70% of all incoming damage, immune to radiation and explosions
---
Earle is effectively 67% tougher than the SBQ (Example: basic 50 Cal, no buffs, SBQ: 3.17 dmg/shot, Earle: 1.9 dmg/shot).
---
I agree with that. No reason why we can change our appearance but not the character name.
---
But let's talk about damage caps and how bloodied is still top. And how energy weapons got a MASSIVE nerf. And shotguns, like they were already bad enough from the other nerf. You guys need to adjust other builds. I love bloodied, and there's still no reason to play another build even after nerf, considering the damage numbers are...pretty bad for some weapons.
---
When I saw only one comment before clicking, I knew it was going to be something like this. ü§£
---
I was in a 2-person ACP the other day and we had a very, very bad time.
---
I don't mind any of this tbh, I die alot and still carry everyone in the instance.
---
I will :D
---
Ring-fencing complaints would just make them easier for the community managers, and by extension the developers, to ignore. Sure, it can get tedious seeing the same complaints, but equally it can get tedious seeing the same suggestions. Both are symptomatic of the same thing - a stagnant game. That should be reflected in the sub. Putting all complaints in one thread would certainly go some way to tidying things up, however it feels too much like white-washing to me.
---
Will do, thanks.
---
Sounds special, I'm going back and forth with them at the minute on the ticket I submitted so hopefully they don't view it as an isolated issue
---
Yep, as a cautionary tale.  He said lots of personal information, that I have not included, while having this conversation.  My point is that if I wanted to, I could say a lot more about it other than the 4 or 5 sentences I posted on reddit.  People should be aware.  Anyone could be listening.
---
I am on Xbox and I traded a fixer plan for it last Saturday and then the night before the event ended the last event I did before going to bed I get another plan. I only got a peppered mod also it was right after I learned the plan
---
So the SBQ, for instance, won't be a level 100 for a player that is level 25? 
---
Also, I would think this will help curb high levels one shotting legendaries before low levels get to do any damage. Sure they can probably still do it, but maybe not quite as often?
---
I thought Fallout 76 was supposed to have a "nice community." Seems extremely toxic to me.
---
Wouldn't mind changing the names of the toons I use. My mule names though, piggy 1, 2, 3 would stay the same.
---
Yeah, I have Pacifist on and some dude blew up my camp house anyway. I'm level 209 and have never engaged in PVP outside of NW.
---
TY for the offer!  But sadly I'm on xbox
---
I got the grill, flag and every outfit.  Only thing I wanted was the tenderizer plan and so of course I didn't get it
---
No one is saying that but this whole post is literally about soloing the boss so your comment ain't exactly useful to the discourse.
---
I'm not saying you are a food build, he called you a food build. So according to him he got his ass kicked by a food build. I'm saying you should rub that in his face.
---
I vote for more.
---
You have to ELI5 that for me.
---
How can you get more XP from a mob that's limited to your level?
---
Yeah, I'm going to try during the legendary vendor sale for one, hoping to get one with 90% reduction on it.
---
I agree, like I said these are just the findings of 6 people. There could certainly be more factors that are also at play.
---
Hope you can find one for trade or another generous soul. Good luck
---
There is a glitch that allows it using a certain type of explosive. But generally, having pacifist on saves you from the vast majority of trouble.
---
double twist.
---
Yeah i rubbed it in his face then i called him a coward since he couldnt accept defeat.
---
That‚Äôs the point though, the change would be meaningless if both happened.
---
That seems to fit with what we found, thank you for the reply!
---
My max Adrenaline and Gun Fu perks disagree.
---
Problem is that it will make the game more tedious as players were nerfed but enemies are still the same. Mobs are not a problem anyway but boss enemies such as the sbq, alpha creatures, imposter sheepsquatch and wendigo colossus are gonna be even more bullet sponges than they already were.
---
I think you misunderstood me. I learned the plan after trading a fixer plan for it and then I got another plan to actually drop for me the last event. I am saving it for a trade
---
Is there a player cap for the event because i've never seen more than 4 people
---
If that happens, player builds will become even more homogeneous.  Even with the recent adjustment, I see unarmed builds dying out.  Looks like riflemen, archers and pistol builds aren‚Äôt far behind.
---
If you build your character around it, they are better than viable. Not as good as commando or rifleman, but absolutely lethal. 
---
My gunslinger is as stylish as it gets. With the right perks, I can oneshoot 95% of the enemies in the game.
---
You need a silenced 10mm and a western revolver.
---
no because they said they didn't nerf the weapons just to nerf them they did it to make it easier to calculate damage so would make sense to nerf enemy resistances down.
---
I‚Äôd rather not see players with names such as ‚Äúhairy ballsack‚Äù
---
Possibly but under specific conditions using stealth multipliers: https://youtu.be/-e_hCU4y76Q
---
Its slower that killing the queen but he should go down in less than 1k rounds easily. Didnt notice exactly how many but maybe used about 800 bullets in total (killing the occasional spawn too)
---
Will take you longer than the SBQ but its pretty easy homestly. Worst part is trying to loot his corpse and make it out without the roof falling on you tbh!
---
I had much success today sitting on the Potra-Toilet.
---
Shredded him in record time from there with a Bloodied Mini-Gun.
---
Just killed the wendigos when they spawned.
---
I jumped down to loot the Body was sucker punched and killed,and respawned outside the mine.
---
I got fuck all.
---
This game can be brutal. :-(
---
I know it‚Äôs getting a lot of flack, but I think it will significantly improve the new player experience.
---
I played a little in beta and in the early days after release, but quit because the bugs were too much. 
---
Now that I‚Äôve come back, I notice that exploring new areas until after level 30 is stressful. It‚Äôs especially bad if a high level has their camp nearby. In my opinion, needing to hop servers because someone else nearby hiked the difficulty up really kills the immersion. 
---
I‚Äôm almost level 35 and am doing the Overseer‚Äôs line in The Mire. It  was going fine until I walked by Freddy Fear‚Äôs and got absolutely wrecked by like 6 glowing ghouls and a glowing wendigo, all level 60+.   I‚Äôm not opposed to challenge, but the content in that section of the map was off limits for me because a high level was nearby.
---
10 of any alcohol will give you an addiction.
---
Block off the big red workshop thing so they can‚Äôt activate it
---
Then take damage down but enemy damage resistance or health down a bit
---
We‚Äôve earned it already? I though it was just an atlas reward
---
Most of us may know that but I figured since the OP mentioned his odd behavior, I would explain why he is acting ‚Äúodd‚Äù tis all
---
They actually patched that out instead of, you know, an actually important bug.
---
Cool I got the 3 head post last night. Feels good
---
Well I got a 3 stars pepper tenderizer now...it's quite fun actually.
---
Raider bot insults sometimes, even threatens to burn your camp down
---
Gaaaaary
---
Gotta take the bad with the good. I'd like immersion more with the risk of seeing someones childish name selection.
---
"Take them in private" is a bullshit counter argument because Fallout 1st is ridiculously overpriced. Just saying.
---
If you're going to lock your Collectron, make sure you target the actual bin where the items are stored. Too often I see people lock the Collectron's terminal, but not that actual loot-bin.
---
Nice!
---
So far I've gotten the skin rug, a couple meat piles, and a bunch of cursed weapons. I can't say that Earle has been all that good for me, since I've ran around 14 events.
---
On XB as well, and plan on running more until I get all the rewards.
---
Don't mobs take 2 or 3 more bullets to kill now?
---
Yep and, if you think about it, its the only 4star weapon out there since 90%RW is default.
---
Low levels dont have valid "arguments". Some content is just not meant for certain levels, period. So many people acting like asking players to do the bare minimum is somehow being as asshole is ridiculous.
---
I haven't heard of any loot table changes from the grenades, booze, etc. I'd think there would be a bunch of posts about if they did.
---
Used melee food buffs and Vampire swing speed gauntlet with good defence, each attack i did was between 200 and 400 damage (depending on my health with mutation), me and 1 other guy (ranged, he was mainly attacking the wendigos) did it with 10 minutes to spare.
---
just gotta dodge,duck dip, dive and dodge his feet, other guy was there to stim me twice when went down, damage to stop auto heal of earle on the occasion i went fully down. 
---
Mental fight though doing it that way! Not easier, but a hell of a lot more fun! And for me as a melee player easier to co-ordinate.
---
Okay, just tested it. Logged in, said -10% Spoilage Rate. Unequipped it and Re-equipped it. -60% Spoilage Rate. I dunno if it's visual, but if it isn't it's not going past 2* Good With Salt, which is ridiculous. Even tried making a new backpack with no atomic shop skins, still 60%.
---
A question I had been askin myself,&amp; ‚Äúsorta‚Äù fits here,about one wasteland...
---
With this update,the way I understand it,
---
Are the days of bringin a newer player wit cha too do a West Tek run,lettin em tag,&amp; them gettin tons of xp a thing of the past?
---
As essentially everything Is gonna scale to individual players now.
---
I stopped defending and just do the reclaim event after.  Too tedious otherwise.
---
Essentially the way the nerd works, it's going to disproportionately effect better builds more than worse builds.  You could argue no one is lying because for tryhards, it will be really bad, but for average Joe's, it won't be.
---
To be fair to them, people wouldn't read the mega threads and would post redundant stuff anyway.
---
You are awesome and should feel good about doing this.
---
Workshops were and still are intended first and foremost to gather resources. The fact that a level 400 like me or even my 150 alt with a bloodied gauss shotgun can sneak up on or run up to poor level 20 Joe shmoe and melt him in a fraction of a second is just a huge oversight by Bethesda 
---
Survival mode was intended for pvp but, again Bethesda's fault that's gone oh well. So they made nuclear winter SPECIFICALLY for pvp, and in adventure mode you can stll pvp however and wherever you damn well please without griefing low levels just trying to enjoy the game like us. Doesn't matter how many thousands of times the broken records say "workshops are only for pvp blah blah blah " give me a break
---
That or chem use is the usual culprit (including radaway). I haven't noticed a change and I run speed demon mutation, but I'm also using class freak to offset this. Have you checked your perk set-up?
---
You actually are gaining some ammo. The bug happens when you fire too fast. You fire the entire clip and then the ammo counter jumps back up when you reload.
---
At least that's what's happening with me and my pump shotgun, I fire 8 rounds and then 3 magically show up when I reload. It's much more noticeable on lower capacity weapons since you can keep track of how many shots you've fired. 
---
PS: if you try this with semi-auto weapons you have to fire as fast as possible to trigger it.
---
It hasn't dropped on live servers yet. Still in the pts
---
Damn.i only complete it twice
---
I wonder if it's arbitrary discretion from some designer or based on an engineer crying about polygon/texture/drawcall size because it sure as hell isn't related to object world-space size.
---
Ok thank you üòä should I delete this ?
---
I was just being snarky.
---
I forgive you, on your way.
---
That dodgeball reference made my cry ü§£ü§£ you sir have an upvote
---
I have a bloodied pipe revolver with a rifle stock pushing about 350 damage per shot.anti armor is going to work with pistols not sure if that's updated yet.pistol builds aren't great but a good 10mm is fun to use
---
I have had a couple of thoughts like you all on a rework of workshops as I looked for that mongrel trapped under the house and was thinking.  They should remove the auto PVP, locking the collector initiates PVP and flags the workshop on the map.  Enemy's are present at the unclaimed workshop and within the boundaries and no waves, the blood eagle base idea would work right into this concept.  You could use them even if you don't want to claim it.  Defend the workshop requires you to reclaim the workshop. This would to open it for other players to take and the option for PVP again. This to would be flagged on the map.  Your stuff would still be there. When the defend cycle hits the enemies spawn back into the workshop and own it and your additions, yep, and the turrets üòÅ
---
I liked angry turtles video on it
---
Not really, it had to do more with the automatic piston. You'd fire from 10 down to 2 or 3 and it would refresh back up to 8-9. Repeat until it finally stops and you have to reload. It slowly sneaks downward, like 10 to 8-9, then 5-6, 3-4, etc.
---
I stopped even turning in my treasury notes because I am maxed out on bullion now.
---
Not even surprised.
---
I think 60 is about the max I remember seeing.
---
It's because calling out Bethesda has shown little to no result. How many times has the key-ring suggestion come up on here? A simple QOL tweak which was implemented by modders almost two years ago. Yet we're still waiting. Perk card loadouts? Pushed back and back, like its a huge feature, rather than something that should've been in from day one. 
---
When it's not just the big issues that are ignored, but the smaller ones too, it's easy to give up. Even when these things *are* addressed, the response is often akin to someone taking so long to patch one hole in a boat that a dozen more have sprung in the meantime. What they've finally fixed is almost an irrelevance by that point.   
---
Of course, the frustration remains, so it explodes sideways at other players who may be screwing things up by not doing x or y. It feels like something people can actually influence, so they'll cling to it. Yes, it's unconstructive, but it's what happens when complaining about the game feels like screaming into a void.
---
It's like an orange mist that trails behind him. Hah, I wonder if other players could see it :D
---
But made daddy a cuckold lol
---
Meat sweats?
---
Felt appropriate, but god is that the most accurate thing for dodging earles feet, with just the two of us and the other guy just grabbing the wendigo‚Äôs he didn‚Äôt do his area attacks anywhere near as often, so just dodging his feet for 15 minutes or so was fun but required so much focus!
---
I haven't tested this, but I wonder if a high level player goes in first to spawn the enemies, surely there won't be two sets of enemies.  But Idk.  If anyone here is on the pts, I'd love to test that.
---
Yes, the change to the damage multipliers will effect every build to point of having to put more rounds in enemies.
---
Haha wow. Sorry I'm a little high
---
I just downloaded the game cuz its on the gamepass, and I was going to try to get a cat, but now I won't because I don't want it to die :,( thanks for ruining my animal loving dreams before they even happen bethesda!
---
As I understand it those days will be gone.
---
Hunger? Not really. Thirst? Hell yes. It's like my character is in the Sahara. But I'm kind of used to it by now. Bethesda aren't interested in tweaking these rates because they can just use them as justification for their future removal of the hunger/thirst meters.
---
Not sure if instigating is broken or something but my friend and I have been reliably doing it with just the both of us and our shotguns, usually team mates get in the way or just lead an entire horde of spawns into other people.
---
P. S we don't use bloodied builds
---
Sounds like the fire glitch I had. I'm not sure if others could see it. It showed up in photo mode, though.
---
I suppose it depends on how bad someone wants it, i personally did loads of these events and only got 2 plans, sold 1 for 10000 caps.
---
I'm not sure what the limit is really adding to the game at all. You can infinitely farm legendary creatures. So why not infinitely farm the legendary vendor? And in all seriousness I've only gotten 3 star trash from the vendor. I know that's not everyone's experience but it certainly has been mine. The only legendary I've ever gotten that was useful dropped from a mob 2 months ago. Out of the tons of legendary trash I've had since beta (off and on. I quit a lot from frustration) I've only had the one drop that was worth anything. A 2 star BE handmade. So it's not like dropping the limit would really create much of an advantage at all. This on top of the fact that some people have legacy weapons no one will ever get. And all the folks with duped stuff. It seems like the limit really only creates frustration.
---
It depends. More people can mean more damage per second but can also mean tanked framerate, Earle kited all over the place so less time spent shooting, more Wendigo Spawns distracting you from Earle.
---
Have you tried gunsmith/makeshift warrior?
---
Had to laugh at your response, as it sounded like some delicious black humour. I'm assuming these people jumping off are on bungee ropes and such?
---
I went to the Overseers house to get the daily once, and there were 5-6 scorched standing on the end of her porch...funny
---
If you want someone to run with myself and another on this thread are planning on running through it at least a few times!
---
I had this happen to me. I have no idea what caused it, but my partner was playing next to me and on her game I looked normal. It was an orange mist/smoke coming from my character model, I don't remember what I was doing when it happened, but I think its just a bug.
---
Running it at r5. I tend to use my Ve gat plasma in there so it breaks kinda fast
---
Awesome! I love that item. One of my favorites in my camp.
---
Oh great! I‚Äôm still trying to get rid of all my legendaries from that event before! Overweight issues are never gonna end haha
---
I would beg to differ on that. I have 20 20 vision and the words on the terminals are hard to read. I just wish it had one of the flat screens so it was easier to read.
---
Ok then by all means please go take over monongah or thunder mountain. Not Poseidon or other workshops in the forest where there's always low levels that just need materials lol.
---
I'm sorry to hear that. Are you on Xbox by chance?
---
all of my weapons do this.  also the whole game has the same response as the ps4 phone app since the last update.  awesome.  im glad they keep making the game worse and worse.
---
Ohh man that sounds epic
---
Every time I try to do this event I end up alone for some reason even though I see other players dots in the area on the pause menu map. I'm guessing we're running multiple instances of this event? Anywhoooo.. I play bloodied stealth and that's how I ended up beating him (solo).. just circling that platform and playing peekaboo with him. 
---
That said.. I'd really like to run this event with a group of people.. what am I doing wrong? Why do I end up solo?
---
I'm on ps4 btw and would really like to find a group of players or a private server where players are grinding this (and even other) event(s). Only one of my boys plays this game but his work hours don't allow him to jump on often while I'm on. HMU! :)
---
Pipe revolvers are so fun to me, I hope I get a good one somewhere down the line. I enjoyed using it early game
---
Necrotats
---
I can understand bosses being resistant so fights aren't 3 seconds but I want to fire my gun more than 3 times before it shatters in my hands.
---
I‚Äôm conflicted, you may good points with the notes and bit of caps.
---
However the amount of times I can‚Äôt loot earl or the wendigos due to sheer lag. And then get booted out of the event is extremely high, also there is no ultricite scrap or repair kits for killing earl.
---
Yeah, there's your problem but I don't blame you.
---
So. Many. Wasted. Fusion. Cores.
---
No news of a delay, and tbh they're working mostly fine right now. I don't think they'll need to be delayed, plus legendary perks were supposed to come out a while ago so they've had a lot more time to improve.
---
Um you could always use nukashine to revive them and remove them from the situation...
---
that is why I only ever defend other peoples workshops.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more.
---
As long as he only drops ‚ÄúYou Have Been Insulted!‚Äù pamphlets for us to drop at event locations for the players looking for free stuff.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd pay 10k caps for one
---
My understanding is that enemies now scale to your individual level so you won't be level 50 running into level 100 enemies. They all scale directly to you.
---
They should donate money from the sales to trying to help the Uyghur Muslims being exterminated by Communist China.  Right now I can't imagine ever profiting off Communist themed items.
---
My problem is when they spawn so  much and the event lags so hard that literally EVERYTHING turns into pixels
---
The secret service backpack is a good size imo
---
Super Duper also has a chance of doubling pretty much anything you create. It's not just for food apparently...
---
Months ago, a change was made to prevent that from occurring. Now, the workshop can be contested from anywhere within the workshop boundary.
---
Maybe we could choose from a set of postcards?  That would get around the abuse angle.
---
I feel the same way!  The other day I saw a CAMP thing I liked and the player was actually home to receive my emote-based appreciation.  Was a nice moment.
---
Pranktron please.
---
Swing and a miss.
---
Yeah!
---
I know right. Lol
---
I know that the problems you're having are mostly present on Console, I am right?
---
On PC the whole experience has been pretty much flawless for me, just a clan mate once crashed while fighting him, but that's due to his potato laptop.
---
Currently dealing with this exact problem, I cannot even get close to Earl without my graphics deteriorating instantly. If I try to turn too quickly it looks like my character is drunk as can be. Frustrating!!!
---
I have too many laser gatling cores with 21% left for this to be visual.
---
Yeah the 90% weight is nice, no real combat benefit compared to vats cost or reload speed but its pretty sweet having it weigh 9 lbs without bear arms.
---
For whatever reason bear arms reduces that by 90% and it ends up under a pound with bear arms equipped.
---
I wish I could use the last mod without it changing the laser to red, though. I like the green.
---
Well.if your on xbox and it will do you some good.join on me later tonight when I'm on.its yours level 50 3star bloodied
---
I beat it with only 4 players earlier, it was relatively easy. And i just beat it with a group of six and it was definitly an other story.
---
Sometimes I wonder about the community. The same came to my mind a couple of weeks ago:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hy54rp/dont\_limit\_the\_scrip\_to\_150\_limit\_the\_amount\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hy54rp/dont_limit_the_scrip_to_150_limit_the_amount_you/) 
---
So upvote. You seem to reach out more :D
---
Most of the mmo games have different difficulty settings so you can adjust it according to your liking and get more rewards for harder content, fallout 76 does not have such settings. You can't really blame them for trying to see the new content, most of the beginners probably don't even know it is new content.
---
Okay perfect! Thank you! I‚Äôll message you when I get on
---
SS pack pack is tiny, and the default is also small. If not, BRC is okay but medium
---
I'll raise this and see what the intension is.
---
i take your dog running off into the forest and offer you a dog stuck in a pipe on the roof of the Converted Munitions Factory

---
 &gt; I'll raise this and see what the intension is.
---
Exactly! I have had the game not respond on me and boot me off the server before.
---
Great idea.
---
Those Wendigos are my go-to for unlimited screws now. I'll be sad if nobody plays the event because I'm way too lazy to launch a nuke myself.
---
I really do try not to complain because far too many people complain about stupid little things now that make no sense. I am just confused on how the dev thought this was the best way to do it.
---
So if I pop into a server where a workshop owner has 1h45mins of immunity remaining, I have to server hop or wait until the timer expires?  That sounds terrible.
---
That's nice to see those numbers, thanks!
---
We just need a "loot all" by holding the loot button instead of tapping it over every dead body until it eventually breaks. It'd loot all dead bodies within a certain radius of your character. So much time wasted at events like Radiation Rumble because of lack of QoL...
---
Same lol. Or just throwing it on the ground.
---
Yeah it does. Found that out when my game froze, it let me rejoin the game in progress, and the event symbol was gone. Thanks Bethesda.
---
I tried standing on top of objects and it got a bit annoying if a  wendigo meleed me it could push me off the object. Also, when feared I tended to run off the objects as well and then had to try to get back on it.
---
I found the alcove to be mechanically easier since the fear tended to just hold me in place against the wall behind me, and wendigos were extremely limited in their approach patterns.
---
Also, not sure if it was just limited spawns due to being solo, or Earle AI freaking out from lack of pathing, but they didn't seem to come by the alcove very frequently. Compared to being out in the room at large it felt like I had to deal with wendigo spawns half as often, but that's more feelcraft and I have not measured or timed it to compare.
---
I have got the mask twice, I usually trade the masks away as they have demand and I got 6k fuel for one which is amazing since my BE25 flamer munches fuel up like a rocket
---
I use my Rift as a mic but my wireless xbox controller to play and seeing an unbindable push to talk setting pisses me off.
---
You understand the only way to get a pvp player off of you is to log in to another server.
---
The system is already terrible, so why would it be terrible that you would have to wait to attack that one workshop?
---
You can attack any workshop that is not on a timer, almost everyone who is attacking my workshops don't need the materials at all. Since playing in april i have never EVER had another player take a workshop from me **even when i let them.**
---
Also the timer could be little as an hour. Anything is better than allowing players to attack whenever they want without limit. There is no win condition, there is no way to stop players from harassing you other than logging out into a different server.
---
Caps are not enough deterrent from the end game players who don't need caps and are constantly capped out on money anyways.Nor do overpowered players die that much for caps to be a problem anyways even if they needed it.
---
Maybe a compromise can be that each player can get a PVP raid token that they can use on a cooldown timer to allow them to engage a pvp event at a workshop whenever they want, but then they have to wait a hour or 2.
---
Would be cool as well. Kinda like what they did with the butcher's bounty perk. When you kill an animal/enemy, it auto adds meat into your inventory if the chance of getting it procs
---
The main issue is explosive resist on bosses m. They need to make the legendary explosive effect and the explosive big guns separate ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù damage to make them viable in my opinion
---
We haven‚Äôt earned it yet, but I guess I was assuming it‚Äôs pretty much a given - seeing how every community event in the past has been completed. I will edit my post to reflect that.
---
Go look for yourself you fucking donut.
---
Thanks. Yes I am.
---
Not sure if your issue is the same but I came across a bug with Weapon Quick Swap - weapons with modified ammo receivers (changing the ammo the gun uses) results in a bug where the game expects the original type of ammo.   
---
I made a video if you're curious:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mks3o9sVLsw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mks3o9sVLsw)
---
I'm giving you perspective on people who are complaining
---
Oof. I see what you did there üòÇ
---
We're all usually nice, but sometimes things have to be said.
---
It‚Äôs not to bad, plus you get a lot of ammo and screws
---
Omg. I will log on around 5 PM CST. I have 3k caps I think. I will ping you.
---
Thanks.
---
They didn't understand how it works is my guess. Even on the last day of the event I noticed people standing around for those two minutes when there were open spots to drum or on the spits. High level folks even, not new to the game people either. The afk drummers / spit turners really helped way way more then the people fighting over the same exact critter spawns. 
---
I really hoped this post would inform and I think for the most part it helped. Hopefully it reaches more for the next meat week coming up yet ü§û
---
As I understand it,there will only be one enemy,but that one enemy will have 2 different scales,that adjust per the players lvl...
---
If that makes sense.
---
What does BRC mean?
---
The main issue is the damage to durability. Weapons only take damage when they get hits. So technically, if there are 60 rad roaches in 1 spot, your Fatman can probably break from full durability.
---
Damage to durability should only be from shots fired. The Fatman should fire 50 Mininukes before breaking, and so should the Missile Launcher. Broadsiders and Grenade launchers should fire 200 shots before breaking.
---
The black backpack with the shovel is quite small and sits higher up the back than the SS.
---
(sorry I cannot remember the exact name of backpack)
---
Buy them
---
I mean, to be fair, you -can- fit a fatman, 6 LMG‚Äôs and 250 grenades inside it.
---
I'm starting invites for the 8 CET Run, add GenericVaultDweller for an invite!
---
Make it a collectron and it roams around picking up junk and insulting you and everyone who comes by your camp. As it kills enemies, it insults them too. "You are too weak to be acceptable junk."
---
Maybe i‚Äôm just incredibly lucky but i haven‚Äôt had this happen yet. Is it random through out the whole area?
---
Eight is the cap, but I've never had that many. Seems like multiple instances pop up before the first one is full, so people get split out.
---
Figures
---
I don't mind them on bosses, I'm happy to sink ammo into them, but when my missile launcher breaks when it's fired 3 out of the 4 in the chamber I'm then just sat playing medic.
---
Yea man, it‚Äôs really unreliable to loot anything.
---
At this point I‚Äôm only joining because I want the helmet. After that I don‚Äôt see a reason to do this event over the queen.
---
Hmmmm....
---
What is bullion cap?
---
The more the merrier.
---
I'll be on around 7EST. I only have 12 nuke cards left, without farming more. 
---
GT Bushmo0kie
---
+1
---
Fucken glitched shoes man. Don't get me started.
---
If more people used them and complained to Bethesda they would probably do something, but unfortunately unless there‚Äôs an outcry from the community they don‚Äôt fix much :/
---
Fair enough,kinda bums me out...
---
I used to Love takin a newer player out on a field trip,&amp; watchin em gain like 4 lvls taggin.
---
Most of em really appreciated as well.
---
Oh Well
---
Gimme a fanny pack. And a socks with sandals skin... or maybe some white new balances so i can finally mow my lawn
---
5000
---
Ya its ashes and stuff falling from the roof and they instantly kill you im trying to farm ammo off the baby earls and the roof falls on my head happened 3 times my last run
---
Exactly! It's all I want. Why have all these perks to make explosive ammo lighter if I can only use 1 rocket from my payload of 400.
---
I had this problem too, but was because I changed the name, not a skin.
---
Fireproof perk helps a little with that scenario
---
It‚Äôs not random. There is a big red circle where the roof is falling. If you stand in one you take damage. Eventually it fully collapses as does lots o‚Äô damage. Stay out of those circles
---
Both systems seem to be mostly functional, though personally I wouldn't mind legendary perks being pushed back. I think the perk coin system and several of the perks need to be re-evaluated.
---
This comment makes far too much sense man, I'm gonna have to confiscate it.
---
no, there isn't.
---
it just feels so lonely now...
---
It‚Äôs a given. 200 million cork lol. It‚Äôs in the bag. And schedualed in already on their time line.
---
&gt;Kaseyisabanana
---
Looks like we have more than enough spots for the first run if you want to join!
---
I think you made a good point but your title kinda kills it. Every time I see one of those events except for maybe free range and radiation rumble, I always see multiple people hop on it within a few minutes. 
---
This one I think will be different (i.e. more how you described) considering you have to launch a nuke to start it.
---
Yes this is the only reason I die multiple times in this event. It‚Äôs soooo annoying just crouch walking around and then BAAM dead from the falling roof just to wait 60 seconds to spawn in and repeat the process until the beast is dead lol
---
Hahaha, magic weapons are for noobs. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
How can I get my 500 lbs of crap in a small backpack?
---
I think it's awfully considerate that they made them glow in a dark room so it's easy to see where to shoot to get screws.
---
It's a collapsing mine... what were you expecting?
---
I feel the same. For some of the time I was an afk player in the event but only because I was contributing if I did not contribute I would not hurt people‚Äôs chances of winning. And with all my extra plans I made 0 caps on them because I have Them all away. Managed to find two tenderizer mods very lucky this event
---
It refreshes daily lmao. They don‚Äôt update the tracker with every deposit
---
The game is horribly inconsistent with thirst/hunger sometimes. It's not a change they made, the server is just acting up. It'll go back to normal in abit.
---
I don't mind doing the boss "normally" in the room at large, but when the instance I'm in ends up with less than three people counting myself, it's handy to have a clean option to be able to still complete the event. My time is as low as it was in the video because up until I located the spot I was doing it out in the main room, until he feared me into a different location and I noticed that he couldn't path to me (I was still getting ground effects). It led me to find this spot out of curiosity and a "If I don't have to try as hard to complete the same thing while solo, why make it hard on myself" notion.
---
Plus, there's a few mechanical differences for a melee build. For one, wendigo spawns probably aren't as obnoxious as compared to a heavy weapons build - turn and smack them; Do you one shot them? For two, I'm not sure if you'd be able to pull off the full avoidance of ground effects like I showed, since you have to be closer to him.
---
As is the way of the Enclave.
---
I don't understand why they added so many new weapons to this game if they're just going to move on before they get balanced
---
I think I‚Äôll take a look and tweak it. Something has definitely changed though. At least for me. Not saying it IS an update but something is going on. I‚Äôm tearing through water. Even just setting up a new camp. Started full water, disease free and fine. Set up a couple of floors and suddenly I‚Äôm dehydrated and my AP is showing red. 
---
It‚Äôs just not been an issue before so either something changed in an update, somethings bugged or I‚Äôm missing something. I‚Äôm going to keep tabs on it all.
---
But I appreciate the comment, I‚Äôll definitely look into switching some perks and see what happens.
---
It does, it just seems weird.
---
Yeah I'm on, just accepted your request! I'll be on for a while, when are you starting or is this tomorrow?
---
this is correct , i play in 3rd person all the time so i assume its easier to see like that ...i can imagine if you only play in 1st person would be harder to notice
---
Stand in the square platform and work the corners of the center piece , makes the fight 100% easier
---
Try un equipping and re equipping class freak. It helped mine.
---
Edit: in to un
---
I was kiinda hoping everyone would have caught on to how it works by now. I guess I get to look forward to a bunch of "ZOMG WE WILL NEVER MAKE IT!!!" posts.
---
When using my rifles cause I don't do commando yes it does. When I pull out the Gatling plasma to sweep and help kill adds...... Not so much. By the time I see person cut me off I'm already dead lol
---
Same! He is one thirsty lad.
---
Does he play yakety sax over his mic while doing it?
---
One of the mutations cause more drain. Don't remember witch one.
---
Pfff. I want my 500 cork back.
---
I've got some "wood" for them, alright...
---
Same !! With the game in the condition that it is, does anyone really think they are even capable of tracking every deposit and updating the website to reflect it?
---
Thanks. I‚Äôll give that a try.
---
It's all rng man, you can't farm specific legendarys, other than the few crafted ones
---
Fantastic idea!
---
You wouldn't be able to do it in a big one either way.
---
I fought him alone after the 2 guys who jumped in with me bailed , seemed to be just as annoying as any other run but I did complete it
---
Tesla rifles seem to be the culprit for the lag.
---
Speed demon? But then I‚Äôve always run that and been fine. I dunno. Maybe it‚Äôs just messing with me?
---
I assumed this was on purpose. The idea being you teach the player positional awareness and timing tactics. 
---
Where to face your back if you know inevitably you will run when it fires? 
---
Just a thought. As Earle is a 2nd generation boss fight I would assume it's meant to try and teach the player base that theres more tactics then shoot, shoot some more and then loot xD
---
Same place as all other legendaries:
---
Drops from enemies, rewards from events, the purveyor, or player vending machines.
---
I'm running around farming baby earls I shoot the colossus till it mutates then I let the other guys finish him off
---
Don‚Äôt worry if concrete andcork was any indication, we will not fail it, no matter what.
---
I'm starting it today but if more people shows interest I can do tomorrow as well. Do you have fallout 1st btw? It might be better for us to start it on private
---
Bingo.
---
Tesla rifles are the enemy. I hope there's a fix for it eventually! 
---
Alot of people seem to really like them but the lag in events is just awful.
---
Its all luck no specific enemy Drops specific weapons afaik. Instead every legendary enemy has a Chance to drop every weapon possible.
---
So you have to just keep farming until you have one.

Though i have to say i cant remember that much legendary gatling Lasers. Maybe it has a lowered chance i dont know.

Thumbs down emote

I wanted my gf to go bloodied, but she was unyielding
---
Because we don‚Äôt admire the glow...... WE ARE THE GLOW...
---
Very nice! I didn't try much with climbing on objects, partly so when I shared it there wasn't much concern with it being considered an exploit. Harder to argue standing on the open ground is exploitative compared to hopping on objects.
---
Do you get feared off of the object when you jump on it?
---
That might be the one. But you are not alone. I also got the feeling of the drain have increased.
---
If I get one more Cursed Harpoon gun,  I am done. Literally 6 in a row yesterday
---
Thanks to the challenge run I'm now ~lvl 120 with the same equipment as when I was level 50 (except for an explosive shotgun and TSE assault rifle I lucked into), so that's small consolation.
---
I do, that works for me
---
I do but I won't pay
---
It definitely removes a ton of potential chaos from the event! Makes it much cleaner when your instance isn't filled with people who are attentive and aggressive and managing wendigo spawns.
---
I got a red asylum for one, and traded a aae15fr handmade as well as the plan for a Tse cryo
---
I Missed A Few Meat Week Events Because I Was In My Pip Boy &amp; Didn‚Äôt See A Notice Pop Up! üòÇ

True

Glad to know I‚Äôm not going crazy.

Blue ridge caravan
---
The halloween coffin one, is the best, IMO. It's the smallest, lowest profile backpack they've added so far.
---
Yes and no. If you're a sneak build you will have an easier time fighting Earle with other high Sneak builds. Not sure if it has always been the case but aggro doesn't seem to be working correctly. If I'm seeing Sneak Multipliers and high damage I know how much damage I'm doing to Earle Solo. If someone in Power Armor is fighting him with me I'm seeing the same damage but it is taking smaller chunks from Earle's health. Something doesn't add up. I've done almost 50 ACP's and Sneak is definitely affected by others in the battle. Regardless of my 'caution' or the damage numbers on screen.
---
Doing NW before adventure mode causes auto completes , I thought everyone already knew this information?
---
Wish we had more like that

---
That one is really big
---
I got one from SBQ
---
He definitely has a good sized HP pool. It requires a strong damage output to solo him but definitely doesn't require magic weapon cheesing.
---
yea. It has it's pro's and con's. I'm sure someone will find a new way.
---
These kids are so mad and downvoting because I have a different opinion then then...crazy
---
Don‚Äôt worry I played event 6 times now and once I died and came back when he died and I didn‚Äôt get to loot him. Everytime I have looted him it was junk. And I‚Äôve only looted the chest 3 times and everytime I looted it I only got caps and junk
---
I‚Äôve yet to find a point of the bot.  I usually kill it for the ‚Äúkill robots with a (insert weapon here)‚Äù challenge.
---
So it‚Äôs preventable, you are choosing not to prevent it
---
Flatwoods monster plush too. And a plush of graham that sings about meat week when you pull a string or something, kind of like how the wendigo colossus one screams.
---
Some irony here related to Karl Marx theory on commodity fetishim :)
---
Just to clarify, place an ammo factory?
---
The black shovel one is the perfect size for me, it's small and sits real high in your back
---
Ya ik these kids are downvoting me too but I can take hundreds of bullets from scorched and a few pieces of wood and ashes fall on my head and it kills me...makes no sense
---
Your father let me inherit his cursed pickaxe, and so our children will be born mutated and bloodied. Now touch it
---
Hey I‚Äôm in the process of getting a group of 8-10 people who I‚Äôll invite to my private server pretty much when ever you want to do runs in a more controlled environment then adventure what‚Äôs your gamer tag ? 
---
Note maybe be a few days before I have a team/ am ready
---
Those weapons wreck group events.
---
Big oof on that one! I'm fortunate enough that my build can usually endure 5-6 wendigos meleeing me without immediately dying. I like having a bit of that meaty endurance - even though I use a bloody weapon I tend to keep my max hp around 35-50% just so I can endure a real solid chunk of damage without being downed.
---
That is an excellent fucking point. They practically are.
---
No its a bug.
---
Maybe he took Berry Mentats, highlights living creatures? I usually play in 1st person view, so not sure if you see yourself 'glowing' in 3rd person view.
---
Will this be for legendary modules ? 
---
Also is it only on the 10th ?
---
Isn't that the acid that comes out of earl? i can see that but I've never seen a red circle when the roof is falling?
---
Use a friend to server hop away
---
Hmm, did not know this. Maybe thats a good way to use all those improved repair kits im hauling around
---
Can someone explain this sub's fascination with the phrase "I can't be the only one"?
---
Title made sense to me to begin with, I thought this was just gonna be a post telling us to grow up and start acting like Adults haha.
---
It all depends what build you run. They are also going to tweak damages before it goes from pts to live, but if you‚Äôre bloodied stacking Chems bobbles etc it will be a decent chunk of damage reduction (if we‚Äôre gonna be honest it‚Äôs necessary) but if you run say a full health with vampires weapons it‚Äôs going to be almost unnoticeable. I mean I ran earl twice with 3 friends then went eh why not and solod him fairly easily. That‚Äôs a little too much.
---
Yep you were missing the down vote I just gave you lol
---
Nothing like insulting the people who come to your CAMP lol
---
Every time I log in I notice my carry weight changes 20 or so pounds? So yeah, pretty janky bugs.
---
Not sure about the modules. 
---
Thursday noon eastern to Monday noon eastern, like usual.
---
That would be amazing.
---
I mean i can stand around in the middle the whole time but what fun is that? Random deaths from a falling roof when I'm trying to kill stuff is not fun.
---
They could make it a community event where they ask for submissions to increase the number of insults available. And the winners get it for free.
---
Oh dear god
---
Any idea if they're going to add the ability to queue for NW from there? That would be the icing on the cake.
---
Yeah it didn't show up but I added you...you're offline though?
---
10k is not that bad really. Pretty easy getting the caps back but the plan might be difficult
---
Make it a Nukatron with that tv screen on it, or the Nuka Mascot
---
AHA! I was wondering how that hero who used his entire camp budget to build an open ammunition factory by Whitesprings got his ammo generators. I like this bug.
---
I thought encryptid dropped them also.
---
In my vendor....;)
---
I can be shot hundreds of times by scorched but as soon as some ashes and wood fall on my head I die? Doesn't make sense to me.
---
Low level areas (rats, ghouls, dogs, etc) I just started ignoring them, way faster to run the retake mission then 3-5 wave scavenger hunt.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that when I move stuff from my stash and back the numbers now ‚Äòbounce‚Äô. They flick from say 292 to 283 up to 292 briefly and settle at 283 again. Not sure if others have seen that.
---
Most of the time i get feared backwards if I‚Äôm facing earle; so i am just running into the ‚Äúwall‚Äù behind me. Rarely i run forward toward him
---
I love the idea, though! How funny would that look?
---
I don't even think it's worth running to the end for the crate. Just stay and loot all the baby-earles for ammo/screws. It just teleports you out when the tiner ends.
---
*ahem"
---
Dooooooon't staaaaaand in the fiiiiiiiiiiire!
---
I didn't know about this loot box!?!
---
I was wondering why people stopped in that last room, seemed they were just changing armor before they went out into the nuke storm.
---
Ill have to catch this next time.
---
I literally did the event every hour on the hour all weekend and only got a generic tenderizer at the last moment. Sorely disappointed. Hopefully the next chance comes again soon.
---
I cant be the only one who wonders this hahaha
---
Its falling pieces of roof...not fire
---
Vampire Gauss Minigun.....I laugh at falling debris.
---
Awesome man my GT: XxPandaDemonxX I‚Äôm lvl 300+. Take your time tho I‚Äôd love to do efficient runs. Mics required?
---
A slider is quiet literally a push to talk button..... And even then the newer turtlebeaches all can flip the mic up which mutes while astros have sliders....  Which is actually alot easier and safer than "yanking the cord out"
---
Unless you have to unload some caps to keep from hitting limit, I'd wait until after the second helping event.  Presuming you participate in same, you might get the plan free then.  
---
Although it's fun to use once in a while, at almost 20# without WR, its one of the heaviest weapons in the game.
---
They will most likely decrease spawns; just like how they spaded the queen w/ her scorch blasts
---
Like Geoffrey to Sansa in GoT üòÇ
---
I have two 90% WR Powerfists and the Nocturnal one does like twice the damage at night. It's actually pretty handy once in awhile.
---
I'm online I will try adding you again, can you also add kaseyisabanana since we'll be joining their private world?
---
question....when you leave the game do you just close it out ...or do you leave the world first?
---
I agree.
---
I hate that fire animation glitch. It happens to me all the time after taking damage from a floating flamer thing and I'll be stuck with it until I log out. ‚òπÔ∏èüî•
---
I can assure you the bug still happens even if you never play NW.
---
Black Shovel.
---
I disagree with this Earle is hella easier. My team of 3 has killed him in less then 2 minutes. Bloodied stealth commando build
---
I doubt it. How many "Weedlord BitchHater", and "WhitePower [ethnicity]killer" do you need to see.
---
Unless teaming up with "AssBlaster HorseDong", is your particular thing?
---
That's all you put in there? - I've got about 100K of ammo.
---
So no more xxxxTrIpLe-k1LLxxxxoxo but instead I get to see ‚Äúfuck‚Äù yea sure why not
---
Ptt is a button that allows you to talk through mic only while held. A slider is an on off switch. No they arent the same. Yanking the mic isnt difficult or unsafe, it is designed to do so. If the slider remains in the off position when you arent holding it, then it is ptt, abd that doesnt sound fun.
---
Yeah sounds great, which is why they will change the event like they did One Violent Night. For some reason Beth needs to make sure we never get anything too good. At the very least they will make it a rarer event. I do hate them.
---
And just like that, the event was saved
---
I'm too proud of you for that to be mad at you for that.
---
Shhhhhhhh
---
My spot (im always in chameleon so you dontknowwhereimat! *5 year old voice me*)
---
Sounds about right, thx friend
---
I thought it was because when he bedded down you couldn't interact with him.
---
There‚Äôs not very many mods for the 50 cal to begin with (literally two mods, being the heavy the barrel, and the prime receiver which you can get from a plan) so it won‚Äôt set you back a whole lot of materials to craft and scrap until you have the heavy barrel available. Otherwise hunt down the world drops and scrap those. One of the raiders in the blood eagle camp next to pleasant valley station usually has either a 50 cal or Gatling laser. 
---
Side note: crafting weapons and armor does not unlock mods. Scrapping weapons and armor, regardless of level, will unlock new mods, however there are some mods that can only be obtained from plans or from mod boxes (mostly just for armor - scout in particular). You will not and cannot learn mods from scrapping mod boxes.
---
Further side note: google the weapons you want to know more about. For example type in ‚Äúfallout 76 50 cal‚Äù and find the link for fallout.fandom.com aka fallout wiki.
---
Wtf are you even on about.    Ptt is a pain compared to a slider.    Ptt you need to literally have a free finger where as a slider you turn your mic on or off...  And no cords arent made to just be yanked on, thats what children do
---
Sometimes players and camps persist in world after they are logged out (or in many cases crashed out of the game). Maybe your camp stayed in world long enough to get nuked? It should not be possible, but who knows?
---
In my backpack.   I keep the rest of my stuff...well...not in my backpack.   &gt;.&gt;
---
This is the update we needed as high level players. Having scaled loot gives a reason to roam the whole map now instead of the mire and bog lol.
---
I love them!  Give us challenges, rar!
---
I don‚Äôt trust the enclave ü§ó
---
Yeah I just added that person too, btw I hope I don't need Fallout 1st for this :/
---
She hasn't landed yet
---
wait, I swear I have the same thing at white springs, your talking about the camp right by that little ditch in the middle of the open Field?
---
i really want the brotherhood collectron
---
It's a video game, my dude. It you're looking for realism, go outside.
---
thats vault 51 where nuclear winter takes place
---
Lazy Atlas jerks get your own materials, mine are well mine and to valuable to waste.
---
I play in 1st person and have a potato for a pc so have all my settings on low with addition settings turned off via .ini and they are still fairly visible if you know what you‚Äôre looking for and are paying attention. The only time it becomes an issue is if you‚Äôre in the position of having a grip of windigo chasing you and you‚Äôre trying to shoot, Strafe, jump, pop stims, and otherwise stay alive.
---
I solo stealth meleed him twice yesterday. That was fun
---
By day: classical
---
By night: huey lewis and the news. 
---
I also wear a raincoat
---
Yes, events tend to be a lot easier the less players. Just like the launch prep for silos
---
Given the amount of pain and issues resulting from ash/goo piles. can we just have them disabled across the board? 
---
It feels like while meat piles are instanced to player, ash/goo piles are global objects, the pile won't disappear until everyone has looted that "container" if you will. So they take much longer to disappear if they do at all. This seems to result in glitched enemies and they cover other loot piles beneath them making them unlootable.
---
Where is it on the map
---
fuckin' molerats, I bet.
---
Darn, I was hoping it updated with every deposit. Shows how much attention I've been paying attention to this thing. Oh well, I guess I look like a complete idjut. Not the first time.
---
The Chally backpack from Meat Week is **HUGE!** I get that its a freaking barrel strapped to your back but come on, it looks ridiculous.
---
You‚Äôre good man. I‚Äôm just glad I was able to help lmao
---
Because other players must see how much of a life i do not have
---
Right on cue...
---
Stealth melee build? How does that work out?
---
The ability to adjust notifications would be nice, with a few options of different things to turn on/off/silence/etc... such as the score system notifications you complained about.
---
The purpose of not having game changing (ie: weapons, etc) items in the SCORE run is so that you can't have an unfair advantage over others by buying your success. It's meant to be there for making the game more fun with cosmetics and other fun loot. If you haven't noticed already by visiting camps, players love cosmetics (me included).
---
Ima be honest with ya, in any game you ever play if you think an enemy is spewing out acid you prob don‚Äôt want to stand in that either.
---
Ya i kno, ill delete it LOL
---
I nearly choked from laughing at this... too funny!!!! ü§£
---
I am not sure Encrypted should be on that list. I always go when activated and it always seems well attended.
---
And I love radiation rumble, sometimes more so when no one else comes.
---
Straight to the Atom shop eh?
---
We'll get it, don't stress :)
---
Basically, you'll (ideally) never be level 200 getting the xp of an enemy under 100. It'll give the xp of a level 200 unless it's capped to lower. Or in the 'lower' regions enemies will be at least 50. However, it's DR/ER and such will also scale, as will it's health, which given the changes to how damaged is calculated means slower killing. So, yes XP will be higher, but it will also come slow.
---
I routinely logged out minutes before the changeover and logged back in minutes afterward for most of the season and never had it happen.
---
I was even logged in during the changeover a good number of times without it happening.
---
The only time I have ever had the score challenges autocomplete was when I was logged in AND actually had the challenge menu open viewing the challenge list during the changeover.
---
Ok, sure. Obviously you know more than I. In a conversation about ptt, just state as you please and divert as you please. King Chad, you have succeeded in besting me. Please, carry on.
---
It seemed too obviousü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
LOL.
---
you don't need one no worries! Can you hear us ingame?
---
I don't go to camps for the looks, I go for vendors only the leave immediately.
---
Don`t worry! Now we have level 50 Brahims, level 50 Mole rats and level 50 Weak Feral Ghouls in Flatwoods!
---
Enjoy it!
---
That was part of it. Sometimes you had to literally wait 60 secs for him to react, other times it was a few minutes. Either way people complained. So now he sits in his office so people can get their instant gratification and not have to wait for anything. Sad in my opinion that they have basically turned him into a protectron, that we see at Whitesprings.
---
sometimes it can be a few minutes entertainment to see how another player designed their camp on "your" spot.  
---
is it similar?  Completely different?  If similar, do you speculate if they saw your design and were inspired by it? (imitation being the sincerest form of flattery)
---
Other times, yea, its annoying to get that message repeatedly, especially when you know there's a do XYZ at your camp score challenge, or your playtime is limited, and server hopping to find your camp eats into it...
---
i really don't wanna fail another one of these
---
We're taking a look into this now
---
Ha! Thanks. Need to get some use out of the damn thing! It's like a melon, just needs an empty!
---
Thanks dad
---
Flag pole lance
---
Who said im looking for realism i shouldn't be killed from a roof falling its random and stupid and there no way to prevent it and waiting 5 minutes to spawn back isn't fun either
---
Ward is obviously a raider plant. "Retired" raider working as head of security for these rude whiney turds? Somehow manages to "lose" an important expensive piece of equipment Everyday? Needs some caps to support his habit.
---
Ps4 players! What this guys said!
---
I'm Egg psn: egroegy.
---
Send friend request and a simple message reminding me. Lets go get some screws 76ers!
---
Also we can do a quick gameplan before so youre not nervous! Happy hunting!
---
Ps: bring the most ammo you can craft for your gun, make sure its in good condition and have plenty of stims! (Feel free to ask if out!)
---
OMFG!!! PLEASE DON'T give ideas on how to break the game before they fix the current issues ROFL. But yes if they are going to just keep re-using stuff then yeah so many good idea's in this thread may as well.
---
Make the flag a mod for the spear, boom.
---
I dont die to that I die to random falling roofs
---
Will you take 40 meat cleaver plans and a hug?
---
See, your father was a fucking colossal problem, most tedious asshole I had to deal with in the wasteland
---
Exactly, I‚Äôm not worried about the crate anymore, I will get more use out of the screws and ammo the babies drop
---
I'm totally down with those assets being reused.
---
It's not quite twelve inches, but definitely smells like a foot!
---
I am on X Box and use the menu to "Quit".After leaving the world.
---
I would assume that just like playernames you could report inappropriate ones
---
Another one? We didn't fail any
---
No it is a AK-101 weird Chinese variant it should be at max 10 heavy with a lot of mods installed
---
But I was only gone ten minutes, should still have been a Blast Zone since they last two hours.
---
Very well could be! Forget the exact location, but I bought all the shotty ammo and fuel in the store, so if it was you, wear that spandex proudly because you're a hero. Also, tell me your in-game name so I can find you again and shower you with caps while raiding whatever wrong ammo-type is in the machines. Thank you.
---
at least a dozen different youtubers would beg to differ.
---
Punctuation.
---
Top left of the map in the mountains
---
Are you talking about vault 79? The gold heist?
---
English not first language
---
Nah, I‚Äôm good.
---
I ain't even stressing about it. People could donate nothing and we would still complete it. The whole event is rigged.
---
Oh no opposite place
---
I ve got 3 more spots if anyone wants to join the first run!
---
Using the radaway probably removed your well hydrated buff, which makes your HP drop slightly.. This is what killed you.
---
we failed concrete
---
Don't worry, they'll move the goal post closer if it looks like we're coming up short
---
Christ its poisoned Halloween candy all over again, last year I found a mini nuke in a nerds packet
---
it's wood for christ sake they shouldn't have to
---
That's vault 51 part of nw
---
I saw a player once with a huge Pot Belly, i was like wtf.
---
This though bwhaaaaaaaaa
---
Yes, things seem too quiet now and the Colossus event felt like a punishment from Bethesda because too many people were bitching that the Queen event was too easy. 2K of 2mm rounds, 1600 rounds of 5.56 and close to 800 rounds of 45 with 5 upper level (200-500+) players with 2 stable flux and 2 3* shitty legendaries! Sure felt like punishment... a reach-around would've been nice!
---
Ill be on, see ya then!
---
The Halloween coffin backpack is pretty slim, just need to wait another month...
---
Or. Just let Bethesda say we‚Äôve done it and keep the mats?
---
Run when you become detected lol. Escape artist and the side cave to the left when you first run towards him are your best friends for this kind of fight. 
---
My build is stealth brawler/commando so I just use a handmade to take out the wendigos when it becomes too crowded or there are too many in my way to target Earle himself. 
---
I didn‚Äôt even have the pinnacle melee build I used for my first queen solo last year which includes every buff possible barring nukashine. 
---
I‚Äôm only 14 str and my uny set is 3 harder to detect, one piece +1 str, and something random on the last. Not the best build but it gets the job done.
---
we'll only 'fail' whatever Bethesda wants us to fail. I doubt they even have the ability to monitor how much was actually donated.
---
it's just more inane busywork to keep people entertained.
---
well by all means they should tailor the game to just you and your likes/dislikes. we live in a society, Karen.
---
they actually do monitor how much we donate actively
---
pc ? 25 caps a plan
---
There are people who either are constantly checking the map or through some other method are eager to jump you when you claim a workshop, because literally a couple times I've been shot within seconds of the timer clicking off. 
---
The other thing people will do is if you're actually trying to do the "Defend the Workshop" event, just come in and start shooting you while you're paying attention to the creatures that are attacking the workshop.
---
It would be cool if you could target another player. Select someone on the map and send the insult bot after them. Even better if you can make up your own insults.
---
I just went to see the weirdness for myself, I knew I was gonna face plant like crazy. I mostly just took pot shots and tried to revive the people who could do some actual damage. I‚Äôd have been happy just finding a place to hide and watching the insanity.
---
It was worth the trip that thing is so freaking Bizzare.
---
my advice would be to uninstall the game. it's clearly broken and doesn't deserve you.
---
Well hydrated just says ap regen and disease resist,  didn‚Äôt know that was a thing.  It was funny because it took me to like 1 Hp for a half a second and then killed me.
---
For anyone testing the update, how does the damage look for sneak builds? I have a pretty basic sneak build with an instigating lever action and can one-shot my way through West Tek. Will that still be possible?
---
Take the object off of it i believe
---
I did it, it didn‚Äôt show back
---
Just was banned from Xbox Live for 24hours
---
OPERATION "GET 'EM OUT" HAS BEGUN, BOYS!! YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO!!
---
I‚Äôd love you all to meet my trader. Bollocky Bill
---
So THATS what causing it!?
---
I have trouble following your.
---
Are you saying that only the level of the mobs scales down and not the XP they give?
---
Whaaaa?! How did I not know this? Thank you! This is a life changer!
---
Wow
---
Was it worth it
---
fast travel away and then come back.
---
Love it when Ward makes you go kill some poor sap for a doohicky and then says something like "Well, we had a few of those, but If the others all broke, then we would have been in trouble."
---
Something ain't right in that town.
---
Yes. You have to relog after you remove the object though.
---
and how do you know? what's stopping them from filling the bar with whatever percentage they feel like?
---
Ya buddy lol
---
I found a .50 cal machine gun in my Gum drops. Shits outrageous
---
Did you beat the challenge and how so quickly banned
---
Did you switch servers?
---
Maybe you said hey kid want some drugs in fallout
---
BASE jumping it seems is the main event. Jumping with a parachute.  But yup.  That kinda stuff.
---
good Lord...go outside
---
Disconnected about five times with XBOX One S, couldn't play longer than twenty minutes.
---
they would they both doing that it's a very simple program and it's on the bethesda web page
---
Stop being weird it was a question about something annoying in the game i guess downvoting hives u a feeling of power too?
---
I just asked while working from home lol
---
I think front-facing Fanny packs would be amazing.
---
If we had mailboxes, Bethesda would have to mail all the legendaries to us that we don't pick up. Bad idea.
---
Don't you mean "chems"?
---
I have a mule with apparel only. It‚Äôs where I store all the unique outfits and rewards from limited events and super rare drops. I decided to keep every fasnacht mask I ever picked up for some reason, and there‚Äôs  literally hundreds. Maybe 120ish jester masks. Yes I made a jester mask museum for this mule. Either way, when I go to transfer new apparel to this mule it takes upwards 15 to 30 minutes for the stash space to load. I don‚Äôt have this issue with my legendary mule because weight limitations mean that one can‚Äôt hold hundreds and hundreds of items like the apparel mule. I think it has more to do with stashing or holding so many items that the game is trying load the texture for each item all the time. On the plus side, my main characters I play with load super quick because they have barely anything in their stash.
---
Sony/MS require GT's to be displayed for just this reason.
---
Do you trust Beth to do the same?
---
I wouldn't know, I don't downvote. I make hilarious comments.
---
You might have come back into a different server.
---
Ok that works too
---
Did we? I can't find a source, but I feel like the double dailies weekend we just had was because we completed it?
---
I found a 50 cal in a small toolbox once xD I was like tf?
---
Yeah it's too cost heavy to stay popular plus the restrictions are pretty dumb. 
---
Oh well I mean at least it gives a cool settlers type helmet
---
Is this a spoiler for the raider quests
---
My go to weapon is a Bloodied Pipe Pistol.
---
I modded it in to a Pistol/Rifle
---
I use my 45 ammo on it.
---
I can put out 300 a shot minimum.

I have other much better God Rolls.
---
This though reloads exceptionally quick.And is great for Uranium fever.
---
It took me about 2 days and 5 colossal problem events to even realize it was the ceiling that was killing me every time. I feel your pain.
---
There not funny bro, this isn't a comedy session it was a discussion about an annoying part of an event.
---
Had one the other day where it was me and 4 sub-50 players. I started the encounter and gave them a chance but 3 of the 4 just sat in a corner killing the adds and the 4th was doing almost no damage. 
---
Not ashamed at all to say that I just quit to main menu and found a new session. Might as well have been a solo run. They really should have added a level floor to this event.
---
Other than the insane lag it causes when there are too many, sure.  And the fact that they can't produce the ammo I use. :(
---
Yea I've heard about the magic weapons... Still the imposter event has been out for a while and the battle theme isn't anywhere so I'm kinda sad üò≠
---
Has anyone tried this with the fusion core generators yet?
---
Ya man I couldn't figure it out at first either I thought it was some poison affect but I soon figured out it was just the roofs.
---
Hey can you actually do it with one of your allies I mean I am doing the space girls quests and I definitely used the flirt options
---
it was cause we completed plastic
---
if it's not a comedy session, why am I laughing?
---
&gt;level 100 radrats
---
Never mind that.  If floaters and mirelurk kings and even fucking stingwings will all be level 100 and meanwhile my damage is nerfed, I will never attempt to fight any of them ever again.  I'll probably spend all my time in Grafton from now on.
---
Vault steel is used to craft solar, thorn, and strangler heart armours.
---
The vaults as of now have no purpose. In the pts v94 is one of the daily op locations though
---
Sweet! Ill add and send you a message. I've had about 5 other people message me as well, could always run it on a private server to guarantee we're all in the event together.  
---
GT is R4VENexe
---
Yeah i know. Well rested for 3hrs is good
---
Lol little boy, you can kill Earle in less 2 min solo and the SBQ much faster.
---
Ok sweet didn‚Äôt know that thanks!
---
It's not meg, it's megs, the settler npc from a colossal problem
---
Yes, unlimited item turn-in per day, negating the need to scrip heavy items first, hang onto extra for the next day, switch characters for the remainder of the day, mule items off to another character to store/scrip, go crazy trying to utilize the entire 150 per day and make it super easy to walk up to a conversion machine once a day and plunk down 150 legendary notes, scrip credit, scrip coins or notes for the actual scrip. I've brought this up before and I hope someone at Bethesda thinks it's a good enough idea.
---
If you'd like I've gathered up a group of players on here and we're gonna try to run it at least a few times together if you'd like to join!
---
So you can do it wow do they show anything or have some sort of fade
---
I bought the plans for the gauss shotgun and mini gun one night. The next day the perveyor gave me a gauss mini gun v/ffr/-90. Then the next day she gave me a gauss shotgun executioners limb dmg/-90. I haven‚Äôt seen any reason to actually craft any since my first drops seemed better then anything else I‚Äôd get.
---
Not mine either. Periods and commas work the same in most languages though.
---
Got a group planning on running it tonight if you'd like to join
---
Nope, you just sleep and get the bonus
---
1. Explosive damage resistance needs removed or greatly reduced.
---
2. Big gun perks need to affect these weapons again.
---
3. Damage needs buffed 50-100% across the board.
---
4. Damage needs buffed 50-100% again, or reduce weight of explosives.
---
5. Durability needs increased by about 5X across the board.
---
You realize those people are very unlikely to ever read reddit ?
---
Not really the Queen flys around where as Earle is grounded
---
Or take rotting food and poop and dump it all over their CAMP before setting it on fire. A new debuff: Stinky Body Odor.
---
does the 60 second respawn kick in after a certain number of deaths?
---
@yiphixTried it last night. I could select it but it wouldn‚Äôt blueprint like the ammo machine. It was at thunder mountain. I‚Äôm gonna try the others tonight
---
‚ÄúDammit I want some free pron‚Äù
---
Just did more looking. We did not fail concrete. I have the banner built in my camp from us completing it. They lowered the goal and we were able to finish it
---
I NEED this plushie!
---
Hmm.  Wonder if it's ignoring the extra charges with Power User or whatever?
---
Not that I would do anything with that knowledge, of course...
---
Garyyyyyyy
---
4 deaths I believe which wouldn't be a problem is people didn't ignore you when you need reviving
---
so you are leaving the world hmm then i have no clue
---
Would also be nice if there wasn't 47 different melee weapons to help with legendary farming üòÇ
---
Lol for science only ;)
---
I completed the event yesterday and got nothing. Bwhaaaaaaaaaa
---
I stood outside the Mine waiting for text confirmation of my rewards.
---
At the time it is enraging.
---
Afterwards i just laughed.
---
I do think one of the Devs is a masochist.
---
Today i had my best Event yet.
---
Shredded the Collosus from the safety of the Porta-Toilet Roof in record time.
---
Shredded the Wendigo Spawns.
---
In my Mind i was congratulating myself on a job well done,when i jumped down to loot Earl lifless body.
---
Boom dead. didn't even see what got me.
---
Respawned outside the mine.
---
Robbed of loot again.
---
I should know better after losing enough Flux to fill a swimming Pool at Queen events,
---
When everyone  kills a Queen and moves in for the loot.
---
I have to run for cover and remap my Perk cards first.
---
I swear this game hates me.
---
Full set unyielding armor of your choosing. Heavy combat is good because it offers good DR once u add bos mod. The stat boost makes up for the carry weight by adding str. Don‚Äôt worry about 3 stars yet. Focusing on getting a matching set of 2* with AP regen is a lot more important at first
---
If you can, carry way less. When i‚Äôm not carrying an insane amount of stims i sit around 168 carry weight with zero weight reduction armor pieces. Ammo weight reduc perks are your friend.
---
In nuke zones i use a set of strangler pa with emergency protocols. Tanky enough that things are a breeze even with low hp.
---
Bloodied handmade or fixer if you can find/afford one. 
---
Yes there is sneak bonus in group boss fights.
---
Mutations are entirely up to you. Lots of people sell em for 250caps. If ur ps4 and wanna respect yours i can help you out with serums for a much cheaper cost if you‚Äôd like.
---
Riding shotgun needs a server wide notice when you start it. That's why no one ever shows up. Honestly I like it when no one else shows up I'm guaranteed hits on the middle legendary and it's super simple.
---
I miss the days of SPECIAL requirements, like, 10 strength to be able to use the Super Sledge.
---
That happen to me yesterday as well. We got him to mutate in the first 3 min then he just disappeared for a few then just came back out of nowhere.
---
Not yet. I‚Äôm on PS4.  Maybe he has 2 characters in the same server.
---
I found a bloody power fist in my ... Oh never mind.
---
Feel lucky I‚Äôve killed him twice and haven‚Äôt received any loot on his body for killing him.
---
Distraction a better term I think.
---
sneak multipliers don't trigger if your target is in combat with anything else, including players. so you can't rely on covert operative, mr. sandman, etc. in events.
---
unyielding armor, backpacks, weight reduction perks. a bloodied build usually ends up with about the same carry weight as a PA build.
---
anything that involves radiation will require a hazmat, CSS or PA. you can wear armor with rad resistance such as SS, trapper, robot or marine but it'll only help against environmental rads (barrels and fissures), they're useless even in radiation rumble.
---
with class freak there's little reason not to have most if not all mutations. but otherwise yes, find a rad shower and then a player vendor stocked with serums.
---
fixers and handmades are the go-to choice for commandos. but any B2525 rifle will serve you well, combat, assault. even a pipe. just steer clear off radiums. bloodied and junkie's are no brainers but there are other useful prefixes such as vampire's and, come the nerf, maybe anti armor.
---
generally speaking heavy gunners have better sustained dps than commandos, unless you're playing by yourself in a private server and buffed with chems, booze, magazines. but that's for bosses. commandos can clear literally everything else faster and a lot more efficiently.
---
Damn! Nice trading :)
---
I solo it for legendaries, but you really need at least 2 animals alive for a chance at the good stuff.
---
I kill the the SBQ in one or two seconds, not to brag but maybe you should just admit you're wrong.
---
Probably just a mutants rolling pin and a hunters machete anyway, don‚Äôt sweat it
---
Oh for sure
---
I don't care.
---
my camp is on a wood resource deposit. i planned to make arrows and feed them into my ammo converter, but never actually did that. still collected the wood tho.
---
so yeah, im gonna be unloading a LOT onto Russel's doorstep.
---
I mean, I'm part of the pts, they said they want us to try to brake the game so...
---
So first it does give you a little bit of damage and visual warning so not as random as you‚Äôre trying to make it seem you just need to pay attention. Also the whole point of the respawn timer is to add incentive to not die. If you‚Äôre having a hard time there‚Äôs always tea time.
---
the free states backpack is pretty small
---
You are right. That 20lbs is a killer. I have one and have to keep it on my character that has martial artist just to negate some of that weight üòì
---
they recently made it a no-camp zone, too. so we'll likepy be able to actually go inside vault 51 soon and explore without having a 3 minute time limit between NW matches.
---
Might have been disabled
---
Thats odds for you, I did Fastnacht over 200 times and I got 1 of the rare masks. I did Meat Week 6-12 times a day and I only got 1 Chally Mask and 8 of the costume without ever getting a tenderizer.
---
Oh I totally get attempting all the big bosses. I also get this nice bit of satisfaction even just powering up all three power plants. I meant in terms of getting lame rewards. I‚Äôve felt a bit of release/relief since getting all the gear I like or want, but do find myself looking for what legendary rewards I get and still throw scrip at Murmrgh and hope as though whatever I get is going to be for me, when really it is just going to be tossed in my vendors or dropped for a level 45/50 player that acts courteously.
---
The Vault isn't actually ruined, the devs moved the door because IIRC people were clipping though it and getting inside or something similar.
---
yes, but have you actually reversed the executable to check? maybe monitored incoming and outgoing packages?
---
fact is that they can't exactly have the playerbase fail community events like these. I'm 99% sure it's rigged.
---
they keep players busy with some meaningless task that's going to autocomplete anyway. it's a win-win.
---
They did have vault 94 open for awhile. It was more like a "dungeon" as you had limited time to clear and complete an objective. I wouldn't know the specifics though. I never did it as no one likes me enough to ask me to join their group lmao I kid I kid.
---
Sumo Bundle int the atomic shop!
---
If you finish their main quest I think that unlocks. You should have a three hour cool down and Its not a one hour anymore. I don‚Äôt think you have to actually be in a relationship with him for that to activate.
---
Did that my first time too lolz
---
If you‚Äôre using the camo secret service underarmor from the atom shop it‚Äôs still broken.
---
technically, yes. but they moved the finish line so that we would win. so we didn't.
---
Just curious. I died about 6-7 times my first run and my respawn time was 8 seconds.
---
there's no sneak multiplier in group events. rather, sneak multipliers don't trigger if the target is in combat with something else.
---
I found some yesterday so you just got bad rng right now
---
xxxSuperKillaxxx works just as good as Captain Poopy Butthole imho
---
On PC, through Steam, I picked up 3 in 30 minutes of play. Looted from corpses, I belive.
---
I still find them in 95% of the time in the launch prep room containers in nuke silos.
---
Wow... Nice work... Obligatory Beth CM tag. u/Ladydevann u/Valseek, u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
Also I never looked in any of those locations for technical data before, I just find it in random location containers
---
1 shot waaaaambulance over here. And from a 'member' no less. Shame. I thought youd like a challenge.
---
They don't protect you, they're designed to protect others from you. If you care about others at all. Also, waterborne viruses travel on droplets
---
Ahh gotcha
---
Was gonna say this, usually get one or two from filing cabinets in the launch room.
---
Do the math:
---
Started at noon on 8/20, ended at noon on 8/26.  20-21, 21-22, 22-23, 23-24, 24-25, 25-26.  That's 6 days.  It crossed 7 days but based on hours it was just 6 days.
---
So that means I can test it on the live servers too, right?
---
Woodchucker :-)
---
Whenever I use my bed I get the kindred spirit buff
---
There‚Äôs also no saying the online id isn‚Äôt just as bad.
---
I'm a herbivore marsupial speed demon that likes being part of a herd. I eat a lot of brain fungus soup and cranberry relish. The brain fungus soup lasts 30 minutes, which is about how long is takes to go from fully hydrated to in-the-red. Basically I have to eat the soup twice as often as the relish to keep both active.
---
While it does sometimes seem like hunger and thirst are dropping quickly, I've used these food timers to verify they are not. Some diseases and most chems, including stims, increase hunger and thirst.
---
It‚Äôs worth a shot. I could def select it and it turned blue
---
It's not necessary to complete him, but similarly when you are soloing him why deliberately choose to make it harder on yourself than it needs to be for the same reward?
---
 I found a bloody power fist in my ...  shit sandwich :-)
---
They used to have raid rotations on a few of the vaults but barely anyone knew about them and didn't join in to help so you'd usually be overrun by swarms of enemies
---
So why do i get sneak bonus during a colossal problem?
---
Let me know im always lookin for ppl to run with
---
For some reason I always grab the workshop at the race track up north. A while ago I had to protect it from waves of robots. Well, on paper at least. For some reason they spawned in the fair grounds and started fighting with the Scorched. Some of the robots died, but the last 3 of every wave managed to get stuck in a building. I had to leave the event zone to kill them, then quickly run back to the event zone to get my rewards.
---
But this feature could seriously use some attention. I spend more time waiting on the enemy to get within range/view than actually killing them.
---
Fuuuuuuuck that.
---
Lowbies: you need a guide for this event lmk. Screw high level xp hoarders and welcome to the wasteland! Youll find reddit isnt like most of us. Just the angry little posts mostly. 
---
I'll reiterate. If yiu are low and want a fun challenging event THAT you are entitled to, id be honored as a responder to help you attain success!
---
Everytime I die, the countdown takes longer each time (I think it's, 3 - 6 - 15 - 30 - 60 seconds)
---
Five level addiction junkie here... took the drugs back to back until I got the addicted notice. Then no more... just stay away from the drugs that have negative effects on your strength. (Psycho is one if those) Having that 5 level addiction with a Junkie handmade or Fixer is huge!!! :)
---
oof
---
I think even after all the duping not many people bothered with radium mods.
---
too bad you're not on PC. I know me and Baronik have them all unlocked. well, I'm missing prime. but still.
---
Wish they‚Äôd bring it back sounds kinda fun
---
Sometimes if you start a new character and discover it, it works. Your atoms/challenges are account wide FYI
---
Not being able to scrap shit on our CAMP area is so damn stupid lol.
---
Exploration or is there a mission/real purpose to go there?
---
So I'm not the only one who thinks Bethesda completes the challenges to make us feel special
---
Guess it runs in the family.
---
No that‚Äôs 6 consecutive 24 hour periods. That‚Äôs not how it works. The event was available on 7 consecutive days. 
---
Just like you said. It was available over 7 days. 
---
That‚Äôs how it works. 
---
Sorry that you‚Äôre wrong.
---
Lol I have both prime recievers. I've crafted and scrapped upwards of 50 and have unlocked 11 mods out of 45.
---
I would love mailboxes. For both letting people know what you think of their camps and for people who place things out for trade. 
---
I hate adding random strangers to my friends list and this would allow players to send them an in game message saying: will you take X,Y,Z for your A,B,C. 
---
Even if you do not trade, like myself, it would be a very useful addition.
---
There is no escape, and that is for sure!
---
you don't. unless everyone else in your group is sneaking as well, of course.
---
it's a known bug and several people made videos on it, including turtle I think.
---
in regards to ACP specifically, my crits don't trigger. except they do, I think. it's a visual bug, maybe? point is that you can't rely on the damage numbers alone.
---
Hey other hard working adults. Whelp, back to work. (Runs thru reddit for rest of lunch)
---
Says the dude that has never played the game.
---
I'm not a big PVPer so I've never done Nuclear Winter. Thanks for the info!
---
It would work pretty well now with the public teams system
---
People gotta have all the power for 1 light bulb ya know
---
Happens to me almost every day, Xbox. Main menu social list won‚Äôt appear, but once I‚Äôm in a server I can look at social and it works that way.
---
Much like most Maniacs today are!
---
I have 2, that way when the single mole rat does chew threw one I still have power to my vending machine.
---
And if that doesn't work we'll send him to Sergeant Dornan.
---
Agreed, every fallout, I hunt down the vaults, to eagerly explore them. FO76, vaults were supposed to be raids only. Err, wut? That ended up being a short lived thing and I'm glad they are starting to open them up for exploration.
---
Does show Beth is really out of touch with what Fallout players want and expect.
---
I'm a mothman add controller..   Some heros wear cute capes
---
Lel. Give me a Chuckle 
---
Have an updoot
---
I lost count. must've crafted well over 500 of the damn things.
---
Gone on PC for people using the Beth launcher.
---
What system?
---
Make sense
---
But they didn't connect the fusions to the vendors
---
Some I seen connected different generators
---
You go to collect and it‚Äôs just full of insults. 
---
Why doesn‚Äôt the communist one give sickles?  It gives hammers.
---
No I still body, but as a level 270 have the best guns and armor in the game i shouldn't by dying to this and no the roof falls and kills u instantly u might wanna do the event again bud, just cause u hide in the center the whole time doesn't mean ur good.
---
Xbox
---
Already did every time I‚Äôve discovered beckley still nothing even traveled from f76 to beckley solo.
---
Would it be a good spot to farm legendaries? Did those spawn there?
---
I have the opposite problem, I haven't looted any containers or bodies yet some how I end up with 5-10 in my inventory everyday.
---
I had five in my last CAMP because I had an empty middle floor. I just filled it with generators and made a sort of "maintenance" floor, then locked the door, put "Employees Only" signs by its sides and never opened it again. They weren't even hooked to anything other than eachother ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
It was intended as a temporary measure before I figured out what to put there, but I ended up moving before changing it.
---
Oof. All the screws
---
Dude...I legit forgot about this...I thought the stupid  "drop excess crap for stupid reward" thing was over
---
Found one yesterday in the university while going to grab some lead so they're still spawning.
---
I guess just bad rng.
---
EDIT: Just tested quickly at Whitesprings bunker and found two of them among the 20ish desks i checked, so yep they're still spawning.
---
I don‚Äôt hide in the center I just move when it starts to fall ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
You are in luck, contact GT Yabvone he does full mods on Radiums at ~1250-1500 caps
---
Can't answer that, only thing j can think is the aesthetics, maybe they want the camp to look a certain way.
---
Since always. Open the map or fast-travel to fix it.
---
I never thought of it like that. I was kinda dreading this feature because sometimes I just want to run around in the forest gathering plants and not worrying about what I run in to. But you made me realize that it opens up a lot more pros than cons.
---
The one thing I will add about the standard PUGs is that it does lead to a bit of elitism. In world of warcraft, for example, if you wanted to pug mythic dungeons, you had to have a good '[raider.io](https://raider.io) score'. Meaning that you have to sign up to a 3rd party website and install a mod that tracks all your progress in dungeons and such in order to prove that you can handle the content. It leads to a bit of problems because it makes it much more difficult for a new player to get into a group since many groups have a pre-set requirement to have a high [raider.io](https://raider.io) score.
---
With FO76, the way I can see this playing out is: The leader might say that you can only join if you have a bloodied build (for example).
---
Absolute mad lad
---
Reviving with stims costs like 20+ packs sometimes. It‚Äôs all about the quack doctor
---
April fools day would be a perfect day to sell it.
---
To each there own I say
---
Maybe u got some better graphics or settings cause i dont see these "warnings" u guys are talking about i sure wish I did though cause this is easily the dumbest way to die.
---
Yeah not having unlocked vaults is a major fun-killer.
---
Yea I'm pretty sure legendary enemies spawned, how it worked was that each vault had 4 tasks you needed to a certain week to finish the raid and while you did those tasks waves of enemies got sent at you
---
Only if they allowed us to change the names of characters first
---
With ACP, people should never have trouble with screws or acid again haha
---
Gone for me on Steam as well...
---
Lol, if you want to be regularly insultednl in your camp, just place the raider punk. That guys a dick.
---
Tweak your build dude, I run full bloodied and can get threw the event with ease without dying.
---
Thanks! I've never experienced it before, and I've been playing for a while. My other character is a melee build though so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it.
---
MORE POWER
---
How? I just can't figure out how to not get one shot by Wendigos
---
Nice! Thanks dude!
---
Cappy? Is that you?
---
I have SPENT...the last...six-and-one-half-hours trying...TO de-vise an insult sufficient FOR a sub-human MUTANT like you. My CPU is NEARLY...MELTING from the...TASK. Try again TOMORROW.
---
I‚Äôve been logged in every singe day of meat week during reset and never got the bug. Anytime I got it the game wasn‚Äôt running and I was at work. I finished the legendary run a few weeks ago and I‚Äôve been trying to get mine to bug out. I‚Äôll log into the ATX, nuclear winter, anything. Nothing that anyone says causes them to bug, has caused them to bug. I don‚Äôt think this is a simple issue that just avoiding doing one thing will fix.
---
Ah damn. I'm on PC but thank you tho!
---
Sweet. Thanks. Now my collection is complete.
---
&gt;The budget limit is there for a very good reason.
---
Fallout 4 also had a budget that was much higher. And if I pay for something, I want to fucking use it.
---
Exploration, and it'll be one of the possible locations for the new Daily Ops system
---
Thank you all. I‚Äôll just pick it up and try it out for one month. My purpose is really to horde a ton of scrap so I can remove it from my stash.
---
I bet we'll get to revisit Point Lookout area from fo3, since it's in Maryland and parts of the eastern fo76 map are already Maryland
---
Agreed!  The durability of all launchers is garbage, and needs to be reworked pronto. My explosives build keeps Weapon Artisan always on b/c of how often I need to repair my stuff.
---
But Text Chat would be "unimmersive" fucking idiots. Give us text chat Bethesda.
---
Id be more than happy to take them off your hands
---
Wow, so I can have my goofy scrap collectron jokes and the raider guns and booze?
---
Blocker/evasive/dodgy I have some quitepoor unyielding WWR armour and even so I can take 3-4 hits from wendingos before I need to stimpac myself.
---
What plans you got?
---
I know it's a hollow thing to say, but if I had any gold, I'd give it to you.
---
üëç
---
Mine is Mules Verne.
---
Ill have to check. Wendigo plushie i think? Maybe one other rare one. I gave the heads plan away
---
I ate the pumpkin pie in the Overseers house today and died.  I am also a bloodied build =)
---
I want a Sunny one. I just want a Sunny one.
---
It may double the cores but fusion cores aren‚Äôt worth the flux to begin with
---
But! I have a good rng.... Whacha looking for?
---
i had lvl 8, survived whole time and revived 3guys  :))
---
kill the wendigos. they often spawn with the ammo you killed them in. I'm consistently walking away with more ammo than when I started.
---
I said it was an issue, not a bug (although it probably is a bug). And I still shouldn't have to do all of that, especially when I'm in the middle of an event or something I can't walk away from just to shut down my vendors. That's ridiculous and illogical.
---
Oh boy!
---
An ex-colleague of mine makes plushies on request. I told her she should make a Sheepsquatch plushie when that first came out and it would sell like crazy.
---
I don't have to trust them, it's in their best interest. Do they really want videos all over the internet of you teaming up with IFuggtURmom69, puzzyl0v3r420 and [racialstereotype]bustertron?
---
Wait what? Where can you get it? I've been on holiday for about a week now, feels like I'm missing all the good stuff.
---
Do scorched spawn as legendary now?
---
Yup! If you‚Äôve got them unlocked in the Atomic Shop, at least.
---
Snallygaster plushie!
---
Mailboxes for camps were datamined like a year ago. I wish they would actually do something with them
---
A bowman would be awesome.
---
I've been on several servers where a nuke is *just* not dropped. Several high levels on my building team and they just don't want to.
---
THIS. I think most people didn't go for it.
---
There is a vault that is partially caved in and you can't see a vault number. I wondered what the story was behind this too.
---
That's why there's a challange to kill a wendigo while wearing a clown costume
---
This happens to me all the time with any gun, I find the quickest fix is to aim in again even if it's stuck aimed in it should fix it or open the map
---
Well if you‚Äôre running bloodied I think maybe a full health build is what you should do. Don‚Äôt know what to tell you dude. It gets red then little shards start falling. Dying easily is part of the glass cannon idea in all build type of games you gotta keep your head on the swivel. You can‚Äôt go bitching cause the game has been way too easy for way too long and suddenly there‚Äôs something that makes a full health build have a benefit.
---
What part of break the game didn't you understand? You can't break some mythical test server. Ofcourse you have to test it on live servers!
---
I had a bunch of crops when the challenges still had "craft some booze" every now and then. Haven't planted them back since I last moved my camp 2 weeks ago and I indeed don't miss them.
---
While I think missile launchers need a big damage buff, I actually feel like Fatmans and AGLs are in a decent spot. I 1 shot most big target enemies with my Fatman and the AGL is hilarious vs Scorchbeasts with their homing VATS grenades or packs of ghouls/scorched. They just need a total overhaul of how weapon durability works. This problem effects split beam laser weapons pretty bad as well.
---
There a post about not getting the atoms for killing the scorch beast queen. That player sent a support  ticket in and they awarded the atoms. I‚Äôm not sure if it marks the task as completed though. That user sent a pic of him looking at the loot in the Queen body. Also make sure you are on a team so your user name is in the screen shot. Try sending in a screen shot in of you in Beckley on the map screen while on a team so your name in right there. That should be enough proof to show you did the challenge.
---
thanks for the tip, i just hate how wallpaper strips off everything on the wall including wires so i haven't really used it much.
---
I will not.  I farm for me. =)
---
Oh it‚Äôs ganna take 2-3 more bullets F that how could they? Don‚Äôt they know the kill only counts if it‚Äôs a 1 tap? How egregious!
---
I will stim anyone that goes down but if you‚Äôre going in full bloodied of course you‚Äôre going to keep dying. Is it fair that everyone has to keep reviving you? If you‚Äôre saying it was 60 seconds then you died quite a lot.
---
My best weapon is a TSE Lever Action, am I pretty much fucked?
---
I run nearly every mutation with no real downside. I would hate if mutants was comparable. It would make having a specialized build useless
---
I shoot those insult bots on sight so not for me.
---
I wish but like so many things these days they limit what we can gift, drop, sell and trade.
---
Sweet. I wonder how many playing the game would get the reference.
---
You're not forced to play with 4-5 people. If you don't make the first 8, don't play the event, and wait until the next attempt.
---
I don't feel that it's low, and it kinda resembles the one on PA, definitely not high though.
---
I use the jetpack to gain air time after jumping, not to fly, can stay in the air for quite a few extra secs if controlled well.
---
You seriously comparing camp budget on single player game to a online game? You are clearly delusional on how and why the limits exist and for what reason.
---
No, but you‚Äôre going to find it a lot slower to take out lvl 75+ enemies, especially mutants.
---
It's luck of the draw. I have killed it with 2 people and failed with 8. It's all dependent upon what builds show up and how much damage can they do. On average, you are correct,  it's been groups of 4 or 5. Like I said it's just random who you get placed with.
---
[Us](https://www.memedroid.com/memes/detail/2785919) headed to Todd to change that
---
Ty for the tips
---
Berry mentats should glow blue when corpses are near.
---
I'm about to get the jet pack but I've been using marsupial and I feel like I may as well just use the 2k on something else.  I'm torn
---
Blocker3 has made all the difference for me.  I don‚Äôt normally run it, but it has changed that event for me.
---
Ah, delightful. I already basically lean on VATS as it is, and lately I‚Äôve been really struggling with the AP drain. RIP
---
No however I'm making him do it next time
---
This happened to me on pc.  I just rebooted and it fixed it.  Good luck
---
Maybe this is their origin story! Children of Atom originally appeared in FO3 so there‚Äôs not really any previous lore as to where they were from, they very well could have originated from WV. Stories could have made their way through the wasteland of people with extraordinary mutations blessed by radiation itself.
---
Death by pumpkin pie,  that‚Äôs how I want to go out.
---
The same problem with me and all my friends in the party
---
no not all
---
I actually can though thats the thing I can speak what i think is annoying with this game, even when I put my health half way its still an insta kill with nearly 450 damage resistance Im aloud to be annoyed theres no significant indicator for me, I worked my way to be on the level that I am, and bloodied is about to take a giant nerf anyway
---
The best was when I went to a player's camp to check out their vendors and it was done to the brim with Communist style and propaganda.... only to find the prices on everything absurdly high.
---
Dude.  Same.  The moment pumpkin spice shows up in stores I lose my mind.
---
I feel I would rather a watoga terminal in which I can send an insult bot to active players for a fee. Same way i thought I would be able to place bounties on players. Creating some sense of pvp justice. 76 is a game with a lot of potential and very little execution.
---
iv killed it with only 3 other rando's before so *shrugs* it depends entirely on gear and shit honestly
---
Well a bow or compound bow, hunting rifle, 10mm, combat knife and then any two handed melee weapons you get should be almost broken for full TLOU immersion where the thing breaks after you use it 3 times (I would suggest the Cursed Pickax with the Sharp mod since it makes it look like an ax and the cursed effect makes it break faster). Gear is fairly unimportant as you can put an outfit on over it, as for the outfit itself I would say go with the Explorer outfit or the miner outfit for some common ones, the winter jacket is a rarer one to aim for I guess. As far as perks go, I would say dump starts into Perception for the bow and rifle (you will probably want to focus on rifle as bows are much harder to use reliably), Agility for the handgun, strength should be utilized to maximize carrying capacity. Intelligence should be used to get weapon modding for sure and make explosives more effective. I would also say get luck to gain the scrounger abilities to find more aid ammo and food.
---
I'll definitely have to look at it, 45% less damage is worth it in an event like that
---
Oh it's awesome anyways. Just ugly on your back. Cushion your legs and it frees up 2 agility from Goat Legs if you use that. Need to grind for 2 Unyielding Fall Damage pieces.
---
Eh I could see both sides of the argument I see how people don't want to have mobs be difficult because bullet sponge mobs if they're not super mutant overlords and shit would be dumb, I can understand unique enemies being tough to kill not normal mobs . But I also see how people want difficulty in fallout to not be such a walk in the park either, and be a little more challenging. I'm more in the middle of having a average difficulty in the game, I want the game to be somewhat challenging but also don't want it to be dark souls tedious or a borderlands 3 bullet sponge fest. And I'm also for nerfs if they're reasonable but not to outrageous aswell. Like some other poster on this thread said we're going to have to wait till the changes go live to see if it's that bad or not.
---
Here is how I see it.  If we are not going to kill him in time then I am going to leave with a metric butt ton of screws =)
---
seriously not even for a free collectron
---
I couldn't at Poseidon or Monogah.
---
Yeah the system doesn't quite handle things perfect it has at least gotten better over time, I remember there was one point where I couldn't adjust the volume on my headset or use volume leveling that xbox had in settings because the system registered my headset as having the ability to do it but it only had a volume knob not the volume leveling for game vs chat. I do kinda miss my turtle beach headset I used with the 360 only because I could adjust the chat and game volume with a knob on the cord.
---
for as far as I've gotten through TLOU, and what I remember of it, start with a 10mm pistol,  a bolt action rifle, a bow, and some molotovs.
---
So you‚Äôre saying that I should leave my lvl 17 junkie alt at home for this one?
---
Is this a bannable thing? I would love to put one at my base but would hate to get my account banned if they considered it a glitch or something of the like .
---
You have not mastered the jetpack tap
---
Im fine with my raider bot. And Fluffy is more savage, then insult bot
---
I feel like they did something to the marsupial jump height.  I used to be able to jump on a roof in my camp that was 1.5 stories tall, now I can only jump slightly more than 1 story.
---
I never even get teammates, i was solo fighting it. I was doing good untill i lost attention for a sec a died and his health reset :(
---
Probably powering illicit ammo manufacturers.
---
use a prosnap yo..
---
It‚Äôs hit or miss. I‚Äôve gotten there as the only person and used it to kill wendigos and farm screws. Then I did it last night when 7 armored gods melted him in 7 or 8 minutes showed up. I only had time to pick up 70 screws, that was my biggest disappointment so far.
---
Nope. I don‚Äôt use them now.  I could care less about an annoying collectron.
---
Fuck that, I want a mute mfer, no wait I want one that does sign language. You skin that bastard how ever just don‚Äôt forget to shut it the fuck up.
---
I enjoy PvP. I do regularly take unowned workshops and hope for PvPers to show up and fight. Heck, some of my friends have blueprinted PvP arenas that they build in a workshop. It's a lot of fun.   
---
And yes, I occasionally also take a workshop that has already been built up. I usually only take the workshops that have a resource that I want to farm, but that resource is secondary to just enjoying PvP. All that said, I am not some god-tier PvPer. I am not level 300 (most my PvP is on a character that just got over 100), I'm not running with god mode gear (no legacies, hell, I'm using two-star weapons and T-51b Power Armour), and when I take someone's workshop, I don't stack consumables. It's a fair fight.   
---
If I notice that the person is severely under leveled, I've even left the workshops and let them be...unless they start firing on me first. You fire on me, you're saying you want to test your luck, and that's fair too. I don't seek revenge on lower levels who beat me - they earned the glory of that kill. And if I beat the lower level, and they don't seek revenge, I have gone and found them and dropped them a care package for their courage.  
---
Now, if you're a higher level, its a different story. If you're pushing level 200 and I run in with my (at the time) level 75 and take your shit, and you keep hitting revenge and coming back for more, I'm gonna keep handing it out. Again, it's all fair.  
---
All that said...I do wish Bethesda would get rid of the broken legacy items. I think they are \*not\* all fair, and they often bypass the limitations set on PvP. I have even turned down the offer of one in trade for a rare outfit, because I think they are unbalanced, and winning with one just doesn't take skill, nor is it fun.
---
I find that having bird bones helps with your jetpack loft as well as remaining airborne a bit longer
---
I had some bad potato salad during meat week. Dead.
---
k then don't but i really wanna get these rewards for the new players
---
Am looking for any of the rare plans I haven‚Äôt got to be honest. I don‚Äôt suppose you have a list at all?
---
I've seen it trading in a certain trading subreddit for legacies and god rolls.
---
The value is only going to go up after the second Meat Week so I'd consider trying to get one ASAP if you have the means.
---
Since when?
---
I am going to try this tonight to see if it works. Thank you for the idea üòÑ
---
Nah, explosive damage on guns doesn't need a massive fucking resist either. It's down to only 20%, it's fine where it is. All bosses already have a flat damage reduction, I think 70% for SBQ and 90% for earle. There is absolutely no reason that explosive damage should be decreased even further on top of that. The only explosions that need a nerf are energy weapons, and bethesda promised "adjustments" to that 19 months ago so they clearly don't care
---
Im just gonna say it. Foundation is a cult. No doubt about it. If you sit there and listen to half the stuff they say you get cultie vibes.
---
restart your machine
---
Bethesda already said they put loggers into the game to track why this is happening after the last update.
---
Is your camp ally the same gender as your character?
---
IIRC, opposite gender gets lovers embrace, same gender gets kindred spirit.
---
They reset 20 hours from your first purchase of the day.
---
Do Abbie. Just put 15 in strength and 15 in endurance to become unreasonably built up lololol
---
The fewest was just me and another guy, we still killed Earle ( i got killed by collapsing shaft so no loot for me) and there were more than ten min left. Another time i was with a 200ish and three others ranged from level 20 to 45, still a success. Bring your ammo and stims and repair kits you can definitely do it with less than 8. The key is higher dps, so rifleman/pistol/bow might not be viable.
---
For real? Not at the same time every day?
---
You smell like scrap
---
U on PC?  Got a 3* bloodied ultracite gat laser.
---
Already dropped off about 4k of wood.  Going to need to enable that wood perk again to double up on harvests.
---
Not off the top.
---
I do however have some great outfits in my mule. Ill check after work.
---
An example of a rare plan? I have a ton of gifts unopened and i know they give plans. Tell me what youre looking for. Me a mama m got a thing.
---
Watoga high school. Don‚Äôt loot any of the round files unless it has a tech in it.
---
WATER PURIFIERS!
---
Teach me your techniques, sensei.
---
4 optimized players can easily take it. wipe spawns, keep moving and stay on the opposite side of the drill.
---
BUILT LIKE AN OX
---
No my character is a guy and the ally is the settler wanderer who's a female
---
Strange in Numbers may have skewed your results.
---
Well over 500, I counted thousands when I unlocked everything.
---
Do the A Colossal Problem event and hope for the plan to drop. :)
---
Or check player vendors.
---
It looks like the Settlers campaign deals with Motherlode-001, whereas the events of "The Motherlode" (and the weirdly sapient/sentient Motherlode) is Motherlode-003.   
---
So, Motherlode-003 is still there for you!
---
Man, I see you in comments more than any single other person.   Or maybe I just notice it more because we both have beef in our name.
---
So what?
---
I'm disappointed too. 
---
I loved discovering new vaults in the games, even the really scary ones.
---
Arktos pharma lab comes close to that thrill.
---
Bonus points if the junk collectors and water purifiers are all locked as well.
---
Not a daily quest.
---
The most important thing as melee is to keep your back to a wall and kite the boss away from everyone else. You only 1 shot them on a power attack.
---
I run half life Bloodied full t65 and two handers.
---
I‚Äôm glad random people can‚Äôt attack our camps anymore in Pacifist mode.    Now if I could stop the random Angler attack.....
---
Apparently I‚Äôve been doing this challenge since I was 19
---
Well then everyone‚Äôs free to make fun too ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. Too me people complaining about proper end game content is annoying. Half health with proper armour is not an instakill if you truly have the gear you speak of. Or your perks set up halfway right. And the bloodied nerf is not that it‚Äôs a change across the board in all damage calculation.
---
If youre in PA without emergency protocols, you might want to change that. if not PA serendipity, dodgy, and blocker. As soon as you health takes a hit jump and stim.
---
Why not just T-bag them? It speeds the whole process up, or stand over them and simply say, ‚Äú You got knocked tha fuck out!!‚Äù And walk away. Lol  -your local high health heavy gunner-
---
Not too bad, i lost four loots already. One to bubble bath, one to collapsed shaft, one to falling amber, and one to the 60 sec timer. The timer is the most annoying.
---
Were they next to the wayward on PC? I ran across a camp like that earlier this week. had a bunker and a 'factory' all dressed up in a communist with a fence surrounding it. They were even in the Red Scare PA.
---
One question, if someone said something like "Hey, Red!" would you even register that?
---
I also like to have some idea of what I want my character's backstory to be when I create a new one, but I cant imagine I'd ever hear their name in game and immediately register that someone is trying to talk to me.
---
It sure does create frustration. I've never gotten anything good from that old hag...
---
Thing is, if people accept this arbitrary system as given and not complain about it, nothing will ever change.
---
One does not simply master the jetpack technique you must harness the taps into oneself then you will learn my pupil
---
And you need to realise the cult of the mega sloth is coming. Some weirdo at crater told me. 
---
Gonna crack open a beer and sacrifice a deer or something idk.
---
I mean I‚Äôm after a lot but it‚Äôs what you have and what you‚Äôre willing to trade. 
---
Urban Scout Mask? Other than that it may be easier if I come see what you have when you logon and then make the offer here if I see something I like?
---
The only delusional one I see around here is *you*, Bethesda isn't a small indie company, they could easily find a way to increase camp budget and keep server stability fine.
---
Don‚Äôt ever close. Literally wait ten minutes or a little more and you will be able to and most likely not lose the rewards. I had this happen numerous times but one time during encrypted event it happened and I said no I‚Äôm not losing my shit. So I let it sit for ten minutes and was able to respawn and get loot. Had it happen after killing queen waited ten minutes got to respawn and even got the flux and stuff being I died before event completed popped.
---
Yup.  Caps, Scrip and Bullion (the Machine) all reset 20 hours from when you first use them.  So if you get your scrip at noon then it will reset at 8am the next day but if you wait till 4pm for your caps then you have to wait till noon.
---
I just skipped a day and started doing them all in the morning before work.  That way on my lunch or after work I can just play.
---
I‚Äôm gonna beat ZAX up.
---
Sleep at home more often? :)
---
  I have the female settler wander as well, but my char is female.  
---
The few times I've actually slept in my camp, I got kindred spirit.
---
There were a few threads about those buffs around the time allys were released - trying to recall those is where the same/opposite question came from.
---
Most people‚Äôs name tags are like that anyway.
---
I think monster plushes is a great way to add longetivity to misc endgame. I wouldn't mind hunting Yaoi guais or flatwood monsters for a chance for plush. Even a Mothman plush would be cool in variants like vengeful and peaceful.
---
I can only not see certain friends through social for some reason.    They aren‚Äôt appearing offline, and are in-game, but they never show up on the social tab list.   Others show up every time.
---
Less wiring cluttering the camp?
---
I've seen people use more than one if they're running a huge field of water purifiers + 4 vendors... other than that... maybe the aesthetic? The use of even one fusion generator is often excessive but I suspect most people don't want to think about how much power they need if they could just have like... lots of it.
---
Sounds prudent. I think i have some rare outfits. Some kinda leather coat (not greaser) resp police and a few others. No US mask but ill get my inv when im on! If it's a highly rare item perhaps there will need to be more balance but i love a good natured trade! Im not sure how courriers work but if a deal is reached ill pay for that security happily :) I go by egg in game. Good to meet you
---
Psn: egroegy
---
Ace does this already.
---
I used to use improved repair kits, but after using 10 every wave I ran out and haven't used it since.
---
That makes buying more options a lot more appealing!
---
You could try getting set of 4 pieces of armor with -20% weapon weight and the +10 to carry weight....
---
This also removes any particular weapon weight perks unless you specially want any of the particular bonuses / usable glitche bonuses....
---
my own example of 9-10 base str, 4 pieces of armor with -20%, and 3-4 out of the 5 armor pieces has +10 carry mod, + lv50 backbag + (agility perk line equvalent weight reduce for food &amp; water , could also shift that for chem one aswell) , so base carryweight is 310 and 330+ with food, up to 400 if needed for short moments with chem and drinks)
---
This is also a Full health build, could be said for junkie base aswell....
---
For commando weapon i"m using handmade AA,fff  but i"m also hauling .45 rifle, vampire gatling, the quest .50 and ultracide gatling laser for larger buggers.
---
Could have been a different server or a player could have bombed your camp with explosive bait which is still exploitable and will damage player camps when not engaged in PVP.
---
Caps, Scrip and Treasury Note deposits all reset 20 hours from when you first made a sale to them after their last refresh. This is whiners a good practice to make at least one sale to each as soon as possible. 
---
If you wait until the end of your play session, then depending on how long that session was and when you plan to play again the next day, you can run into this. 
---
Example:  Start playing at 12 noon, and don‚Äôt turn any Treasury Notes in until 5 pm. The next day you start playing at 12 noon again. The rest is still an hour away. But if you‚Äôd turned in even one Treasury Note at noon yesterday, that would have started the refresh timer and you‚Äôd have a full bank again when you logged on.
---
Once beat him with only 3 people. It really comes down to builds.
---
Edit: it was more like 2 people. One was a level 18. Not sure how that worked out.
---
Scarecrows surrounded by turrets on blocks.
---
I totally agree, as long as I can change it whenever I like in character editing. Half my characters have changed a lot since I started them.
---
I'd like a bag like the vault duffel bag for dropped items. Or failing that, a good old fashioned handbag!
---
That's why you had guilds.  And really if the leader only wants bloody builds, then the leader can sit and wait until he has his team.  I did WoW way back in the day, and camping outside Black Temple hoping to get in a group wasn't fun, but you almost always got an opportunity to run it.    
---
Area chat would help.
---
I got stuck in a team of 4 when it first was released and we killed him in ten minutes. I used bloodied fixer and rest where in power armor. I also used magic junkies mini so it‚Äôs possible if ppl have right guns
---
I either get a mole rat that stays permanently underground or enamours that run so far away the quest fails me for leaving üòÄ
---
\*Mr Insult Bot teleports behind you\* "Huh so there are things you're good at, no insult for you today"
---
Not rly need 60+ fps for magic. My fps varies from 30 to 60 and my magic minigun works just fine
---
Bro ur not getting the point the event is NOT HARD TO DO i can sit in the middle the whole time WITH MY B2525 HM too, I have full uny secret service armor which is the best damage resistance armor in the game and id almost indefinitely out damage u any day with my perk cards as they are the best for commando and rifleman which is why I shouldn't be dying to a stupid falling roof ur completely missing the point bud
---
A buddy and I saved all three extra vaults to explore over a weekend when we party up. Imagine our disappointment...
---
Ah
---
Havnt donated a single thing.  Things still got completed.  U will get it
---
I definitely need to look at dodgy and blocker
---
Thanks. I will try that if it ever happens again.
---
Magic?
---
Yeah, I'm a HW Power Armor character, but I don't really have a build yet. Best legendary I have is a furious ultracite laser gatlin. :/
---
The timer is definitely the worst, you can watch him die and you can't do anything
---
Thanks. I just have to wait an hour more.
---
There‚Äôs already berry mentats. They should highlight recent bodies since the biological process doesn‚Äôt just fully stop the moment you die.
---
Get it!  Used properly it markedly increases jump height.
---
First, jump with a light tap.  As you begin to fall, tap again.
---
There are variations you can discover on your own, like saving just enough juice so that you can land without stopping.
---
Go to YouTube and go search angry turtle and look up his video and magic weapons.
---
Yea accidents happen I can accept that, but this timer is completely artificial annoyance
---
I did finish the quest and the lovers embrace was happening each time I slept in a bed (I always sleep in my own camp before heading out into the wasteland) so this is very weird.
---
Yeah, I have tried them. They do not tend to work for me.
---
Mate. I am so sorry. I just logged back in and as I was fast travelling to my camp someone literally bought it from my machine. It‚Äôs sat in their for almost 5 days with takers!!!
---
If I get another I‚Äôll let you know. But I‚Äôm so sorry to have gone through all that.
---
What inside of the vault was that again lol?
---
They look cool.
---
If I remember correctly, once you've selected a new body for Polly you need to return to the Wayward and talk to both Polly and the Dutchess for the next quest to trigger.
---
Yes!
---
Not at all. Appreciate your candor regardless; add me. All the people i know i just give excess stuff to.
---
How did you get the plans initially? Ty very much in adv
---
Will do
---
It's the USA, communism is for the rich. Radiation poisoning for everyone else.
---
If it was a max of 30 seconds, I don't think it'll be too bad. But 60 is ridiculous
---
I‚Äôve had this happen with my guass shotgun it is annoying but yeah it fixes itself most times. Worst is when you‚Äôre Fighting the queen and it happens
---
They really should let people explore Vault 51 outside of NW. Even if it ties to ranking up in NW. It has a lot of stuff to check out in it but you get like a minute to do so while waiting for a NW match to load.
---
Thiccc
---
Found the reddit Karen.
---
Dodgy will eat up your ap, so ap regen buffs, nuka colas etc help a lot
---
I launch Encryptid constantly (mostly because I have over 30 of these cards since they're my only caps sink) and I always get 4+ people per event. Averaging at 6 people or so. 
---
People will still run A Colossal Problem because of the absurd amounts of screws and XP it gives. As well as guaranteed legendaries for scrip and 8 treasury notes for bullion.
---
the real question is: so what? of all the games to be worried about having an agenda, I'd say Fo76 ranks pretty low.
---
not to mention the mothman and cultists in general are an important part of the game. and that raiders are vicious by nature, displaying the corpses of their enemies as a warning. or just as a trophy. and some of them are cannibals.
---
I searched for them for ages and someone on here got some for me so I purchased those. Then I got a Meat Tenderizer plan drop and then another in one day. I swapped one of them for this signs and letters plan to stick in my machine. 
---
Bloody Sod‚Äôs law. 
---
I‚Äôll add you now.
---
Well I get the same effects with my gauss shotgun I just do a gun bash and it fixes itself but I wish it didn‚Äôt do that because it happens almost every time
---
*FACEPALM*
---
No fret friend. I don't stress over a game. Seems counter intuitive
---
Worried about this with conventional explosive weapons as well, but those have always been weak since the initial explosives nerf so it comes with the territory.
---
After dropping off 15 over two months ago I have not found any. After dropping that 15 off I had another 15 and the daily would never show up so I sold to vendor bot and have not found any since. Ppl acted like I was crazy.
---
Hail satan
---
If we start out with the philosophy that ‚Äúthe first one‚Äôs always free‚Äù, guaranteed we fill the wasteland with junkie builds.
---
So the small pop up in the top left corner is annoying but quests, picking up legendaries and other shit blocking your view is cool? 
---
What?
---
I joined one ACP and 6 of the players were between 20-60 range. while waiting for the shaft to open two of them died to those two wendigos. 
---
I laughed and bailed. 
---
put away my J HM and took my 400 level ass to fist punch level 1 robots at fertile soil.
---
I‚Äôm level 250, do you know the max levels for each region?
---
Never played NW ... still had Autocompletes
---
I agree - area chat would help. So would a LFG channel and a in game guild system. I know alot of people use discord but it would be nice to have guilds as a game feature.
---
A b 2525 handmade? What‚Äôs that? Commando????????? Never heard of it. But I can seem to avoid the falling roof no problem. Just saying. Already solod it FYI.
---
It's the misty mountains calling, little hobbit..
---
Not a bug. Just an exploit.
---
For someone but Hong about down voting you do a lot of it slugger. I meant bitching but Hong sounds fun though
---
Cheers man i got a few junkies bits nothing special but I imagine the bonus makes it worth it. Didn't want to start swapping perks messing with taking chems etc i know the negative effects puts you off a bit but its a trade off and I'm not real bothered about bloodied. The fixer is what I'm aiming at ive got a couple tendy plans so its a possibility I'll get a decent one. Appreciate the reply my dude üòÉ
---
This evening I can not. But I will gladly join another day. 
---
GT: Walrus Parkour.
---
I played FO4 immediately after TLOU. I was so disappointed. Gameplay was cleaner and less ‚Äúcut-sceney‚Äù but the story... omg
---
Just sucks I have a full ap refresh weapon weight reduction scout armor set right now.  Idk if I can give it up lol
---
Eh, they make a pill for that though.
---
nah, I comment a lot.
---
Bro its not hard to solo u stand in the middle on a box the whole time ik im farming ammo of wendigos thats the only time I ever die. The thing is insanely squishy its not an accomplishment to solo it.
---
I mean getting a magic weapon is kinda easy but I guess it's still lucky if you get one
---
This happens to me with my plasma caster all the time.
---
There are some that are still bugged (Abandoned Bog Town) but if you snag screenshots and attach them in a ticket they‚Äôll usually fix it for you. It‚Äôs kinda like the queen, I‚Äôve beaten her multiple times and gotten the loot but never been able to accomplish the ‚Äúkill tough enemies‚Äù achievement.
---
What about when Earle just straight up disappears through the ceiling for 10 minutes? Is that addressed too? Because that‚Äôs the only reason my team lost the event, lol
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! HE DID IT!!
---
I always thought it was hard by how people always want one but who knows. Either way it's good I guess
---
Those robots had it coming mate
---
I do it when It happens to me first idk what to tell ya bud probably shouldn't do it first üëå
---
I wish someone would give me the crocolossus backpack plans ;_;
---
The one time i saw it at a players vendor i didnt have the caps ;_;
---
But yes, some people in this community are amazing!
---
I always give people that just come out of the vault some supplies. :)
---
So I wasn't crazy, Durability is subtracted for hits, not shots.
---
The overseer has a display case in her home that has a vault-tec style, blue and yellowish gold backpack. It‚Äôs the same appearance as the camp supplies backpack from just before leaving the vault in the beginning. It‚Äôs kinda cool,  but unfortunately I think it‚Äôs the same size as the standard green version that we already have.
---
Rock on!  Glad to help.
---
So... in game, everyone jumps off with PA?
---
I have a mic and think i have good gear for it..count me in. JrArevalo956  pm me your gt.and thanks!
---
&gt;Which side is spewing disinformation?
---
None. Most people testing on PTS and giving positive opinions are hardcore players who will finally get to use their top tier guns and grinded ammo on something. So the chnge is positive FOR THEM(In positive group there is also alot bloodied haters which are weird people) 
---
The negative group is mostly more casual players who are aware that they will now have to grind more things like ammo or stims. Builds will also get more minimaxed due to harder enemies.
---
In my experience in running the event, it's based on how often and how quickly you die. Your first time or two might be an instant respawn or only having a few seconds on the timer. Subsequent deaths, especially if they're happening frequently, will ramp up the respawn timer significantly. My last attempt, I had horrible luck at staying alive and ended up with a 40-second timer by the end of it. My buddy had a much better survival rate and his timer was less than half of mine.
---
AP refresh has a cap limit.
---
At least the heavy weapon weight reduction perk affects all conventional explosive guns, including the m79 launcher. I only need to carry around 3-4 auto grenade launchers to make it through ACP with at least one intact.
---
I already call them children.
---
So still not able to shield the camo SSA UA...
---
Did u read the info in some patch noted or just guessed?
---
Its is if you have the ammo I wish there were magic melees but shotguns are pretty good on ammo
---
the whole "degrading per hit" mechanic is for the trash bin.
---
I tried ACP 18 times: finished 16 times (one of this runs was me and just two other guys, level 200 and 300), once my game crashed and this time that I bailed.
---
I hate how RL cults always have to ruin and bastardize fun stuff like a sheep costume. Some people see a goat and it's just satan incarnate and nothing will ever change their mind. A group of crazy people sacrificing someone/thing else? IT'S THE DEVIL. I'm surprised you didn't call deathclaws nothing but an allusion to Reptilians.
---
Here's a tip for you, just because one piece of fiction uses those themes doesn't mean others aren't allowed to use the same imagery without supporting them. If there's anything human beings are it's not very creative, and themes get recycled and reused over and over again just with a different face.
---
This isn't exactly updated, but you can get many heads from these repeatables

---
Did you have to buy the plans off him? I thought they were part of the loot pool?
---
Still not able to shield it...
---
Lol this wasn‚Äôt the point of the post but I feel it üòÇ
---
That Gatling laser should shred Earle. Put in Stabilized, Bloody Mess, the heavy weapon damage perks if you can, Power User (makes ammo efficiency go through the roof) and Gunsmith if possible. I would also recommend making that gatling laser primed. 
---
A good gatling laser or Plasma can pretty much solo Earle as long as everyone else in the room is even slightly trying to damage him. And the upside is you don't have to be one of those people who make posts about how many thousands of 5.56 or .45 rounds it takes to kill him. Because your 1 fusion core has so much total damage it won't even put a dent in your reserves.
---
And if you need more fusion cores? Craft a low level gatling laser. Everytime you craft a gatling laser it gives you a free fusion core.
---
What a King
---
Still not able to...
---
Is that why my two shot 10mm smg is made of candle wax and toddium?
---
Adding the Salty mod to it bumps the weight to 34. :)
---
To me they are just dead weight cus it goes up to 100%, but with my perks i can repair it up to 200%. :/
---
and those robots will see me until I killed 1000 of them with bare hands and I have one copy of the forest camo jumpsuit.
---
You cannot nerf without base weapon adjustments or lose a large number of players. TSE nerf gutted my friends list. The last few kicking won't stick around
---
yeah but its strange that you can control yourself outside of power armor
---
I use psychobuff only, great shit and easy to craft
---
A burning flag weapon mod would be cool, can you show your hatred for certain factions.
---
N+1 is the correct answer
---
The Colossal Problem event has been a godsend for me. Screws are no longer my limiting factor for Radium crafts. Now it's adhesive...
---
Concentrated fire?
---
I just tried this. It doesn't make accuracy go into the negatives, it does that for range. Is that what you meant?
---
They did not specifically mention that particular issue lol. But it‚Äôs Bethesda and FO76 so I can safely and confidently say it will be addressed soon‚Ñ¢
---
I made it primed and am slowly working my way to all of those perks. 
---
I had no idea you got a FC from craftingna laser gatlin haha. The more you know!
---
As i always tell insecure trainees at work: "There are no stupid questions.. Only questions you might already know the answer to."
---
Doesn‚Äôt work with melee, only ranged.
---
can i add you just to play some events after your done with this?
---
I had radscorpions that dug underground and never came back.  The marker showed it was 8-10 feet underground.  But it never surfaced, so I gave up on the defend event and started doing other things.  And even when it became a Reclaim event, the one radscorpion was still underground.
---
"You feel your lovers embrace" 
---
Thats all yer getting.
---
I misread... I thought you were talking about shotguns. My bad
---
I would love the backpack. 76 players are great!
---
That's why i am a m√Ñd1C, trying to keep everyone alive. Please stop running into the molten debris, I can't revive ask piles. Thank you
---
so many hours wasted building a good vault
---
UNLIMITED POWER
---
I'd love a mechanic where a missile launcher or fat man could stagger the queen or earle, even if it's doing little damage. That could turn heavy explosive weapons into a kind of support weap.
---
Another 6 levels of perks I need to get hahaha
---
Oh, I have a lot of .308 cause my main weapon was a hunting rifle before.
---
I‚Äôve done it solo in a couple minutes with my gauss minigun, 5 - 10 minutes in group (depends on the number of participants) with my ultracite gat, but I did have experienced the fast travel bug, like respawning outside of the event instead of inside on the timer, and even on the other side of the map effectively cancelling my rewards from the event, all that just by dying after killing Earl
---
I know it's difficult but just imagine the blast you'd have from 64 player servers :D
---
computer desks in the whitesprings bunker military wing spawn them quite often.
---
This is unknown. One Wasteland is one thing, the nerfs are another. It might come with this update or not.
---
I want a child of atom atomic shop week
---
Traded a legendary for 1k gifts.its cool but sucks took up 100lbs and after opening 100 you have crazy weight due to those plans.i just drop them anywhere
---
Obviously
---
Have Super Duper and Science Master (I think it's Master) whicever one of the science perks says "Your crafted energy weapons require fewer materials" when you do craft those gatling lasers.
---
You burn through it though having too much fun
---
You are asking recently-turned-greedy Bethesda.. it would be too immersive and it would stop people from buying it on their own. So that's a big nope.
---
Agree with this as a stealth melee. Would make for a great perk card name. Kneecapper!!!
---
Or use nexus mods b/c apparently you don‚Äôt get banned for it
---
If that's the case, why would you care at this point? you'll go there when the vaults open and be done in like what, an hour?
---
That's true
---

gilman lumber mill. can get all 25 in one go
---
I'll give you 1 cap.
---
Sounds great! I was offered 134c for it so not too different.
---
Anyone have a magic gun for sale.i just found a magic armor price in someone's vender for 300 caps.
---
I agree.  Some of it isn't even veiled at all such as the 666 on the side of that blood eagle camp.  It doesn't bother me, but it is pretty obvious.
---
Bethesda asked you to break the game? Thats awesome, its like being given a license to kill. Abuse the glitches while you can bro lol.
---
Did Billings Homestead defense yesterday, searched for a while and game decide to tell me where it was, my last super mutant was at the very bottom of the river, why not, I guess
---
Ok, thx.. Good to know, normales i dont die in the Event bc my Vampire Plasma heals me... this time i got an a√ü Kick from earl
---
Tru dat
---
There worth much but I had three and traded a lot of them for weapons and ammo etc I wouldn‚Äôt sell really I would try to trade with them
---
Whats the other 2 effects on it?
---
A lot but it has died down a bit. Maybe in the range of 10k caps but i'm not sure
---
I have also had this problem with two characters so far . I thought it was just a one time issue but I just ran thru a second time and it did the same thing
---
What system you on?  I would think it would be worth more on consoles for at least the next few weeks.
---
And the reptilians would be the mirelurk king
---
I'll take it if you are offering it?
---
You can get some decent stuff from it. Especially if you sell it now
---
Xbox, so yeah
---
I mean, it doesn't net me anything "real"  only in the pts which doesn't transfer over to the "real" game.  If you bought the game through Bethesda.net on pc, you can join the public test server too.
---
I'm having the same problem on PC.
---
Very annoying.
---
Has yours fixed? I just logged back in and it still doesn‚Äôt want to work
---
At least you didn‚Äôt get paired with only one other person, who only brought a sledgehammer with them....and did little to no damage. 
---
I was able to take Earle down, but it took a lot ammo and Chems.
---
That didn't work for me sadly.
---
Signed in and out of the launcher.
---
Rebooted.
---
Even 30 is too much, it‚Äôs already a hassle to die and reload, why punish the unfortunate at all. Maybe 10 sec flat for each death, that‚Äôs it. This punishment also happens during Encryptid, totally unnecessary.
---
I had this happen to me yesterday while fighting Earle and I about had a conniption fit (I'm a vampire's build, so. Yeah.). It drives me crazy. I asked about it here because I play with 2 other really experienced players (one of whom has been playing since the game came out) and neither of them have ever heard of anyone having this issue before.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC I can craft the shocks. I don‚Äôt charge any extra beyond standard shocks costs (they use a lot of flux)
---
It was that way in fo4 too, idk why.
---
Okay, 2 caps.
---
True that and I'm well aware of the lore with the cultists and mothman and the raiders. I'm just saying that that is most likely disguised as game lore when it's actual satanic.
---
Damn! I'm gonna be rich! :D
---
Eat a few honeys
---
I had Sunshine Meadows, and ghouls were supposed to be attacking. Waited and waited. Then heard gun fire from a player camp just down the road, on the shore of the river just up from the hot dog place. Wandered over and saw the entire pack of ghouls attacking the player's fusion generator as the turrets and ally shot at them. Once I figured out what was going on I finished off the ghouls, but not before they destroyed the fusion generator. Felt kind of bad that the defense event on my workshop destroyed another player's generator, but that's how it goes I guess.
---
What confuses me is it's honestly not even that difficult to survive as a high level player. I'm a non-optimized melee/rifleman build that prefers to use fun weapons over doing Uber-damage (any knife with faster swing speed is a damn treat) and doesn't use power armor. It's very rare that I have genuine trouble surviving things and, when I do, it's usually from a disease I forgot to account for that tends to be particularly troublesome for the situation I'm in. 
---
My only consistent worry for this event is fear causing me to launch into that giant drill face first. It happened twice on my high respawn timer attempt. The Wendigo Spawns aren't all that tough and Earle is more of an insane bullet sponge than an offensive threat.
---
There's always been a confirm purchase selection on PS4, unless they removed it.
---
With my vamp minigun I was standing under the debris and not taking any damage.  Vampire's is great.
---
It's honestly depressing when using a shotgun on earl does more damage than a 2 shot fat man and the shotgun is the one that doesn't ever break.
---
I must be making my weapons out of paper.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
not anymore, literally the first place I check
---
Nah, xbox player here.
---
if you die a lot (like as a bloody build while ignoring the spawn) the timer's time increases with each death
---
Oh, now that would be a HANDY addition ...
---
I'd like it if you could choose your preference in settings. I'd personally prefer the character names as well.
---
Tell that to my V/FFR U.Gatling Laser...member
---
Gimme a gutsy with its AP rounds to protect the camp. They melt me when I see them, so I imagine melting low level mobs wouldn‚Äôt be an issue
---
Account‚Äôs been dormant for almost 2 years and this is your first post? Don‚Äôt blame us for being a little... suspicious.
---
Probably not gonna get atoms.   I'd be happy with 1 perk coin for every 100K score.
---
The Grafton Monster has always reminded me of Gossamer from Looney Tunes: https://youtu.be/J4fjA8W-6es
---
I kinda felt sorry for it. Would love a plushie of him.
---
Maybe til he's lv 18.
---
U?
---
That's a great idea that's been suggested countless times before and has virtually zero chance of ever happening but thank you.
---
I bought mine at a players vendor. He had two. One for 5000 and the other for 7500. I bought the cheaper one.
---
technically correct, it can reset after a few hours and you find a new technical data. but if you can't find any it will not trigger.
---
So what exactly is a "magic" weapon? Just a gun with a great legendary roll? 
---
Would it be something like...
---
I got a pump action that ignores all armor, +1 agility (I'm an agility build too aye) and one other trait. However, when I use it it does aight damage, but if I enter VATS I can one shot just about anything. 3 shots at the most if it is a very tough enemy, only in VATS though. I'm guessing its just a perk or system I'm unfamiliar with.
---
I wish I had your luck. I want one to finish my look but my 10 runs ar Earl so far have given me a bunch of cursed script and 1 or 2 plans.
---
  I dont know if I want the "sense of acconplishment" of getting it to drop myself or just buy or trade for one
---
U is for ~~you and me~~ Ultracite
---
100k score? Not even. That‚Äôd be awful... maybe 5k-10k? Sure
---
Gary!

On an unrelated note, 150000000 wood scrap, at .05 pounds per piece, is 3750 tons of wood.  This is roughly the weight of a modern navy frigate.  The wood we are gathering is likely eastern white pine, with an average density of around 26 pounds per cubic foot.  This means they expect 288461 cubic feet of wood, which is almost exactly what you would get if you stacked an entire football field, including the end zones,  five feet deep in wood.
---
The total industrial wood harvest in West Virginia (requiring 1500+ lumber mills) was over 110 million cubic feet in 1987.  288461 is one 381st of 110000000.  This means they want roughly 1 day of production at prewar levels...and they gave us a whole six days to do it ;)
---
They're nuts.
---
lol.. no way yo.. the free atom era is over and dunzo..
---
Yeah, that's too bad.  I mean, I also just now started played the game even though I preordered it because my old computer couldn't handle it, so I'm making up for lost time.
---
Hitman and 250dmg while reloading I believe.
---
3 caps for both.
---
A tip jar would be cool for the business's who have good service
---
Hunt and loose. Because by the time you track down the distracted bastards you've left the event area.
---
....
---
And when you‚Äôre level 5 and you make yourself some new armor bringing yourself up to a whopping 35 DR, it makes absolutely zero difference?
---
This is why you aren‚Äôt a game designer.
---
This is exactly why I do it.
---
Ah. N is for anytime any time at all, to genocide wendigos, you see!
---
The lowest of efforts.
---
Yeah he could set up at Berkley springs on weekends now that Murmph is left it.
---
Ah ha. I misunderstood that element. I've never tried it without power armor due to the radiation!
---
What I meant was that the power of bloodied, for example, is going down, while the power of Anti armor is unchanged, so comparatively the power of AA is increasing.
---
TIL learned, during a random encounter with Graham, that you can milk Chally :)

This happened to my brother with the Contemporary Camp Bundle on PS4. It definitely has a "confirm" button but I think it'll sometimes register the X input double. Normally if I view something I lightly tap X and immediately hover my thumb or put it somewhere else just in case lol
---
Most times people were able to get their atoms back after submitting a ticket though. So hopefully they open their site soon! Good luck!!
---
What does miss Esda have to do with this?
---
Does all Secret Service count?
---
But like.... Closing the gap isn't bad...... Its what everyone wanted (even bloodies before they knew bout it).
---
Gotta be fair to all
---
But it is an accomplishment not to get crushed by ricks right? I mean I clearly am inferior in most ways but I kinda need that win in my life.
---
Danger vs Caution
---
I'm going with your strategy.
---
Why do I have to keep trading shit, just give me the god damn boo-yawn.
---
To power that lovely hovering square building of course! The single light bulb and 8 vendors with 600 cap plans, won't power themselves!
---
I only revive if i see that they are actually doing something like clearing adds
---
No, it will depend on cases, magic shotguns are a bit tricky, you need to have a piece of armor with the blocking prefix, that will boost shotguns damage greatly in VATS. In OPs case, heavy guns (iirc) with vats hit chance, limb damage or bashing damage, combined with 200 firerate makes them magic, meaning you can melt anything.
---
damn, I feel like I'm scamming you with the return rates!
---
This is not correct. With or without power armor, Fear makes you lose control if you are too close to Earle.
---
In addition "closing the gap"=/=changing hierarchy of damage. Smh man. Btw i have a GREAT pvp AA railway rifle. Not all things suck
---
Well you're gonna like the next update then
---
It's what I want too.  What I meant with my previous comment was what I just said, they are, in effect, nerfing bloodied, etc, and bluffing AA.  Which is a good thing.
---
Turn the throne north of the ammo factory into his home
---
Graham's tato salad is rotten too. Watch out for that. Eat 2 and you get straight food poison.
---
Same role as Collectron, OR make him more like a Mr Farmhand (tend to plants, brahmin, whatev). Could be interesting.
---
level 30
---
Xbox as well.
---
I understand that, I'm just saying they're taking steps to make the game better.  I play on the PTS and it's fine, if the PTS became the standard game, I'd be completely okay with that.
---
The problem with priming the Gatling gun is it‚Äôs sort of a side-grade. Speedy receiver is a 25% DPS increase; prime is worse vs most enemies but slightly better vs the queen. A primed bloody 50cal is ideal vs the queen.
---
No you get mr farmer version with the saw and slow laser
---
Are you playing with 10fps? ü§î
---
Interesting. I wonder if bethesda is quietly killing off the spawn points. I've been hoarding them since wastelanders came out, since I had heard the brotherhood would be returning in the winter, and figured they would be used for something. I've got nearly 300 now I think.
---
&gt; I get WHY its 8 person on the technical side.
---
I don't.
---
SBQ fights allow the entire server to participate, and although it gets a bit laggy at times it still works. Also, if the nuke spawns a regular Colossus in the sundew grove, the whole server can fight that too if they want.
---
Is it because Earle's fight takes place indoors? Well, Radiation Rumble takes place indoors too, has no player limits, and also spawns a million enemies just like Earle does.
---
So unless I'm missing something, I'm not seeing the difference here.
---
I hope my tameable pets get Scaled in one wasteland, as my lvl 21 deathclaw isn't going to survive in the ash heap anymore if the enemies scale up to lvl 50.
---
Edited first comment cause youre a cool cat, turns out! :)
---
EDIT sorry I'm a dumbass. I've meant XP the whole time. LOL
---
Yeah 5-10K score would be about right.
---
Smart thinkin!
---
I have a prime 50 cal gun. ( I don‚Äôt remember the exact numbers) but when I shoot her in the face let‚Äôs say each bullet does 20 damage. Just an example. 
---
But my Gatling gun that‚Äôs not prime does 25-30. That‚Äôs why I was confused.
---
When you looked at the map... was it actually on you? The audio always say leave the area even if you aren‚Äôt in the area.
---
You can‚Äôt nuke the area around the vault though?
---
Yeah, I should have been more specific.  I'm glad they're doing this.
---
24 corn, last offer
---
Which daily quest is it? I don't even know what to do with these ü•¥ there's no quest pop up when I do find one so idk
---
You can‚Äôt nuke that part?
---
Lol that part of the map cant be nuked
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs still not possible to nuke the forest...
---
U dont need the armor if u have a magic gun
---
You know, when you said do an Ellie build I thought of:
---
 [https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Ellie](https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Ellie) 
---
So I might be a little out of touch.
---
It's delicious!
---
Me too! My archer build is gaining my unconscious focus :D
---
Vault 112 was the virtual reality one. Yeah that one is crazy.
---
haha, I wish. no, you can't nuke the forest (starting) area.
---
you get a warning that a nuke has been launched no matter where you are on the map.
---
10k xp maybe, not 10k score
---
I‚Äôve only been able to use recent players and public
---
Teams to join my friends and it‚Äôs getting really annoying
---
Oh that is good news
---
Verdammin schisse
---
Vault 76 is a safe zone you probably just got the death from above mission because someone was nuking the mine or queen
---
I second this.
---
Hello chandler bing
---
Fun counts.  "Perfection" in this case is overrated.  I'm bored enough as it is without having restricted myself to min-max and certain weapons.
---
It is impossible to nuke the vault. The alert goes out server-wide, next time check the map for the actual location.
---
A full secret service set would work.
---
Having the same issue
---
Omg. Yes.
---
10k exp is easy. You are talking about score AKA the leveling stuff for the legendary run aka a battle pass.
---
Take my money üí∞
---
Cant play without inventory mode after i tried it, fuck scrolling 100 items without proper sorting, dunno why this not a basic thing
---
I like using a vampire's weapon at 20% health because you don't lose too much damage to a bloodied, but have way higher survivability, and now they're only going to be more viable.
---
that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong pal.
---
You get the alert no matter where you are. Unclench.
---
Im selling mine cheap because eveyone is going that route. Im just here for the lols
---
It took me a bit to get used to...there's hope.
---
I do the same thing. Although they will be a bit more than level 1 after the next patch, so bare fists might not get the same mileage.
---
Kudos to their music department because they make some seriously catchy tunes. 
---
Fasnacht, Slocome Joe‚Äôs vending machine, the atom shop...
---
Yeah I wasn't too familiar with them either
---
Guess you just heard the nuke announcement.
---
The TOXIC PLAYERBASE is busy nuking monongah mine rn
---
Cosmetics are account wide.    
---
Things like Atoms, Caps, Lunchboxes, and Perk Card packs are for the character you take the reward on. IMO, those are best on your highest if under 50. With the implementation of trading in unwanted perk cards for Perk coins and Legendary Perks you're going to want them asap.
---
So, my read of this is that you just a need a level 10 character on your team with a level 10 legendary weapon that is somewhat OP for his/her level.  
---
You get enough shots in to count and then have the low level kill everything (since it would be easier) and then you, and the rest of the high levels on your team, scoop up the high level loot.  Then you switch off so that everyone has a run at the low level role.
---
I'm willing to bet that this becomes the new boss kill strategy, especially if/when magic weapons get fixed/nerfed.
---
 The starting area cannot be nuked. The notification is to inform you that a nuke is being dropped SOMEWHERE on the map.
---
I started as a rifleman for 100 levels and started running commando for another 150ish. Ill try to answer your questions as detailed as i can so bare with me on the length of my answer. 
---
It does fairly well in group content. Sbq and earl still have plenty of options for sneak damage just stay back and half the time youll barely get seen. Having a piece of armor with the effect that lets you turn invisible while not moving helps. 
---
Lower carry weight is not really an issue. Craft a max level backpack with the chem weight reducing mod. i believe i comfortable sit at around 240 with one point in strength.Could always add carry weight mods for armor if its a big deal.  i carry 4 weapons as well and a bunch of ammo. 
---
Hazmat suit isn‚Äôt  really necessary unless you don‚Äôt have the Chinese stealth armor. if you have it. radation isn‚Äôt a big deal anymore. Just put on the chinese stealth armor for high radation zones. Decent armor protection and you stay invisible while crouched. 
---
Weapons will depend on your build. Anti armor or furious if your planning to run a non bloodied/ junkie build. 
---
Most commandos run fixers, handmades, combat rifles. I personally run fixers and handmades. As well as the slug buster. Turned into a full auto it is pretty decent. 
---
The main thing for stealth commando is try to find weapons with 25% less vats ap and/or 25% faster fire rate. 
---
I couldn‚Äôt offer any advice for low health builds. Not really my thing but if you find yourself not enjoying it. Try a junkies build. High health and pretty great damage. My junkies handmade is at an (estimated) 140 a shot before any buffs for stealth or anything. 
---
My build without any bonuses is 1 strength, 15 perception, 1 endurance, 5 intelligence, 14 agility and the rest of the points in luck. It might not be what others would call top tier but i do fairly well and kill things fast.
---
This.  Vault 76 cannot be nuked.
---
It's safe to jump back in and play again, once your pants dry of course.
---
Yeah I've just been trying it again and confirm definitely appears, it just didn't earlier, I must have double clicked really quick! I will try submit a ticket when the sites working again, thanks for your comment :)
---
How about those games tags like 1663927#hwjmahdiwo669010654
---
What's up with that?
---
You are going to love the clown outfit.
---
Not me - i kill him on sight. Stopped being funny a long time ago
---
Not Satanic; Mothmanic!
---
calm ya titties
---
You had a fundamental misunderstanding about how it works, which is okay.. it's more than a little confusing, especially with how it's worded.  
---
You get a warning anytime a nuke is launched anywhere on your map, just open the map and look for the giant red circle that indicated the landing site.
---
haha you're right, I shouldn't assume.
---
This man knows how to MMO.
---
I see;  
---
If that happens and despite what they will say, they can rollback your toon to a previous non hacked state.  
---
You might want to keep sending tickets over tickets untill they accept to do so though.
---
This guy lol.
---
I have a dedicated gunslinger. Levelled her using aa and quad, but for endgame I had to take her bloodied. I CAN solo anything, but for the big guys I have to use my bloody plasma flamethrower, and that eats ammo so much it's not really viable for all the time. In a team I pull plenty of my own weight, but imho it is the weakest weapon class by far.
---
Ok thanks! I‚Äôm like angry but glad I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing this right now.
---
The area around the vault and Flatwoods cannot be nuked. The notification you heard just goes to everyone in the sever regardless where they are. If you look on the map it wil show you the actual location the nuke will be in.
---
Mid september (if they dont delay) if I remeber correctly
---
Thank you for nicely telling me, a new player, this information. I was under the idea that you heard it only if it was in your area. It seems kind of counter-intuitive for the broadcast to go off everywhere, how do you know if you're actually in the zone of the nuke?
---
lol this is hilarious. With such an over reaction and making such assumptions I don't think the game would be missing out on much if you do uninstall.
---
You definitely need to uninstall this game right now, because you are not equipped to deal with it. Not trolling or being mean, just trying to save you what will no doubt be a lot of stress and aggravation.
---
I am down for that!  I haven't done that yet and it sounds like it might be kinda fun to have an event where you have to hit a target on the ground or something.  Hell would just be fun to do.
---
Might actually log in and do that now. lol.
---
Had this happen while waiting at the start of the colossus event. More annoying that nobody tried to revive.
---
You could literally say that about any piece of content in this game. Why even play this game if you are that cynical?
---
Iron fist works with unarmed weapons which include knuckles deathclaw gauntlet and powerfist. Gladiator wont work with those weapons as they are considered punching weapons. I run a melee build using a bloodied powerfist. I also love martial arts for the faster swing which makes a huge difference.
---
Gimme one of those "GOOD DAY TO YOU" jumpscares any time.
---
does this mean 8 level 10s-30s can do the event no problem when one wasteland drops? when it does drop people will be testing everything for sure.
---
It's losing value every day. Right now, people are impatient and want it immediately. In a month when everyone has multiple, because the event is ongoing not limited, they will be basically worthless.
---
I saw Beckett at another camp. He two timing you Bro.
---
This is incorrect. My male character receives lover's embrace from Beckett. You get kindred spirit from unnamed allies because you can't romance them.
---
Also why you‚Äôd feel like you do less damage with HW compared to unarmed is pretty simple- it‚Äôs the combo of queen DR (resistance) and damage reduction, plus melee armor penetration. She‚Äôs got around 70% reduction and then 300 DRI believe. 
---
So let‚Äôs say your bloodied unarmed melee sneak attacks normally hit for about 6k (2k pip-boy times 3x sneak attack). Queen‚Äôs Reduction drops that by 70%, to 1800. Then her armor kicks in, but you‚Äôve got Incisor, so her 300 armor turns in to 75 armor. 1800 damage vs 75 armor basically means she has no armor.
---
Now let‚Äôs look and a bloodied 50cal. Well optimized build, running about 350 damage in the pip-boy (with Prime boosting that to about 450 vs the queen). 450 minus her Reduction puts us at 135. We‚Äôve got Stabilized with our power armor on, so her 300 armor becomes 165. 135 damage vs 165 armor equates to about 55 actual damage. 
---
See how that math works out? Those massive, massive sneak attacks basically allow you to ignore her armor (but not her reduction!) while the fast, small hits from a heavy weapon get penalized hard after reduction and then armor.
---
True; thanks for the heads-up.
---
Check the map, if there‚Äôs a big red circle on you then it‚Äôs time to run. But there‚Äôs a huge safe zone by vault 76 and I believe goes down by flat woods aswell.
---
Sorry I just sold it, if I get another I'll hit you up though!
---
They have so much free time, are 'rich'in game and want to FLEX. üòÜ
---
How about both. Put one in parentheses below the other.
---
Well as long as it's a setting of course, not the ONLY function.
---
But yeah, I've only ever found one Nuka Cola Wild before, I wonder how many other types are out there besides Cherry, grape, quantum, and MY BLOOD'S IN IT!
---
They broadcast to the entire map so you can become aware for safety and for the eventual event that could happen. Gives you time to get ammo fix armor weapons etc. And welcome to Appalachia!
---
That's not how stealth works. If the mob is fighting something (another player, other mobs), you can't get sneak attacks on it (even if you're not in Danger status yourself).
---
I mean that's what the base component of soda is, it's a syrup.
---
Lmao. You didn't exit the vault, saw a notification for an event happening *somewhere* in the map, quit the game and posted this. 
---
It's okay. No one is out to get you. Notifications pop up now and then for events. You can log back into the game now :)
---
Well the Gatling gun fires WAY slower. Heavy weapons have the broadest range of options of any weapon type. Gatling gun is fantastic ammo efficiency, but lower DPS (it‚Äôs baseline about 2 rounds per second vs 9 rounds for a 50cal)
---
Log out then back in should fix it. I also load a different game then reload 76 and that fixes my friends list.
---
Try Nukes &amp; Dragons. Lots of room to finetune a build.
---
None of the unarmed weapons double dip anymore. They patched that a few months ago.
---
I think the only ones that do anymore are pipe guns.
---
I would just like to say the GTA community is a hell of a lot brattier, seeing as half of them are spoilt brats with their mum‚Äôs or dad‚Äôs bank details.
---
This bug sort of just pops up every once and awhile. I don't think there are any surefire fixes.
---
ofc! Feel free :)
---
Grahm's plans are rare because Grahm is rare.  He wouldn't be rare if he had a stool in some fancy train station every day.  
---
 I've watched Grahm tenderize a Legendary SB and a Colossus.    This man is a loner, a rebel.  Leave him be.
---
My GT is R4VENexe, shoot me a friend request and I'll add you when I'm home
---
Nope, then finding him randomly on the map and getting the rare plans wouldn't be a special occurrence. Not everything needs to be spoon fed to players. Meat Week is enough.
---
Why not both?
---
It's the bow. Crossbows don't suffer from it.
---
Nope, you can do it any time you collect a data. I normally leave my tent outside venture and hop back and forth to the bunker 3 or 4 times in a row.
---
Each ammo factory takes 20, so if you wanna run 10 factories, you need 2 reactors
---
Today I learned something
---
That's illegal.  Considering its abusing and exploit
---
Right? Lol
---
I know that feel. I have Revenant equipped, but I never get any use out of it because nobody ever revives me when I'm downed. I should probably swap it out for something else.
---
I really hate it
---
Hasn‚Äôt been my experience. And your numbers pretty much line up with the difference between sneak and non sneak attacks (60 nonsneak is 210 with 3.5x sneak)
---
Any new robot allies would be cool. Personally I'd love to have a Whitespring assaultron. Having one say "Sir" randomly when I get back home would be nice.
---
I‚Äôd argue they get more mileage as it‚Äôll take more than one hit. And those smug robots have it coming. They‚Äôve had it too good for too long
---
It is the APOCALYPSE.    
---
From the start it's been known that it would be easy to fix. If they keep messing with you  jump servers.
---
Slightly. Two shot degrades weapons down as it fires two bullets without costing two from your inventory. Explosive Legendary effect, Quad and I assume Double also degrade faster.
---
The above comment refers to Explosive launchers as they have less than 20 shots per repair, depending on how many targets get hit.
---
You ok
---
Equip born survivor 1 and you can mostly forget about dying if you have enough stimpaks and don't get unlucky within the 20 second downtime. Although I use first aid 3, field surgeon 2, and share team medic 1 with the rest of the team as well. Generally, I will come out with more stimpaks than I go in with after wendigo looting.
---
Wish people would realize this and stop reposting this idea over and over... I'd just be happy with other mundane rewards from the run after passing 100. A token amount of caps, a little scrip maybe a repair kit or two.
---
Mine is set to scrap and it is glorious. Every hour or so it's full of goodies.
---
Why act creepy? Drug dealers are fine upstanding citizens in Appalachia
---
Thats cool. Like I said, I kind of want to earn it myself, but I also want it for my outfit.  If I see it in a vendor I will almost certainly impulse buy it.  I hope you got something good for it!  Right now is the right time to sell.
---
I wish these were a real enemy crazed feral radiated cats would be a freaky think to have to fight a hoard of.... same with horses
---
It‚Äôs not a daily. But have you done Bos quests already?
---
Like it is in ESO? I've been wondering that as well for nearly 2 years. Surprised Bethesda Austin hasn't done that, along with Player 'Factions' (Guilds).
---
Oh no!
---
No not yet
---
Oh OP said it's part of a daily quest hah anyway yeah I did the BoS quests
---
That‚Äôs ok
---
Am I the only one who wants multiple collectron stations at once?
---
That way Free States Collectron and Communist Collectron can go at each other like Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots while Ace and Insultron are having a rap battle.
---
Yes really true but by act creepy I mean be a creepy one not like hey dude I need some caps mind if you buy some of my water or chems and more like hello there kids want some sweet tasty drugs
---
Best NPC in the game
---
There is no cool down
---
No, it was a while ago, they were somewhere on the north end of the Forest if I remember.
---
I don't. For that reason :)
---
Dont get why people wanna farm for that 1-2 meta weapon or do an event over and over again. They're not exciting at all.
---
I was going to save them for a fresh toon, but the rep and gold grinding has made me stop using my other characters.
---
You are just starting, so, I would collect everything with my main and AVOID creating new characters. Just mules.
---
This. My build is similar except I run low health with a full set of unyielding gear. Adrenal reaction and nerd rage provide nice damage boosts to go with any weapon, but its even better with bloodied weapons. With my health low enough and strange in numbers to boost my mutations, I am hitting very close to 400 carry weight with just 1 point in strength. Add to that the chemists mod for my backpack and I can carry hundreds of stimpacks and radaways and still have room to lug around multiple weapons.
---
I have killed Earl with just another player. We were both Bloodied commandos, no magic weapons and we finished with time to spare. It really is all about your build and gear.
---
If you pick up a new technical data you can turn it in at camp venture for rewards.
---
Don't worry. Look at it like this. He was just bringing you steel scrap üòà
---
I dont have any purifiers becsause there is no water near my mountain base, but i needed a 2nd generator beause the 100 power simply where not enough for all my gimmicks, defense and stuff to power up.
---
If you go to one of the frat houses there are usually a bunch of different ones on a shelf. There's orange, wild, dark, grape, cherry, quantum, and now cranberry. And of course original. There may be another that I'm forgetting...
---
True. What I've discovered is that Cola and Cherry all have similar spawn rates, Quatum's spawn rate is about half of that, and the others are so incredibly rare you should even try getting them.
---
Are treasury notes worth anything? I got one from a bunker and I have no idea what to do with it.
---
My God, It's mootiful!
---
This would never be the case. Nothing in ACP will ever be at your level. It will still be difficult for a level 10, they just won‚Äôt be useless. Even if that were to change you‚Äôre still doing level 10 damage (so very few damage perks, no anti-armor perks, shite weapon mods, shite weapon durability, etc) as opposed to a level 100 with all of that stuff plus prob some good weapons. 
---
You‚Äôre never gonna get a level 10 soloing ACP, it‚Äôs just the difficulty of it will scale to be as difficult for them as it is for you *if* you didn‚Äôt use all the good stuff you get by level 100
---
I‚Äôll keep saying it. Beth doesn‚Äôt want them viable because the explosions increase server load. And I don‚Äôt want them viable if they‚Äôre going to make me lag during group events.
---
Moooove here comes the Brahmin Cowlossus
---
Secret cow level triggered by a quest for a npc named Wirt? Yes please!
---
"Death From Above: Check the map to see where it will land ...and if you should run!"
---
That's literally what the popup says. Pay more attention next time.
---
Your reasoning for your suggestion is that people can endlessly attack you...but you‚Äôve never had anyone take a workshop from you. So what‚Äôs the problem?
---
Thing is, if they add horses, people would (rightfully) demand that they be mounts, and you know they won't ever do that.
---
Suprised?
---
Wait is that a thing? I've never seen that in 10+ times
---
Does it give birth to regular ghouls? That would make everyone avoid the ground entirely. Some 28 days later looking scenes
---
I'd think if it somewhat scaled to their level they still wouldn't have the loadout and ammo to kill Earle in a group of low levels.
---
I've seen level 100+ struggle with damage if not stealth or bloody. They'd get it done at a significant ammo cost in which a low level wouldn't have even at their scaled Earle.
---
It's right there in the article. "Let‚Äôs imagine you are playing as a level 300 character, and you decide to head to West Tek with a friend who is level 30. Even though you will both see the exact same Super Mutants at that location, their levels will automatically appear higher to you and lower to your friend so that they are more appropriate to your individual characters. In addition to their levels, the Super Mutants‚Äô damage, health, and resistances, as well as the loot they drop and the XP they award, will also better match each player. This means that your level 30 friend can now meaningfully contribute to the fight in this formerly high-level location, which was not possible before. You will also earn more XP per kill than before, since these Super Mutants previously could not spawn at such high levels. While creatures will still have minimum and maximum levels, One Wasteland will bring much more flexibility to players‚Äô combat encounters going forward."
---
No rads down there. You can wear a full set of whatever. You need to equip a hazmat, PA or Stealth suit to leave the event, since it kicks you outside the mine, ground zero.
---
Unarmed benefits from both Twisted Muscles and Talons mutations, whereas regular melee weapons only get the boost from Twisted Muscles.
---
Be aware though, the next patch changes the way damage buffs stack, and unarmed has been especially gutted.
---
If you cannot get a hold of Yabvone, I can do this for you in ~15 minutes or so.
---
Are you breaking down all junk items, selling scrip weapons un-modding weapons to conserve weight and putting ultra light mods on armor to lessen weight
---
Crap I got 2 back to back when the even came out and sold my extra for 500 caps.
---
Yes and when range is negative, you have 95% VATS accuracy even if you are far from the target
---
That depends on whether or not the damage changes are even actually part of the upcoming update or just something they're continuing to work on.  One Wasteland itself is just the change to dynamic enemy scaling and as far as I have seen in any articles like this there's been no mention of the damage changes outside of the PTS.  We could be screwed and they'll drop the changes to the damage formula with  the next update, but for all we know similarly to legendary perks they could continue working on it based on player feedback.
---
Make sure to bulk all your junk and to get rid of anything you don‚Äôt need
---
Only store things your gonna use. Bulk all your junk before storing.
---
So One Wasteland is a nerf to cheese power levelling where you go around tagged the high level enemies that your high levelled friend spawn.
---
I don't mind that one bit.
---
Make alternative characters and store stuff there
---
when i was a lad it was only 400
---
How do I break down junk items? I normally go out pick up junk (fans, oil canisters etc) and then just go back to my camp and go to my stash and hit store all junk. Is there something else I need to be doing with it?
---
Nah. Too high. Everyone I know has at least 4 or 5 mutations.
---
I won't be on that early sadly, still at work atm. I'll hit you up if I can't get ahold of Yabvone though
---
So basically just need someone to build a camp at the bottom, and something to make it look like a target.
---
Sign up top that says free base jumping lessons, PA optional.
---
MeatGrahm the Cowlossus.
---
Nope couldn‚Äôt find him down there. Here‚Äôs an invoice for 9 million rounds of .50 cal btw.
---
Oh that would be cool! I like the idea of postcards.
---
Alright so im not the only one who thinks he looks like a nutsack in between the 2 giant legs
---
only store what you need.
---
Poor ol' man Earl is dead
---
This title made me laugh more than it should have
---
hahaha its creepy creepy fun
---
Honestly I find a lot of the damage perks are unnecessary for bloody unarmed, unless you‚Äôre taking on the queen or Earle. I run martial artist and radicool always, and sometimes rotate in incisor, iron fist, and ninja, but they won‚Äôt make a difference fighting small fry. Serendipity, dodgy (bc you won‚Äôt need much ap for attacking), and lone wanderer help keep you alive. Also try for SS armor to get some rad resist against ghouls, but that‚Äôs much less important than just having unyielding armor in general.
---
Hecks yeah! That's why I set up so close to the vault. I like helping new players.
---
What do you mean by bulk all my junk? Sorry noob here. I usually go out get fans and cement bags etc etc and then when I‚Äôm back at my stash I just press the button that says store all junk. Is that not what I should be doing?
---
Would you mind explaining what Daily Ops are? I‚Äôve been hearing about them but still aren‚Äôt sure what they are and what they award.
---
No? Where is this giant ghoul in 4?? I don‚Äôt remember it
---
Will you enjoy the game with less players and once it eventually shuts down? Not to be mean, but really, to 'food builds' and solo players things really are about to get a hell of a lot more grindy, and it's not as if we have the biggest playerbase to start with. I've only rarely met genuinely 'multiplayer' teams. Even on Public Teams people are usually off doing their own thing in a Building rather than actually working together.
---
I might be just being alarmist and it may be a massive success, but all I really see are a few bonuses (max level legendary drops for one), and a massive in overall time spent doing basic things. It's amazing how much a few extra bullets per enemy wears on the guns and armor. In fact I hope I am, because I thought Wastelanders had saved the game, and I would hate to see a slow death from people just getting frustrated to the point they don't find the game fun enough to bother with anymore.
---
Ok. No worries. I am in game all the time these days...
---
Meanwhile tesla rifles are still more than viable and break entire areas of the game still.
---
Yep, it‚Äôs always been a little odd. I mean, really, in a game full of (essentially) zombies, you know you need to hit them in the head!!
---
What do you mean by bulk?
---
I've  been searching for 4 days now and noone sell the explosive  flamer
---
You want to go to a workbench and scrap all your junk and then go to a tinkers workbench and go to the bulk tab and then bulk it
---
And that is my point, this shit makes leveling up harder.
---
You don't get more XP for killing higher lvl mobs.
---
MR/MISS [INSERT NAME]
---
Oh I forgot about this post but yes you are probably right. I just assumed there was only 1 motherlode but when checking again the travel motherlode was indeed still there
---
I use the shining meat piles. Is there anything better?
---
What exactly are the magic weapons? I hear them mentioned a lot and know they melt enemies but not sure what the stats are.
---
The one wasteland weapon nerfs will effect low levels much less though since they don't have as many stacks of bonus damage available yet. Likely only have one weapon perk at best and missing nerd rage, bloody mess, etc until higher levels. So a level 5 with a bloodied weapon might be the strongest you will ever be in the game, although absolutely no damage reducing perks so a true glass cannon.
---
Back in our day, the stash was a mere 400lbs limit.
---
Yeah its still glitchy. When you walk up to it just right the door bounces between clean/open and gross/sealed
---
Take them, open them from your aid menu, you'll get a lot of stuff out of it
---
I don't know it's just an idea
---
I like how people are rating you down because you are telling them the truth of the situation.
---
Damn, haven't heard that song in a very long time. Would be awesome to hear in Fallout 76.
---
Yea before you put all those items in your stash box go to a workbench and you‚Äôll see a option to scrap item. Do that then you‚Äôll see a prompt in the middle on the bottom of your screen that says scrap all junk do that. It breaks all of it down to its smallest weight
---
They were craft able christmas gifts that contain caps, plans, chems, etc.
---
The VAST majority of them were duped via a glitch.
---
duped rewards from a holiday event.
---
Well it's xbox so, sometimes yeah
---
Its not marked on the map and you dont get a waypoint when you visit. I found it last night too its just a dillapidated unmarked random ruined vault
---
Pull it all out again, take it to a workbench (any type will do) and hit your reload button while looking at the workbench. At the bottom you should see the option to "scrap all junk items" or something. This will break it all down into its raw components, which weigh significantly less than the original junk items.
---
Get into the habit of doing this before storing your junk, after every junk run.
---
It gives you caps, junk, aid and some plans. There‚Äôs millions floating around the market because of a dupe, some people say you‚Äôll get banned from using them but I highly doubt it. I probably wouldn‚Äôt use all 700 but at least pop a few open
---
They are a heavily duped item.  Use with caution.  If bethesda ever gets serious about duping (not very likely) it may cause you some issues.
---
That sucks
---
Vault 51 maybe?
---
Oh wow okay I didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks so much!
---
If you are talking about the lunchboxes and gold... doesn‚Äôt really matter. Whichever one you will play more I guess. 
---
All the cosmetic stuff count for everyone.
---
?! Go to a workbench and scrap all junk. Then store it. 
---
At one point, the stash limit was 400.
---
If they are duplicates, should I get rid of them?
---
Thank you I had no idea!
---
Thank you this helps a bunch!
---
Fuck yes
---
difficulty-very hard
---
type-boss
---
"i'm level 20 and have shit gear, is this for me? sure!" :/
---
Will I be punished for having them, if mine are duplicates?
---
Yikes
---
I dont know how to do tag but spoiler. You can get the rare ones from the the one room in the frat house consistently and there is bubbles in whitespring. I just farmed them once for collection.
---
yes time for us to finally give the Brotherhood our wood.
---
Gonna keep this on my clipboard.  This is a great explanation of what it means.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKo\_8XKVqGQ&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKo_8XKVqGQ&amp;t=3s)
---
I do want this
---
Right. Hadn't considered no rad down there and didn't check. Always worried about it being a nuke zone per se. Thought that is good to know. 
---
As far as the original issue....huh.
---
Worry not. As I (and many others) said in the first part of fortifying Atlas, we will get all rewards as Bethesda can't afford to show we don't care about the event.
---
my legendary mirv fat man dies after like 4 shots. it weights like 1WT thanks to my perks but still, the times i get to use it are so friggen rare. need space to launch, enemies to be distracted from me. 
---
but it has saved me once or twice.
---
I'm in!
---
Scrap the weapons you won't/don't use.
---
Turn in the legendaries you won't/don't use for scrip.
---
Scrap your junk at a tinker's workbench BEFORE you put it in your stash box.
---
Sell surplus meds, food, etc. to vendors at train stations
---
Get the ammo converter and get rid of ammo you don't/won't use (especially missiles and mini nukes as they take up tons of space)
---
You can't keep/hoard weapons and armor like the before times in the long long ago. You gotta scrap it all.
---
It's an exploit, it's bannable because it's a violation of ToS. We don't know how long, but don't do it if you don't know. It isn't worth the risk of being able to use your Bloodied Explosive Handmade 10 seconds longer.
---
Mechanic jumpsuit, bog wanderer headgear, machete in hand, slowly walk towards players and never stop.
---
I had a guy at my camp baiting me too attack him back so he can destroy my camp so that's when I baited him into one of my rooms with a lock on it and shut him in after about 5 minutes he finally left and never came back lol
---
Don‚Äôt store all those extra armor and weapons. 
---
You don‚Äôt need all those missiles and mini nukes. 
---
Why do you have so many chems in your stash?
---
Put those power armor pieces onto a chassis ASAP!
---
Why do you have 500 asbestos? What are you going to do with that?
---
Only keep 100 max scrap of most things. 
---
Don‚Äôt store raw junk.  Scrap pretty much everything.
---
At the tinkers workbench you have an option to change your junk into bulk. So instead of 30 pieces of steel, you‚Äôll change it to 1 bulk steel. It‚Äôs a different quantity for each type of junk. Regardless bulk will weigh less than individual pieces. For example: waste oil weighs .1 pound each. So 10 would weigh 1 pound. Change 10 pieces to 1 bulk and that 1 bulk will weigh .8 pounds. 
---
It‚Äôs not a huge drop in weight however it adds up when you have a lot of junk.
---
On the note of junk make sure all your junk is scrap form which you can do at any crafting bench.
---
Wait... you aren‚Äôt scrapping your junk???!?
---
Why is this downvoted? He's a noob! He needs help!
---
At a Tinker's Workbench, as long as you have plastic, you can bulk scrap your junk which makes it weigh less as a whole.
---
Wow. Thanks a lot for putting it as simple as possible. That was easy to follow and understand.  
---
(&gt;O_O)&gt; üç™
---
Also, with your stash inventory open, click the "Mods" tab at the top to make sure there are no mods stored in there. If there are, pull them out and toss them.
---
Depositing all junk automatically deposits all mods that you're carrying too (bizarrely), and mods are heavy and basically useless once you learn the crafting plans to craft them yourself.
---
Poison/rad/ER/DR all show only if you have them. If you get a legendary poison resist armor piece, it shows up next to DR/ER. Disease IDK, it‚Äôs % based so it‚Äôs different. Fire I assume will show up like Poison etc once the card exists; current fire resistances are all % effects like disease.
---
This helps a ton thanks so much for the tips!!!
---
Nah this company has time and time again proved they are not serious about running a online game(still love game btw.) and they seem to never pull the trigger after huge duping incidents.  I would open some its shouldnt be an issue.  Just wanted you to know there is a .000001 percent risk.
---
If youre reaally enjoying the game.. fallout 1st gives you an unlimited junk storage container
---
Yeah, that's never happening. They'd say bye bye to all that Fallout Shelter online money &amp; Bethesda is too greedy to stand on principle
---
Might have to journey to the center of the Earth to find out.
---
I sincerely hope so.  The new damage calculations could use some fine tuning for certain weapon types.  I hope they spend a good bit of time making sure everything is balanced.
---
Okay, then. I suppose I can open just a couple.
---
Thanks so much and it‚Äôs alright there are always a few people that feel anyone posting on here isn‚Äôt allowed to be a noob and needs to be a Sherpa or something. It was the same in my Destiny 2 days.
---
Nice! Lol
---
Omg yes!! An insult bot would be awesome!!! I have wanted one since I first saw one
---
I think the challenges should still reward something after. Maybe give the option to trade score for scrip, caps etc but there is no way they're going to give atoms.
---
Wow thanks a lot this explains why I was full so fast and will help a lot!
---
lol nope
---
My experience comes from the PTS, so it‚Äôs subject to change.
---
Step 1. Go grab all your junk back out of your Stash box.
---
Step 2. Go to a crafting station. Any of them besides a food one will work. Select Scrap All Junk. That will significantly reduce the weight of all that junk and you can now put it back into your stash box.
---
Step 3. Go to a Tinker Workbench. The one you typically use to make ammo. There is a Bulk option. This will further reduce the total weight of these scrap items. And you'll still be able to use them for crafting purposes.
---
Im guessing after step 2 your problem will be fixed for a bit, but when you get a lot of stuff, bulking is a nice option and also allows you to sell excess scrap to vendors.
---
No I sure wasn‚Äôt! Sorry new to fallout just came from years of Destiny so major noob alert lol
---
Sadly
---
When the capitalists monetize communism.
---
I am only defending other people‚Äôs workshops, you can still get killed during defends if someone contests it during the event.
---
I was getting this bug before getting Healing Factor and one of my friends gets it consistently without having Healing Factor. I don't think this is the only trigger.
---
Loving this thread lol
---
Yea I had already tried getting rid of all of them, definitely helped but was just a bandaid fix to the problem
---
Only weird thing, is that this guy showed up as level 15, I‚Äôm level 190. His level was technically like 3-400. How did he make his level look like 15? Hacker maybe?
---
No problem you can also break down non legendary weapons and armor as well
---
Maggie
---
Don't listen to the ppl saying you'll get in trouble for opening duped gifts, you won't. 
---
Every gift in circulation rn is duped. All is well. It isnt exactly game breaking either.
---
Are they all still explosive I'm using a gauss rifle and after Wastelanders I noticed it did hit AOE now I'm not noticing it hit at all on targets near or ground splash either?
---
Man this helps so much I really appreciate it thank you
---
Well, for starters, it would help if Players that don't normally play on the PC version through the Launcher got something for their own systems.
---
Steam, Playstation, and Xbox players can't receive any kind of "PTS recognition" item, and have to purchase the game again to participate in the PTS.
---
I contributed 10k wood.  They may or may not just complete the goals for us, and I certainly don‚Äôt need the plans or aid items, but it‚Äôs something to do.
---
Yeah, a good place for the woodchuck perk is the little camp site near where One Violent Night occurs (about 28 wood stacks) and Helevitia there is a wood bar with another 17 stacks, totaling 53 total.
---
I always forget missile launchers and fat mans are "big guns."
---
But yeah I really wanted to use a Quad missile launcher I got a while back, but between how fast it breaks down and the complete shit damage it wasn't worth it.
---
Yeah [just replace "horse" with "wendigo colossus"](https://youtu.be/h2dJ-JUzhVs)
---
I've never had healing factor and don't use any health regen food and it still happens to me.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me 1 of the 6 times I‚Äôve played the event.
---
I would never use another weapon if i could get a 3* bloodied chainsaw
---
I'd even be happy with a wow emote or something for when they are at home. Jumping around and giving a thumbs up just isn't the same.
---
I'm just happy to know other people enjoy browsing folks homes.
---
Small Water purifiers do need 8 power for 2 water.
---
40 power 5x small water purifier (=10 Water)
---
30 power decontamination bow
---
12 power = 4 x 3 for vendor machines (donut machine do need power to make noise).
---
20 power = 10 x 2 for turrets
---
= 102 power + Power for gimmicks
---
With industriel water purifier you'll need 2 x 10 = 20 power, only.
---
Some people do want even more water.
---
I don't know, haven't played the game for a while
---
It doesn‚Äôt unfortunately , (unless it‚Äôs been patched and I missed the patch note) you will lose a bit for the plastic you use and a bit for 2 scrap items (maybe lead and crystal?) but everything else weighs the same
---
Really? I only started playing recently. Don't know where all the spawn locations are
---
Back in my day we had to W A L K barefoot from Vault 76 to Belching Betty and B A CK with only 400 pounds to store and WE LIKED IT!
---
You are many hours late, but we thank you.
---
I would say its no big deal. Its been doable since beta and plenty of people use them. Just last night I ran across 5 different camps with them. It has never been listed in any official BSG notes as a bug, glitch, exploit or otherwise.
---
Mood
---
Hmm hopefully someone can reassure it does splash AOE it still says it goes up 51 points of damage when I equipped demo expert just not seeing it hit ever since I put suppressor on it.. Hmm
---
Tbh you‚Äôre probably safe to open them all. You‚Äôll have to make the ethics call yourself (duping is cheating) but I seriously doubt they have a mechanism to track individual items. If they did, they‚Äôd be able to turn off all duplicated items with a simple script.
---
My favorite is when I power up Thunder Mountain and take the workshop for the cores. So many enemies spawn inside the power plant. It's really obnoxious. I get more glitched enemies there than anywhere else.
---
I‚Äôm sorry I have 900 ballistic defense. Your 35 damage insults don‚Äôt phase me.
---
You are doing that too much. Try again in 5 minutes.
---
Try eating my butt, Reddit.
---
Usually when you willingly sign up to beta test something you do it because you enjoy the game and getting to experience new content before everyone else is enough. Asking for more more more on this sub though? Can't say I'm surprised.
---
Those Horde events and Uranium Fever are gonna be even more popular now
---
Thanks for lmk!   That is very good news.
---
check out twitch for fallout communities to join....look for waste virginia!
---
Agreed. That's why I got it.
---
Thats all I want. Just an easier user interface or even a exchange all option for each type of ammo. Having sliders would be the best thing but an exchange all option would suffice.
---
I miss all Garys, except gary 85, that asshole owes me 30 caps
---
This is for everyone who is making game designer insults. Tell me how well is 76 doing again? Is it finally a Triple A game?
---
We‚Äôve all been there, friend.
---
No worries
---
There‚Äôs already a problem with people on the PTS inky because they want a sneak peak at what‚Äôs coming out and don‚Äôt do any reporting back.
---
There‚Äôs more feedback (bitching) here than in the PTS forums. And some of the ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù on the PTS forum are along the lines of, ‚Äú I don‚Äôt like the artwork for the new season so I won‚Äôt be playing it‚Äù
---
So there‚Äôs little testing and bug reporting or decent feedback.
---
Now add something like giving players atoms or more? 
---
It‚Äôs not going to make better testing. Just get more players interested in the free atoms.
---
You've now got me picturing ghoulified Skyrim giants.
---
Put it in the fucking game to earn holy shit stop asking for more microtransactions
---
I will check that out
---
Isnt that more: "I got a puppy in my van"?
---
The +Limb Damage is the saving grace for a lot of heavy weapons.
---
And a legendary Ripper!
---
Yeah, the rate isn‚Äôt that big of a deal. Since I am constantly picking up ammo. I just want sliders or an exchange all option
---
It's what I've been doing, has worked out great so far! If I want a drink I'll just go to the Wayward.
---
I'd rather not.
---
Outside of the SS backpack, the demonic and raider pillager are decently small if that' s something you're into.
---
I just have the tenderizer plan left but it's yours if you want it. What's your psn.
---
Beef - It's what's for dinner.
---
Counterpoint, I have five toons with different builds and I still haven‚Äôt finished Wastelanders on any of them. I‚Äôm still playing a bit on one and a bit on another. There‚Äôs no damn race and the game is still playable even if you haven‚Äôt unlocked everything in every toon.
---
Start a party, invite friends to it, join friend via party menu, find each other in-game, start a team by using the prompt when looking at one another.
---
That‚Äôs the best I got.
---
this.  
---
but id like to add 'do you need low level power armor parts at all?'  
---
chassis are 10lbs of dead space. id suggest to wait til lvl 50 and go for the higher parts. perhaps you decide to use no PA at all then and kept it the whole time.
---
No. Because that means your getting more rewards from it than other players and that‚Äôs not fair.
---
"I'm sorry I only think about myself when I make suggestions about game design. Everyone else's experiences don't interest me."
---
I don't run a build, but just one legendary Chainsaw, any flavor.
---
I don't like this post.
---
Everytime I try to join session through the party menu or any ps menu I just get disconnected
---
Enjoy all the free stuff inside the gifts, but please for the love of Atom don't try selling the mounted head plans you get. The game is already overloaded with them to the point where they're a joke. Just dump any extras on the ground where no one will find them.
---
Read the frat party poster and you'll get the fraternity quest which will take you to fraternity row outside Morgantown. Fun sidequest, recommend
---
Bubbles in on the second floor of whitesprings. A red miss nanny selling soda
---
why not just keep playing the game how you have been the whole time? I just ignore all the new wastelander crap.
---
Karen Gamers, it is a thing we've had and never knew we had the name for. This sub is lousey with em.
---
Again that means some players are getting more from the Legendary Run then other players and that‚Äôs not fair.
---
I really didn‚Äôt know. Very cool.
---
I don't use power required turrets.
---
I use the regular shit.
---
I've done the frat quest already. I also collect nukashine.
---
Yeah, BGS Maryland writes the stories, fixes things, and occasionally creates concepts. The newly formed Texas team was tasked with filling the world that the Maryland team created perfectly as well as maintaining the game, and implementing the features. Thats why we get something amazing every now and again and then Texas swoops in and kind of messes certain things up. I don‚Äôt want to give them too much crap because this was and has all been brand new to them and Bethesda in general. But man sometimes I just want to grab them by the shoulders and shake them to ask what the hell they are thinking.
---
Instant buy for me
---
and the walk was uphill!
---
BOTH WAYS!
---
I have 2 because i love water
---
This is not correct. The upcoming changes affects how damage is calculated from multiplicative to additive. No matter how many additional damage modifiers you add to the damage equation it will never subtract damage. So while DR on enemies will reduce based on its level a higher level player will always be able to do more relative damage to the enemy because they have more modifiers. In addition a higher level player has access to high base damage weapons with better mods. The base damage of a handmade vs the base damage of a hunting rifle are staying exactly the same (as it currently works on the PTS) in the new update. And all that is to say nothing of the non-damage perks like reload speed, accuracy, better vats that a higher level player will have access to
---
They're a repeatable instanced dungeon mission that you can do solo or with a team (public or private). The location of the dungeon and the enemy type is random and changes everyday. The enemies also have a random special ability and maximum perception which makes stealth almost impossible. There's tiered rewards you can earn once per day for reaching certain completion times.
---
They're a lot of fun, some combinations of enemies are difficult, some are not.
---
Also, enemies drop what you shoot them with, so ammo isn't a concern as long as you loot the bodies before you select exit.
---
Not sure what the special rewards are, I haven't gotten them yet and I didn't get time to datamine it yet.
---
Don‚Äôt threaten me with a good time
---
I‚Äôve got my sacks next to my heads and plushie üòÜ
---
Yeah, I have really slowed down on faction reputation. Or grinding it out I should say. I do have the max settler reputation because I ended up siding with them in the end but the raider reputation is a little slower going. Getting closer though. I really want the raider ammo machine. Plus I have like 1000 treasure notes and already have max gold bullion. So it shan‚Äôt be long.
---
That‚Äôs weird. I don‚Äôt see any legendary effects in your statement about what experiences you suggest. You don‚Äôt think a level 1 person with 50 DR should have 5% damage reduction? Oh dear. Let‚Äôs see how is that zero difference when 5% is clearly put into effect? When you reach higher levels let me know when all your hard work pays off so you are rewarded with your time and effort instead of being level 1 with enough DR for the rest of the game
---
That's still the one item I haven't got from any of the meat weeks. I'd pay 10K easily for that. That's not too unreasonable, its extremely rare. 
---
What I find funny though is everyone selling stuff so high, then it gets purchased.. I hope you weren't at max caps LOL. I got to the point I just sell stuff for whatever the game defaults to, its not like it does me any good, might as well let someone else enjoy it too.
---
As others stated... I'd wait for the next event, or if you got the caps and it's not too terrible a price, just pay it. I made 10K caps over a few hours last night and today just questing, selling, etc.    Save all your ammo too. I found tons of people buy it from you when priced for 1cap/ea (for everything). 1000 rounds of something you were going to drop on the ground is 1000 caps!  It makes those expensive items suddenly not so expensive anymore.
---
and one fine day, the red sun is going down over the bog, you turn around a barns corner and see a cowlossus and a sheepsquatch doing the inter species cha cha. sweet sweet wastelands.
---
Another option is to have a third friend be your anchor, if you‚Äôre trying to meet up with a specific friend.   Everyone has each other added, you and your friend join person 3.
---
Course, that will only work if your FL is bugged in the same way mine is, where only certain people won‚Äôt show up in the social tab, while others show up no problem.
---
That is pretty awesome!! I'd love the croc backpack plan!
---
I found the Wendigo plushie plan for $200ish on one vendor. I appreciated the person that put it at that price so I could grab it. Basically free! :D I now price all rare stuff at cheap prices just so others can share the fun too. Its not like I can do anything with it.
---
Once in a while I'll save the really rare stuff and gift it to someone that came by and showed my camp some love. Its fun!
---
I wonder what happens when you tug the udders on a level 50 brahmin and it kicks you.
---
This needs to be tested.
---
LIT! NO KING!!1
---
People from pts said it's fixed.  Colossus event was not a patch,you need to wait september.
---
I would not care if it stayed level 20 or finally got the magic level 50 through completion spawn. Anti-armor/Furious/Ghoul Slayer/Vampire Chainsaw, +50% limb damage, 90% weight reduction.
---
\*Sheepsquatch
---
Do friends show up on the recent list?
---
Well, he is a ghoul....
---
Exactly!! I have a great monitor AND a great PC. I shouldn‚Äôt be getting literal headache or migraines from trying to read the impossible to read text. I am glad somebody else noticed this. I have 20/20 vision and still can‚Äôt read it. Hell even if they swapped out the curved terminal screen for the regular flat screened terminals it would be an improvement.
---
Hurrhurrhurr
---
even if the mailboxes were limited to giving the existing items, notes and holotapes that would be hilarious.  leaving someone an "im watching you" or "I.O.U. toilet paper" is all i need
---
Mines not even loading. Been down for like an hour
---
I have a magic shotgun, it oneshots enemies like ghouls and supermutants but does little to scorchbeats. It's a good magic weapon, not a bad magic weapon that pulverzes the queen and ruins events
---
They should, though most of my recent list seems to be just random people I‚Äôve shared a lobby with and had zero interaction.
---
Yeah same üòï
---
I herd reset and everything on Xbox..no luck
---
Nah just kill em all and leave a message inside on the wall and the quest can progress fine
---
Agreed
---
I hear ya, but baby things gotta change! I got two accounts and 10 characters. I had to delete a level 50 character to get a new character to "level up" for score. I never used mine the way you did - I have my main (junkie commando/unarmed) at lvl 430 and my secondary (junkie but 15 charisma and able to share level 5 adrenaline or ironclad etc) coming up on 200. 6 others are level 50+ that are just there for storage and purveyor rolls. the last 2 are &lt; lvl10 and are just there to level up quick.
---
I'll never understand that 'counterpoint'. grinding rep and gold with one character is agonizing enough. it's not about not being race, it's about not wanting to waste months on it in the first place.
---
if you want a gauss minigun? max rep with the raiders. sure, a commando has no business unlocking one. but the ammo machine is something every character has an use for, and it's also a max raider rep reward. so you have to grind two characters regardless.
---
and this is just one example of why having these character-locked is stupid.
---
I agree but honestly he sounds like a chain smoker who worked at the mills for his whole life and after work would get pissed in the Southside and wake up in brighton hights. If we factor that in he kinda sounds like he would fit in around the mexican war street area lol
---
You based this whole idea off that wordplay, didn‚Äôt you?
---
I dunno, feels like there are different weapons and playstyles that fit different parts of the game. If you try starting a new character without transferring anything from your main, would you jump straight to a Bloodied FFR Fixer?
---
And also, where is the logic in slow fire being as good or only slightly worse than rapid fire? Ammo consumption, recoil and shorter effective range are downsides of rapid fire, but if you can negate that with lots of mats, good Perception/VATS and handling closer combat, why shouldn't this be the *best* option?
---
Yeah I'm just wondering if a friend joined the server I'm in then went to the server where all my friends are if I could follow them that way
---
Is there lore stuff to check out on terminals and notes?
---
For me blocker 3 and pneumatic chest piece mod is a must. You still get staggered but not nearly as bad, and you take little to no damage. Escape artist is very good for losing spawns and colossus.
---
That's really nice!
---
Should work
---
I have two - and it is hard sometimes to decide which one I want to play with - since they have different feels &amp; stories (and focus).
---
Right now, I'm mostly on my 544 - just because I love using her to fight Earle.
---
Exactly. The trade window and the vending machine window are basically the same thing. Easy to use and clearly displayed for everyone to see. Trying to read that curved screen terminal compared to the regular flat screened terminals is impossible. I have the exact same problem with the daily planner terminal camp item. Yet I have zero problem reading the hackable terminals you find around the world.
---
They used to spawn legendary, but were removed from the drop table, along with the buzzblade.
---
The previous low level locations cap at level 50 spawns now, the previous high level locations cap at level 100.
---
"Plenty of folks wanna make life hard for people just tryin' to survive. I'm not willing to stand for that kinda shit."
---
(Also, their progress is fine.)
---
Since the mask doesn't mean anything anymore, I just shot the crap out of them.
---
Posers!
---
Because you don't need rads to make use of it.
---
Although I don't think anyone would disagree that it's the best use for em.
---
I believe this thread proves otherwise
---
I didn't know there was a problem until a few months ago from reading about it here on Reddit. As of late, I now get it once or twice a game session, so I know its gotten worse. Not a bloody build either. Moving about 20' does seem to fix the problem, for me at least.
---
That‚Äôs where it started but now I‚Äôve convinced myself it would be legit awesome.
---
News flash, you sound exactly like him
---
haha shaft
---
I've got a level 360+, a 260+, a 220+, and a 160+. I know how the game works.
---
You, clearly, don't understand scaling and player experience.
---
No, I don't think a level 1 should only be able to get 5% dr. It needs to scale with level, armor rating, and enemy attack damage. Like pretty much every single well balanced game in existence does. 
---
A level 5 with 50 DR should be reasonably tough against level 5 enemies, but get smashed by level 50 enemies. Which is exactly how the current system works. Your proposed system.... would not work like that.
---
I'm not saying the current system is perfect, but I am saying it's far better thought out than your braindead concept.
---
The sheepsquatch nicknames the cowlossus bighorner.
---
As of right now some things are being nerfed more than others for no reason.  Bloodied, Junkie's, etc are being brought more in line with each other which might open up more builds for people.  Slow firing weapons are being made useless compared to faster firing ones which imo is a bit much.  To give an example, my Bloodied pipe revolver base damage went from 558 per shot to 205 but my Furious 10 mm SMG went from 104 to 98.  RoF is 6 on the revolver and 91 on the SMG.  Vampire's Tesla went from 137 to 57 with RoF being 91.   2S Gamma Gun went from 307 to 249 with RoF also 91.   These are just the numbers off 4 weapons on my main and I checked using the appropriate perk cards for each weapon.  Haven't checked anything with heavy weapons or melee yet.
---
a toggle under display settings would be super sweet.
---
Having trouble with the stash space? You think 800 pounds is too low for this kind of games where grinding is practically necessary? You just pick a thing and  are always overencumbered? Do you think Bethesda created this issue on purpose? 
---
Don't worry, Bethesda heard their players about this issue and because they're such a good company they just created a solution and for the minimum quantity of 100 dollars per year or $13 per month you'll get the scrap box, an unlimited stash for all your junk, something that should've been included without any extra cost since day 1. But if you're paying for it that means it's better. :) 
---
Aren't Bethesda such a great company?
---
Well I don‚Äôt understand why if you enjoyed playing multiple toons before Wastelanders why you couldn‚Äôt continue enjoying it post Wastelanders. Don‚Äôt grind. You don‚Äôt need the rewards to keep playing if getting the rewards isn‚Äôt making you happy. I‚Äôm enjoying the game the same way I used to because I haven‚Äôt changed my play style to grind for rewards I‚Äôm doing fine without.
---
To me it is worthless.everyone will get it from the event sooner than later.
---
It's not as rare as ultracite calibrated shock from the queen. Impatient people could spend some more caps.
---
You missed the opportunity to call it a ‚Äòmoo-nstrocity‚Äô
---
Hopefully the findings help someone(s).  I hit 100 today and it was both anticlimactic and relieving at the same time.
---
In total, i think i lost close to 6,000 points over the course of the pass which is far less than some.  I always logged out at least 15 minutes prior to 12pm and didn't log back in until 12:05pm or later.  I also made sure that Nuclear Winter wasn't my last played activity before logging out.
---
In either case, the pass was enough for me to play almost every day since it came out.  I'm curious to see how the next one goes and if they'll fix the issues encountered in this one.
---
The problem is the inability to have a way to stop it, esp since they don't want the workshop and just want to grief you.
---
The problem is that pvp is not designed in a fun or meaningful way where you can "win"...so it becomes boring harassment and pvp itself is not meaningful balanced between builds.
---
Hopefully one wasteland will fix that, i wouldn't mind pvp so much if people couldn't become overpowered gods that take 0 (serendipity) or 1 damage(sentinel(75% dmg reduction)+chems) while healing for 100's of points of health a second.
---
We deserve better.
---
High five! You have unlocked fulfillment.
---
Atom...bah.

Moth Man I've seen with my own two eyes.

ü§£ü§£ I don‚Äôt hate everything. I absolutely love bethesda‚Äôs games and LITERALLY DEFEND THEM AT EVERY TURN. I hate the ammo converter because even though I have 20/20 vision I cannot read it on my 4k monitor. Clearly didn‚Äôt read what I said and just look at the title. It would be an incredibly useful machine if it didn‚Äôt take an hour to use. For instance the same UI used on literally everything else in the game. Such as the trade menu and the vending machine venue. Get over yourself.
---
Same thing with The Dragon. I have a bloody Dragon, but I'd glad give up it being special for a chance at more legendaries like it, the chainsaw and ripper being put back in the loot pool.
---
So apparently friends do not show in recent.  Guess I'm SOL ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
i got no beef with that brahmin
---
If it helps, thats happened enough times that I just run in and steal the cores out of their extractor and bounce. I just wait for a high level to take a nuke plant then its on. Rinse repeat every 5-10 minutes, I logged out with 15 new cores one casual evening.
---
Yes some people lock their extractors. Ive had that happen ONCE the entire time Ive been stealing cores from the rich to give to the poor (when they drop below 30% due to me using them) üíÖüèº
---
I am really mooooved by this idea.
---
I don't know about you but having a constant supply of ammo means I don't waste nowhere near as much time gathering supplies. and that's on my commando.
---
except the gauss minigun is certainly a game changer, even more so now with the nerfs. so I need max rep with the raiders on my heavy gunner too.
---
it's not rocket science.
---
Every time I do that it‚Äôs either a floating monstrosity or a massive box with pretty much nothing inside
---
Sounds like a mooot point to me, I doubt they'll add it. Or they'll charge Atoms for an entry fee to the event, you know, really milk it.
---
Your the one trying to insult me so what does that tell you? Whining and offering criticism so that they hopefully change it are two separate things. On top of that I don‚Äôt spend all of my time on the internet and on social media so all the lingo means absolutely nothing to me ü§£. Sorry you feel that way but that is your problem not mine.

Been saying this since the start.  I play all my characters in all games differently and hate when people assume otherwise.  Pretty sure they could make it so if someone blocked a player for whatever reason it would block all their characters.  They would have to give free name changes first if they ever did this.
---
You could also tell your friends to join you.
---
A friend of mine said that toggling ‚Äòappear offline‚Äô on and off a few times got his friend list to work the next time he played the game, but it didn‚Äôt help for my list.   Still, if you‚Äôre out of options, might be worth a try.
---
while theyre at it let us have 2 collectron.  Insult bot and raider bot constantly talking their shit at camp would be awesome
---
can't do that, my dude
---
OMG NO WAY!
---
"For sake of immersion"
---
Warning! Motherhumper42069 launched a nuke!
---
But seriously it would be kind of cool, character names are totally pointless right now, not sure why they bother having us name them at all.
---
Unfortunately we have too many people playing to get them all in a server by joining on me without people waiting half an hour to get into the world.  Thanks for your help though, I appreciate it üëç
---
It's because people don't want to admit the fact that it's happening, Bethesda didn't even mention it once in this ITV, and if anyone hasn't read any post or watched any videos, they don't even know about it. The damage decreases are crazy. Talk about nerfing all builds, and making bloodied the only viable build. If you look at the numbers, bloodied is still higher by a large amount, compared to a junkie bloodied build. And like Tesla's, gat Plasmas, already low damage weapons, are even lower. I think the numbers on the gat plasma went to like single digits, below 5 damage. It's stupid and everyone's acting like it's nothing. Borderlands has insane damage mulitpyers, more than Bethesda, are Bethesda said that their servers can't handle that kind. It can't be right. Maybe upgrade the server to support it. But the damage decrease is crazy and people are gonna leave.
---
wait, no, cant be, there is no WAY Bethesda would do something like that. You are telling me that the community could not produce 75,000 more cork than steal in less than 7 days? nah, I don't believe that. Everyone knows how much easier it is to get cork than steal! It is not like we can scrap any weapon and get steal from it.
---
^(this is supposed to be sarcastic)
---
Check your pip boy....apparel, I think.  
---
The icon looks like a raindrop.
---
One of my armor pieces has 25 poison resistance.   There is a raindrop iconto the right of the DR # with the number 25 next to it.
---
Id definitely buy it 100%, I got the atoms
---
I had this problem too. The directions would say top floor and stairs on the left and I‚Äôm like that‚Äôs not even here. And on a different floor led me in circles.
---
Why not Cowasaurus Rex or Moozilla ?
---
I am trying again right now and guess what?
---
Earl is inside the ceiling...
---
I even had a good team this time
---
It's simply crazy how unlucky I am
---
I'm sitting here laughing my ass off imagining a Brahman cowlossus
---
This honestly sounds like so much fun, I know it's been a few months since this post and I just wanted to know if you ended up doing the DnD like session and how it went? :)
---
Haha blaze it amirite?
---
I remember way back before people knew there was a guaranteed pie drop, I sold a couple of them for 10k caps.    Congrats on your pie, my dude.
---
This is the quality content that keeps me coming back to the sub
---
What if there was also a rad roach mini boss that could spawn around vault 94 or the one used in wastelanders
---
She looks pretty similar to the settler wanderer. You could totally dress the settler wanderer in her clothe and then adorn the area around her chair with the camp stuff you get from Earle.
---
Remember what a wise philosopher once said. ‚ÄúInsults are the tools of the defeated.‚Äù The moment you attacked my experience and tried to demean me by suggesting a novel idea reveals to me that you lost and cannot do anything else but complain and whine and insult me. It shows your lack of intellectual growth. Now that petty insults are out of the way are you ready to understand? 
---
In order to actually get extremely high DR you need to use tank perk cards instead of damage cards. If the system stays the same now. Everyone only needs to run damage cards because no matter the armor rating you take the same damage if it is high enough. The balance I offer is easy because no one has yet to get high DR unless sacrificing the proper means to do so.  5% damage reduction to a low level won‚Äôt save them because they won‚Äôt deal the damage necessary to solo anything at higher levels. The weapon effects on legendaries give us that damage. Or they should. Right now they kinda suck for all guns. But there is supposed to be a strategy to building something. Right now as it stands there is not. My idea fixes that with people deciding which cards they want instead of everyone running the same build 24/7. Just because we can die and respawn doesn‚Äôt mean we should be able to. It kinda ruins the immersion that we are basically immortal and nothing will kill us anyway. 
---
So please try to understand what Im suggesting instead of only citing yourself as a source of information. Thank you
---
Why would anybody want that over deep pocketed then? From what I understand it‚Äôs just a weaker version of it
---
Buzzblade was removed?
---
I haven't found any in a long time on PS4 but somehow I have 104 in my inventory, I've never even picked up half that.
---
Must not be on consoles then
---
Meh, Bethesda is actually moving the bar each day. The event will complete no matter what we the players do.
---
No worse than Bethesda‚Äôs attempts at a Boston accent.
---
I‚Äôm still looking üò©üò©üò©
---
yes fucking please
---
It gives bonus ap that can be helpful, plus it's great to reduce weight for storing in stash
---
They don't have enough players. That says it all really, doesn't it.
---
AA40s would be dope as hell and useful for anyone
---
You're not. Everyone has the same chance to earn these things. It's on the player if they don't.
---
fix it good under int
---
Fix It Good under Intelligence.
---
Well I already have a godroll weapon, I was just looking for some tradeable things or just bloodied guns in general (since I like using non unarmed weapons just for the hell of it)
---
Thats my main problem with it. It would be incredibly useful if it was just more convenient to use. I said it when I first acquired it. Its almost like they were worried it would be overpowered for legacy players down the line and give them an unfair advantage over new players. Course now we know that we will be able to purchase old seasons rewards with gold bullion so the limits on it seem ridiculous now. Just my personal opinion on the matter. I love the complexities of their games but certain things that don‚Äôt need to be complex that are make for a lesser experience. Its like Jeff Gardner said on the no clip documentary survival elements in games can be fun but you don‚Äôt want there to be survival elements on everything. His exact statement was ‚ÄúI have to brush my teeth every day or they will rot and fall out of my head, I don‚Äôt want to have to do that in a video game I just don‚Äôt care‚Äù so that comparison seems valid when it comes to things like this. Once again. Just my personal opinion.
---
Prepare for trouble,and make it.....triple.
---
Well there's also the problem that Bethesda doesn't listen to most of the feedback too on PTS forum. Probably partly why they don't have enough testers.
---
If your getting something from completing the dailY SCORE challenges after you complete the run, then your getting more than players that haven‚Äôt completed the run.
---
Greedy.
---
Server hop is the easiest thing to do.
---
As an Ohio boy I would love an expansion across the Ohio River. Tbh idk much about SE Ohio tho so idk what they could populate it with.
---
Rule 9 is really hard.
---
Same here... I wish I could sell/give the scrap and repair kits away.
---
Yes-   You can server hop to a new world without the nuked zone.
---
It depends on how low the enemies scale down. If they scale down in health and DR it is possible that a low levels effective time to kill could possibly be lower. I understand the multiplicative to additive change, but as I stated the nerf will have much less impact on low levels since they don't have a ton of multiplicative damage increasers currently available at their level. Adrenal Reaction and Legendary Effects are about it. 
---
The base damage for commando weapons is pretty damn reasonable compared to max level. Level 10 10mm SMG base damage is 50% of the max level version, but a level 15 Handmade does 66.7% as much damage as a max level 45. I use low level Bloodied commando weapons on my alt that I'm leveling and they absolutely shred anything close to their level, while still being respectable against high level enemies.
---
No, I often forget to use chems.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. It would make a lot more sense.
---
Thank god. Now for the radaway problem
---
Don't have healing factor and shotty unyielding, not bloody.  Didnt have this glitch until last update.now it runs rampant. Am on Xbox.   Theorycrafting is good though, lets keep it up guys.
---
You mean feedback like the one about the artwork?
---
The PTS isn‚Äôt just about feedback about what players think.
---
And I‚Äôve read the feedback. The majority of it is terrible, poorly thought out or just stupid.
---
I love when people ask this question.
---
Even with the few issues I had, I've had fun since day 1.
---
Don't let the fake news scare you away from things ;)
---
I do not remember a giant ghoul from 4, and I played that for thousands of hours.   Either it doesn‚Äôt exist, or marijuana affects the memory.
---
Yeah, that is to be expected on exchange rates. Just the way it is.
---
he was probably using a magic LMG. angryturtle has several videos on them but they're essentially bugged legendary prefixes with a pseudo furious effect that can kill bosses in 10 seconds flat.
---
Just keep reading my last comment until it sinks in.
---
Shut up Meg
---
Lol did you go to the Ben Shapiro school of discussion? 
---
Again, you are only focusing on your experience as a highlevel.
---
And I've no idea what point you're trying to make when you said " 5% damage reduction to a low level won‚Äôt save them because they won‚Äôt deal the damage necessary to solo anything until higher levels." At best I can gather, you still don't understand what *I* am saying, but you're also saying that low levels can't solo anything? I'm sorry, WHAT?
---
Like I said, Bethesda's system isn't perfect and has room for improvement, but yours is vastly worse for anyone who isn't in endgame (and also worse for anyone not optimizing armor, although you do have a case that that could be a good thing for balance and build variety)
---
"it's tragic what happened to your father, truly tragic"

*immediately goes back home and puts Earle's severed heads on display*
---
"Fuck yeah! That looks SWEET!"
---
You mean he didn't give you the 30K for the fucking cursed pickaxe?
---
roflol
---
It went well! Only had a couple of players but overall I think fun was had! Thank you for reminding me about this! I want to do it again in the future!!
---
You do recall that Fallout 4 was released after Skyrim, yes?
---
I don't know if you are still doing this or nah, but I've yet to launch a nuke or do this event. I'm level 129, or 130, or something like that. I play solo except for the occasional random event etc etc. 
---
I think I do okay, but, anyway, I'd love to launch a nuke, and do this event.
---
I do have a private world that can be used. Once I figured out how to invite people to it would be more than happy to let it be useful for things like this.
---
Anyway, my IGN is randomxyn.
---
Can you *not* start witch hunts?
---
I hope the next major update after the BoS is the rest of the vaults opening. It would be interesting if a non-control vault with survivors opened up. Maybe they could be crazy from the experiments and give us a new enemy type we can find in the wild.
---
Maybe don‚Äôt break the forum rules?
---
Also White Knight in Agility makes it cheaper to repair.
---
Unpopular opinion, but I actually like getting low level legendaries from it. It helps me outfit my low level toons.
---
Does it have to be 8 different Daily Ops? or can I run the same one multiple times?
---
Also I saw someone say there was a weekly challenge in the PTS that showed you how many Daily Op's you've completed, but I don't see that at all.
---
Can anyone clear this up for me?
---
There wasn't a giant ghoul in 4, or 3 or New Vegas
---
Make sure to swing by Helvetia for that giant wood pile close to the fast travel spot, it‚Äôs behind the building where you‚Äôd have to drop off rad toad eggs during Fastnach!
---
Maybe a bit longer than 2 weeks, but you are essentialy correct. My main completed The Legendary Run over a week ago, so I don't need xp. I had over 450 treasury notes (playing an alt at the moment, so this is slowly going down). I have Fallout 1st, so I already had more screws and acid than I know what to do with. Other than the unique rewards, I have no other reasons to play this event. So, once I get those, I doubt I'll do it very often.
---
That's melting not one-shoting.
---
I did the private server thing. It still had the same dialogue.
---
Delays, delays delays. Bugs bugs bugs. Did you *really* expect anything different?
---
A level 700 could very well be rocking the same gun you found at 50. It's more about perks, mutations and chems
---
I have that, but thank you regardless.
---
Steam auto assigning a alphanumerical identifier when someone doesn't have a bethesda account.
---
There isn't in vanilla. Just from a minute or two of searching the web and my survival guide all I could find were mods that added giant versions of already existing creatures. Maybe he means behemoth but they're already around randomly. I only checked because I was worried about having a hazed memory too.
---
Sweeter than sugar bombs, nuka-cherry and fancy lads all rolled into one. Pure diabetes.
---
RIP leveling our lowbie toons. This will make it harder for sure.
---
Well it was so fast, could be melting as well.
---
I would like to say the same. I've encountered several kind legends out in the wasteland.
---
For sure man. Take care
---
You are misinterpreting what I said into your own vision. Did I say low levels can‚Äôt solo anything? No I did not. They cannot kill high level enemies so they will die if they try. You cannot proceed
---
If you cannot build properly. I guess I should take my vanguard SS armor and just never worry about armor again because mister gutsy and assaultrons can still basically burst you which makes no sense. 
---
Enemies who are low level have nothing to fear from a level 1 radroach. So I fail to see how this inhibits lower level characters but rather makes them wait to do end game content because they have to actually earn that ability.
---
Is the croc backpack coming back? Just dropped a decent amount of caps on the plans, I'd hate for it to be made cheaper now
---
Got me again , frozen screen of orange damage , glad they held this off till it was fixed
---
are you sure he one shot Earle, though? several reasons why it could've just *looked* like that on your end.
---
On top of that I would like to see your gameplay hours compared to mine. My daily routine is, wake up, eat, go to work, come home, play 76 for hours on end, write and record music, repeat. 76 is a vast majority of that time. There is absolutely no reason to come in here and insult people. That just angers the other person (normally because words don‚Äôt hurt my feelings) and leads to a me me me argument which goes absolutely nowhere. So don‚Äôt pull that crap with people. As long as you remain civil it makes it easier for someone with an opposing view to your understand where you are coming from. The reason the internet sucks is because people like you get on here and make for a toxic environment. Hate me, call me names, do whatever you have to do but in the future try to be a little more civilized please.
---
About replacing exploding perks considering they were never popular but getting rid relatively more popular ones like the armour perk.
---
Not testing out legendary run in PTS.
---
A plethora of bug fixes that were never seen to on the pts that made it to live.
---
I've seen the feedback too &amp; a lot of the sensible ones are outright ignored.
---
A legendary chainsaw with weight reduction would be beautiful! ü§û
---
came here to say this.  DONT DO THIS PEOPLE.  Xbox will gladly ban you on a whim.    Messages can even get you account banned, or console banned (i.e. a brick).  Don't matter how much you've spent, Gamerscore, etc..   
---
Used to read their old moderation forums back in thr day.  Every other post was "Why was I banned"?  
---
Although favorite response was a "mother " asking why her son was console banned.   Mods response?  "He  described a sexual act with a pineapple".
---
Buzzblade still spawns legendary, I landed two three star ones the other week!
---
Behemoth was my first thought too.
---
I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre not as common in 76 as they were in 4.    I like fighting them, but the guaranteed spawns they had in 4 kinda ruined their specialness.
---
That's great to hear! Would love to join sometime if you ever decide to host something like this ever again!
---
The first time Chally ran towards me, it scared the fuck out of me, ngl
---
I collect them now. Accidentally ate one, but now I have a full thanksgiving shelf filled with pie.
---
Then they can level the Sneak perk and equip it as soon as they smell danger. There are so many playstyles in this game, and none of them are wrong. Relax
---
Wait...how do I get her to come be at my camp?  She's still standing around at the Power Armor stations in Foundation.
---
See I don‚Äôt dislike the flat screen hackable terminals you find around the world. I can read them easily and the wording size is completely fine. Something about curved screen terminals like the daily planner and the ammo converter make it far more difficult to navigate.
---
ü§£
---
She doesn't it's just a joke
---
I'd try explaining. But I can't do anything about your brand of ignorant.
---
Sounds like fun. Thank you!
---
Oh my goodness, a croc backpack! You‚Äôre so lucky! üò≠
---
Quick question Maggie, which one of these three heads is your father? Cause i gotta use one in case i'm out of toilet paper
---
I have about 12 low-level Power Armor sets I need to gift away.  I stockpile too many give-aways!
---
I get Kindred Spirit from Beckett because I don't roll that way and finished his questline without flirting with him.
---
Can you have more than one of every collectron? Because I would love to have an army
---
Hmm. Weird. I'm fairly certain I've experienced it with my crossbow too :/
---
Duped items containing caps, common plans, and aid items. Near useless for higher levels, but the caps can be great for lower levels. Don't feel bad for using them, there's so many of them ingame that nobody cares anymore.
---
I think you‚Äôre exaggerating.
---
I just went and read the top posts on the PTS forum. One us that INT shouldn‚Äôt give an XP bonus. 
---
That‚Äôs not feedback so much as opinion. There one listing the new rewards for the treasure hunt that someone data mined. There‚Äôs a post asking if the Chinese stealth suit benefits for any of the legendary perks. 
---
The best feedback/bug report was about a reward being repeated twice on the new legendary run. 
---
There‚Äôs not a lot of amazing feedback like your stating.
---
On trade forums. There‚Äôs no way to manipulate RNG in game that I know of. That‚Äôs the R part of the acronym. If you learn the market, vendor hop, and trade your way up you can get anything ya want. I‚Äôll
---
A giant fish boss would be cool
---
OP was storing a lot of unscrapped junk and unneeded weapons.  
---
800 lbs is plenty if you avoid the hoarder mentality.
---
Dude take some English reading/writing classes. I literally QUOTED you saying it. 
---
Again:
---
"..to a low level won‚Äôt save them because they won‚Äôt deal the damage necessary to solo anything..."
---
I'm done, I can't deal with trying to communicate with someone as obstinate as you.
---
Nope. Only lead and aluminum. Otherwise, the weight reduction is just the 2 Plastic you used. That‚Äôs it.
---
I mean if you are taking longer than 5 minutes to launch a nuke you're wasting your time
---
Honestly... it is Reddit.  It isnt surprising.   What is surprising is this seems to be one of the least toxic communities I have seen.  Honestly even with the shitposts it is a breath of fresh air here compared to other areas of Reddit, and honestly does make me enjoy the game even more.
---
More people will always mean more complainers.  But also more feel good posts too.  Just the loudest voice (complaining) is usually what sticks out.
---
That would be funny, but if they did implement something like this, I would hope it would be more functional then anecdotal.
---
I didn't even know I wanted this till now.
---
Ace sort of insults you a little bit. An insult bot that still
---
Gets junk would be cool.

Once, I was holding the hemlock holes workshop, minding my own business when I‚Äôm told I need to defend it against super mutants.   Okay, common enough occurance, and I‚Äôve got turrets all over the place so I can pretty much go back to playing the banjo.   The one wave I had to defend against completes instantly without a peep from my turrets.   I figured it was a bug, no biggie, and now I‚Äôm well-tuned, so it‚Äôs about time to hit the ol‚Äô dusty trail.   I put down the banjo, and I hear all my turrets start firing wildly at something.   I‚Äôm tired of repairing turrets, so I go to clear out what I assume to be that wave of super mutants I was expecting, and instead I see Grahm beating the shit out of one of my turrets.     He‚Äôs not hostile to me, so I just watch as he takes out all of the turrets on the ground, and teleports to the ones on the roof of the shed thing and smites them.   Then he sold me plans for radiation emitters, moonwalked off the roof of the shed, and continued on his merry way down the road.
---
Ill probably go for vats
---
Omg I thought it was just me.
---
I think only speculation at this point 
---
There‚Äôs a video on YouTube called West Virginia roc about it that‚Äôs cool
---
I wish you could get an asultron for camp defense they are baddys
---
You are a moron if you think I actually meant low levels couldn‚Äôt solo anything. Enjoy your meager existence playing a busted game. When you develop a higher understanding or even higher logical processes in your brain talk to me again. I leave your sorry poor obsolete brain where it‚Äôs at because I can‚Äôt seem to repair the damage. Enjoy!
---
"you're a moron if you think I meant what I wrote".
---
The Trump school of debate then.
---
There's no official explanation for it but Oxhorn did made a video about it, offering an interesting theory.
---
No way! I completely disagree! 
---
This gives me a headache just thinking about that happening.
---
Sofia is annoying as hell, crashed out of a spaceship (there's a LOT more to this but I'll save it for spoilers). Above all else, she's accident prone, not a spy/assassin type. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
---
I really forgot this was still a thing. It's so dumb. Xmas presents give better rewards.
---
This is true. There's already the option to pick up everything at once though right? From world containers and loot bags? Shouldn't be too hard to implement the feature/QoL you mentioned at all üôÉ
---
You sure are
---
I mean... yeah?  I think this is a great message to spread, but you were about to log off, why keep listening to his conversation?  Again, great PSA, but why choose to listen to two phone calls he made?  Just log off.
---
The idea of a radant Queen is terrifying.
---
You most certainly are not the only one.
---
Interesting. Did he need any specific legebdary armor pieces or just perk cards and a gatling plasma?
---
I've been playing this event with my commando character. I should probably try it with my melee soon. I'm curious to see the damage differences.
---
He seems to love Foundation. I always see him in there or around the bridge.
---
'Finally, somebody with the guts to not be a douche'. 
---
I then bought a disco ball....
---
I first saw it in one of his wastelander livestreams, but never went to check it out for myself until today.  I didnt know he made a video about it, ill have to watch it!
---
So you still got insulted üòÇ
---
Poor Earle
---
My camp's in the same spot and I have the same frustration. Sometimes I'll get the same server upwards of 5 times before finding one. I don't know if I'd place it at top priority for things to be fixed, but it's certainly annoying.
---
I just wanted the Brahmin outfit, and nah, I play on PS4.
---
I have legitimately gotten about 25 perfectly preserved pies,  have actually eaten most of them when i didnt have any other food
---
They are 100% drop now?
---
I've found, with very few exceptions, that the fo76 community is very helpful and friendly.  I was gifted semi rare plans and aid items as a low level player and I have made sure to pass it along now that I am no longer low level.  I'm always willing to help out even up to crafting level appropriate armor and weapons for free, I even throw in ammo for what I craft for people.
---
I‚Äôve been running blocker/serendipity and have only died twice out of all my runs. I‚Äôm not even using dodgy. What do your perks look like? What chems?
---
Agreed. Also, I can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve set up just the right composition, chosen the right filters and logo, and snapped a beautiful picture... and my photos gallery is full.
---
I'll never understand this pie thing. It's a machine I smack as I walk past and I've gotten a couple of pies from them...
---
If they gave a massive boost I'd be all over it like a fat kid. They're kinda useless. I'd love like a +15 Luck for two hours of something.
---
There‚Äôs one machine on a rooftop that will drop a pie every time.   Unless they changed that recently, but I don‚Äôt think they did.
---
I was doing census taker and grahm decided he didnt like that and killed the census taker.
---
It's incarnation of Blood Eagle God!
---
Either way I love to see some people in that base
---
Clear the mine in ten seconds flat, eh?
---
You can still get a 1* legendary ripper and dragon
---
Huh. That‚Äôs pretty interesting
---
My main is named Konrik (after a d&amp;d character i made, both are two handed barbarians.) I have a secound character i've been meaning to level up. A real lankey thin guy. A plague doctor named Doktor Kr√§he (doctor crow). I want to get the quak doctor outfit but its so damn expensive.
---
Ah I wasnt sure if I missed some lore or something, Ill check out the video tho, thanks!
---
I run a full health build with 9x heavy gunner and a 25ff two shot .50 cal. I eat a lot of super stims but I can grind him down solo
---
I have serendipity but blocker definitely sounds like it's necessary
---
The collectron ripper
---
It was confirmed early on by Bethesda that it was the original model for scorchbeasts.   
---
Here is some of the original concept art:  [https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Yaoeoq](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Yaoeoq)   
---
Also ignore the idiot below that says there is no official explanation.
---
It should be an exclusive boss for Meat week.
---
If they cannot fill (15+ people on a 24 person server) servers, they will shut the game down, then noone can play. Short of that I'll have someone to team up with. I dont care if I solo easy stuff but I like Encrypted where I need.another person to take a pylon or Colossal Problem where I need another damage dealer. There are far too many builds that can one shot most of the game and for even a watered down MMO that is bad. Builds might be more important going into one wasteland but I mean - shouldnt they be? When my un optimized bloodied build can one shot any non event mob (3 for scorchbeast), there is something wrong when I can get 2-3x more damage if I tried harder on my build
---
Did you see a large crowd of people's dots at the location?  It could cover up the event icon, I just usually fast travel to 76 and run down the hill.
---
Have you talked to Maggie yet ..it wouldn't trigger for my friend till he did
---
BGS: Too late, we read it for the atomic shop first üí∞
---
I did and it still didn‚Äôt trigger
---
I really didn't know what to expect since I don't play many multiplayer games that aren't PvP oriented. It's been really cool to experience a different type of online experience.
---
Did you actually travel to Huntersville or did you travel to a party member who was near it...only to discover that while you were in transit, they moved?
---
Ha; that's right!
---
There is an official explanation. It‚Äôs the original design for the Scorchbeast. Bethesda started this a long time ago. Take a look at the early concept art and you‚Äôll see what I mean.
---
Cash Brahmin*
---
If you actually read the PTS feedback, you'd know I'm not. 
---
It's not all gold, granted but far too much good &amp; thoughtful feedback is outright ignored. Main reason why I stopped playing the PTS. What's the point if you're going to be mostly ignored anyhow.
---
It‚Äôs actually a great perk in general. With our bloodied builds it‚Äôs mostly only melee enemies that can kill us. What kind of armor are you rolling?
---
Yes, we need a bigger budget, especially getting cool items.  
---
But...  maybe the game isn't made for us.   I slowly built up my settlements in FO4, themed them (Starlight changed to Star City, home to all my Allies shops, made a reformed Cait a bar even because I miss evil karma, Danse runs a training school called Danse Class, Deacon runs a disguise shop, McCready sells... lamps and lights, Strong runs a "milking" shop where he sells "milk", Curie is the medic at ApotheCurie, etcc...) but, maybe it is to keep things fresh. 
---
  I love my Red Rocket Fasnacht Diner with confetti spread across the parking lot, and don't wanna change it.  Just add to it.  But...   having to change csn be refreshing as well.  
---
Is that the game?  Is it me?  And I trying to cram settlements into the game that doesn't do settlements?  I dunno.   I want more budget for sure, or better flamingo units for items (seriously Mothman High sign....).  But on a slower hotel internet connection I've seen WHY a huge budget can be bad.  Dunno, thoughts?
---
Exactly lol, it's not a real spacesuit
---
I think, with the recalculated damage, sniper rifles just can‚Äôt reliably kill high level enemies with a headshot, even with a bloody min/max build.  It‚Äôs perfectly fine if commando is stronger than rifleman, as it is in the live game, but in the PTS single shot sniper rifles are neutered.  I‚Äôd just like to have options other than commando or heavy gunner for end game play.
---
Workshops are PvP zones. Don't like it? Trade for some good  gear and fight back, or don't fucking claim the workshop.
---
My friend was able to join the event even before talking to maggie
---
Yes, maybe a bit bumbly, but she is a fangirl. She would make a great custodian for the secret base, though maybe not the perfect operative. But theres always whats-her-name who knows how to use a stealth suit for that. Though, personally I found her more endearing than annoying.
---
The first time it's possible they were in a separate instance somehow. Either way good for you!!
---
I literally just read the feedback.
---
It‚Äôs always the same every time I read it. The majority of the feedback is someone grinding their personal issues. Or giving feedback that isn‚Äôt related to the new stuff that‚Äôs on the test server.
---
Most people there are just wanting to play the new content before others. And few are giving useful feedback and even less bug reports.
---
Your best bet here is to join some public teams, fast travel (for free) to the camps of the other players and hope one of them will have a decontamination shower.
---
Zealot‚Äôs Marine Armor. Very cool design from the Children of Atom in Far Harbor FO4. Wild love to see it in 76
---
Yeah, I don't mind checking new servers, but if we could reduce that by at least checking NEW servers each time, that'd be great.
---
I'd like a noticeboard, visible only to team members, where I could leave a note saying I'm desperate for 10mm ammo or whatever and people could leave whatever's appropriate. I always wanna gift people stuff but don't wanna just dump useless ammo or plans on them.
---
Also, /r/fallout76settlements is way more active.
---
Wow I‚Äôm glad I managed to kick that corpse eating habit then
---
I give some aid items, and a few bobby pins to every low level player I can catch.  Sometimes they are so skittish!
---
But if they ask for a gun or some ammo, why yes, I will make you some.  And you're probably getting a few dozen CAMP building plans that won't sell.
---
Now if you ask for my 3\* level 50 rifles?  No, just no.  I am walking around with those because  I use them.
---
I would like more then one robot in my camp. I don‚Äôt need two resource collector just a few robots buddies
---
It must have been that. Those team beacons are bigger. But I popped over a couple of times when there was a cluster and no event. I caught one at the tail end.
---
No. Nothing you do in the PTS transfers over to your standard character. 
---
Your PTS character is a clone, trapped in an alternate reality. Anything your PTS Clone does has no effect on the original, and nothing your original does has an effect on the PTS Clone.
---
this, sir, is my nightmare as a non 1st player :D
---
Here, this is what I was talking about: https://twitter.com/TheRealKRAEFTIG/status/1273589833319854081
---
They may have fixed it since June, admittedly I don't really play my rifleman character much anymore.
---
What even are good damage numbers on him? I have a ultracite gatling laser, no specials builds and it just hits him for 1 dmg, 2 at the weak spot when I can hit em. Even with other people around I end up pulling more aggro so it's confusing to me. I feel like I'm doing shit damage, but I'm pulling aggro. Wut.
---
Because the game knew that‚Äôs where you really wanted to go.
---
You'll get the rewards regardless, bethrsda would t let you fail
---
That‚Äôs what video games are.
---
I usually have about 15 to 20 minutes worth of work around the camp when I'm done for a bit. Scrap what I've found, make food for the next days adventure, craft ammo, collect from my resources, etc.  I do that all at the end.  
---
So, why am I gonna log off when I'm not done just because this guy had is Mic on and decided to take a personal call at my camp?  
---
I wasn't done after he'd left, I was still on about 10 minutes after.
---
He's bloodied, of course.
---
Happens to me a lot too, I went to join scorched earth and somehow wound up at a random players camp just today
---
OK thanks.
---
Don‚Äôt worry next season is chock full of armor paints according to the datamine. 
---
I just wish the outfit mask was a standalone mask
---
Welcome to the wasteland, Dweller. Expect a lot of friendliness, especially to a newer player. You can turn off pvp in the options so you don‚Äôt accidentally hit someone then get murdered by a guy 20x your level (the only exception bring workshops). 
---
I wish you well in your endeavors around Appalachia.
---
It‚Äôs only 120 pounds...
---
I just have a hard time throwing away cool stuff that a lower level player would enjoy. 
---
But these 3 sets of Level 30 T-51 Nuka-Cola Power Armors have just got to go!  Along with the all the level 15 Raider sets on pristine (sort of) condition.
---
What level do the mole rats max out at? Can only imagine being attacked by a group of level 50 mole rats
---
Dude open all of them. You'll get a ton of stuff inside you can use or scrap or sell. You got a super nice gift. Bethesda has only ever targeted the people doing the duping. And only if they're egregious offenders.
---
Wind drift.
---
Just... why?
---
Make it a Cursed weapon (to the boost the damage to make up for it being level 20 at max) and include it in the Mischief Night event loot pool. Vampires, Limb Damage, 90% Reduced Weight. Also throw in a Cursed Drill and give it an exclusive Wounding Effect with stacking bleed damage. 
---
It is time to make up for the sins of the past with these ridiculous non-max level weapons, and especially the drill for the further insult of the non legendary versions polluting the legendary drop pool for so long.
---
Hey what‚Äôs your psn I would love to join and do it
---
100% this. I really enjoyed creating and min-maxing all my alts as well as making completely different CAMPS for all of them, but after completing the entire questline on 2 alts, and having both grind gold and legendary modules daily I slowed down on the rest of the alts, and now I've given up the grind on one of my last 2 remaining alts and just use my level 250 main to try to get better rolls on my Secret Service armour. I've legit not logged back into my alts for months now and I miss them for sure. 
---
I'm crafting so many decent SS pieces which go to waste. If sharing SS pieces between alts was a thing I'd 100% go through the questline on all alts eventually so I could buy the plans, and share pieces that my main crafts. 
---
PS: I've seen a few people say that they've deleted and started a new alt just for levelling up SCORE. I've personally not found the need to do this at all tbh. I've found that a full Unyielding set with XP buffs + Lunchboxes + high intelligence (50+ Intelligence) levels up SCORE so damn fast and easy even on a higher level character.
---
You're putting yourself at an unfair advantage by not crouching and therefore exposing your location to us PvPers. üòÇ
---
Also on PC, please!
---
Oh no
---
Cool! Thanks for the info. Glad they went with a bat cuz the others kinda make my skin crawl.
---
hey, how did u get to stack psychotats and calmex?
---
What do you play on? I might be able to help you out
---
I have a crush on Earl. 
---
Sorry, typo. I had a crash.
---
Bugged weapons that do a crap ton of dmg pretty much
---
Only certain effects active the bug... Angry Turtle youtuber has an in-depth guide of different stats that trigger the bug.. theres a few of them
---
Did they finally fix adrenaline?
---
Kinda baffles the mind that this is even a thing... When implementing a feature to "Find a new server", one would think there would be a parameter to, I don't know, find a *new* server? Don't know anything about programming but it seems like quite the oversight.
---
I take workshops for PvP for score and in hopes that I'll get some godforsaken PvP from you pathetic foodbuilds.
---
Dont care about the text part just the constant sound it makes when people buy from your vendors.  Especially when someone buys 1 item at a time. No need for the sound or text, dont need to know when someone buys, like their name, what they bought and how much they bought. Just give me my caps, quietly. Not immersive, in the middle of a scorched beast fight hearing that someone bought 100 ammo.
---
They keep making bosses immune to it.
---
Awesome. Just wish I didn't have to take a drop in damage for it. Guess it's either a bit more damage or unlimited range! Thanks.
---
So guess no vendors at my camp again till this becomes a thing
---
This right here is the kind of shit I like
---
Workshops are the slowest way to get resources.
---
It seems to be a lot more common lately. I think it's an extra Todd tax.
---
Didnt get the Tenderizer plan, so hoping I can get it in September
---
That's actually the one I'm a member of. I forgot everything that can be abbreviated on Reddit has already been abbreviated. LOL
---
Events like Manhunt or Line in the Sand.
---
Since you didn't say how, it's from Monster Mash candy rewards. Neither is useful enough to spend that amount of time hoping for one though. You're still at the mercy of rng.
---
I‚Äôm guessing Xbox?
---
Yea thanks I sorta forgot what the name was
---
*I hate you so very,* **very** *much...*
---
People were still bitching at me when I was farming people on my level 30 character with nothing but a bare bones basic set of assassin's sentinel and a level 15 instigating handmade.
---
Sorry...
---
I forgot flair
---
So true
---
Sorry all gone now
---
They don't actually stack. I was still learning how buffs work and Calmex was never working with Psychotats, I just hadn't bothered to pay enough attention to my stats. Overdrive and Psychotats seem to work fine together though
---
Did you try a hard reset
---
You can join the event by joining the team or someone in the mine. This is the easiest way, by far, and lets you farm ACP more than once per nuke if there are multiple instances.
---
The event ! marker only lasts very briefly after nuke launch.
---
I had a similar experience yesterday, only one other player showed up and they quit after several quick deaths. I kept in stealth, moved around often and basically just kept at it. Wasn‚Äôt quick or pretty, had to repair my gun twice, but didn‚Äôt die once and only panicked when I once again forgot where the exit was at. Stealth is the way to go in there, it was a very chaotic shooting gallery and a lot of fun.
---
Yes. Be ready to fight for and defend your shit. This game isn't supposed to be easy and hand you everything for free.
---
Directly to the location
---
It‚Äôs actually not that far off I‚Äôm from Boston. It‚Äôs definitely exaggerated in a few characters like Parker Quinn but it‚Äôs not that bad.
---
Ok I‚Äôm joining thanks for the shout!
---
I aim to please.
---
Someone give this dude an award for "hot plasma in your ass." üòÇ
---
I just do it as a flex.
---
Yep....check out my 6 fusion generators and 8 decontamination arches.... I got mad resources.
---
The ladies love it and can't get enough.  LMFAO.
---
this won't help storing more items in the stash, but will increase the effective amount of stuff you can have.  
---
Under strength, get travelling pharmacy and bandolier.  Under intelligence get batteries included.  Under agility, get through hiker.  When they are maxed out they reduce the weight of chems, regular ammo, energy ammo, and food &amp; drink by 90%.  Then you carry all the chems, ammo, and food with you, unless you are trying to sell it.  
---
I know you'll also see pack rat under strength, but that is less useful, as you do NOT want to carry all your junk around with you.  Whenever you die, any items in the "junk" tab in your inventory are removed and put in a death bag out in the world.  Most of the time you can go back and get it, but sometimes you die in places you cannot get back to.  Junk is safest in the stash.
---
Somehow, your username and being from Boston make perfect sense.   I would like to hear a limerick, though.
---
I'm in the same boat and agree completely! I'm amazed at the generosity, it's been great! 
---
I'm level 25 now and have begun gifting out stuff to very low level characters. I'm still building up myself and have a ways to go so I've not been able to gift anything major but I hope it made a difference! 
---
I also get shocked when anyone buys anything from my frankly poorly stocked vending machine, I assume it's just out of kindness!
---
Tldr: I've been very impressed by the community so far  ^_^
---
Have you actually bought everything?
---
What weapon are you using? Any particular strategy?
---
Do you have a link where I can see this confirmation you are talking about from a Bethesda employee.
---
I‚Äôve submitted a Bethesda support ticket. It may be something tied to 1st from what I‚Äôm seeing
---
Yeah buying for caps is nice.i play a hour or 2 a day and im usually at max caps.i end up gifting stuff away but the really good guns I have will stay in my stash until I'm ready to trade them away
---
That and ghouls are the biggest motherfucking jump scares. Oh and a WELL HELLO THERE from a previously unseen Mr. Handy.
---
Sinistrmark
---
NP,hopefully she has somethin for ya!
---
I think just giving us a small account stash to transfer items between characters would be world changing. If you need a lore justification, the team thing is perfect. Obviously my "team" is going to be willing to hand over weps and armor other members aren't capable of getting. If I have to finish the main quest for all of them fine. I don't want to do that, but if I could transfer my vanguard's off my bloodied to my full health I'd def do the quests on all characters to make that happen. I'll never grind rep again tho. Not a chance. 
---
For me it's hard to play characters that don't gain treasury notes from events and the like. I've completed wastelanders on 2 toons, I have 2 others that are just scrip mules now. I'd like to play them, but it seems wasteful not collecting notes.
---
I just want to place more than one bot in my camp.
---
Explosive heavy guns (not the legendary  effect) should have a good chance of staggering enemies close to the detonation and their damage should count for a bit more, especially for a direct hit.
---
Now this is a Cult I'd take part in. EFIL SI EPIP
---
You can purchase any of them from the soda shop in the whitesprings.
---
*back in my day, the stash was only 400. And we had to like it.*
---
I‚Äôd be happy if we could dismantle them for weightless ‚Äúscrip dollars‚Äù and turn those in. I‚Äôm fine with the current daily limit
---
Allow the Universe to guide you. Do not try to control the Universe.
---
I've seen it when stashing junk, it flicks back and forth between old and new weight a couple of times before settling.
---
She is so annoying that I put a hazmat suit on her so that I wouldnt have to see hee looks every time i come back from exploring. Talk about a healthy relationship... huh
---
Happened to me once. On the phone with doctor talkin bout deez nuts.
---
I read this from another person, so with the exception of the screws, springs, adhesive, lead, and aluminum (might be missing another one) I always keep all of my materials no more than 100 quantity. If it gets too much I bulk them and sell it. I'm only level 40 so maybe end game levels are different but for me I don't need 400 rubbers or gears, it's a waste to me.
---
Also be careful about your ammunition, missiles, nukes, and fusion cores will weigh you down (so use them when you can). You'll get the hang of it. It's kinda annoying cause I'm used to the other games with infinite stuff, but it makes it more realistic.
---
That damn lady...wish she had a mute button
---
My alt names will break your immersive experience, "Aid alt" "junk alt" "weapon alt"
---
Yeah, when it returns in Sept, just go and be there at least 2 minutes before the new hour.  Hop on drums or spits and that will give you time to spawn in and get the event started well.
---
So annoying when this happens
---
Lots of stuff has been canceled this year. No reason too add more stuff to the game that would undoubtedly break something else in the game.
---
That's not the Southern way though.  Sweet potato pie tastes similar to pumpkin,  and its "SWEET POTATO pie and I shut my mouth".  
---
Well Maybe that is for Fallout:  Alabama.
---
You don't actually want this. You just wanted to say "Brahmin Cowlossus" and got sick of waiting for an oppurtunity.
---
yea, i know about overdrive and psycho.  man i burned alot of calmex trying to figure out the combo i had to come back and ask lol.
---
Goin too cook dinner,so she‚Äôll be live until I time out...
---
Good job man
---
Oh lol the username is a quote from the Witcher 3.   
---
Lambert, Lambert, what a prick.
---
Are you...are you fucking kidding me...are you that fucking stupid... I mean really?  I literally supplied the link to the free lance artist who worked for Bethesda on this. You can clearly see it was based on her original vulture bird design before being swapped and that it is an early model pinned up.   
---
Shit use the search tool and go read the Q&amp;A in 2018 they answered the question there also.
---
Thanks! I was surprised to say the least!
---
So it is like playing a game in real life...   This is some Inception level shit...
---
Or just be a single, giant blue one. Babe the blue brahmin.
---
I have lived those times oh my
---
Yeah my two shot missile launcher breaks crazy fast
---
Yes?
---
Thank you.  I thought I was going to have to spend a few thousand atoms.  I'm happy that I don't have to.
---
I did a quick repair behind the pillar only to come out of my pipboy with him in my face, it was a panic moment for sure! Glad it worked for you too!
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, HE DID IT!!
---
If I read ur rant properly, u r complaining that, if u die at the end of the event u spawn outside instead of back inside? Well...the event is over....it has no choice but to spawn u back outside...and if it did spawn u back inside, u wont have enough time to get back to the body anyways....and they do give u about 2 minutes to loot before cave in
---
Lol, this is amazing! Have had any great reactions you should share?
---
The smallest water purifier doesn't need to be in water but it doesn't make too much water.
---
God I hope so.
---
it is forbidden knowledge you get the quest by listening to a holo tape at camp venture
---
That would be a nice April fool's event
---
True, but the unlimited carry weight glitch that carried over from Fallout 4 was alive and well :)
---
if you turn 1 in it will flag them all as used even if they are in your stash
---
I bought the lvl 98 hehe
---
I can see it now, introducing "Fallout 1st Platinum". Matter of time.
---
I got it figured out one of the bypasses worked
---
That's nice and all...but gold bullion doesnt make them 12$ a month.....its call "Capitalism"....America is famous for it
---
*Zorbo is up to bat the score is 2 to 1 and it's the bottom of the ninth.  A strike, a ball, another ball, a second strike, and he's outta here!  That's the game*  Captain Cosmos: 2 Zorbo: 1*
---
Only if the community can add new insults to it over time.
---
So wait, who's butthurt here again? üòÜ
---
Indeed. Durability is terrible.
---
I'll never forget just wandering around the wasteland while ignoring the main quest and finding vault 112 naturally. Little did I know it would be a part of the main quest but it was neat to be able to skip some quests.
---
Just encountered this bug as well. The settler variant also has a similar dialogue bug that is a total downer (just did that a week ago on the other character). My raider character had already done the Steel Mill section of the quest and Gail had said that I was nice to Ra-Ra, etc. So I just rage quit after I got to the part with Ra-Ra and the Slug Buster door because I wasn‚Äôt Ra-Ra‚Äôs best friend suddenly. 
---
I‚Äôm a little bit pissed. I‚Äôve been waiting on this character since the last update broke the quest line (seems it was hotfixed enough to continue progression), and this is my main character who just wants to start earning gold bullion. 
---
Does Bethesda give items that players are supposed to have?
---
Also Pickett's Fort
---
Lmao it literally says that claiming the workshop opens you up to PvP. Lesson learned, foodie?
---
Dang. I would've given you one. Good luck, man.
---
94, 76 and the Whitespring Bunker. 3 in 2 years
---
Lol they won't. Turrets neither.
---
I love massive junk hauls like that. I switch servers and throw that shit in the scrapbox.
---
Fallout 3 had hostile brahmin, it would not be the first time Bessie has gone rogue...
---
I‚Äôm happy because they don‚Äôt spoil
---
I'm on it as much as I am here, I'm a friend for cliff builds.
---
Lmao üòÇ
---
This poster gets laid on the daily, ladies and gentlemen.
---
Atlas is looking like it's going to be a proper bos settlement. I just wonder how they're going to come to  Appalachia. By vertibird or some other instance.
---
Good job.  I completed the run yesterday.  Now i can relax
---
Heavy guns are cumbersome, perhaps go for shotguns? Gauss shotguns are great for damage and range. A Junkies , Vampires or Anti armour would be great. Why nerd rage if you want high health?
---
I‚Äôm hoping the backpack drops this round if it is still in the loot pool.
---
This is a console limitation. Not fallout 76.
---
Console only allows so much data to be attributed to screenshots within the games folder to prevent one game from taking up all of your storage.
---
You could always take a normal screenshot.
---
I think the issue with the Vaults being raids lies in the fact that this is totally uncharted territory for the franchise and it's trying to straddle being an MMO, where raids are a staple, as well as a Fallout game, where (if we're being honest) the most unique and fun content are basically just glorified dungeons. It was an obvious move to make those the raids, even if it was poorly thought out and implemented.
---
I agree and I try to do the same
---
That would be about two hours ago, honey.
---
That's like saying withdrawl from an addiction is relaxing.  What am I supposed to do for 12 hours a day without fallout?
---
GARY!?
---
More like in FO4 when you take an existing character and then start a modded game with that character, but set it in a different save file.  
---
You keep the original for legit playing (like for Achievements), and use the modded version to battle **Thomas the Tank Engine** while running around in **Iron Man** power armor, with your buddy **Danse Lightyear** riding an **Imperial Speeder Bike**.
---
maybe after you die for the 15th time! stop dieing
---
Well it really looks like devs wants us to log in more, not to actually play more. Without limits for scrip and legendary rolls people will hunt for legendary items much more, which means more people participating in events, more nukes launched, more encrypted started, even more vending machines visited looking for cheap legendaries to make more tries. This will give people a reason to actually play, not just to log in to get those 150 scrip, 1400 caps and 200 bullion, spending 10 minutes a day in game.
---
Its really the first time it happened to me. The servers where almost completely empty, not even a single public team...   
---
Quite a reminder...
---
I think it‚Äôs random I‚Äôve seen between 50-500 caps
---
A real hep fat.
---
Right like I‚Äôm just tryna get some caps not even really worried about the legendary but that would be nice to get to
---
Someone dropped 10 of them in an event and I picked them up and fast traveled before I realized they were for someone else.  I would give them back but I don't know who to give them to. :(
---
No problem man, most of us are always happy to help :]
---
I realized I left my mic unmuted after playing another game with some friends, but I only use my headset/mic for other games. I just use ear buds and listen to youtube while playing fo76.
---
I saw someone leave my party.. then realized the mic icon was there. I felt bad cause if my mic was on it would be a constant fan noise from my fan cause it was hot as hell that day.
---
I also feel bad when people use their mic at me. Since I'm usually listening to youtube videos I don't actually hear what they are saying.
---
You mean r&amp;g station? Or is there another vendor there?
---
I mean, talk about poor decisions...
---
I got a be15 dragon from meat week, that's the power of trade
---
It‚Äôs a tough, crappy lesson to learn.
---
I was carrying 125 lbs of scrap the other day (including 20+ stable flux) because it wouldn‚Äôt fit into my stash and I was mostly grinding meat week (a totally safe event).
---
I decided to jump down to an encrypted event and arrived before the beacons acquired their target. The imposter got melted in three seconds. I never even saw where it was or where it was killed.  Turns out, it died right below my perch on the house.  The explosion killed me.  Because the event had already ended, I dropped my junk bag.  By the time I respawned and ran back, the only thing left was some cloth and some leather.
---
I never take junk bags following an event unless everyone else has long gone. But not everyone plays the same way.
---
Lesson learned.
---
Swear we all have that exact same CAMP spot hahaha, it's great
---
Borderlands games are amazing
---
I thought this was common knowledge? Idk I‚Äôm usually at work so I don‚Äôt have to deal with this.
---
Learning plans should be account wide. It would make the game more fun without negatively affecting the grind.
---
Me, too! They're always so cool!
---
I did a recreation of the player house in FO3. It's basically the perfect house. Room for everything.
---
I tried to do the house from Sanctuary in FO4 but JFC that roof. T_T I mean, I did it, but WOW did it suck. LOL
---
Thanks :)
---
Major buzzkills when you find a vault only to be told "You can't open this, you're not allowed". I wouldn't mind a quest where a vault opens up and we try to introduce them to the wasteland proper, or help them survive their experiment so they can live normal(ish) lives.
---
It's why I enjoyed that 1 vault in FO4 where it's just a bunch of people trying to survive and keep their home together. It presented the other side of vaults where it's not some tragic or horrifying end, just a peaceful attempt at trying to survive each day in a grim new world.
---
No imagine if it were like Witcher 3, where if Geralt slaughters a bunch of cows, the Bovine God will spawn in to stop him.
---
No one ever said Bethesda has good voice actors
---
üòÇ Zing!
---
Dungeons
---
I understand that they are a business but players without fallout first probably spend more time managing their inventory than they spend actually playing the game
---
I meeeeeeeaaaaaaan that's pretty funny if we're being candid here. 
---
"Welp, I'm here in a public workshop where I could get smoked at any moment. Guess I better pull every bit of junk out of my stash to see how much it weighs for some reason."
---
Honestly, owning yourself so completely and thoroughly isn't actually the silliest thing I've seen someone do. Now, owning yourself like that and then getting on reddit like folks are supposed to feel sorry for you, THAT'S the silliest thing I've seen someone do.
---
If they delay daily ops I‚Äôm definitely taking a break
---
Rooftop of West Tek has a guaranteed perfectly preserved pie just sitting there
---
Has camp budget ever been increased or optimized?

The last event I just did say 10 minutes ago had 9 minutes left on the event timer and I died and respawned in the inside and was going to jump back down the hole to get down there the wendigo colossus just died the hope collapsed on me literally 10 seconds after it died and the first time it happened I died has a 20 second respawn timer it respawned me outside while other people were still in there I understand it how your not supposed to be in there after the event but atleast give us some time to loot say if we‚Äôre waiting to respawn when it dies like don‚Äôt just automatically spawn me out there kinda make it like load baring event or whatever that‚Äôs ones called I‚Äôm bad at wording things but I hope u get what I‚Äôm saying
---
Got a problem with it?    
---
I'm sure you would want Socialists in charge. B/c some people bad life choices you are forced to give them some of your stuff to make things 'fair'.
---
Pc, I did get out of the situation, but it would be nice to have someone to play with
---
Mine still doesn‚Äôt work
---
I was doing the Scoot quest yesterday(finally).. by the 2nd note I knew I had a wendigo problem coming up. Got dang wendigos!
---
That's the real reason why the Fallout 1st tent exists. Robbing players at workshops.
---
It‚Äôs ok. That‚Äôs probably his one rng moment. He‚Äôll never get god rolled bloodied gauss mini gun after this score.
---
Chinese stealth armour, sneak 3 and Lightfoot. I get into a Scorchbeast buttcrack without it noticing.
---
I would be down with that
---
Absolute facts!
---
Plus wasteland whisperer and animal friendly if you want to pacify. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

First time meeting Grahm, was about level 15. Was playing with a friend who was vastly more experienced with the game and had a level 100+ character on Xbox before moving over to PC. He mentioned offhand about 20 minutes earlier that where we were headed was a place where he often found scorched beasts. We didn't think much of it, but lo and behold one spawned and harassed us. We had accepted it had the better of us, until Grahm and Chally turned up. Kept it occupied long enough for us to run off like little children. Class from Grahm and Chally, big respect
---
In the future I intend to create an alt and explore Appalachia without carrying any aid and using only what I find during the walk and carrying only what I think is physically possible... I know that will be challenging, but it will be very fun at times. Not using Vats seems like a good idea too.
---
Damn you Stanislaus Braun
---
I‚Äôm okay with it not being Sofia. What I think would be really cool is if one or a few of the women from the Order of Mysteries went into hiding back then, and now ~25 ish years later, they come back to rebuild it. That makes sense, right? It would be so awesome to run quests for the Order of Mysteries.
---
The raider collection is pretty rude to me üòÇ the best we can do for now
---
I was wrong, it is still on the drop table.
---
I just rolled a bloodied, 10% aiming Gauss minigun. I‚Äôm sure this will probably hit harder than my shotgun. Thanks for the tips.
---
I definitely would if I was playing that character. Immersion is something that I take seriously, I enjoy the access that games give to allow you to submerge yourself into a role and enjoy the reactions that you get from that role.
---
I've been trying to decide which crops are neccessary. Corn and maybe blackberries.
---
Tbh I've had this problem on/off since February.
---
This one time at band camp...
---
Yet another game everyone tells me I need to play, but haven‚Äôt gotten around to
---
Hell yeah, that‚Äôs an awesome roll! You‚Äôll definitely feel that difference
---
Better idea: Make the Tent and Scrapbox available to all players and make FO 1st more about Private World benefits like persistent workshops and larger camp budgets. You know, like they said they would.
---
I don't want them to continue to invest in this game.  It only means it will be THAT much longer before they make an actual Fallout game again, and not this abomination.  If you continue giving them money when they make Fallout skins for other game genres they'll continue making bad games with Fallout skins on them.
---
I think it should get massive horns like the cows have in Africa.
---
Doubt you lost the vault tec supply crates, they remain in your inventory through death, the lunch boxes are listed as aid, repair kits, and scrap kits are listed as misc, so you didn't lose any of those. There aren't any other legendary run rewards that are classified as junk. So you really only lost your base junk items/scrap that you pulled out of your stash.
---
Well i focused on dailies for scrip.  Got that sweet 50% sale in 2 weeks
---
But they don‚Äôt.
---
Just had to work around the issue with a friend. He went to his private, I joined. He was able to add me from the recent tab. Then we both restarted the app and viola. Finally on a team üòπüòπüòπ Ridiculous
---
I'll add you, my GT is R4VENexe
---
No this is a new issue that is plaguing a lot of people today where the friends list can‚Äôt sync
---
He showed up during Cranberry Bog Primal Cuts for my teammate. Survived the event... only to be shot by my teammate üòÇ
---
Do you mean Swan, the super mutant behemoth in Boston Common?
---
The scrip limit sucks though
---
...like I said, been having said issue for a long ass time.
---
Same deal with flamers, especially explosive ones. The burn damage they apply takes away durability, and the mods take away a ton as well. I have a legacy flamer I love using, but it breaks after every 100 shots
---
Is it 1*? If it is then it‚Äôs not a legacy
---
Lot of people don't realize that certain camp items are not necessary and more convenience.  There are many camps in the world that have all you need as a crafting station and many have a stash box there too.  White springs Bunker, White Springs resort, foundation, space station.  When I design camps now I stick to decor and looks, instead of function because of that and saves some on budget.  However, that is just a personal preference.  I understand many like having those things at home.  I'm constantly breaking down my camp and rebuilding it at least every couple months, lol.
---
It's not explosive. üòÅ
---
Do you mean for scrapping?
---
I've done that when super overloaded at some far off location. "Ok, the nearest vendor is there. BUT, someone has a camp here. Get to walking and resting every couple of minutes." only to reach the player camp just as it vanishes like a mirage.
---
Now that is Mooove in the right direction
---
Oh Thanks for the info.
---
It‚Äôs not a machine it‚Äôs just a pie on a plate
---
Actually it goes to 60 after 3 deaths. It is a little steep but yes just gotta learn to not die.
---
I keep getting black screen when trying to join friends
---
I put about 2500 ultracite plasma rounds in to him amongst 8 other lvl 200+ players and it still took like 10 mins to take him down
---
Right they don‚Äôt. Instead of adding a food that does this, just improve berry mentats.
---
Sorry dude, but they're whack compared to Cowlossus üòÇ
---
Directly copied from an email from Bethesda
---
‚ÄúFirst, we recommend that you attempt to exit the game entirely and restart it. If that does not resolve it, please proceed to the troubleshooting steps below: 
---
Ensure that your ports are accurately opened
---
These are the required ports for Fallout 76:
---
TCP: 80
---
TCP: 443
---
UDP: 3000-3010
---
For exact directions on port forwarding your router, please refer to your router's manual or website.
---
Bethesda.net Only
---
If you are not able to add a friend as they do not appear and you know they are online, have both of you exit the game and come back online. Alternately, have a third player add you and your friend to their friend list and then add you to the same group. From there, add your friend to your friend list.‚Äù
---
Not sure why Bethesda would care about the flux cost of a legacy. Especially since Bethesda doesn‚Äôt like the idea of non cap trading in the first place. However, below is a solution to your problem that isn‚Äôt so impossible and doesn‚Äôt require petitioning Bethesda for a change in the game on a sub that Bethesda doesn‚Äôt really read. 
---
For starters, open up some new characters and drop the flux onto them. Congrats you now have 3200lbs of additional stash space. This the only way to do store this much. Even if Bethesda expanded stash space they are not going to give you the 750-1000 lbs of space you need to buy a legacy for flux (75-100k caps for legacy / 100 caps per violet flux * 1lb per flux). Now grind that flux til the end of time and hope the legacy is still available by then.
---
Oh dude it‚Äôs sooooo good.
---
Today's inside the vault definitely made it sound like next month.
---
There are a lot of really nice people that go out of their way to help people. It's been a refreshing change and a lot less of a toxic environment as many of the other multiplayer games I've played. Glad to hear you are enjoying so far. Remember to pass on the love once you get up there in levels.
---
I have personally been doing a lot of photography lately, mostly getting shots of my power armors and costumes, but the big thing for me is going to places that are not often seen and doing photos there.   
---
If you are going to include your character in photos be prepared to open and close photo mode a lot, rotate the camera around, see if you can get a good angle on things where they line up. Rotate the camera and see if things look more interesting, change poses and filters, sometimes they can really enhance a shot.   
---
If you intend to do wildlife shots stay at a distance and find the enemy pathing routes, know where they might go and then note the surroundings, a shot from one angle might not look impressive, but from another you might get something eye catching in the background. Keep an eye out for glitched mobs, sometimes they offer the best photo you can get of some enemies, or just fascinating images, like a wendigo you took the head off of that is not standing in an idle animation.  
---
Do not be afraid to play around with the depth of field, sometimes turning it off can make an image too busy, letting things go hazy further back can keep focus in the front of the image.   
---
Move the camera around a lot, move up and down a lot, some items look better from other angles, sometimes a head on shot does not look as good. Also remember the rule of thirds. Imagine the image is broken up into 9 equal boxes, try and line things up along those lines to make things look more visually appealing. Remember leading lines, major lines can guide your view along an image as well.
---
Unfortunately I'm on Xbox
---
I actually secured an insane trade on it today so now the grind to get another one begins lmao
---
If enemies scale to you do you get less XP if you're a low level?
---
Oof, well good travels!
---
And it needs another dynamic. It‚Äôs just a bullet sponge event. There should be alternate tasks to accomplish like in the vault raids. Teamwork should be rewarded, while maybe not required for event completion.
---
The ash/goo piles thing is so bad I had one dude come down with me and my two friends with a Tesla rifle and single handily almost crash our games and Ive never had that much lag in my entire time of playing 76 I was running like 1 frame for the whole year
---
Hopefully I missed out when they were open
---
Neither do Fasnacht donuts which are arguably easier to get hold of in bulk :)
---
I couldn't believe it! Maybe they were just equally grateful because I had the Chally mask priced at 500 caps in my own shop. I did ALL the dances and emotes and jumped ALL the ways to show my appreciation!
---
Similar experience to yours.  There was an old nuke on the mine.  Someone launched a nuke for SBQ and both events popped.  I decided to go to Colossal Problem even though no one else was showing.
---
Took me longer than 5 minutes.  Maybe 12 minutes all in.  Wasn't worried too much about the adds, just found a quiet corner.  He never feared.
---
1200 .45 and 1200 556 rounds later and he's dead and I've got a new gas mask.  I sold at the vendor and traveled to the Bog and missed by seconds being able to tag the Queen.
---
So far you are the only one reached out for the 8 PM EST run I'd love to show you the steps and do the event! I'll post a comment again for visibility, the more the merrier!
---
I experienced this when 4 dudes spammed Tesla‚Äôs at him and he kinda of rotates on one point and flew into the roof
---
Could have it that at the end of free range if all 3 brahmin are alive after killing the sheepsquatch they walk over and start eating it for no reason then they start mutating into the secret cowlossus!!!
---
I also have no time to play and enjoy the game since I have spent all my time managing my stash
---
When I started the game recently I was doing some research and was like "Aw man, I gotta get that mask!" after getting the mask I was kinda confused why it wasn't legendary, till further research.  Oh well, free mask. Shame no hats work with it.
---
My first edit was exploding plasma but I thought of the children.
---
Quad and Double don't have any impact on durability as they only affect how many bullets (or whatever type of ammo) a gun holds, not how many they shoot.
---
This event is a joke , let the the low lvl have their fun
---
Wait is she an ally?
---
Sounds about right.  Communism and Socialism is about having a small group of upper class and then there is everyone else.  So why shouldn't the Red Shift series be premium while the Communist armor skins in Season 2 be free since that is Communism?
---
To be fair we have been inside most of the vaults. We just can‚Äôt return after.
---
I can hop in and launch the nuke for you if you'd like.  Just to say thank you for helping others.
---
Berry Mentats should *in theory* work on corpses up to 12 hours old, as skin, bone, and tendon tissue can all survive 8-12 hours after somebody is clinically dead. But in practice we kill shit so hard pretty much nothing survives ever.
---
Oh I'm sure, it's literally the only benefit of pvp, picking up the scraps from food builds who will just collect more. Why bother though? To build a food castle? To trade for nukas for your drink build? oO
---
At least some "pvpers" have a YT channel that people actually watch...
---
The first time I wandered into Dyer Chemical plant to explore, only to get my ass handed to me by Gutsies and Robobrains. Along came Grahm and Chally and he really helped stay alive.
---
Glad to see he's doing better after getting stuck inside a tree at the Halloween March in Whitesprings though, I was definitely worried about him for awhile.
---
I was thinking the event could be started by Bessie, but I like your idea better.
---
The stuff of nightmares right there. I hate ants.
---
! THIS !
---
Reading the paragraph reminded of "Yadda yadda yadda" from Seinfeld. 
---
"You yadda yadda'd over the corpse eating!"
---
We have our issues but still one of the best communities out there!
---
I just flat out told her the truth and showed her pictures. Lmao
---
Mags, actually. ;) Short for Maggie.
---
AFKers are becoming a problem. Especially since the area above the mineshaft (where the workbenches are) is completely safe from enemies and there's no penalty for lingering there forever.
---
If people AFK at the SBQ fight, they get nothing. Nothing from the body, and nothing from the event itself. So I don't know why ACP isn't designed the same way.
---
Considering the rewards and drop rates for the good stuff were appalling I think I only participated for a couple of sessions and stopped because feeling like a complete arsehole just wasnt worth it. At least make them hostile or put up a fight. By rights you would expect them to want to guard their treasure. Not run away screaming in fear
---
Me too, she deserved to know what happened to her father
---
Ferb I know what were gonna do tommorw
---
Yeah but remember, the vault raids flopped because they were *too* tedious with random tasks.
---
Why are you in this sub? Are you in this sub to complain? Are you in the sub for Fallout Tactics to complain? This is the Fallout 76 sub.
---
I recommend modding fallout 4 or NV with the mods that give extra story. And replay those games. Add some positivity to your life. And ours. 
---
And then we can enjoy this dumpster fire of a wannabe-Fallout-MMO without you.
---
Stop wasting your time in this sub. Your time is worth more.
---
Ah yes, rule of thirds. Learned this method from art classes. Thnx for your time m8
---
All i hear is crying like a b+√óch , its a game if you dont like it play another game
---
I held off on somewhere to build until something jumped out at me from questing. The Mistress of Mysteries quest is my favourite in the game, so I built on the cliff it finishes on, great location. I really wanted to build down off the cliff but it's a real pain so I just built a huge barn instead
---
Odds are, you're wearing weight reduction gear (armors/backpack), yes? In PA, you lose those benefits
---
I mean I know it's going to sound cheesy but best thing you can do is if you see a beginner give them some stims and ammo, spread the help :) We will do the whole process without using glitches so I do not really wanna waste your time. You are more than welcome to join if you want!
---
Are you wearing non-power armor too? Cause it unequips when you get into power armor
---
Love the sense of community here honestly. By the way anyone one PS4 that has cryo rounds they don‚Äôt want to leggo cryolators let me know please they are my obsession
---
Same, on and off since launch
---
Wowww I feel dumb lol thanks cause I checked my armor and not my backpack my weight was still good without any armor on but when I took off my backpack weighed over 200 pounds more I have the chemist mod
---
No problem, I wish you the best with your photography.
---
Left hand or right?
---
So edgy
---
Yea I just figured out it was my backpack that reduces aid weight now I gotta figure out the best way to sort that üòÇ
---
I already have a full set of bobble heads and my favorite looking magazines ready to display. A full display takes a sizable chunk
---
The glow‚Ä¶the wonderful glow!
---
I definitely do when I can.   I did send you a FR and can come along to help at 8 if the group isn't full.  Won't be a waste of my time... I just like launching nukes.
---
I do agree that would be nice too but I imagine it's less of a Bethesda thing and more of a console platform issue.
---
Aggro is funky. It's not super clear exactly how it works. If you demanded a guess on how it works and why you're locking aggro, which I also see happen a lot with heavy guns especially UGL, my guess would be that threat is calculated by damage taken before DR/ER is applied. This could explain how a low damage high RPM weapon is able to grab it and hold onto it despite not doing much actual damage to the health bar. There is probably also a modifier on that number related to your stealth visibility.
---
Good damage per hit depends on the weapon. My damage in the pipboy sheet is around 150 with the UGL. I use a psychotats and sometimes a bobblehead on top of that.
---
Because of Earle's high DR/ER, and what we can only assume is a blanketed flat % reduction similar to what the SBQ has, you're going to do really low damage regardless of what you use.
---
However, with a heavy gun, if you want to do maximum damage per shot you're going to need to run all damage increase perks, stabilized, and then some kind of damage boosting legendary effect like Junkie, Furious, or Bloodied. Bloodied is the strongest percentage. AA perk won't be as effective as one might hope for because it (and stabilized) won't contribute to getting over the percentage damage reduction, to my knowledge it reduces the damage by X percent first, and then applies DR/ER to what's left. Your best bet is to have the base damage as high as possible so that the number applied to DR/ER is that much higher.
---
As you can see in the video I linked, when bloodied reaches its peak I'm only doing headshots of about 20 damage. So I would probably say a headshot of 10 damage is pretty good, but not great. 20-22 is probably as high as you can get with a UGL.
---
I think you meant the "Mad Cowlossus"
---
Or even a 1 to 5 star rating system at the very least.
---
If you don‚Äôt learn the plans for many weapons they won‚Äôt been in the pool of weapons that can drop from the purveyor. This doesn‚Äôt apply to all weapons and I can‚Äôt tell you which ones it is necessary to learn the plans of but my advice is don‚Äôt learn a weapon plan if you don‚Äôt want Murmurgh to give it to you.
---
Not bad dude. Need to see/read the traits on each but there's some great weapons there if you're newish regardless of trait. Even for scrip value too.
---
Edit I mess about with a Quad handmade in overland looting as it's like 80+ rounds to a clip. Never reload during a trash fight.
---
Same but I think it would be cool. Just walking through ant tunnels and fighting massive ants until you get to the ant queen room
---
It always cracks me up when I do Encryptid and I see that "Yasmeen McGillicuddy" is a conduit.
---
&gt;And as we know, we can‚Äôt share stash space (I have god rolls getting dusty)
---
Now now! We can‚Äôt be having that! Either myself or somebody else may have a use for said god rolls.
---
I would go onto fed76.com and see about what it's worth to the PC market. Keep in mind that what they say is like top dollar for someone looking for exactly that weapon or armor. So if it says it's worth 1000 I usually sell it for half of that or so. But he'll throw it in a vendor if you're never gonna use it and get some caps out of it. Nice find!
---
same here.
---
This is why I quickly quit gathering rifle items, ammo and builds. 90% of the rifles, fully modded, weigh me more down than a Minigun or Missle Launcher. Like... wat. Unless you're going for bloodied/stealthy sniper builds, there's no reason to waste stash space on rifles. Might as well go heavy guns build
---
Yeah, that‚Äôd be a boss that would truly scare me. I like being scared so I‚Äôm all for it :)
---
That's what I thought, but not what I've been seeing. I have a QE Pump and a BE Pump. The QE breaks horribly fast.
---
Given their proximity to one another I'm hopeful for conflict between the Mothman Cultists and Free Radicals, similar to Foundation's settlers and Crater's raiders.
---
On the plus side you have plenty of stash space now?
---
I did not realize there was such a hate for Sofia on this sub.
---
And that's the point...its either not pay and suffer or pay and not suffer
---
OP you please thank you for making my evening
---
Yeah this annoys me quite a lot, whats the point in naming our chars if no one else see's it, if I had know before I would just call them 1,2,3,4,etc, but at least hackers can see your account name might make their lives a little easier....
---
Oof.  Did someone mention it to you? Or did you just realize?
---
I needed to drop a bunch of stuff.  I easily get enough legendaries to scrip, so I dropped a bunch.
---
And here I am with hoping to see a "Sluurmp"
---
You got some nice stuff there, the junkies stuff is all high value, as is the ts tesla.  Without seeing what the other legendary effects are, I couldn‚Äôt give you an amount, but I have a feeling that at least one of those is ‚Äòmagic‚Äô.     Assuming that isn‚Äôt the case, I still wouldn‚Äôt part with any of those for less than 7500 on the low end.
---
That being said, I‚Äôll give you 10k for the minigun.
---
Score daily quest.
---
One of the daily challenges is to buy or sell to a player 3x. Easiest way to is buy 3 ammo, 1 at a time, at a vendor.
---
There's a daily SCORE task to buy 3 things from a player vendor. Buying 3 bullets individually counts for this
---
Probably a daily challenge to buy/sell 3 items from other players.
---
Daily challenges for the legendary score often include ‚Äúbuy or sell 3 items from another player vendor‚Äù 1 round of ammo = 1 item
---
T-45 PA w/ Emergency Protocalls, Bloodied FF Limb Gatling, pumpkin grenades, with a min/max PA build 
---
Kept hiding under the entrance and spamming my gun at his face
---
Lol...wrong tree dude...ur telling me as if I said something was wrong with it...lol
---
The daily challenge of buy/sell to other players 3 times.
---
So they buy 3 bullets one at a time.
---
Daily quests for the legendary run require you to buy 3 items from another player or sell them to a player. 
---
One of each bullet fits the criteria and only costs 3 caps and can be done in a couple seconds. That's it.
---
username checks out
---
We‚Äôre gonna crush this goal tenfold
---
you can report bad user names, and they have to change it, if they persist with shitty names they get banned.....supposedly.
---
All there are still issues with it, like resistances don‚Äôt seem to scale up.
---
A slow death. Gotta keep em working those miner jobs
---
Kept hiding under the entrance and spamming my gun at his face 
---
Also used lone survivor for the 20% damage threshold
---
How about fixing things before releasing paid skins and unique gimmick versions of them?
---
Right, but I like them as loading screens. That‚Äôs a bummer to hear there‚Äôs no way to expand it.
---
Traveling pharmacy
---
They should call is ‚ÄúDisplay Season ‚Äú
---
Daily ops seem to big a big thing for challenges in season 2.
---
Treasury Notes are the currency for the Wastelanders DLC endgame, it's what you use to get the jetpack and T-65 Power Armor
---
Smartt bet I‚Äôma try that rn
---
I use the grocer's bag myself, so I had to figure that out too...lol
---
Yh like after you do the stuff for gram (or what ever his name is) if you reach a certain amount on the progress bar in a certain amount if time it would spawn in and give unique stuff to do with meat week from the atom shop and base game or you get perk whick would let you harvest more meat from braman or can passify and control them like I'm fo4
---
Yes, the spawns seem particularly vulnerable to shotguns. Two shot pump gets them in one pull.
---
half the time i show up people with magic weapons kill him in under a minute
---
It very common on ps4 , you hear ppl getting yelled at by their SO  or ppl yellin at kids  ALL THE TIME
---
Short on caps, of course
---
ohh
---
Revenge of the brahmin
---
&gt; I would assume that just like playernames you could report inappropriate ones
---
And they'd just as soon not have to hire additional staff to deal with all the reports
---
lol.. cheap bastards
---
I buy minimum 76 for the daily
---
Bruh it‚Äôs literally like counting money in the worst part of town
---
Fuck thatd be amazing
---
The flamer and cryo are a whole other problem, they don't kill unless they're explosive
---
20% seems more reasonable. It would be near AA and TS but easier to deal with as most people have mutations already.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt get that they never going to increase it 
---
It the main feature on 1st membership , if they increase it , it will devalued the scrap box
---
Yes it does, you one of the crybabies?
---
It's funny because I was saying the same thing to my team mates last night. We have been grinding CP hard since it dropped on console and as of last night we all now have all the rewards so there isn't much point in us grinding it any longer. We will jump to the event if someone else drops the nuke but won't go out of our way to start it anymore.
---
Yeah that's also a problem. Apart from very specific rolls they underperform.
---
With small groups, some players who are not equipped to deal with wendigo spawns get destroyed.
---
I just did one with 3 people. My lv 70 heavy, a lv 200 heavy, and a lv 500 bloodied.
---
Bloodied fella missed most of the fight. Because he was detected, anything that gets near him results in an increasingly long respawn.
---
The lv 200 and I stood under separate shelters where rocks couldn't fall on us and killed Earle by bringing him back and forth to and fro our positions. Wendigos barely hurt someone with full hp PA, so occasionally I'll clear them out as they were more of a nuisance.
---
In other scenarios, I've seen guys who bring their BE glating plasmas only to kill themselves repeatedly, because occasionally a wendigo will walk in front of the burst or things of that nature.
---
You don't lose junk when you die while in an event.
---
How long have u been playing?!!?! Seriously...this is crazy...does anyone ever pay attention to anything...these post are ridiculous
---
I‚Äôm level 400. killed him with two other randoms. level 200 and 300. it took us 25 minutes. I full health junkie commando, they both PA heavy guns. since it took us 25 minutes I‚Äôm assuming there were no magic weapons involved.
---
Satisfactory Arachnophobia mode would like a word with you.
---
I'm on Xbox and will be on tomorrow and I have a bunch of radaway you can have some same gt as on here send me a message and I'll hook you up. Usually on between 9 or 10 am GMT could use to get rid of some of it anyway.
---
Yeah, u actually hurt my feelings :,(
---
No. Only reason he is special is because you never expect it.
---
I truly share your feelings. poor creatures :(
---
Wow I'm dumb, aight. I always just figured it'd be better to buy something more worthwhile, but it is what it is. Thanks
---
I like buying one bullet... One bullet.... All bullets lol If they got .45 I'll buy them out at a cap a round. Caps are just bullshit useless to me now other than buying ammo.
---
But yeah OP it's the daily SCORE challenge.
---
Good
---
Your reply is ridiculous son
---
Bless your heart.
---
First time this company takes a decision not based ln immersion/rpg

i‚Äôve had him show up once in over 100 hours of gameplay... does he only show up in specific spots or something?
---
Some people love to post shit like this just for attention.

Same shit with the ‚ÄúI got my daily auto-complete‚Äù bug

Christ, forgot about that daily, I guess I'm just dumb. Thanks for that speedy reply.
---
I did it with one or two players several times. People say his legs are weak but my experience is shooting his heads drops him fastest.
---
Forgot about that daily. LOL. thanks for the reply
---
Wish they would buy some other stuff instead of ruining my perfect stack of 1000 ammo. :(
---
I always wait at least 30 seconds after logout to join another server, thet it gives the server a chance to fill the spot you left (hopefully) then you defo go to another server...... (usually) I've never had a 10 try relog or even a 5 for that matter.
---
They were so friendly and cute, i end up taking bunch of selfies then let them walk.
---
I tried all these still not working. I do not think it is my pc problem I think it is a server problem.
---
Thanks , Im just dumb and forgot about the daily.
---
 wait thogut you need to shoot back to get hurt
---
Quick question, how did you get your carry weight to 460 with the chems backpack?
---
Yeah especially when me and my two friends switched to melee so as to not one shot them, and then we all took turns beating the poor things to death.
---
The only other thing that made me feel that bad in a game was the end of The Last of Us 1
---
Me too, and then i got killed anyway? üòë
---
Occasionally finding a vault still full of people and quests...I guess vault 74...I guess
---
Limit yourself to 100 of each scrap material.. and sell or drop the rest , 2-3 weapon , rename your armor you equip with the ‚Äú- slot type‚Äù (ex - left leg ) and scrap/sell the rest  by renaming them it easier to keep track of them
---
Do you have a source for this as I don't think thats true.
---
Was this reply before or after the one where you admitted [you were dumb](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ihw4j8/people_have_been_buying_only_3_ammo_at_my_shop/g32vb3c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)?
---
Just curious.
---
No no, not for attention. I truly forgot about the daily and wanted to ask. Is that a crime? Jesus
---
As an evil cultist, I enjoyed hunting my fleeing foes. Especially for loot pillaged from their back.
---
Man I'm dumb. Thanks for the speedy reply
---
Shoot forgot. Thanks Bruh
---
You got some crazy carry weight perks
---
Sounds like one or two players can make or break the event. I do massive damage with bloodied, but nothing noticeable, to my eyes with AA weapons.
---
his he glitching  or hacker because that should not happen
---
Yee
---
First your nail his head to your wall then you nail his daughter, I see how it is
---
Ye I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
I finally leveled up to a point where these limits my play style. I have a bunch of legendaries I don't use and have to wait a full day only for 150 scrip? like Bethesda, everything okay at home?
---
Ok, thank you. I just needed to vent because BY GOD i havent done a thing
---
Pacifist, problem solved
---
Strong back 4 bear arms 3 and radicool which gives me more carry weight with rads and unyielding armor
---
I always complete the daily buy from another player at low level camps because I remember how bad the grind was for caps when everything you get is worth next to nothing
---
If not on PC, I'd wait till the nerf and then see which is better
---
Never encountered magic weapons in an event, or if I have, I didn't notice. I think perhaps I saw a SCQ meet a magic weapon, but maybe all cryolators freeze her to a near standstill. That fight was, by far, the quickest I've killed her, as she only managed to return to the air once in the entire fight.
---
So I‚Äôve been told lol I hear other people‚Äôs and it‚Äôs crazy to me cause I‚Äôm so used to carrying so much now it‚Äôs hard to get rid of things
---
Instructions unclear, killed earle with a railway rifle and then crucified his daughter
---
Done it twice so far and been successful with only 3 other people. Think the key is to be strategic and work as a team, couple people taking care of the spawns, couple people tanking Earle.
---
The issue is they have to pay for the songs usage.
---
Mole men unite
---
The vaults were my favorite part to. It‚Äôs like exploring ghost wrecks almost. There‚Äôs always an eerie story behind these sometimes abandoned safety shelters. I love the ones that have experiments gone wild as compared to the highly irradiated or bug infested ones.
---
I pick up four and Im encumbered :(
---
I'd be up for that if it also made clear the username. Because of scammers etc.
---
It‚Äôs not about earning anything. Your save data takes up literal space on their servers. Eventually with enough players and how much you play, you‚Äôll be costing them far more than what you initially purchased the game for. They need to charge in order to ensure they‚Äôre at least breaking even with the data costs to store your character and transmit the data to your client.
---
Some of my Fallout 4 save files were nearing 45mb in size as I got close to 100% on that game. Multiply that by how many players purchased Fallout 76 and that are playing across 3 store platforms - Steam, MS Store, Bethesda Launcher. You‚Äôre looking at huge amounts of data being transmitted and stored on their servers.
---
Just assume anyone calling them Toons has more MMO experience then you. I'm thinking about making a low level Twink. Know what I mean?
---
Then wth are you worrying about getting a legacy weapon. You are basically asking for more stash space to grind hours and hours and hours and hours of flux but you don't have the time?
---
Bro it been a daily thing for the last few weeks , if you are paying attention at all you would know what up.. 
---
It fine you got caught with the bullshit , no need to defend yourself and just move along
---
Disagree...Skyrim and Oblivion are still great to play.
---
I dont think anything in the game can do 30k-45k damage in one shot
---
I have all the perks that reduce carry weights equipped. I have probably ~200 sodas and ~180 Salisbury steaks on me.
---
A lot of the other suggestions are really good.  
---
I settled on Mountain Scout (FO1st?) between it, Hunters Long Coat and Insurgent.  I couldn't figure out what backpack skin to use with Insurgent.
---
The in-game drop Engineer Uniform would look good if your backpack would be hidden by the built in tank on the back instead of it clipping through the backpack.
---
Never heard that in an MMO. Plus this game isnt an MMO
---
Are you maxed out in strength points?  I‚Äôm just trying to maximize my carry capacity, but I‚Äôve had to take a lot out of the strength category to increase my agility, perception, and luck
---
Ahh I see, makes sense.
---
I have several but trying to experiment with a non-mutated character.
---
Same, this is getting annoying all I want to do is join friends
---
What kind of power armor
---
I never fast travel,  mainly coz I'm always over loaded.  It really does drag the game out longer and it makes it feel more rewarding when you find random things in the world that you have never seen before or forgotten about.  I love it.
---
I wonder if anyone has ever done it The original way lol
---
They could expand the area The Pitt is set, that's close to the confluence of the Allegheny, the Monongahela and the Ohio rivers.
---
I got the raider vending machine just to sell chems and alcohol. I sell cheap (as low as I can sell before it would be better to sell to a vendor) but addictol is full price
---
Yeah, that's exactly why I muted it in the beginning. It's maddening.
---
It‚Äôs affecting way more people today there‚Äôs over 30 people I play with all being affected by it in the same day it‚Äôs not a coincidence. And none of us experienced this before today
---
I just want to ride vertibirds goddammit
---
I finished yesterday as well, but I‚Äôm still grinding for those treasury notes.  I was on earlier today and hardly any events popping up..
---
Evil
---
Full chally costume for me.
---
Yea I have 15 strength which I‚Äôm trying to get rid of some points so I can make my rifles stronger
---
They'll probably become more homogeneous for now (although that's not saying much, there's not much variety already) but this really lays the foundation for so much future improvement.
---
Will they pull that off?  Will they even try?  Who knows.  I'm not holding my breath.  But these changes lay a solid foundation for that sort of work.  Revamping the core math this way really allows a lot of room to tweak relative balance without runaway outcomes.  Hopefully they have the will and the talent to do something with the work they're doing now.
---
either of the T's would be nice
---
I would like to come over for dinner, please.
---
I'd like a whole new character in truth, never been much of a fan of the mistress of mystery outfit, so I propose, !La Fantoma! From the earlier games, could have heard about this stealthy order of heroines, and came to find them and maybe join or help out.
---
Obviously it'd just be someone in a costume, but still, could be cool.
---
Well, the BOS likely isn't going to give a crap about gold.  You can't eat it or build with it, though it does have uses in energy weapons I suppose.
---
And if they really walked the 2600 or so miles from Lost Hills to West Virginia...it's not like they can take it back with them.
---
You are exactly wrong.
---
Logging in, auto completing Vital Equipment for 11 scrip, a TON of XP, some rewards and some 2 notes bullion for all of 30 seconds effort...  That is pure love for alternate characters.  There is literally no juicier, lower hanging fruit in the game.
---
Wastelander is WHY I have alts.
---
(snuffling grunt)
---
Most weight efficient crops in my mind excluding flowers and berries
---
I‚Äôm sitting at 15 strength 6 perception 4 endurance 9 charisma 6 intelligence 6 agility 10 luck
---
üëå
---
personally i would had went with the Brahamut myself, but that could just be the Final Fantasy talking.
---
A J2590 will be awesome!
---
I killed him solo a few times and to my taste it is easier than doing that in a group. I'm stealth bloodied rifleman but also carry a bloodied Gauss gatling.
---
The point here is as long as you're hidden Wendigo Spawn won't get spawned so unless you've come there for screws Earl is the only target.
---
Just have to hide and shoot while remaining undetected.
---
This is a business mechanism to encourage people to get Fo1st, thats why I got it, coz I got pissed at dropping 3 things I need to pick up something else, also Fo1st is a trap once you start putting shit in that scrapbox it kinda gets addicting.......example, I have 50k+ aluminium, 40k+ of lead, 3k+ of ballistic fibre, 200k steel, what to do with it all I don't know....you cant make it all into ammo as you hit max stash space super quick, and if you cancel Fo1st you then can't put anything else into it, which in turn kinda fucks you over and it's not worth looting anything and wheres the fun in that :(
---
The would move too quickly for camps to click into existence, ruining all the hilarious hillside messaging we‚Äôd get flying over
---
Also look for the railroad tracks.  They will lead you to the tunnel exit.  That‚Äôs the marker I use.
---
Damn.maybe I should take that jetpack off my t51. Will def try and see if hanging by the entrance gets it done for me.TY
---
Dang it. 
---
Have my poor man‚Äôs gold
---

I don't eat any of it. It's more for bragging rights. I'm a melon man.
