angryturtle on youtube did the work and it's 255 items (a container counts as one). Skip to 17.30 for a summary [https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0](https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0)

Not a controller. But I have a rechargeable pack in mine. And only while playing 76 will the pack “die”. It’s not dead just needs to be reseated. Not sure what’s going on in there but stop it. This game isn’t friendly to that.

---
Epic - now how about a response about the auto-complete bug affecting a bunch of people?
---
I recently upgraded to team no fall damage through my legendary armor. I love fearing no fall from any man's CAMP anymore. :')
---
Send an invite to communistraptor I’ll join
---
I think they have armor piercing attacks. They aren't kidding when they say someone needs to have their ass kicked.
---
Now. You can do it earlier if you want a short term legendary of lower level, I do that on secondary characters just to increase my output when  a bit squishy/low on damage, but it’s best to do it after 50 as then all your drops will be max level.
---
While yes this is true I figured many wouldn't want to change thier armour sets for the weekend.
---
It would render the existing ones less useful. The idea being you fix the dupes (good luck) and then make the existing items redundant by increasing the item level cap. Essentially a soft reset like many mmos do with expansions that raise level cap.
---
I cant stand when people change the team I'm in. I run in *Building* for a reason and dont want a leader micro-managing my xp. Thats my take at least.
---
There's also a power generating version, unfortunately you can't swap the one you have, you have to build a new one.
---
I completely forgot about the mobile port. I've been wanting to get back into FFXI. I may have to find a way to afford it. Wonder if Siren is still a good server.
---
Its especially annoying since i transitioned to a bloodied build like all i hear is "its time to get your ass kicked" and then i just die
---
Yeah, that was an odd one.  Even though I'm swimming in Improved Repair Kits from the Queen, I was fortunate to have 3 different characters who had *something* to repair.
---
Or just do them anyway because they've been stupidly easy so far.  
---

---
People were crying about how the nine creature challenge was impossible to accomplish and a sign that Betehsda had designed the system to force people to choose between playing NW for hours or missing out on score and having to pay atoms for ranks.  Meanwhile it took me all of three games, two of which I spawned in killed all the creatures around me and then killed myself to start over again, and todays challenge was an impossibly grueling deploying my camp once.
---
The most time consuming NW challenge yet was just having to play for thirty minutes.
---
Are you still doin it?
---
It's been fixed for awhile now and I believe it now can produce power.
---
This! 
---
Has been posting this spam. Doesn't seem like a legit story. More like a plea to get one cheaper. 
---
Why not just ask to buy one? Markets flooded with powerful guns at the moment.
---
Yeah Flux disappears on death.
---
That said between all the different spawns a decent amount of junk can still be looted during the event. Springs from Yao Guai, Acid from Wendigo, Adhesive from Anglers, and so on.
---
Basically, as soon as the SBQ is dead and looted its just best to run to a survival tent (either your own or someone else's) and dump off all your junk before running around to mop up all the rest of the adds and loot everything else.
---
Depends how much your offering my friend really wants one so your gonna have to offer for it
---
In short, lunchboxes will pay off better during a triple EXP weekend.
---
Considering how rare lunchboxes are (at this time) and that we already had a triple EXP weekend once, I would suggest not spending them at this time unless you are lagging behind and do need the score from leveling up to catch up.
---
Terrible accuracy for long range shots and a hidden VATs miss chance added in. TS is better on close-medium range weapons with high ammo capacity vs. accurate rifles for example
---
Kill some random scorched, pick up their damaged melee weapons, repair.  All you're out is some steel, wood and adhesive.
---
Sorry no I can hear the quad quad quad quad Teslas.
---
This alas only happens if I leave enough time for people to get hits in, since the Sheepsquash only drops 1* legendaries guaranteeing the event rewards for everyone is far more important.
---
I took a 3* down this weekend with a friend. Got me a really nice 1* zealots guitar sword!  Woo hoo!
---
&gt; how the hell would it be a waste
---
I mean arguably it's a waste of time 99% of the time. There's loads of weapons but it's very obvious the odds are skewed to give you garbage like pipe weapons and missile launchers instead of a handmade or fixer.
---
It can't be a waste if the only place you can spend the tokens is there.
---
Hey do you know if or how much  camp budget you need for a pet? My camps are pretty much maxed but I still want a pet again..
---
Garrahan HQ also
---
Yeah it drives me crazy.  I don't care if they fix the doors, fix the damn weapon wheel
---
Yeah the RNG can be frustrating but it definitely makes the excitement when you get a good roll that much better. After so many rolls on secret service when I finally got some good rolls I was so excited I ran right out to test it, only a week later I noticed in my excitement I didn't even put the buttressed mods on them
---
Very true and honestly something I didnt think. Lots of my buddies are a bit behind me but I myself am doing well. Though I dont mind sharing a few with them.
---
You waste your time going there to get pipe weapons and missile launchers lol. It's not even true RNG when it's so obviously weighted to give (or not give) you specific weapons.
---
Grab a friend. Claim a workshop. Put down an ammo converter and lock at Level 0. Clear friends 5 cap bounty. 
---
Less hassle trying to find a unhacked terminal.
---
Amen. I've seen her land ON the drop site bunker to get at me on the fence and radio array, so you can't tell me she isn't capable. Seen her lunge through the fence as well. Worst case, she glitches slightly and gets stuck, which means yay, immobile target!
---
Lol, I log in start or join a build group and go about what I was planning to do anyway. It's pure luck if we wind up at the same event or place on my part. 
---
It's all about the buffs and the SCORE.
---
I'm really happy those challenges are willing to be adjusted.  Some of the NW ones were crazy.  Today's challenges were quite fun to complete!
---
I wasn't saying specifically 10-50 for those. Just making a point about how they shouldn't be expensive in general.
---
Indeed, I'm fucking done with this shit. I have died so many times on storymode and Nuclear Winter thanks to these useless developers they have.
---
You won't be able to do 10 per week at the latter end of the spectrum.
---
That would be perfect, I was thinking just so they could manually keep track if there's a well known dupe, but if they could automate it that would solve the duping problems completely
---
death tambo sounds ridiculous but has good damage esp for how low weight it is.
---
Lol hahahaha
---
Vault-Tec Agricultural Center. Top floor. 0-level terminal. 
---
You can knock out an Event while there as well.
---
People can't use the weapon in question to do what you claim. 
---
Not unless you were in pvp. 
---
Wanted players also don't get free reign on destroying camps. 
---
Fake news.
---
Thanks. I found it was a military helmet and I found mine at Morgan town inside this wooden hut by the river along the back wall where the airdrop event happens
---
I have been attempting to get a post through on both of the 76 reddits. I kept messing up the marketplace formatting so it kept denying my post. Im not spamming anything. I am asking if anyone has one for caps or bulk junk because thats what I have. I blue screen all the time and usually at the worst possible moment. I have a team I play with regularly but none of them have the Quad fixer. I reached out to Reddit for help in locating one because past experience has shown that redditors are pretty decent people. Apparently I made that judgment in error. I am not going to delete my post just because you don’t seem to like me. Go elsewhere “sir”
---
I'd rather AFK for 250 SCORE in Nuclear Winter than farm buffs and ammo to grind the 25,000 XP you need to get in order to get the repeatable to give you the same.
---
The Amazon servers in your area must not be very good. Sometimes joining a friend can put you on a more reliable server, even though it's not in your country or region. Another thing to note is performance has been a little rough since wastelanders, and even more so since patch 20.
---
You should consider how many score points you'll need for that last week.
---
Well seeing how there changing the amount if score able to be got on the fly. Plus a double score weekend and seeing how I'm 10 ahead already. I might be able to get even further ahead. I doubt that they won't increase scroe again.
---
Second half of the board is equal to first have of the board in score points
---
Glass cannon builds be like that sometimes.
---
I feel like I kept seeing posts about it at least they noticed and fixed it. I have to imagine they do what they can with the small budget they have. This game is made to make money until es6 or fo5 so i can imagine a skeleton crew being assigned to this project. I almost feel bad for them.
---
Fun fact: some people have a different time zone than you do!
---
Did you get it for free if you had the other?
---
Make sure logging into nw isnt the last mode u play. So If u played it make sure to log into adventure before getting off. People say this seems to help
---
Thanks!
---
Yes and if it keeps going up without increasing score at all. Then in the last week you wont even get 1 lvl yes. Why do you think they've added more dailys and increased one thing by 250. Its gonna add up over the next following weeks. Especially the double score weekend.
---
There's an old rumor long since debunked that more people makes sbq stronger, thus low levels make it harder without helping. 
---
It's been proven untrue but that's why people spaz out.
---
GTA V has a far more populated online mode.
---
It makes more sense to keep RDR2 there.
---
Already addressed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hqfr5h/psa_you_dont_have_to_do_the_nw_daily/fxz048w/?context=1000)
---
Him much ammo can you buy for your scrip or gold bullion? Oh, none?
---
Yes legendary Fixer also has the sneak bonus and  slightly higher dps over normal combat rifle.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hqfr5h/psa_you_dont_have_to_do_the_nw_daily/fxz5rnc/?context=1000
---
They've addressed it.
---
Got it! Thank you sir
---
i very rarely have any xp buffs on. I always forget. Even when i set out to make relish i'll collect cranberries and then get distracted by an event. Then another event. Next thing i know i've got spoiled food. I have no problems getting repeatable quite quickly. 
---
but it's fine that you know to go afk in NW. I don't think it would occur to someone who had never played NW before or maybe went in a few times since the challenge started.
---
Or is it that i have 312 physcial armour and 450 energy
---
Ok thank you friend
---
If you purchased the bundle that had the waterwheel, the power generating one was added to it. So you get it for free.
---
The vendor hopping is the main reason I do it. I usually start 'build team' for the exp, and search out camps when people join. The real benefit is the free multiple fast travel points, but the vendors can be a real bonus if they have fair prices.
---
I play a bloody build with unyielding armor but sometimes when it's lots of overly strong robots I just put on the Chinese stealth armor to take them all out.
---
I’m not 100% positive but I don’t think they take up any budget anymore. Or maybe it’s one flamingo unit. What I do know is that I’ve had camps very near the max if not completely maxed and never had an issue with breaking the budget. Get a second opinion if you can.
---
You buy weapons and armor for scrip, and you buy weapons, armor, plans, etc. with gold. Not sure why you had to ask, the game does a good job telling you what you can buy with it, but I guess you needed a refresher.
---
Now, getting back on topic, the points serve a similar function, so I don't see how it's any different.
---
Mr Gutsies with Ballistic damage are pretty damn tough at any level of HP total.  Even at 450
---
DR and a full health build, it wasn’t until I added in some TS pieces that it became manageable.
---
Control tower at Ward airport has one too
---
Oh, I like your thinking! Lucky on getting back to work! My business got broken into due to the Seattle riots. So no foreseeable future.
---
I never asked you to delete. 
---
Just ask to buy one without a story. 
---
It just comes across as fake as each post seems slightly different in the story.
---
How do you know.
---
You see i kinda cucked myself when it comes to that since i played wastelanders on day one i never did there questline before siding with the raiders....
---
Just hit 37 today. Skipped 2 NW challenges. The revive player ones believe. My biggest gripe is don’t put challenges that put us at the mercy of the enemy to complete. Either bump the score for NW by a sizable amount or remove the ones that need other players to do. Because let’s face it. That team that’s steam rolling the match isn’t too concerned about ruining your challenge. 
---
I’m slowing down more now than I expected. I assumed by 50 I would leveling at the pace of snail but not now. 
---
I would love a few more dailies but ones that are more in line with the season. Kill X with energy weapons, craft fuel.
---
If this is the glitch I think it is, if you die as a public event ends then you will get the no respawn bug. Fortunately if you have a friend in the server, you can rejoin and if you are VERY lucky you can still loot the boss if you passed he damage threshold. (I've done it and was in shock)
---
Like some heavy guns and would it be good on a shotgun? I got a TS pump action form the preveyor
---
Im about 2-3 weeks into playing so my armour is bascially just the legendaries i got on first roll and modded with deep pockets
---
I copy and pasted because I’m lazy. My posts cant be different.
---
There’s a linked spreadsheet https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm3f2d/legendary_run_score_rundown_guide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Good on shotgun, yeah. Shotguns in general are just in a bad place in 76, though. Such poor range you might as well just go melee
---
Edit: TS would also be good on heavy guns, just at a closer range
---
Thank you! That actually makes me happy to hear. I hadn't tried due to budget concerns, but I will check it out.
---
I'd rather play unreal tournament 2003 or something...
---
I hate both the Battle Royal and MMO portion of 76. I could live without both. That being said, I'd much rather nab 250 SCORE in Nuclear Winter than farm buffs and ammo to grind the 25,000 XP you need to get in order to get the repeatable to give you the same.
---
Once you can get the SS armors crafted, it makes a big difference.
---
I run a troubleshooter armor piece..
---
You can still buy the plans with bullion at the second to last settlers rep level, but it seems exponentially expensive compared to everything else... Thankfully the helmet is not required.
---
I mean the non-quest variant, of course. Plenty of things under Quest at the Tinker's Bench that can't be made after the initial quest that required the item.
---
I normally start or join building teams for the int boost and I feel like they're fairly casual. The other day I joined an events team because I wasn't on one yet and Scorched Earth was just about to start. The team leader kicked me out about half way through so a friend could join their team. So that was cool.
---
You're saying you have a bloodied explosive gauss shotgun?  Otherwise there's no point to use the demo expert perk cards for that weapon.
---
I currently have the chest peice and the underarmour with the sheilded mod , im having an internal struggle saving up for the jetpack or just giving the armour pieces
---
I have a vendors hall a nice couch a stash box and two vendors
---
Is that resistance to robots? if so you must be living the sweet life
---
Appreciate the news, thanks!
---
Yeah I use a .50 for med-to close range then point blank I use shot gun. (I don’t have a TS .50) just a TS pump action.
---
When it comes to bullions im limited to the 200 daily cause i never have alot of caps , so theres so many things i wanna buy including that dirt plots foundatins
---
Lmaoooo
---
its just one piece.. I also VATS them in a limb ASAP
---
Get Buttresed for the limbs and Jetpack for the Chest. Make sure two of the pieces have 50% fall damage protection, though.
---
So the suggestion to deal with workshop
---
griefers is to hire one?
---
You need a slogan, and a card too, start a business.
---
I bet you land on your balls and those big squishy things cushion your fall, right?
---
We didn't have 2 extra challenges today!
---
makes sense. Thanks!
---
I’m all in on ammocoin
---
So I've been selling all my legendaries super cheap but never figured out what fair scrip price was. So you're saying like 100 for 5 scrips 180 for 9 and like 800 for 40?
---
Didn’t see that, thanks!
---
I sure will when i end up buying them its just if i should get the full set plus + the resistance mods before buying the jetpack or getting the jetpack first and then the peices
---
If you are carrying enough loot to care about losing. 
---
In a workshop you own. 
---
While not paying attention to whose around you. 
---
Fair Game. 
---
You'd hate me. I understand that it's part of the game so have no problem with taking or losing loot. 
---
Best Bag so far 1300lbs of junk of a player at Monogah. Guess he was duping junk with a trap. 
---
If they were not, then damn I'd really like to know the backstory of how he ended up there without duping it all. Haha
---
Easily one of my favorite updates
---
They just want your money. lol
---
You see im melee so even in vats i cant do much apart from punching them in the face with my bloodied deathclaw gaunlet
---
That shows igs over double the first half actually. At space 50 you have a total of 59,500 score, if it was equal to that you would have 119,000 score. It shows 200 000+ score at lvl 100
---
I was wondering about that id you double stacked the -50% fall damage thing if it'd actually negate fall damage out of PA.
---
My weekly one got auto completed when I completed two of them.
---
It's amazing how many people just click Confirm/Yes on this WITHOUT reading it. 
---
Gives Human CentiPad vibes... haha
---
This is also saying you need 3,100 score a day to do it free. So therefore its impossible. 1000% impossible. Maybe 2-3 days a week you can hit it but not everyday. Cause well, no possible to get 3,000 score a day. 
---
Was it meant to be this way lol wasn't it "free"
---
I too completed the main wasetlanders storyline.  Playing both sides up til I had to make a choice and went with raiders.  Never got the steam achievement to unlock.  My guess is it's for completing the full quest with the settler faction.
---
Yes he was
---
Whitespring basement office also
---
What are you talking about? You've never been able to make more then 150 scrip a day by turning legendary weapons in at train stations.
---
Yeah, I'd imagine he was hoping you'd stink to the bottom and drown, where PA doesn't float.
---
Nah, I understand how crazy or weird this might seem, but I'm very sure. I've been looking at my chemistry bench each time I've logged on. The one thing I haven't done is, picking up flora in a nuke zone. I'll try that later tonight.
---
YES. The simplest solution. Hell even make it a special vendor at Whitesprings.
---
All they'd need to make me happy is allowing wallpaper to be applied to the bottom of a ceiling. I want my glow in the dark stars above me to
---
You've been bamboozled!
---
No he wasn't ... try again without armor!
---
There are tanks that you can dive in and there’s like a lootable body and it has some sort of heavy weapon in it. I think I got a fat man or something? I don’t think he was lying, but I’m not sure if he is correct.
---
You're supposed to get it on the first one.
---
All the upvote. After reading the spreadsheet on here. 
---
3,000 score a day needed. I thought I was doing good at 28 lvl already NOPE. Needed to be at 33 to be on par. Which is impossible lol
---
... and get blown up!
---
Manually could take very long since so many legendary items were duped repeatedly. If they can automate this, it would solve duping completely like you said. What they did to gold bullion legendary items is good, it has been doing a good job preventing duping. Maybe they can borrow some of that coding and apply it to all legendaries.
---
People tend to loot them, you might have to server hop a lot to find one.
---
You can get frogs legs by overseer level 8 by spending overseer points to buy it! Every build should have high enough agility as agility favours every build type!
---
Thanks so much for watching, and that would totally make sense. Even in past scrip openings I have noticed that they always follow a pattern per-session. Next time I try this I'll hop servers if I see a pattern.
---
Breaking news: jerks in video games. In other news, people also cheat extensively.
---
This. Also if op is still scripping items at 1k scrip, that's just wasting the scrip
---
Oh. Didn’t know that. I thought it renewed over a thousand every day.
---
u/IValseek Here's what would be nice. Allow us to reach the finish line without the repeatable. I hate both the Battle Royal and MMO portion of 76. I could live without both. That being said, I'd much rather nab 250 SCORE in Nuclear Winter than farm buffs and ammo to grind the 25,000 XP you need to get in order to get the repeatable to give you the same. The old system of grinding challenges for Atoms was both much more straight forward and much less tedious by far.
---
Its like 1 in 30 you get something good. I got a furious gauss minigun this weekend from her but you will get lots of hunter or nocturnal crap from her. Its better odds than any legendary enemy gives.
---
please give me winterized by christmas for my father winter PA helmet it’s all i want and i’ve been rlly good
---
I got you baby do you want qffr fr or q2525
---
We are the Enclave.
---
I appreciate the kindness! That's ok though, I was helped a while back and got bored because it was all given to me. It's not that I really needed flux, but I was planning on selling it and upgrading my handmade with it for that 3 extra damage for automatic. 
---
As for the PA, this might be something you could help me understand. I'm getting X-01 because I've searched on google what the best PA is for nuke zones, and it seems to be X-01 because of the high radiation resistance at the cost of ballistic resistance. Is this truly the best choice, or would T-51 be the better choice for nuke zones?
---
Or they could make a button add a legendary filter. And have it on by default and so when you want to scrap on you have to turn it off for it to show them
---
It's gambling. It's a waste until it isn't. I've thrown thousands of scrip at mama mumbles and the only really nice thing I've gotten is a B25P Fixer from the sale this past weekend. 
---
I scrip stuff more to free up carry weight then anything else. Being able to roll 10 new 3 stars a week is just a bonus, considering that when the game launched you just dropped or sold your extra legendaries to vending bots.
---
That's when I got mine
---
**God Bless the Enclave!**
---
hurr durr stand on bunker and fence because power armor no poison resist waaaaa
---
The queen isnt effected by explosive damage
---
No. 150 scrip, per day. 1000 scrip is the limit to how much you can carry at a time.
---
Its called landview lighthouse (I think)
---
Coming soon to the atom store, a collectron bot that simply empties resourses from machines at your camp and dumps it into your stash
---
friendly - neighborly- allied
---
The guy who fixed all the broken legendary promotes way back when just didnt give a fuck about two of the most prevalent enemy types in the game.
---
Ahhh...I had no idea they changed it. Good to know. Thank you for the clarification.
---
Breaking news: Canned Coffee isn't cheating.
---
Just did that one today and it was pretty great. Wish I would have none about it before I hit level 30, though... Scorch Beast is pretty epic, always.
---
You’re welcome. It was enjoyable to watch, and not much too long/needlessly drawn out like most I ignore. 
---
I’ve been paying more attention to the patterns but I’ve been a bit hit and miss because I lack patience to save up scrip to get a good dataset 😁
---
It's entirely possible to loot and get away if you do it quickly though.
---
Been considering skipping NW for more repeatables too, but NW still gives Adventure mode XP. Would that contribute to the repeatable and, if so, would it be worth it when accounting for that too? On average being around 1-2k XP per match?
---
The rain wetness shader is absolute trash on PC
---
Never got it.
---
That’s why every time I get a new bundle or learn lots of new item plans, I’ll clear my CAMP and rebuild. Easiest way for me to work in the new items without trying to change my current setup to accommodate.
---
Yes. It’s a real soul destroyer isn’t it. And even worse I believe that last rank is as long rep wise as the two before it combined. 
---
I feel like I’ve been doing the last settler rank since I was a foetus.
---
Will do
---
Is it possible to buy it?
---
They're mad because you're succeeding at a lower level, if you are dealing enough damage to receive the loot from the SBQ's body, you've done your fair share and deserve the loot.
---
Ohhhh. I’m still learning.
---
Some areas have the wetness slider permanently active - like the Nuke Silos.
---
Yea, this sounds like a good idea.
---
My guess would be that the raiders would put out a bounty on a Scorched or some other monster who has been terrorizing the neighborhood, while Ward will have us kill an innocent child or something.
---
What perks are you using?
---
Even the MEAT turned chrome.
---
Firecracker berry? I think you win :)
---
I'm on level 33, I just made it onto the second part of the map, to do that I've had to complete everything since the start and repeatedly earn 10k experience points.  What's sad is with all that work the rewards coming up are all kind of lame.  The only thing that excites me is the giant stuffed sheepsquatch.  And to be honest, I think the only reason I want it is to see if I can put it in my camp after I was so pissed to discover I couldn't do it with the giant teddy bear I got as a "reward" from turning in Mr. Fuzzy tokens.
---
I just bounce servers at Charleston fire dept until I find it locked.
---
If it has loot, it turns into a meatpile or metal pile until looted or server despawns it after &gt;x&lt; amount of time (not because of adds)
---
 *Why, Johnny Ringo, you look like somebody just walked over your grave.*
---
You sure you didn't learn it already? you get it on your first kill and once you learn it, it doesn't drop anymore. Check under misc at the bottom.
---
Yeah manually would depend on a fast response, like a couple hours after that video was posted they shut down the servers and do a search for people who had recently picked up a bunch of the same high value items from vendors
---
That's a good point about the bullion items too
---
It's nice to find someone else who sees something other than "hahaha now I can get all the great items for dirt cheap" in this whole situation
---
On a more serious note, if you are still having problems put in a support ticket with Bethesda.
---
Nothing has been settled about the system and afaik it's all subject to change. 
---
I wouldn't bank on anything that's live on pts being the same when it releases live.
---
Well - that risk ALWAYS exist. It's still Fallout 76, rofl :-b
---
Most of the camp lighting objects are set to 1/1/1 for RGB - which is BRIGHT WHITE.
---
Even the damn garbage barrel fire.
---
Hear hear!
---
How high did you fly?
---
I don’t believe it drops again for people after the first (I’ve done hundreds and never seen it again ), so unless people have alts that list it....
---
You definitely should’ve gotten in on your first one though. Weird.
---
You could get a friend who has it unlocked into a team and build it at your camp for you I guess.
---
Yea, I ended up buying mind for around 2500c. I am not sure if I got ripped off or not.
---
This idea encourages more mooching, as people would just wait to join at the last few seconds and receive the rewards for completion, more so than they do already.
---
Well only just last I was thinking stealth was broken again until. I realised I went from a dark indoor interior to the encryptid event in daylight with my pip boy light on and the imposter kept killing me... After I turned that light off its definitely a much different experience
---
How much xp is needed? It doesn't quite tell you how many times its repeatable. I thought it meant it just never stops the whole time not that I have so many times to complete it in a week.
---
A-fucking-men
---
For shame!  Have you never had sausage gravy and biscuits made with sausage from a mason jar?  Mason jars hold more than just simple veggies and fruits!
---
I'm gonna give up, the way this game works is honestly despicable
---
Also pretty passed to find out that the extra daily challenges only run till the 20th. They aren't permanent.
---
Didnt say it was
---
That sounds cheap as anything to me honestly. It’s base price is 2k and I’ve literally never seen it for sale a single time. 
---
Things are worth what you’re willing to pay I guess 😁
---
If players can’t reach the low rank needed for the camp converter, then why would they care for the points? As for the event/quest rewards including ammo points, that’s asking a bit much. You already get ammo as a reward, you can loot ammo off 90% of your kills, is it really that impossible to just take what you’re already given and convert it at your camp? At some point players will need to accept that they might have to grind and save for a bit to get what they want.  Players complained about useless ammo and were given a FREE method of exchanging useless ammo to get the ammo they want. Players complained about how they didn’t get enough legendary items from event, now I’m having to take up space storing all the legendary items so I can try to trade them in for 150 legendary scrip everyday, while earning scrip for every quest and event. They’ve stopped short of rewarding atoms for everything you do and still people demand more. For a company everyone here loves to bitch about, they sure do give in to your demands quite a bit.
---
I'm not an FPS jockey. I can handle 30 fps on consoles but in Fallout 76 it's never stable 30 fps. At times, it looks 15 fps. It's pretty bad.
---
I have a Xbox one x and when I first get into a server it does that and it’s so annoying. So you’re just better to go in pip and get the item you want or you might die if you’re near enemies
---
I agree. It can be annoying. Not a fix but I find it helps to zoom in as much as you can
---
Can agree with this
---
Turrets shred bloodieds. 
---
Especially if placed smartly. 
---
So...many...bullets...ow
---
Thanks for the heads up! I got the same gun and I find that not blowing myself up is my biggest challenge. :) Just set up dense armor, and am going to be buying Fireproof x3 next.
---
Agreed, hopefully tomorrow we see a massively expanded number of weekly tasks to complete.
---
Not there.
---
With Mr. Gutsys it’s kill them before they kill you fast.
---
There is no such thing available at this time
---
No the extra few they already gave us is the ones.
---
Somewhere center of the map; proximal to white springs
---
It doesn't stop, it's just a continuing grind.  I've been joining teams and then non-stop doing events, the 4x experience bonus adds up. The only thing that sucks is I've noticed events don't spawn as often as they used too.  Well, unless you like the Manhunt one, I swear that spawns every 5 minutes.
---
Go to the lighthouse east of vault 76 and in the second floor of the house next to it, theres one which requires 0 skill, server hop if already hacked:)
---
If someone from Bethesda could chime in, that’d be great.
---
Yea, this is a very grind heavy
---
Lol
---
Unfortunately the only solution may be to move your camp elsewhere.
---
Just ig ore them, some people really need to get a grip on reality
---
Talking about the comments regarding. I honestly don't care. It's public forum and stories like this always come across as fishy. 
---
If your looking to buy or trade. Just say that.
---
I usually run to the tent and put it in right away but I did die once recently before doing so and spawned back in and never could find my loot. So disappointing
---
Watch a video by Angry Turtle that will explain it
---
It damn should be
---
Same here I've got over two hundred of the improved repair kits from Queen grinding that was a good chance to free up some weight.
---
or CAP coin.  and "CAP" works both ways : Busta and Cola !
---
Stealth bonuses stack
---
The kid ran off with our osmosis machine. What else could I do? 🤷‍♂️
---
Haha I haven't actually. 
---
I should of stated I'm from England. We generally use cans. We also rarely use glass jars for meats. (maybe some hotdogs)
---
However I understand different places use different methods. I was just pulling from my day to day knowledge haha
---
Depends 300-1000
---
I check but they aren't there
---
Well that sucks.  So then once you reach the stage I'm at you won't even get a "reward" a day and pretty soon it won't even be one a week.  Sometimes I hate this game.
---
I always wait for whoever started it. I find it rude when someone goes into the terminal when it’s not their caps that paid for it.
---
That's the problem with update 20, it takes on average 3-4 shots to kill in VATs and out of it.
---
Across the railroad tracks from Whitespring Station.
---
This happened to me. Look up the glitch to get under the map and delete from below. It worked for me. But you're gonna have to get rid of the stairs first, try adding another foundation to the one with stairs, then you should be able to delete the stairs/upper floor.
---
No! Let's start a petition. The only thing I can think of why it isn't logically is because obsidian has the copyright for that particular song and Bethesda doesn't want to file for or pay for approval to get the copyrights to put it in their game.
---
Maybe you are thinking of the cap limit which is 1,400 and resets daily.
---
I was just ranting about this
---
It takes nothing away from me if they do, so why worry?  It's not like my reward depends on their input.  Like I said, just keep out of my line of fire and we're good.  Besides, it's not for EVERY event, just the few open public ones that have a fixed duration and no player init.
---
5 bundles of each isn’t going to put a dent into your stash box.
---
It’s all those ridiculously overweight mods and plans and medical supplies that do that.
---
And yet they gave us the Ammo Convertor/Button Press Simulator haha
---
If you have an excessive amount of items in your inventory or stash box it will cause lag, I saved myself some by storing all my notes and holotapes etc but now my stash box is laggy instead
---
Not saying that's definitely what's happening, but that was my personal experience
---
Xb1x player
---
It’s so bad. When I trade with people it takes minutes for me to scroll to my item and set the price. It’s insane
---
My girlfriend has f76 on the original ps4 and Jesus. Sometimes it looks like she’s just watching a PowerPoint. I have the game on my pro and it’s bad but man I feel for folks who have the older versions of consoles.
---
I found it an missile launcher there, look for the tank with Bubles is the only one you can swing with a hazmat suit, with the PA I'm not sure.
---
if you find nothing keep server hopping till you get the missile or the gattling.
---
If you look at my post about it someone in the comments linked a video on how to get underground
---
How many on your team or running solo?
---
Yes, but it would still be (grammatically correct) "you're the dumbass". As in "*you* are the dumbass'. "Your the dunbass" only works if it's a heinous misspelling and/or the work of an imbecile raider, which is highly believable but none the less incorrect.
---
Does the bolt action still benefit from both riflemen and pistol perks at the same time? I remember reading about that a few times but I just assumed it would have been patched by now.
---
A Bot Merchant who can pull them apart &amp; give us back Specific Legendary Modules .  Or even maybe even construct Legendaries.  There could be several “Are You Sure” gates so nothing wanted is lost if pulled apart.  The Modules already exist in a way - If Bethesda has access to at least one component programmer - they could  probably make a module for each Effect.  
---
I’m sure they’d also make us trade like ten or twenty normal Legendary Modules for one specific - but eventually you’d have the Legendaries you’d actually want.  Give the Bot Merchant a fun personality - or bring in a Celebrity Voice - make it slightly creepy or fun or memorable.  Maybe it looks like a metal spider or something- who knows.  Maybe they can make it an ATOM Shop thing &amp; sell is back our Player Agency... LUL
---
As a 475, I don't care who shows up or what level they are (I've seen people at level 15 and below)  I'll do my best to keep them alive so they can keep shooting.  I get my hits in early and keep the other enemies busy so everyone can get their hits on the queen.
---
Several times a day... 
---
Doing the same thing...
---
But DAMN one day I will corpse launch myself with my Gamma Gun into my Basketball Hoop 🏀
---
I’m confused, I was just explaining where the note came from (not directed at insult not but instead another raider), not the grammar.
---
Platform?
---
Well, I reckon it will take about as many shots if you use any other prefix considering the nature of the bug. 
---
I’ve experienced the bug a few times but not enough times to consider a change in my load out. Currently, I use an I/ 33/ 25 Lever Action and an I/ E/ 25 Hunting Rifle for role play and I’m doing fine with the average mob.
---
My dude bloodiesnis not hard to use...at all. You may die once or twice vs none at all. But it's still mad easy and the massive damage output waaayyyyyy out weighs the lack of durability.
---
You wanna actually be one shoted by everything go Berzerker. That should be the real glass cannon build and do more damage than anything else. Bloodied needs a nerf. Too many things work too well with it compared to other builds.
---
I'd rather all build have better synergy but Bethesda is far to incompetent to do so properly. Thereby, a nerf to Bloodelied is not just needed. But more than likely to happen.
---
Just a general rule. You can go 30 per to start but if stuff doesn’t move just lower the price if your stash starts getting full. You may as well scrip daily. You never know what you may get
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help ~~kill the kid~~
---
I think I’ll just do that instead. I got some of them on my vendor, put them all a little low then it’s actual value so maybe someone wants it buy it. But the rest I’ll just give them away if I find a noob.
---
PS4
---
Im lucky that im always running into the transport. Literally sat in my camp porch watching some one working on taking one down. Vertibots crashing in my front yard and all. Most servers are full of newbs that have no use for them. Had a 400+ stop by and clear a bunch of stuff out of my vendors. Took all but one card im on xbox
---
Gotcha, thank you I’ll try that
---
Thanks bud
---
Engages pvp. 
---
Wants to report.
---
No problem.
---
The sky is falling!  The sky is falling!
---
It can take anywhere from a few days to weeks because of covid
---
It was in the patch notes for patch 20.  Just sayin
---
Sorry, different platform
---
☝️ this
---
That is an on going bug for a long time now
---
I feel slightly attacked by hoarder but I’ll be damned if you didn’t nail it on the head
---
Lighthouse keepers house second floor
---
Yeap. Idk when we can start buying lvls for atoms but I have 2,300batoms which I plan on waiting till more the end of the season so I'm not buying easy lvls but the hard ones
---
Ahhhhh, I was unaware. Thanks for the heads up. F’ing Bethesda.
---
Honestly same. I’m mostly on a build team doing my own thing. But if I’m feeling like being “social” I’ll join event teams and just do the public events. However, In between events I’ll be at my camp chilling teammates are welcome to join me, but I prefer to stick around and run my store. All my vending machines are stocked full of legendaries and I like to be around to replace em when I make a sale.
---
I have a junkies with 40% faster swing rate if you ever change your bloodied build and wanna trade, hit me up. LoL
---
Yea, I try, but when there's a ton of players it is impossible almost.
---
Misunderstood then.  Sorry.
---
I get what you're saying and sorry if I come off as a grammar nazi. I was simply stating what the correct phrase should be and not what was/is stated.
---
No worries.  As a native West Virginian, I think I have seen just about every thing you can possibly stick into a mason jar end up there.  Beans, berries, apples, apple pie filling, sausage, deer meat, pork fat, salsa, pickled eggs, pickled &lt;insert food here&gt;, soups, jellies, jams, chicken, anything that couldn't run away faster than we could chase it, you get the idea.  We've eaten things that were in our garden, both growing in it, and crawling thru it.  Groundhog, rabbit, squirrel, turtle (from the pond up the road).  If we could shoot it, or catch it, we ate it (at least once).
---
Camp McClintock, second floor
---
I reckon the low vendor count is due to new players who have no idea how to use one
---
I get no XP or items from things my group members kill near me, and they get none from my kills unless I use my Tesla to tag them and take HP, rad and durability damage waiting for them to kill it... so I prefer not being near anyone. Even with the LFG system this game is not group friendly and they're just there to activate my perks and int bonus.
---
‘Tis OK - video or not, for those of us that have been there, you just stirred up some memories :)
---
Thx !
---
Of course, but the 100% bonus dmg from Instigating is still going to do more first shot damage than the 50% bonus junkies gives when you take that stealth stack into account. The end result is Instigating will always do more first shot dmg. If you need two shots they will be about even, then Junkies will take over 3rd round and beyond (at least that's what my quick math says).
---
This has been a bug since the beginning I’m afraid. Been playing since b.e.t.a and still have yet to have it completed.
---
If you have the stairs stacked exactly on each other for whatever reason it won’t let me delete any pieces I attach at the top. I’ve had to start over a few times. Let me know if you find a way!
---
Yeah I've resorted to trying to just fast travel to the nearest place and pay the caps sometimes. They need just a simple "Join current event" with the teams
---
Funnily enough there is in fact a glitch for the raiders too that is far more game breaking than the one you have listed
---
I've just bought my first house and a big selling point was the established fruit trees in the garden. We've got Damsens, pears, 3 apples, and even just spotted a cherry tree bearing fruit this past few weeks so we've just started making our own jams and preserves. 
---
Can't wait for the rest to start bearing fruits. So this topic was fresh in my mind haha
---
U know its bad when bo4 did something you should copy.
---
Same deal with me. This isn’t caused by being on at reset at all.
---
I think most people know about the Settler one.
---
Punch a hole in the bottom of the can, and it'll slide out smoother than last night's radroach.
---
the legendary spawn rate should be higher or the same for low enemies because who wouldn't like looting legendarys while they are leveling a new character.
---
I read only the title and was like 🤭
---
You're comparing two cards that are both well over 5 years old. 76 is not super optimized but it can run at 100+ fps with modern mid range hardware and some minor tweaks.
---
Shoot at their thrusters before they see you
---
Did you end your last session, or start the current session, in the Nuclear Winter game mode? Or did you examine the Atom Shop before entering the game? I think both of those actions can cause the bug too.
---
I’ll second this.  I carried a death tambo for 10-15 levels when I was still a newbie.
---
Now at L214, still keep a legendary one in my carry inventory
---
Watoga transit station. Gun range. Penitentiary. All power plants.
---
The simple solution is to make a new character, the quest still completes. Just remember to claim your rewards in your main account
---
It's a rare drop for sure. Don't know about Wayward though.
---
I got my all time gun from her this weekend, an anti armor explosive .50 cal and I also got a bloodied gun that I sold for $30k caps.
---
Whitesprings near the ghoul car park has 1 squirrel I can reliably find. 1. Squirrel.
---
Ive started to buy some cards and the first one I used Im pretty sure this guy was trying to get to the terminal to start it but I kept stepping in front of him. He got the hint eventually. Someone else did end up starting it the minute I stepped away from it though. At least by then enough players had turned up. It should be locked to whoever put the card in
---
At what point does its just a game nolonger matter the moment you have to share loot stingy ppl on both sides my opinion yeah your lvl 25 is trying his hardest probly dumping rounds into the SBQ but you fail to realize that you just being in the area raises the stats of the queen and thus makes everyone else hit her less effectively i (lvl 176) aa fancy pump seen this first hand starting the queen im smaking her for maybe a 16th of her health bar handfulls of 45 damage markers and then when I have 20 ppl there all I can do is smack her for 1's you simply shooting her doesnt mean your being more helpful then the help you give the queen in damage resist and let me tell you nothing sucks more then launching nukes all day privately killing queen but then go to public and watch so many ppl be there that can't do anything to her now neither can you and your squad of queen hunters who have been doing it all day that said I was lvl 25 rite there theres alot I didn't know that I do now it sounds like yall killed it so he really has nothing to be salty about its just a game if you raging on some lvl 25 cus he's uneducated on it your an ass i don't care its a game let them enjoy themselves maybe educate them God forbid help somebody progress

Mama dolce has 2. One in the downstairs office in one in the fujiniya intelligence base in the piping outside (keycard in upper office).

Yup. As long as you have the right stock on it. Pipe revolver does as well
---
This.
---
Feed already tells you how long it has been running
---
Yes, that and the 512 hacks were weights off my shoulders!
---
Got down to &lt;1000 and grinded rest out.  If you want to do that, log at vault 76, hop to Helvetia, the fort, and the logging company, then the dam or some other spot to check a random spawn or what have you, then hop servers.  Don’t log at a logging place, that seems to bug it out.
---
Thanks man. But just a question before that. Was this a recent video because if not many things could have happened in that time period. Like they could've addressed it or something
---
Man too bad bully hunters shutdown.
---
No problem. The video posted is recent enough I suppose. It’s definitely within a month, perhaps within two weeks.
---
When I bought the bundle I honestly thought that is what would happen. Pretty disappointed to learn I was wrong. I feel like a lot of atom shop stuff lately has been sloppy with various bugs and oversights which should never be getting through on a premium item
---
Thanks
---
Thank you
---
If you check ebay you can buy one lol
---
How do you do against SBQ with some help with your build? Would you say it's still possible to solo if you really wanted to? It's unlikely I would need to but it would be nice to have kinda thing. There are definitely some drawbacks to junkies (and bloodied) if pure dmg isn't your need.
---
Outside of the responders jumpsuit I am yet to see any of the jumpsuits that are meant to drop in events or quests
---
You'll love it, but it is a lot of work.  To keep the costs down, keep an eye out on flea markets, Facebook marketplace or other online venues for used jars of various sizes.  Way cheaper than buying new, and you can go lots of placed for the rings and lids.  
---
We lost two apple trees a couple of years ago, but we still have our main one, plus plenty of raspberry and blueberry bushes, a peach tree, grape arbor, and a walnut tree.  Pack some walnuts in maple syrup or honey and save it for a cold day. Good Stuff.
---
Bethesda hasn’t allowed mods but if you are not duping and all that with your mods then I’m sure you will be fine
---
A bloodied gauss shotgun is the best for damage output hands down.
---
The easiest way to do that one is go to the logging camp in the north west or any place with cultists or blood eagles. They drop a lot of armor.
---
You don't have to...but you should. 👍
---
Just happened to me - what time is reset PST so I can avoid it?
---
There is something that is called pvp to deal with situations like this...
---
You sir are a god among mortals
---
I don't like any of the NW ones, personally, because I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the "Save Everything" mod. I wish Bethesda at least looked over certain mods to whitelist them for use cuz that one is only harmless UI polish. 
---
But for ones I actually find way too time consuming: I extra disliked the creature kills, even the 3/3 took a long time so I immediatly decided to skip 9. 6 Stimpaks I also skipped. And I've skipped the revive other players one each time cuz I don't feel like bothering/pestering/begging other people for help every time it pops up or running around hoping my random ally gets shot in the face...
---
The sad part is that these people are generally rewarded for these types of actions in real life.
---
There's almost nothing in Season 1 that I would spend money for if it showed up in the Atomic Shop. If we were living in the old system where we did challenges for Atoms and these were the offerings, I'd happily be sitting on a nice pile of Fallout 1st and free Atoms waiting for something I liked to show up.
---
I tried that but my INT/LUCK kept making everything have bonus durability bar.
---
All of these great, and I'm really hoping to see some of them work their way into the game.
---
I like that
---
[removed]
---
most mods are only cosmetic and client side, you can find some on Nexus mods's website
---
Wasn't aware of that.  I'll have to swap demo cards in and out and check damage stats next time I'm on.
---
Yeah I'm disappointed about that as well
---
So do the other allies! The astronaut likes to play the piano and tuba on my bandstand
---
This Worked for me but mine was called Project76.ini
---
just a heads up, and as another user mentioned on here, my folder "mygames" was in my documents instead.
---
Oh wow that’s a lot! Since I’m still kind of a low level, I’m not sure how much high level enemy farming I’ll be able to do. But a lot of the other buffs mentioned should help, thanks :)
---
That doesn't help when you already have 5 characters. I'm not deleting characters, especially when the lowest is level 120.
---
If you think about it, they were right on the cusp of replicators for public use if you look a the Sierra Madre dlc for NV
---
Not lucky! =0 
---
I have asthma and haven't left the house for 2 months. I have zero confidence in the government, work or the public in keeping me safe. And Asthma UK recommends not wearing a mask if you have asthma. But you have to wear a mask on public transport and it looks like they're gonna make wearing a mask in shops mandatory as well. So... i kinda can't get to work.
---
I love the event too, but often find myself being the only one there.   Is it because so many people run bloodied builds  and the event takes place  in irradiated water and you get attacked by ghouls?
---
He’s toying with you...sort of. There’s been ‘something’ going on...something that involves players exploiting the system leaving valuable goods vulnerable to obtain for a short time. Erhm, look into it if you want.
---
yes you will need to grind out the xp challenge hard to beat it, but then again not everyone should be completing the seasonal challenges.
---
By the power of grayskull...
---
PC optimization would be nice too.  It's Bethesda, so....
---
It seems like there are other similar glitches on the challenge list as well. It says I haven’t discovered Beckley when in reality I’ve been there a ton of times. 🙄
---
learn something new every day.. thanks
---
Mods are not banned, and have never been banned. They're not supported, which is the same as with all their other games. You can use mods on public servers, but their being client-side only limits what they're capable of - most of them are texture replacers, audio replacers, or GUI tweaks. If you can get it on Nexus Mods, it's fine. In fact, if you're on PC, there's some mods that you absolutely should be using.
---
I was having trouble with the assaultron in the Grafton Steel Underground, so I went back to my CAMP and grabbed 4 mines. Placed the first three, then threw the fourth one and they all blew up and killed me. That was all of my mines.
---
I wish the secret service Jetpack stopped fall damage. :(
---
I’ve played several characters and it has always been rewarded on the first completion of Scorched Earth.
---
That’s what’s happening.  Someone on Friday posted about the change to gameplay as soon as they dumped their holos and notes.  Decided to try and it was a massive performance gain.
---
The secret is not the amount of items ie... 2x plan but having all the plans.  Rendering that much takes time.  Ditch it all only keep what you are selling and are active for quests.
---
Accidentally nuked by my own teammate in NW because I somehow got the orientation of the map confused and took one step into the target zone a second before the nuke hit.
---
At level 4 I went to my first Queen fight. I only scored loot because I was on a team with a level 640 😂
---
Try maxing the commando cards, it’s fun to switch back and forth and commando can be super fun in and out of stealth.  My personal fave is the auto railway rifle in vats, if you get an ffr or explosive variety it’s absolutely insanely fun and hard hitting.
---
I switched to commando when wastelanders hit because of the reasons you mentioned and I’ve had a great time with it.
---
I stay on the terminal after starting the event to make sure no one gets on it.
---
I also have a 2-shot auto grenade launcher with anti-armor and.. something I forget that isn't terribly special. I generally carry about 200 grenades along with those mini nukes.  Believe it or not this is on my shotgun/melee build. I tried to be somewhat well-rounded.
---
You have 5 character slots...
---
Make use of them all. 1 per theme.
---
Insult Bot walls up to me, I let him do his shit. But then I turn the bastard into scrap.
---
As said in the thing, I don’t have the needed plans to build it with another character. I wasn’t really asking for another camp, just ranting
---
There's already a perk card for that. Maxes out at 80 DR.
---
What about a vendor box in the survival tents? I’m sure it would be an incentive for more f1st subs and it’s not like we don’t already know BGS loves money over everything.
---
That’s really odd.
---
Cool those are litteraly my last 2 left
---
Cap sinks exist for a reason.
---
With calibrated shocks on both legs of a level 50 excavator you can get close to 500 I think
---
Happy to hear it works for other people too :) and yeah that makes sense, especially since all my notes and holos really add up to a lot of individual items
---
(Those and books are the main things I always collect in Bethesda games, I love the lore, I always tried to get every book in Skyrim)
---
^ this is my entire point
---
Probably helpful to wait to do your weekly 3 levels until the weekend as well, as it will be really easy each day
---
I’ll call with a 1* instigating golf club. Drained ALL my ammo to get it.
---
Yes.
---
Does the weapon have some sort of inherent explosive dmg? I noticed I had science and master science still equipped.so I changed them out and replaced them with demolition expert rank 4/5and the guns dmg went up from 1600ish to a lil over 2k. Had to log out real quick after making  my masterpiece to eat lol all I can remember is that it had bloodied 40 bash and agi.. so idk what's going on really sry
---
God ty lol
---
And all was well till someone deconstructed thier white whale for some wood, steel, a spring, and some screws....
---
Fast Traveling should be free altogether now. From what I understand, the reason for it having a cost was a pvp thing, where if a player is killed, they'd have to fast travel to get back to you, the cost incentives you to not keep going back and griefing the player.
---
PvP is basically non-existent now so I don't get the point of the cost in Fast Travel anymore.
---
Fort defiance has 2 iirc

It’s just unfair at the end of the day, it just completely leaves you open to be killed

Turned into a meat pile for me. Even the camera trick couldn’t find it. Thankfully someone saw me and two other people running around with question emotes and he stood over it calling us over.
---
I’m sure they would rather play working games than this bugged disaster. We should get atoms every time the game crashes. I could buy the entire shop.
---
Thank you for the post. I server hopped, and restarted my game and that didn’t work. I restarted my ps4 while I looked up the video you recommended, and when I got back into game, I was allowed to delete the structure.
---
Did they do any graphical improvements? Cuz im like you, I tried it when it came out, didn’t like it — i dowloaded it again a few days ago and it literally looked like a different game. I figured it was just me but now idk
---
I’ve noticed that when in power armor, despite my legendary armor being much stronger, Gutsy bots can’t really hurt me much. My theory is they just rail you in the head where you have no DR with almost every shot.
---
Probably noon. But why would you do it so early?
---
I am saving my atoms in case I need to skip the last couple levels at the end of the ten weeks.
---
It does indicate what player launched a nuke, if that's what you mean.
---
this one is especially difficult for those of us with a high luck build.  everything i pick up is already 100%+!
---
I'm Rank 40.  I'm still able to progress a little over 1 rank per day, sometimes 2, which is what you need to do in order to stay afloat.  But it gets much harder to rank up as it goes on because the SCORE required goes up +25 each rank.
---
If you factor in the Weeklies, you should be able to keep up this one-rank-a-day business up to about Rank 60 without needing to do the Repeatable, but thereafter, you will need to hit that Repeatable a good 9-10 times.  Which isn't that hard if you're doing all the things that boost INT (if it remains based on XP - there's an Event repeatable too that we've yet to see).  If you're not, though, this becomes odious quite quickly.
---
To me, the negative part that surrealp touches on as well is that the Board goes into a kind of drought from Rank 40 to Rank 70 where there's just nothing particularly interesting to earn.  In fact, most of the rewards have been lackluster.  The Ghillie armor is just terrible, the Power Armor is nothing special, the Ammo Converter was a joke.  Really, just about the only thing that stood out for the better was that Sheepsquatch plush.
---
My camp is very close to Foundation. I get nice traffic there because many people still need to go there everyday.
---
I have this happen on hotkeys on PC! Weapon switch hangs and I have to scramble back till it completes
---
Yup. Seeing low level vendors again stuffed full of missiles and mininukes. I smh every time.
---
I almost ALWAYS see one in the cookong area of Flatwoods. But I'm on ps4 and ofc, ymmv.
---
I'd rather go to a level 38 tbh. I jump to WS high level vendors and find non legendary fixers and BOS combat armour and other over priced rubbish. A lot of long term and full time players use low level alts to sell their stuff nowdays. Personally I have 3 alts under level 50 selling all my left over 3* scrip, cheap chems and unrepaired Crossbows.
---
Mama Dulces Feed the People event. In office ground floor.
---
Just go to the prison. There’s one rifht there and 10 ghouls. 2 challenges bing bang boom.
---
Honestly, that's what I love about the budget in a challenging way, its a challenge to figure out just how to get the most out of your budget through creative use.
---
I found one it was 5k though
---
This would be so cool. I totally agree that there needs to be more stuff for various "builds" to really feel complete and fleshed out.
---
I like to play like a melee/heavy "tank" and with melee getting kinda nerfed since the start, diseases being really prevalent, and enemies ignoring me to go hit the little guys, it's not as fun as it could be.
---
I'd rather they just got rid of the scrip cap. It's annoying. 
---
Unless scrapping them gave me modules (guaranteed). 
---
I have to craft another 40 billion guns before I get my first Bloody one.
---
Weve all gotten xp off the backs of people higher leveled than us. Its the circle of life
---
There was a bug on launch for pc players downloading the game that resulted in many players not being able to play yet as well.
---
The essay thing never actually happened, it was just people trying to go “hur dur todd howard bad”
---
But anyways no they do not ban for client side graphics mods, the official stance is that they are not supported, meaning if you fuck up your game don’t expect help.
---
Wtf. How
---
Buy it I would pay more than that easy lol
---
Amazon as in the Brazilian Amazon or the e-bay like website? My performance is good on ultra, it's high latency I'm sure
---
I did buy it
---
#pcmasterrace
---
Have fun with your shitbox lmao
---
There is a guy I ask like 12hrs ago that just said he'd sell his for 15 or 20k and I just laughed
---
Yes, I run into this a lot with Scorched that are in "poses". I recently took the Speed Demon mutation and Marathoner so I just run up to things and hit them with my Instigating stick.
---
Lots of times I kill them before they can react and they're just stuck in the position they were in and are unlootable. 
---
Gotta wait a moment, but yeah definitely feels like a bug.
---
I'm just about to 760 hours and I think that should be more than enough to get those 20 atoms lol
---
Bingo
---
Meh, at this point in the timeline, I'll agree that "mortal enemies" isn't accurate. I don't think that they'd like the existence of one another though, and there's a ton of elements already in the game to kick off their potentially-violent disdain for each other. If I join the evil faction, I want to forward their agenda, and I can't imagine it would be to help them establish a presence in Appalachia.
---
I think it’s more there so you can track your hours played rather than something to strive for
---
West Tek, White Springs Golf Club, The Barrows. There’s a few others but I can’t think of them at the moment.
---
Agreed. I'm also a little disappointed that snappibg the vendor to the counters doesn't fully work, and that there aren't any Slocum's Joe themed tables to go with the chairs.
---
Aaaand that there's not a just flat wall sign for the store name like you see out in the world (like the one in Morgantown).
---
Like idk it's kind of annoying to me when the assets exist and they're not in the bundle?
---
It's a shame Bethesda cares so little about build diversity. You have multiple DPS playstyles, and maybe a few effective Tank builds, but Support is neglected so hard. What's baffling is we have a SPECIAL stat that is pretty much totally dedicated to Support, however making an effective Support build is a real challenge.
---
That's some epic long game right there. God Bless the Enclave!
---
That's not much honestly. If he still wants to sell it tell him to message me tomorrow same gt as on here. I'll give him 20k
---
And here I was arriving at level 39 tonight, thinking I was doing well and coming in ahead of my target.
---
Go suck a dick jackass
---
Then just add a stats menu?
---
Maybe. But we'll see. Between work and too tired for gaming, I just haven't had time or energy to grind. This event is perfect for people with the free time in the pandemic, but that is not me.
---
I will only buy the levels that have 150 atom rewards as the next level. Basically, it'll be a free level up. 
---
Other than that, no. I'm not paying to gain levels.
---
Has this been updated? That is depressing if so... I have the grocer’s backpack.
---
You can pay to win the legendary run?
---
&gt; Fast Traveling should be free altogether now.
---
Agreed.
---
And with the new public teams feature, it's now possible to have 9 different static free fast travel locations all around the map (4 camps, 4 tents, and 76), plus the other players themselves if you're not together and playing split. This renders paying for fast travel completely moot. Might as well just get rid of it altogether.
---
If you're running bloodied take off your unyielding gear, otherwise yea you're stuck.
---
Does this move the whole game? I don't have enough space on my c drive I don't even know why.
---
Just some raving lunatic. It'd fit my camp vibe. 
---
He's just walking around screaming or saying things that make little to no sense. Over there doing the idle animation for gardening and he's just screaming as loudly as he can. 
---
which tbh is a mood when physical labor is involved in anything.
---
Yeah, I was really sad when I went to the bunker after logging into Wastelanders for the first time and there was no upgraded tech. I'm fine grinding through treasury notes. Just give me something.
---
I wonder how much it’ll cost to buy the whole board
---
so for me, it's complete x amount of ten, like different robots. get down to my last eyebot check challenges yep 1 more to go, kill... and nothing, no pop up. check challenges and it is complete.
---
Current option =  mesothelioma or no mesothelioma.
---
It's 5pm for me when it resets!
---
What happens when ZORBO reaches the end of the board?
---
Exactly! The game is dominated with Bloodied builds and Junkie's builds. I don't remember the last time I saw a good Vanguard build. 
---
As it stands, support builds are non-existant. I think the syringer with some added perk cards would offer so much for a support build. Most support cards or legendaries help with healing or removing rads, but alot of bloodied builds don't need that "VATS critical heals nearby allies" and they definitely do not want rad sponge. 
---
I'm glad you think its a good idea.
---
I sent him your gt so hope you get it bro good luck
---
Anywhere a lot of mobs spawn really. West tek and whitespring are the main ones but it’s honestly all RNG. I’ve gone to Tanagra town acid farming and gotten 2 legendary cave crickets as well as another legendary at the old station below. I did awol armaments earlier and got 4 legendaries. 
---
I’ve been to west tek and got not a single legendary from like 20 super mutants, yet yesterday I went there and there were 5. Most I’ve seen recently was nuked grove in the bog, I had 7 legendaries spawn there.
---
Or an Insult Bot collectron!
---
The vender steal glitch is still occurring and ignored by Bethesda so we can't just have it by the spawn!
---
Well, I live in South-east Asia (Singapore to be exact), it's kinda hard if I want to take a country that is outside my own to court... Anyway, the customer service personnel refused to help until 72 hours. Denying me the service I paid for, wasting my time to slowly move through inside the game lugging along all the damn scrap when I can use the time to fast travel to the locations instead, making me give up events (e.g. I'm at Aaronholt farm, oh here comes the Scorched Earth event -\_-). Really "nice" customer service they have there... they insisted  the 72 hours to see if the situation solves itself, I'm gonna demand compensation for all my troubles for that.
---
Hopefully the data mined R91 skin can be put on Fixers.
---
And we all know it belongs to Crater, not them.
---
Thanks man!
---
Huh? Your flair is PS4 Help.. but you’re asking about Xbox and PC.. which is it?
---
Their music catalogue hasn't grown  much since fallout 3 because of money, in two ways.
---
The organization that held the rights to most of the songs you hear on the radio from FO3, NV, and FO4, were bought out. They specialized in digitizing old music.
---
I believe they also got licensing rights to some songs from a government funded archive that was defunded in recent years.
---
They're going to have to find a different way to use "new" old music in their games
---
From Rank 40 to Rank 100 it’s 9,000 Atoms
---
One could argue you need to manage your weight better, but I’m sitting here with 53,000lbs of crap in my scrapbox... Total game changer.
---
Try closing your camp menu and restarting that. If that fails, try server hoping. If THAT fails, try rebooting your game.
---
Piper wrights great grandma
---
I want Aries or Eugenie or Weasel lol
---
that sounds amazing. i imagined him as a mothman cultist
---
150 atoms per rank starting tomorrow I think?
---
I think a scientist or doctor would be pretty fun, or something similar to C.U.R.I.E or Codsworth would be cool for a robot ally.
---
The Tombstone references are on point, but honestly the best advice for the victim is to put on pacifist mode and mind their own business.
---
Workshops aren't worth the effort vs farming and i don't mind going rounds with "anti griefers". Happens at my wife's trap base all the time with white knights trying to defend or warn people.
---
statistically, yes. however unless you are buying modules there is nothing else to do with it so if you have scrip, spend it.
---
Jesus christ man
---
A few people have commented on this. I dont know if it has always been the case or if updates have broken something.
---
My game stutters when I run too fast lmao.
---
Starting tomorrow 150 atoms jumps you to the next rank regardless of score needed
---
Wonder if anyone is anywhere close. And if anyone does hit that Mark they need to be contacted by Bethesda with a voucher for the next fallout for free. That is a crazy amount of time on one game. I have had my gamertag a long time and I bet I don't have that many hours into every game combined!
---
Well the use of the FO1st membership's scrapbox is exactly what I am keeping the scrap for. It's just that my previous membership expired (I cancelled the monthly payment to prevent it from auto deducting :P), and I tried to purchase a new one to continue putting scrap into the scrapbox. But well I'm denied of that, so...
---
*laughs in the 100k of caps worth of guns I've gotten in the past 3 days from using all my scrips*
---
I'm pretty sure Bethesda uses Amazon web services for their servers, but to be honest I really don't know that much about it all. Here's a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9slo4j/the_servers_are_in_the_cloud_pete_hines/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) I guess. Remember this branch of the studio is still new with online multi-player.
---
Edit to clarify, yes Amazon the eBay like online web service. They do a lot more these days than just online delivery.
---
Did you attach a roof or another wall above or below?
---
You still get more exp from events by switching over to events team at the end of the event, and can maximize your exp gain by being building team otherwise. So really, even if you're farming events building team is pretty much what you want to be on the majority of the time.
---
Getting pretty close to halfway.....
---
I have heard rumors of possible score bugs you could do to get super high levels or even complete it by now, can't confirm it though. I guess a level like this is theoretically possible with little sleep and doing nothing but 76, possibly even having multiple people playing on one character.
---
Better than casual players. I do the dailies, weeklies and some grinding and am at 35. You're doing great.
---
Woah, that’s a new one to report I guess. Have not had that instance.
---
No I was just changing walls and all of a sudden it denied me to change all my walls including the walls I already built beforehand
---
“xbox beta pass pc” ok grandpa get off the computer
---
If theyre cheap enough I'll buy em for my ammo machine, but they're almost always like 50 caps a pop and then the head shaking commences.
---
Candles! Bonfires! Those metal cans with fire in give a really cosy glow.
---
That Mothman Hunter outfit looked pretty dope..
---
I will make a floating light out of bounds (or out of sight) because the light permeates **everything**.
---
A Mothman Cultist Priest, his daily quests send you off to help other Mothman cultists. ALL Mothman cultists are non-hostile while he is at your camp unless you attack them. sometimes the wise Mothman may visit your camp and you can commune with it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
a Malfunctioning Mr. Handy with split personality programming, it constantly switches between Handy and Gutsy. his quests would revolve around you collecting parts to try to separate his two personality programmings. when completed the Gutsy goes off and becomes a wandering merchant/pops up sometimes to give you daily quests.
---
a Stranded Zetan Alien who sees you as a primitive creature, but is just friendly enough to get you to help them contact the mother-ship for emergency pickup. their quest line would revolve around making a communicator, protecting the Beacon against camp attacks (it angers Scorched and Scorchbeasts).
---
okay dumbass get off reddit

It makes me so sad to find tapes with elder maxson on in the brotherhood place. I guess he'd be long dead by this game.

---
I’ll swap out sniper for long shot depending on situation. Same with adamantium skeleton, lone wanderer. Since adrenaline is bugged I’ll taken those points and gotten demolition expert as I’m using an instigating explosive handmade and the extra INT is good for leveling in the season.
---
Only need power to show on map
---
I find the raider punk to be the most unobtrusive. Ditched the astronaut in 5 minutes, she's a creepy weirdo. The old man needs new jokes and probably to be in jail. Tried to keep the wanderer around but that song grates after a while and she really needs a shower.
---
Every character should have an Ally option.
---
Power just makes them visible on the map, they are active as long as they are there. Gotta store or scrap them to make then inactive
---
Same as OP for me — mostly the WS.
---
remember when someone bought fallout 4 i think with actual bottlecaps
---
Wonkey...love it
---
It'd be nice to have different camp slots. I have five characters all with great camps. I still want and should be able to build.
---
Contrary opinion: I like pipe weapons. I like railway rifles and fire axes. Some Fat Man launchers aren't so bad. The idea that some weapons are preferred just doesn't work because it means that the devs play the game, and would spend time to identify desirable weapons and then code that in. Furthermore, if something *was* favored in the code that would undoubtedly have been discovered in the code by now.
---
No the artillery box was by far bigger.
---
Powering a vending machine just lets the icon show up on the map. 
---
To stop people from buying stuff, you either need to completely block off your vendors, either in a room or with barricades, or you need to store them.
---
Did you remove a floor or foundation?
---
At your perk screen press the left bumper to highlight the stat who's cards you want to see.
---
I'll wait towards the end of the season and buy the last 20 or so levels i'm expecting i'll need.
---
Yeah, I'm getting the same error.
---
well i’m sorry i have no idea what xbox beta pass pc is
---
what score level is everyone on right now and what should you be on minimum if you want to be on the right track?
---
you mentioned 2 different platforms and a service that is available on both but i’ll get off reddit and play fallout 76 because my “dumbass” can at least figure that out
---
He's still alive for another 30 something years. FO76 only takes place like 25 years after the great war.
---
Well learned something new today. Thanks for the info.
---
5050 hours, if I get there I'll hopefully be the first to ask for something. Thinking of afking while I sleep to cheat my way there at this point! FML!
---
No...he is alive and well on the west coast as the holotapes say.
---
Yes, since Wastelanders, lights have a massive radius and shine through walls.

Sometimes useful, sometimes not so much.

I just found the problem after an hour of searching the problem i had my collectron blocking a segment of the wall above the second floor
---
Try random encounter spots. If you're on ps4 I could give you a method that will yield probably 10-15 legendary enemies with no server hops, nukes or events.
---
If I could I would
---
9am PST
---
You will get a chance to pick it the next time you level up.
---
hmm I don't think I've done this one but I've done line in the sand plenty of times got 7 levels once doing it a couple days on a new char. Just a lowbie with his bowie knife stabbing like crazy.
---
I hope that we can either have 2 allies or have pets stay at our camp.
---
Ty For helping me trying to find the problem
---
I'm playing on a one x, it's still happens to me.
---
They supposedly drop also from Defend Events (workshops)
---
Honestly, I sell all my stuff super cheap. Any caps are better than no caps, and clearing out stash space is crucial.
---
Radiation Rumble event is usually good for half dozen or so.
---
True, true. Rather just spend the caps, we need mounts dammit! I demand ride-able brahmans.
---
Top of Watoga Civic Center. Legendary 3 star super mutie always spawns for me.
---
Theres something about letting another man take what's yours, that screams weak to me.
---
Some people want workshop because they find them interesting. Some people want them as passive resource generation while they do other shit. People have all sorts of reasons why they do the things that they do - I'm just offering a means to violently smash your opposition. Capitalism baby.
---
Also pacifist is so lame. Get saucy and live a little!
---
Awesome list! From memory I believe lunchboxes don't overwrite the well rested bonus. I believe I had both running recently :)

Don't for get the eyebot pied piper who leads the rats around. I see this lil' guy all the time and always makes me laugh.

nice thanks for that

Sugar Grove blacksite entrance.
---
In my shop area I have what look like fluorescent hanging lights, they light up everything. I have like track lighting and some lamps in my house but I like it not as bright.
---
Would love text chat so I can say "Bro I'm RPing that's why I'm wondering why you keep referring to this as a game"
---
Having people in the area doesn't increase her health, as you have been told repeatedly.
---
I was solo. I joined a team at the end, though.
---
Punish me daddy.
---
It’s humor. Like how the ones to kill robots, all the amounts are 1010 or any combination of 1s and 0s 
---
Because robots are computers.
---
What should I absolutely be using
---
Good lord that person has to be trolling. I just don't know why people take gaming so seriously. Like don't get me wrong I love to min/max but that's like...unhealthy.
---
If that fails, send me money.
---
Question - are on Xbox? I’d love to see the raider tree if you’d be willing. Great work!
---
Standing on fences/tents is absolutely a problem _if you are the one currently drawing her aggro_ .  You will know if/when she's focused on you and when you are please be in a place where she can land eg not in a ditch or on a tent with no space to land evenly.
---
Maybe it has something to do with detection and over encumbrance? I seem to recall that has something to do with it. But I'm just guessing.
---
Servers only hold 24 people.
---
Servers are all around that number. Game is currently a top 20 game on Xbox
---
Gotta store them since power only make them visible on the map. My solution is usually putting vending machines in a room accessible only thru a garage door. Then wire a switch that is accessible by you only, that turns off the vendor power and shuts the garage door.
---
That sounds so boring to be honest. Less damage and more interesting changes.
---
It was all junkies, but no god rolls. Going with heavy weapons or rifles at the moment.
---
I'm surprised it was that low.  I got swarmed whenever I'd drop a bag of useless junk after a Fasnacht.
---
No not her health her damage resist but argue it all you want i have proved it to myself and thats all I count I have tested it privatly me on my own server I hit her for easily a 16th of her health but when my friends all finally join 7 more people my damage goes down to 10s I use a shotgun build so distance is a factor in testing i used the fancy pump on the right wing rite under it you can screem it ill never believe you
---
I thought I saw on the website that every time you update your ticket it moves to the back of the line.
---
Weapons you find on tables and such can always be repaired no matter your stats.
---
Screaming Eagle skin isn't even based off an AK is it? Looks more like an M4 or similar..
---
Alas those who die just before it does means they'll never be able to loot it if that's the case....
---
And digested goo.
---
Crawling to the nearest station whilst listening to ominous flapping overhead and letting my chameleon armour activate about every five seconds pretty much sums up my experiences up north.
---
I'll have to go back and look as I didn't see a chat option or a phone number.
---
I use Cloudy01's mod manager. It has a Nuclear Winter mode for quick and easy enabling/disabling mods for NW. I know some people don't like managers, but this one may interest you for that reason. Cheers!
---
People are greedy by nature..
---
Or, you know, an AK 74 which fires 5.45, and can be had in 5.56 as well.
---
Is this really the hill you want to die on for this game?
---
Can’t agree more. I made a space/red rocket themed camp this most recent time and it turned out great (space wallpaper with red rocket lights at each of the crafting stations and a couple of the bright downward-angled bright lights to look like “suns”), but the glaring lack of stars on the ceiling really takes away from it.
---
I'm pretty sure they just made it a mix of real parts to reinterpret the F3 AR without having to actually add in a whole new gun.
---
It’s a shame how they implemented this weapon skin in the game in the first place.
---
I have been in RP group in FFXIV and eso and never talk like that lol
---
Right. If you're certifying a game for a console  and core gameplay functions cause it to hang, that's on your code/testing, not the console.
---
Thanks everyone! I haven't been able to play in a couple days but getting on now to try again, now that I know what to do! Get the key card from the body 👍
---
Why do people insist on "realism" when it comes to firearms in fallout games? 
---
The entire setting is an alternate universe. There are 2 headed mutant cows and roaches the size of large dogs. 
---
The least unrealistic thing is the caliber the handmade rifle uses.
---
He probably grinded exp hard
---
People should also check just how much time you put into this. You're a person who clearly doesn't mind spending hours on tedium. The old system of doing challenges for Atoms had none of this crazy grind.
---
I'd insist it give me water ice.  I have plenty of cryo rounds and water.
---
Not at all. It actually would make sense since it's a side-charging AR-15 model (similar to an AR-18 if you look it up, but on the wrong side). These were originally chambered in 5.56 / .223 which is what the handmade is in-game.
---
The original skin of the handmade resembles an AK-47, or an AKM which would have been chambered in the Russian 7.62x39mm. FO3 also had their Chinese Assault Rifle chambered in 5.56, which I always attributed to the idea that since the Chinese figured they'd need to loot for ammo when they invaded, they chambered their guns for the invasion in 5.56, but there's no lore (to my knowledge) of that, and I'm guessing Bethesda was just too lazy to make multiple calibers for rifles.
---
Weasel 🖤
---
I don't get how they haven't done it already, considering the overwhelming demand.  
---

What do u have to do to get that far? I haven’t even passed the first marker.
---
We no longer stock water ice. Water cannot also be ice.
---
I would like to hope so. Either way, it doesn't effect me whether they cheated or not.
---
Yeah, believe that actually starts this week or next
---
That option will be made available tomorrow
---
Well done
---
Not hoping to die. Would just like guns better repped in games I play. I go to Nuclear Winter when I want to die on a hill for Bethesda.
---
I think it’s coming tommorow since Tuesday will be the end of the 2nd week of the legendary run. Plus atomic shop gets updated
---
Part of the problem you aren't grasping is, Bethesda aren't religiously gun enthusiasts, they never have been. To this day, one of my biggest pet peeves as a minor detail has been Kellog shooting your spouse in Fallout 4 with his revolver and you hear the casing clinking to the floor as if it was ejected from the gun like a magazine fed gun.
---
Anyway, the only reason New Vegas' guns were so great was because they had more enthusiasm over the mechanics of their guns, especially JE Sawyer, who is a big gun geek.
---
I've been running bloodied lately and don't have a problem.
---
Not sure why it is often overlooked.
---
The chance of learning a new modification on armor is notoriously low. Less than 1% if I’m not mistaken. It is best to maximize your INT to the best of your ability to increase said chance. 
---
Edit: by scrapping the armor piece
---
You don't get mods by crafting. You get it by scrapping.
---
Its supposed to be a 75% chance (from first google result) to learn it from scrapping them.
---
Here’s another: people who fill the troughs in Project Paradise, and those who stay with the animals while others take the Alpha. Equally as boring as herding, but it makes a difference.
---
Rank up by completing challenges...
---
Or spend atoms starting tomorrow but seriously... you have 8 more weeks.

Camp McClintock top floor. Level zero, too. I'm the same room as the Mr. Gutsy.

Must be all those people that "wouldn't even play fallout 76 if it were free."
---
It’s so random anymore. West tek has not given me anything after a week of straight runs I’ve only gotten a 1 star legendary mutant and a 2 star hound. Whitespring use to be 1 to 2 legendaries at the golf club. I would just sit out the window and they would all come right there. But something happened when wastelanders came out. They will not come to the window and I’ve gone through it numerous times and not a single legendary. The watoga train station sometimes that little tower that’s right near it when walking towards prime fissure can have a couple legendaries. As in yesterday 3 cave crickets where legendary. And like the one person said awol had 2 one day for me. But anymore there’s really no sure way
---
Thanks, weird that it happened to me I never play in the morning at all. I guess it was the NW last login thing.
---
Appreciate it!
---
All im imagining is a person slowly walking while they are carrying a bag twice their size and its banging and clattering with pots and pans.
---
With pretty much any robot that's not an Assaultron or Eyebot, hit their weapons. When they're crippled, they detonate and do a ton of damage to the robot (and may even set them on fire for even more damage over time). Even Colonel Gutsy crumples like a cheap suit if you hit 'below the belt,' as it were.
---
Chat options on the bethesda website. I had to Google to find the number.
---
Metalpile.
---
How much different could you make 3 different rifles of that variant?
---
 The battle rifle, I can see it being added as a semi-auto alternative to the hunting rifle while having more stopping power than a combat rifle or handmade rifle. Unless you're using Prime .308 for a Hunting Rifle, .308 kinda just sits in your inventory, waiting to be used by a lmg. 
---
But the Chinese Assault rifle, I don't see being added. There were skins for the handmade to make it look like FO3's chinese assault rifle. They really should've just made the Handmade a 7.62 because the tin can Assault Rifle was already chambered in 5.56, so they seem too closely related. 
---
As for the Service Rifle/All-American rifle from NV, that's basically the Screaming Eagle without the carry handle sight (which is sorely missed) As much as I hate to admit it, they won't add a Service Rifle to 76 as it'll be seen as a Combat Rifle clone and people would question why the Screaming Eagle was ever made for a handmade rifle. 
---
I guess this is the best we can get. Hopefully the upcoming R91 rifle skin can be put on a Fixer.
---
We get magical guns that do extra damage if you’re hurt or high but god forbid if the bullets don’t match up right
---
Im not sure if NW XP applies to the weekly challenge... but even if it did I still think you can get better XP in game.  2k XP is easy to get in adventure with daily turn ins alone.  
---
But dont let that stop you if you enjoy the BR mode.
---
im ready hah. i have 262 berry mentats and 100 on an alt ready to go!
---
I thought that it looked a whole bunch like an Israeli FAL.

---
In that case, the 7.62 NATO would be correct, since that’s what FAL’s are chambered in. 
---
For OP: They do make AK variants in both 5.56 and 7.62. They’re produced under the Saiga name though, so a little hard to find if you don’t already know what you’re looking for.
---
Yea fortunately i think majority of the players don’t want to have anything to do with duping. It cheapens the gameplay, greatly shortens the lifespan of the game, ruins the in-game market, and always result in more nerfing simply because everyone is instantly OP.  The only ones who reap the benefits are those who make real world money out of this exploit.
---
Not looking for realism. I'm fine with whatever goofy designs and guns Bethesda releases. What I dislike is inconsistency in the content. If they choose to make a handmade which looks like an AK, operates like an AK but uses 5.56, great for them. I'm all aboard. Just don't label a skin for a 5.56 gun with a 7.62 NATO label. Just want some consistency is all.
---
I imagine a BOS ally will be a given, but id like some diversity too like maybe a super mutant, assualtron, pets ofcourse, and maybe ghoul. But id trade half of that wishlist for Weasel. Come on Bethesda, we want big boom!
---
The Brotherhood and Enclave in the west don’t meet or learn of each other until Fallout 2. While they could meet in 76 and have that not contradict anything (both factions in Appalachia are out of contact with the west), it wouldn’t really have any connection to  their later conflicts in Fallout 2 and 3.
---
Mesothelioma has a lower budgetary cost or at least did
---
Weirds me out a little when team member shows up to my camp and sits there waiting for me to make a move, as captain. I’m looking all over the map,nothing.  Is he afk or rally just sitting there?   Yeah he’s there....been there this whole time, weird!  Map.....nothing.   Broguy checking my water filters.  Come on god dammit just a uranium fever, shit I’ll take swarm of suitors at this point!   Nothing.  And still rando player 4206969666broguy is at my camp....staring at me.
---
A pet.. Dog, Wolf, Radrat or Mole Rat
---
Cool ally would be Mole Miner, Super Mutant or Baby Deathclaw, Radscorpian or Yao Guai
---
Robots of various types would be nice but Mr Handy or Assaultron would make the most sense
---
No, the chance is 0.75%.

---
Yes you can. The system is designed with pay to win in mind. You're supposed to get invested in the season. Then when you near the end and the SCORE needed to advance ramps up, Bethesda hopes you'll pay your way to the finish line for fear of missing out. Most players are not MMO grind lunatics.
---
I got a fall damage SS jetpack torso and a fall damage SS leg, both Unyielding, and I gotta tell ya, it's pretty much the best thing in this whole game.
---
Sorry I meant that I had crafted then scrapped
---
Fallout 76 uses the same DR/ER system as Fallout 4, which doesn't have locational damage for players (at least in terms of how the shot is resisted). Your full DR/ER is applied to any hit, regardless of where they hit you.
---
I feel that. I was hoping for a return of the Free States, as Raileigh Clay isn't confirmed dead or alive. All we know is that the Scorched and Strangler Vines made the Free States go missing.
---
I would be tickled pink if Raleigh led the Free States back to West Virginia as a neutral alternative to the Enclave and BOS.
---
I had an issue, but it could have been from a shutting down from Xbox rather than logging off, then I tried to start the game the next day, got kicked out of the game, then found the autocomplete of stuff I did previously on a different day.  I didn't have an issue from being online during the reset.
---
I've been following your mob route roughly and it's out me at around lvl 47. Amazing how much XP a single kill can get you.
---
They make a wide variety I realize, even some 9mm variants I've seen. I definitely see the resemblance to the FAL there now that you mention it. For me, the trigger guard, grips and stock gave me more of an AR look, but either way just the idea of using 7.62 NATO, in a gun that's chambered in 5.56, which is based on a gun originally made in 7.62x39. I find it somewhat funny.
---
Does bird bones solve that problem? Currently modding my SS stuff and wondering if I need the fall prots.
---
Oh dear God, please do this. Sooooo many 40mm grenade rounds find their way into my inventory from doing events

Who is the Pied Piper not? 🤔 I don't think I've met him.

I do the same a lot, but always like a challenge. I'm not as bloodthirsty as others. If you're on xbox you can catch a real challenge with me. If you're on pc, im just now reaching level 48 and playing with 0 friends or gear so I can see how everyone else sees the game. 
---
Xbox gt: RadSammichEater
---
Can i ask why?
---
Perk Loadout Manager is at the top of the list, and it does what you think. Save Everything is right behind it. Keeps you from accidentally scrapping favorites and lets you type numbers where the game only gives you sliders, like pricing items in your vendor. Once Text Chat is working again in a couple of days, you want to get that too. 
---
Better Inventory and either Kit's Killer Strings or Ratmonkey's Tagging and Sorting (only one works at a time, I use Kit's but the other is good too). Two of those together is such a massive QoL upgrade for inventory management and junk sorting. 
---
Glowing meat piles, glowing ores, glowing plans. You want them all. I run all these and some more that I'm forgetting, but these are the ones I could not play without.
---
I'd like to think that too, here on Reddit pretty much every time I've posted something against duping I always get a bunch of people shouting that it's a good thing and everyone should have whatever weapon they want and stuff like that
---
The money traders are the worst, but there are also those who just want to be the strongest they possibly can and don't care if the market gets ruined in the process
---
I'd try asking Bethesda support on that in your ticket. I'm sure they'd know best
---
Not entirely. I tested it with Bird Bones, one piece of 50% Fall gear and Goat Legs. Still took some
---
damage.
---
Awesome, now install a new string mod (such as https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/523) because Fo76 inventory management is life 😂
---
Is there a way to do this with a melee weapon since I'm a purely melee build any attempt to use a gun result in bad damage
---
The revive two players in NW is incredibly time consuming. Most people die in the open and since you can't crawl when downed in NW the only way to revive them is wipe the enemy team before they finish them off.
---
Even if it was only revive one player this is a hard skip for me, I'd prefer to kill 9 creatures!
---
I think you could merge / divert existing rifles already in-game. The handmade could turn into your AK (7.62x39) with all that goes with that, the big water cooled assault rifle we have in game now could get the service rifle makeover, then all that would be left would be a .308 full auto R91. With this setup, the .308 is really over covered by the hunting rifle and light machine gun, but with one a rifleman style weapon, and the other technically a heavy weapon, that allows the R91 to slide into a Commando style rifle.
---
The thing is I’ve tried but I feel like I’m not explaining myself and they gave me like two answers “Note that linking the same or a different Xbox account to the unlinked Bethesda.net account will allow access to this game data via the newly linked Xbox account.” Right after saying I would lose all my progress...I just don’t want to sound annoying and have them just ignore me :(
---
It looks like they just reused the sign that's by your bed in Vault 76 when you first start a character. That was manual as well.
---
Same here. I've got so many in my stash, I was perfectly fine using a bunch to finish that challenge.
---
It won't remove any addictions you currently have, no. Try to find Addictol from chems vendors or by doing the Guided Meditation event. Or if you just have the one addiction, Radscorpion Egg Omelettes will do the trick too.
---
If you don't usually play NW, and you're over level 50 in Adventure, you'll have a bunch of unopened perk packs there that you can open and gain XP from. You'll level without ever even playing a round.
---
Well glad to be wrong thanks for the correction.
---
Cool got it. Thank you.
---
Got it, thank you.
---
You are right that is a close resemblance
---
I’d say either whitespring station or the station right next to top of the world. I often see 2-3 camps clustered around that station.

Hey man, that video really helped me. I watched it and it helped a lot. Thank you so much😎

Read the Bethesda response.

I just show up when it suits me and as long as I get there early enough I always tag it enough for loot.. I have no real interest in farming the event on a regular basis

Thanks for the suggestions here everyone, I derped around for an hour today looking in places that I thought I remembered one and never found a terminal.

Why doesn't the link work? I want to see it!

The split personality mr handy is amazing! I love that idea
---
&gt; the idea of using 7.62 NATO, in a gun that's chambered in 5.56, which is based on a gun originally made in 7.62x39. I find it somewhat funny.
---
I’m totally with you and I agree. For what it’s worth, looking at it in the Atomic Shop reminded me of the Service Rifles from FONV until I threw it on one of my handmades and looked at the charging handle, the forearm and the sights. Those are what made me think of an Israeli FAL. 
---
In the interests of bending your brain a little more, Eugene Stoner originally designed the AR rifle to be 7.62 NATO. We’re really only used to them in 5.56 because the Army wanted the design but wanted the lighter (and much cheaper) 5.56. That’s really the only difference between the AR-10 and AR-15 as designed by Armalite. In fact, if I’m remembering correctly, the time period of the release of the AR-10 would line up pretty well with the 50’s aesthetic of the game. 
---
Hang on. I’ll google and then edit if I’m wrong.
---
Edit: The Great Google Machine tells me that the AR-10 was released in 1956 so it would definitely fit.
---
If possible maybe the Level Up! (0/1) being changed every other day.
---
It gets harder and harder to level up and I dont have nearly enough time to consistently level up once a day. That's the one daily I end up missing out on and only getting every 3rd or 4th day
---
Just aim, as far as I know. You don't need to VATS target a limb to do locational damage to it. With ranged weapons, at least, I get pretty much the same effect just manually focusing my fire on a limb as I do targeting it in VATS. But I've never made a melee character, so I can't say for sure.
---
Yeah, it’s waaaay to early to be spending Atoms on this. Unless someone absolutely knows they can play for the next eight weeks and has that kind of disposable cash to drop on this. 
---
There’s got to be a few players out there like that, I’m sure.
---
Considering it’s an end game weapon, it’s rare af
---
Everybody on here is really helpful sometimes when they aren't being a d bag. You were one of the helping ones😁
---
Correct. It's an assaultron, so it turns into a metal pile. Confirmed that the other day when I couldn't find it for about ten minutes after it exploded, and just looted every metal pile I could find until I happened upon the right one.
---
Its been 2 weeks already? Jesus. Those 2 weeks flew by. Not fallout related specifically just in general.

Did hardcore GTAV RP for awhilke. you didn't mention "the real world" sometimes someones would slip up and say their game would crash and my char would say "Wouldn't this be fucked up if our whole lives were just a stupid video game and some asshole was controlling our every actions". Buying stuff with real money was called "bitcoin", logging out? "Leaving the city", so when someone told me to join their team chat in the menu "I asked him if he had the radio unit for my pip boy so I could do that" and he just kicked me out of the group instead lmao. We would bullshit OOC stuff in the text chats though but voice was 100% in char, guess it stuck.
---
Is it still there?
---
Dogmeat.
---
Did you check your pip boy quest data for an Ally quest? It never starts tracking the quest automatically for me on PS4. I have to go manually track it then it shows up on my map.
---
Yes so far

I got your mask if you can get me a BE vats Assault Rifle or something of the sort.

I think some bloodied guys are about to kill it

Thats why you wear your jetpack

Yeah it’s dead

Lol full world dang
---
Its for this reason I'd love them to introduce an event overlay, say when you open the map it brings up a list of active events on the side of the screen, you can click to expand the list and then see which events, both public and normal, are active on the server, then just click one to port to it. No more looking around on the map for active events and then screwing around with trying to actually click the icon.
---
Oh well lol thanks
---
Yes, I have finished the quest entirely. She mentions this when I talk to her after it.
---
Appreciate you trying though! It only gave me a nocturnal pipe pistol so you probably didn’t miss out on much
---
YES!
---
Don't give up, you'll get there.  I just made ally with the raiders and by the time I got there, I had enough gold to buy some great stuff.
---
Sometimes I have to leave the server and join another to actually get that side quest to show up.

That's right! Forgot about that and the three "associates " 🙂👍

---
I think you're confused as to what the "problem" is. They are not supposed to 1shot kill in vats, the 1s kill is the bug.
---
Once you finish the main ally quest she will give you new mini quests. Either get a weapons case, kill a bad guy, or free a captive. They show up as new ally quests on either side or daily lists.
---
No clue then.
---
Progress won’t cross platforms.   But if both account 1 and account 2 are on same platform I think you will be ok
---
Alas fo76 doesn't let you drop/trade keys. Sorry.
---
Preferred action from now on:
---
I joined the event, several were already in.  Guy was on the cabin roof, playing Kris Kross’s “Jump” during the countdown.  Everyone jumped in time to the music.  We smoked the imposter after a dozen or so joined.  PS4, one of the coolest things I’ve come across traveling WV.
---
That all makes sense in my book. Definitely a classy design, and I believe the waffle mags were consistent with some of the original AR-10 mags too. Good to see another gun guy or gal on here as well, and thanks for the addendums.
---
Nope not fixed.if you have a shotgun with certain effects it o.p in vats...limb damage is one also a bug with certain armor does the same thing
---
Happens to me with the repeatable Stings and Things quest. If I complete it and log out, it starts again as soon as I log in. I always wait a till reset to do it just so I'm not taking advantage of the exploit but it's honestly really annoying seeing the quest always be there in my pip boy no matter what. 
---
I'm shocked that this problem can occur on other quests, especially those that give scrip
---
Hey, no problem! It’s not very often that I get a chance to talk guns without someone looking at me funny.
---
it reminds me of that robot from Nuka World. what was her name? Nira? except she seemed to have no idea she was flipping personalities, and this idea seems to imply it's like a Handy and Gutsy are both inside the body, fully aware of each other. and that sounds great.
---
to add to the idea: remove the center eye, and make the left and right ones look different (76 is based on Fallout 4's engine so they can easily use some Automatron assets for this) for added "duality" effect. like a two-headed creature lol
---
I believe you can have the plan and not learn it and it will drop again.
---
according to this, ive finished week 2 before end of week 1, without any NW. nice.
---
PC dog

---
Nice...what week are we in?
---
Holy shit! That definitely fits much better than the FAL. Good find!
---
More the fun of killing it
---
What platform?
---
I should also say these are super glitchy. I've gone days without getting a new one. Sometimes the ally will not initiate regular dialog and talks to you like a visitor to the camp. I've had to scrap and rebuild the ally camp pieces over and over to get them working again.
---
Ps4, I’ll pay some caps for it
---
That worked, thanks
---
Oh yes. makes me feel like a badass.
---
Week 3 starts tomorrow
---
because many other people have done them already. You need to hack a higher level one. i had to go all the way to the flooded trainyard.

It fits the time period and the 7.62 Nato
---
Sorry mate I’m on Xbox. Best of luck tho

That's what I was saying, that sign had more function than the ones in the atom shop. The ones for the Slocum Joe set are static.

Lunchboxes seem to give a "very" well rested bonus in the effects tab. So yes I guess it doesn't stack?
---
I’m doing full unyielding with some ammo weight reduction. I feel your pain cause I’m a bloodied heavy gunner in T-65. Carnivore works wonders cause it doubles the meat carry weight bonuses.  The strong back perk card can add up to 40 lbs as well. Calibrated shocks is a must (+50lbs on each leg). I’m usually rocking about 420 carry weight in PA without whisky, 430 with if I need the little extra.
---
a ghoul who used to be a member of the Free States before getting ghoulified. maybe we find them in a sealed-off bunker.

We're starting week 3 tomorrow, so long as you're above 29, you're good.

I know that much. This is on my private server and I know where the terminals are. Thanks for the help though.

Yeah lmao I’ve got the original Xbox. It’s bad.
---
you lost your loot in your own workshop? you know you can build stash boxes right?
---
Fantastic idea

The sound of the weapon is just so satisfying, it just feels smooth.

Its one of my favourite weapons, I just wish I could find a JE one :(

My eyes always light up when I see the junkies prefix on a lever action rifle, but I'm yet to find one with explosive. I got a bloodied explosive one from the imposter sheepsquatch once. Been tempted to switch and use it.

Until they add some new options for PA, your Unyielding set is going to be your workhorse. I'm fully spec'd for PA and I still have to step out to fast travel regularly.

Basically yeah. I am doing the whole Mothman thing at my camp in some degree. Got those effigies all over the place.
---
definitly!   
---
  
---
some time ago, i found one which didnt fit my build at all but i tried it. ended up at morgantown airport, frenetically shooting low level scorched for like 20 minutes. not that satisfying as the railway rifle but really fun :)
---
I agree!
---
I've heard it only counts if you get the killing blow, and a few of my buddies confirmed they completed it this way.
---
I have a JE one up for trade, but I’m Xbox
---
Take Poseidon and monogah simultaneously I got like 40 fusion cores in an hour or so.

You can use the photomode glitch to get into the TNT dome. That's what I did.

Avoids the hassle.

If it makes you feel any better, all my armor has weapon weight reduction on it, so I watch my weight jump to like 740/370 when I get in my PA lol

All good lad🤟🏻
---
You haven't seen the eyebot playing a tune and leading rad rats through the wasteland?  Aww. Keep looking, he's a cute encounter.
---
I was saying meat pile or metal pile depending on what you kill. I was generalizing everything that dies and has loot will become one of those piles
---
Do I need radicool if I’m not running a melee build? Is their any other benefits
---
That was something I got all to comfortable with fo4 mods. Anything that was in the world someone would make accessable through a mod pack. 
---
I don't mind small things being a plan (radiation barrel) but I paid good money for tires with chains on them and I'm currently working everyday to get a "Raider Tree." It would be nice to be thrown a bone once in a while.

Ah yes, that roaring "BLORRRRRKKK" that signifies you're fucked.
---
F...I've had pc for a week. Its quiet on there so far.

Which platform

Agreed

Couldn’t agree more! It may just be my favorite weapon from both 76 and 4.

Artkos Pharma also has one. Jut gotta kill the low level robots.

Speaking of radiation rumble or riding shotgun or any of the other escort NPC events, the one person who was forward thinking enough to perk Friendly Fire with a shiskebab flailing away at the scavengers.

---
Since Game Pass my lvl 325 is usually the highest on server, with two or three bases on the map.

We have a huge influx of new players which is diluting our high level/vendor concentration. Expect to see fewer nukes dropped for the same reason.

Yeah gotta zoom in real close to fenagle it just right, them have the game fail the command to travel and have to do it all over 5 more times.
---
I have like 8 Assultron recall circuit boards left. 8 more times I can start Encrypted.
---
I went with settlers but really wanted to go with neither lol. I based it off the fact that I want to get allied with both factions and it’s harder to get there with settlers after the raid because there is only one daily to grind vs the couple for the raiders. After getting my boost to the settlers I have about equal rep with both factions and am slowly grinding my life away. Hope this helps!
---
spoiler anyway....
---
&gt;!settlers gives gauss shotgun, and a fertilizer machine (makes instant fertilizer things, causing plants to have food immediately)!&lt;
---
&gt;!Raiders have gauss minigun and a bullet producing machine!&lt;
---
&gt;!so shotgun fertilizer, or minigun bullets!&lt;
---
&gt;! oh, and you can eventually gain full rep with both, regardless of choice!&lt;
---
[edit: last part]
---
It will send to your last used character.
---
It's over, Anakin! I have the high ground.
---
Thank you so much!!
---
Exactly!
---
I went Raider for the ammo converter, but did not share gold.  Still haven't made it to ally yet.  The settlers have a fertilizer machine.
---
I did the one at Eastern Regional Penitentiary that goes to intake. It locks itself fairly quickly, too.
---
Morgantown Airport has one in the terminal, if you don't mind plowing through some low level scorched.
---
That would make sense but where are the caps going fast traveling elsewhere? A loss in continuity but hey it’s Bethesda...I do want this update though.
---
There was someone in r/fallout76settlements that recently made a video about how to get it to work.
---
The door places at a 90 degree angle, so you have to place a doorway 90 degrees and centered where you want it, use the replace thing mentioned here to switch a regular door for the train door, remove the wall (but the door still stays? Or maybe you do this then remove the wall? I forget) then use a flamer (trap camp object) to destroy the door and rebuild the door from the yellow outline after you replace your wall.
---
Very complicated. But possible.
---
Would be easier if it didn't have that 90 degree issue for sure.
---
Oh, I actually ran through the vault several times without completing.  There's a legendary to farm.  I'd logout after getting the legendary.
---
Is gold sharing a choice I can make after I break in?
---
the furious effect just shed a tear
---
Yes, it's a choice after you get to the end and collect it all.
---
*you’ve contracted dementia*
---
No it isn't. Crippling perks no longer can be used to force her to land. That is the problem.
---
Sorry but your math is off the score am little bit.
---
I mean Fallout Shelter has resource collectors, having a CAMP bot that collected everything in your camp space like plants and resource nodes whatever would be useful.
---
You’re a huge help. Worked first try after many hours of struggling. Much appreciated
---
It’s more like 50 ghouls 2 turrets, 2 rats and 7 robots on my run. 0-5 legendaries. If you sweep it fast it’s pretty decent. The exp isn’t huge but the time it takes to clear it once you have the loop memorized it makes it worth it. Not to mention you can kill 4 ghouls/supermutants when you zone into the location.
---
"I felt horrible" Jesus lmao its a game you can do whatever you want dont be such a bitch.
---
Darned diseased radroaches did it again
---
I'm curious where everyone is at ATM. As a casual player I do all the dailies and weeklies and never touch NW. I also do a few rounds of the repeatable and I'm at 32. 
---
I really don't know where I should be at this point.
---
I just don’t unlock the reward I want for a certain character until I’m in game with them, and that seems to work just fine.
---
They both run together. I've had both the Well Rested and Very Well Rests bonus at the same time.
---
I just got it today, got the beanie about 4 days ago.
---
I'm on private server for 2 hours a day.just got off add me JrArevalo956
---
The quest will give you 1,000 gold bars I strongly suggest you keep them for yourself. Purchases in the vault for items paid with gold bars is really expensive.
---
Thanx man
---
I think it’s an unique idea but I hardly think anyone would chose this perk over the more useful ones.
---
I've only got it building a max of 3 cores at a time. Is there a way to increase the capacity of the fusion core producer?
---
Complete the daily challenges and you'll get one in no time
---
The "bug"I am talking about is the shotgun not getting hits in VATS unless you enter, leave and reenter VATS.
---
No way! They are mine and I’m not telling you!
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/edit?usp=sharing Scroll to the right.
---
Cool I'll look them up, thanks.
---
collect while you sleep
---
Thought you were talking about the Perk and thought I was the only one to do that. 
---
If you use animal friend wasteland whisperer and robotics expert you can neutralize most of the enemy spawns pretty quickly.
---
you get a +1 internets for making me laugh.  but you also get a -1 internets for not actually helping :-P
---
Surely the bloodied, TSE is inaccurate af.
---
Thanks, will do!
---
Thanks dog
---
You specifically said "every shot was a one shot kill." Do you really think you should be 1 shoting enemies while in vats yet doing little damage outside of it? 
---
The missing while in vats bug has nothing to do with shotguns and happens on all weapons.
---
u/Nathan_TK nice.
---
Thank you!!
---
Your suggestions are far too user friendly to ever appear in this game.
---
Sweet usually get on about 7pm till about 10.public servers have been a tad crowded in the popular areas latley.well message me tomorrow and we can team up.
---
Some  good info., but I don't understand why people need  data miners to convince  them of  something that is plainly evident if you just play the damn game.
---
I have a stealth rifle build character, and a furiuos lever action.  The hip fire is maxed and it seemed to miss way too much.  Haven't used the character in a while.  He is now my mule
---
Fortunatley that has not happened to me. But Ive heard from plenty of people it did happen to. thats a really big kick in the rocks...
---
It's less like "think", and more like "should".
---
I like to name my weapons after... plants. 
---
Creeper, Diogenes' Lantern, Dragon's Tongue, Amaranth, Tiger Lily, Edelweiss, and Forget-Me-Not are some of my favorites.
---
Not true. They implemented my idea to long-press the action button to consume food and drink without going into the Pip-Boy.
---
Oh I completely misunderstood. Didn't realize the damn things were fixed. Jeez that's lazy.
---
MODUS doesn't even have a connection to Raven Rock or the Oil Rig anymore and is only partly functional. I would say the idea of including more Enclave stuff right now is limited at best.
---
Maybe some quests to repair MODUS and maybe restore some functionality.
---
People actually attempt a build in NW lol
---
Sorry bro got one for 5k caps early today
---
I run excavator with 470 carry weight.  Bear arms is a must for me since I’d kill my stash limit if I put all of my guns back in it.  Install Emergency Protocols and Calibrated Shocks and you’re basically set.  I use a Targeting HUD in the helmet, but you might consider the mod that boosts INT to level up and increase SCORE.
---
Some of those are food weapon names too. Like if you said this rifle is named Dragon Tongue or something I wouldn’t bunk an eye. Hahahaha.
---
Good job, you're just above par, should hit 100 by the end of week 10, rank 35 is about 1/5th through the legendary run due to the increasing XP. I'm at 45 myself and apparantly thats only 30%. The last 50+ ranks are gonna be slow, but atleast you're on track to finish.
---
I'm at 40, Zorbo is at 45. I've been grinding the repeatable like its no ones business haha.
---
I swear I remember someplace where there were a bunch of them, along with a note saying we need food other than sugar bombs, or something like that. Can't remember where though.
---
I hear ya. Last time I ran the event I was conducting all 3 pylons just tearing through stims and even went down a few times. It was rough.
---
I did that once didn’t really know that’s how you started it
---
Scorchbeast Brains are +8 int with Carnivore. It's super nutty
---
I would love to setup a collection that would collect stuff for me and put in my stash...
---
I hit lvl 34 today, I've completed every challenge except today I didn't get the level up, not feeling great. Not super confident that I'll be able to get thru the higher levels with the xp grind its going to require but I'm going to do as much as I can until I get to go back to work( hopefully soon)
---
I'll give you some stuff. Hit me up on psn: Twiztidjuggalo73
---
I have an Instigating, +1 Strength, (something) Super Sledge with a heating coil and I dig it. Got the mace skin from the Grognak bundle to shut up the crackling sound.
---
Sounds like something you need to contact bethesda for =/ Never heard of disappearing plans, thats scary. I've spent so much time finding and learning stuff, I'd hate if my character just started forgetting it lol.
---
Eh it kinda just looked like a green jacket and blue jeans, The Treasure Hunter outfit looks cooler I think.
---
(Although those goggles looked pretty sick, imagine if wearing those gave you the detect life effect like Berry Mentats?)
---
Umm, have you run out of certain mats?
---
Yeah the last rep before you are Ally takes forever and a day.
---
And while we are at it can we make the ammo coverter not absolute misery to use.
---
It really does suck, especially when I pour some rare resources into an item just to not be able to modify it properly
---
Just log in with the character you want it on before you accept the reward, should ensure you don't give the wrong thing to the wrong character.
---
I want a dog
---
No, but if I did it would at least show me that the plans were there in the first place
---
I couldn't agree more. Now, Bethesda will never go for the Wastelanders weapons being tradeable between your own characters because then you won't have to play as much.
---
That being said there should be some way to easily transfer weapons, items, ammo and such between your own characters. A mailbox system like in nearly every mmo ever or say a 50 pound stash that is shared between all your characters.
---
Hasn't Maxon executed a bunch of enclave scientist for FEV stuff at this point?
---
🔥
---
I don't see an option to do that.. where is it?
---
It is the first completion. A lot of people instantly click the buildable only when their building because it makes scrolling though everything much faster. It's easier to miss it that way though.
---
There’s a level zero terminal at wade airport on the control tower, one in the office of Whitesprings, and one (two?) in the Morgantown Airport interior. Back when I was trying to do the hack terminals trophy I ran between these terminals then reset my private world and run to each of them again till I got it.
---
Yeah this happened at West Tek twice today. Kill super mutant in 1-2 shots with an instigating sneak attack, then they are just frozen dead (standing up) like a statute and there’s no loot box. Weird
---
I had a two shot explosive gauss rifle early on in the game that I called big dick.
---
He keeps buying he keeps landing in debt. Oh poor geoffubazi (literally). Not a bank would Loan to You.
---
Switch servers. Usually when that happens when a higher level player was in the area before you and caused higher level enemies to spwan. 
---
All good until you meet up with your first 65 Charred Feral Ghoul. Then, RIP.
---
The fake golfer! I met him a few weeks ago and didn’t even know he existed! 13/10 would love to romance him.
---
I'm so glad I'm not the only one that sees it this way.
---
Have you switched characters, was someone sharing a mod perk card with you that isn't there now, learning pocketed armor for one piece of armor doesn't let it transfer the knowledge to other types of armor. Each armor is different and has its own plans to learn. Same goes for weapons.
---
It's fun to drop a bag at your feet whilst waiting to fight the queen.
---
I don't think we'll still have the exp repeatable challenge during the double exp period.
---
I find it a bit annoying that the asbestos roofing in the Atom Shop's Spring Bundle don't work together too well with the half-angled walls since they're originally meant for the metal roofing, which means the metal grey edging collide with the black tiled roof.  
---
   
---
I wish they'd add an alternative half-angled wall with the asbestos roof edging so it doesn't awkwardly conflict with the asbestos roof.
---
Yes. This set of power armor grants 4x yield from ore veins scattered in mines and throughout the map and give +100 carry weight. You have to have the full set though, but it is extremely helpful and can actually still tank a good amount of damage
---
Then BE will be better.
---
You must have been having too much fun. Todd did not approve.
---
Wait a day. Go get the materials again then come back. You may even be able to just server hop instead.
---
I have switched characters somewhat recently. Could I fix this problem by switching again, do you think?
---
server hopping didnt work, so ill try again tonorrow then
---
That would be insulting.
---
There's a prototype skin for the Ultracite PA. You can also place other Atom shop skins on it as well, such as Prime Skin. Tech Documents handed in at Camp Venture gives you a chance to learn BoS paint plans for the T-60. Or if you know someone who can mod it for you, ask them nicely.
---
Definitely bloodied. I have one too, and explosive isnt the greatest for stealth builds but I use mine all the time to farm west tek without going through very much ammo at all.
---
Forgot to mention thunder mountain plant as well! I believe it is a max of 3 so you just fast travel to each power plant every 22 minutes. Each fusion core takes about 7 minutes to get produced. Technically you can get 9 cores in 22 minutes if you have all 3 plants taken.
---
Yep, plans learned are specific to characters. Would be nice if they were known across the account. But...  \\o/
---
if i create a new caracter i will go to every event to speed xp up. so it is actually great that u participate in this event, especially if u do 1000+ damage bcz some 100+ dont and than a lot of complaining about "no loot" for them. try to be in a public team bcz that garantes loot for u if any of ur teammates did 1000+damage.
---
it happens, if it was the quest where you pick up different meats &amp; they expired /you used them you may have to pick them up again, then turn them in and the quest log will be bugged the whole time.
---
Try the raiders quest of taking out the raider. Man I spend WAY too much going all the way across the map to find them dead.
---
Thankfully I can plop my tent down.
---
Well I know that much, I just thought that if since I didn't know the plans on one account, the game might've gotten mixed up and decided I also didn't know it on the other. 
---
I don't mean to be rude, but I'd like to clarify that I've been playing for two years, not two days. I know how basic things like accounts and weapons work.
---
There's also a Possum badge
---
Last week I had someone on my team(random) buy a green asylum dress while the vendors were off and they were walled in. I had done this because I was close to 30k, when they bought the dress it put me over the limit. The camp spawn site is a long way from the vendors and I am not over budget.. I  removed the vendors until after I bought some more gold on the weekend.
---
Bruh.
---
I had a dude seriously try for like 10 mins straight to get my end game set of SS armor off me. I have an end game handmade as well, he kept asking me "what do you want? What do you want?".
---
Bro, "what could I even need?"
---
And it shot that Big Dick Energy (since the 2mm is considered energy ammo)
---
Or you could just can mystery meat. Who knows combining a bunch vile things can be so good.
---
Jesus Christ THIS, so much this... 
---
If I had a dollar for every time the game froze mid fight trying to use the goddamn favorites wheel leading to my death... I could afford to go buy a game that has a functioning weapon wheel. 
---
I lost a solo queen fight today because the weapon wheel would freeze for 5 seconds every time I used it, if the goddamn menus and interfaces in this game actually worked right I would have had no problem killing the queen solo. Most of my deaths could be tracked back to the freezing menus.
---
No idea what fortifying atlas is. Anyone knows?
---
i have a legendary broadsider named the toddsider because they’re both worthless
---
it's a community event to fortify the ATLAS Observatory so the Brotherhood can settle there.
---
I know I found sugar bombs for this challenge on the top of the red rocket in Flatwoods. But I may be wrong.
---
I’ve got like 40 sugar bombs in my inventory but can’t tell if they are RADS or not
---
Yes. That was right before the bombs. He executed them then took his men and they took over an abandoned military base and made it their command center. They then dug in and gathered resources and when the bombs fell, Maxim had his guys work on and finally get linked up to a satellite or two so they could send out a call to any and all remain Army/Marine forces. That’s how the Brotherhood got started in West Virginia. The call was as heard and answered.
---
Sweet! This month will be busy !
---
T-60 has most of the Brotherhood ranks available from doing the repeatable Brotherhood quest Forbidden Knowledge. It's another grind, that was pretty easy early on but was changed and made harder.
---
That guy was pretty funny.
---
No. I will probably grind and grind until close to the very end and buy the last ranks.
---
This is my goto
---
This same idea is literally posted every day since the game was released...
---
For farming Instigating Explosive Lever Action is better under strict conditions. Use your Bloodied build the same, but with a weapon that does 15% more damage to enemies at full health. Not much can survive that. Anything that can, swap to another auto weapon.
---
Oh my god. I didn't even think that was an option.  I finally have use for *all* the crap I pick up.
---
on the melee part is the desync the client know you are there and doing damage to the npc and giving feedback, BUT the server are stoned laughing to a cat pic till he notice that he needs to give  feedback too so you do 1-3 more swings, if I read right here on Reddit someone sayed that the server have a 20sec tic to update or was 2 sec, anyway is the desync .
---
transfers are gonna happen regardless they really should add that in for quality of life
---
What level are you? Seems like you're getting old
---
You are like, dude I just wanted the event in a group daily
---
If you find yourself dying a lot stay away from the mire (the swamp) and the cranberry bog as those are higher level areas. The blue link when your on a team is your "bond". Say you're on a building team, you'll get +1 intelligence for every fully bonded team mate plus yourself. So +4 for a fully bonded team. On events also make sure its active in your pipboy. I have to do mine manually a lot. 
---
Most high levels that give stuff to new players don't want anything in return, but be careful trading by drops. Only do it if you don't care who takes it or if no one else is around. Also be careful with trading in general. I always sell through vending myself.
---
Edit: also check collectron stations and water purifiers in camps. A lot of people leave them unlocked for others.
---
Level 46. He's getting up there, but I've seen men out there make it to 150 before their hair starts graying
---
Ya, it's too much on my main.  I just end up creating trash characters where I get easy early levels, delete them once it starts to get slow, then restart a new character.
---
It’s a grind for sure, but you’ve got it. Just make sure to stock up on legendary modules!
---
I also used to have all my armor in storage set to ultra-light build. Once I moved those to a mule my stashbox improved as well (I did this after dumping unused holos and notes and noticed a big jump both times)
---
50% of the time, works every time!
---
For robots, you could really use three points of Tank Killer to get through the armor. Bloody Mess is always welcome. And brew yourself some Ballistic Bock for even more damage still. Other than that, you should probably pick a specific weapon type and perk around that. The game punishes you for being a jack of all trades. And don't forget player vending. Buy yourself cool weapons like bloodied, junkies, two shot explosive or anti-armor.  Happy gaming.
---
Unless I'm actually playing with you as a team, I'd absolutely hate this. This is a very selfish approach to handling experience. Unless you're playing together as a group, only the leader benefits.
---
A ton of micromanaging for a little extra XP every now and then? No thanks.
---
That would just incentives players to load their machines up with pipe weapons, normal outfits and bunches of common plans in an attempt to attract shoppers.
---
I mean the point is to take it all in speed run
---
Best bet for revive player is spawn near a tall building or cliff and take turns jumping off it and being revived.  Morgantown is pretty good for this, since there is an abundance of cliffs in remote areas.
---
Also kinda every video game ever...
---
Reminds me of the redemption of Battlefront 2
---
I used all my lunchboxes doing the XP glitch lol I dont need double XP
---
Umm... there there...?
---
I think there are two or three at the top of the flatwoods church
---
Only thing I want added to the syringer is a damn stimpack syringe. Whatever you shoot gets health back like a stimpack, and you can shoot escort targets with it to heal them like the cows from Free Range and Riding Shotgun, the creatures at Project Paradise, the worthless scavvers at Radiation Rumble, etc. 
---
Hell Bethesda just give us a legendary syringer with the Medics effect on it from fallout 4 and just make it a unique reward from a quest or something.
---
:)
---
The Fallout wiki states that 1 Fusion Core is created every 7.5 minutes or 3 Fusion Cores every 22.5 minutes.  So the maximum you can have is 8 Fusion Cores per hour per Fusion Core Processor or 24 Fusion Cores per hour if you take over every Power Plant.  
---
To get 8 Fusion Cores per hour, just grab the Fusion Cores every 15 minutes.  It is the same thing with Water Purifiers.  Large Water Purifiers produce 60 Purified Water per hour, but you have to collect the water every 5 minutes or less to get the maximum amount.
---
holy crap! i’m the guy who dropped the plans xD always here if you need a lil help getting used to the game. 
---
love, BEEFCAAAAKE
---
She’s bugged, if you did it once wait till the next day.
---
Either that or spam the shit outta her.
---
It increases the vats cost, not sure about the accuracy.
---
I was thinking the same thing of accidentally scrapping the incorrect legendaries. One idea could be that just like turning legendaries into scrip, there could again be specific benches that do so. Another simple but bland idea really would be to get a fraction of scrip after the initial 150.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Ok
---
Now you still have something fun to look forward to other than a right leg.
---
This would add soo many ways to customize a room
---
Nah imo duping shouldn’t be that big of a deal. Unless it’s armor or weapons. Idk I don’t think it’s that big of a deal broooo
---
Super late here but I think it's only for X-01
---
The second level of the house at Landview Lighthouse has a level 0 terminal, and I believe there's a similarly leveled terminal at Mountainside Bed and Breakfast.
---
unfortunately, this doesnt work out in the long term. Players joining after Legendary Run ends won't be able to spend them without having to depend on the camps of random others
---
If you have 1k scrip do yourself a favor find the purveyor. Bottom left of the map and buy some legendary gear or weapons.!go for 3star armor or 2 star weapons for max yields. Or stock up in modules if you finished wastelanders
---
I was going to say "not using the clutch correctly," but your story works to. 
---
My sympathy.
---
Oh shit... good thing I am 34
---
Giving Beth the idea to let players invade the inventory of others with notes that they have to keep dropping...
---
You, sir, are the fucking devil!
---
You can't do that, that makes it unfair for people who got legacy's in the beginning. 
---
For those using the exploit, if it is their gun, and they want to trade it, that is their right. How they got it? Buying it from a vendor? That's the issue. You are blaming players for doing something "immoral", even though they've spent hundreds of hour sin the game. That makes no sense. Just put of curiosity, what level are you and how many hours have you played 76?
---
Hundreds of fluxes may not guaranteed from duped, some fo1st member can get them easily n dun have to worry about stash limit, u r not affecting other players so dun feel guilty, some people may bought godroll with caps n they think they are lucky but dun know it’s duped
---
Lvl 50 gutsy are trash...lvl 52 though... those are the dangerous ones. AA shots it seems and super tanky. Eventually with the right gear you'll be able to 1-2 shot them though
---
It's not a score bug but an exp bug.  Bethesda fixed people being able to trigger it themselves before the season even started but people found a way to trigger it on each other, that's how even as soon as last week you could see people with the space suit PA skin.
---
I like the cut of your jib
---
Im able to one shot them if i charge upto them since im using bloody melee but they sure do scare the shit out of me when they come out
---
This would melt the queen so fast
---
Fuck people who lock their purifiers, for real. It’s such an issue I’ve wanted to start a wasteland “free water” gang or something that extorts purifier owners into opening their pumps. There is absolutely no way people with locked pumps are collecting their water each time it fills. Or that they’d even notice any was gone when they check most of the time.
---
I dont think trading for duped stuff is wrong, I think having to pay money for ingame items that are more then cosmetic is wrong
---
I believe the ability to do that starts tomorrow. It's going to cost 150 Atoms per level, no skipping.
---
Yeah, it is a little rough when you lag hard, especially during Nuclear Winter. I wish there were something to be done about it.
---
Do you include Mr. Fuzzy toys in your collection of bears (including the 4 jumbo ones)? How about collecting as many outfit items as possible? Or new/clean junk items?
---
What about physical challenges? That is, test yourself by trying to reach crazy parts of different locations. Like, get to the highest point you can in Watoga, or see if you can climb up various mountain sides.
---
I started to use explosive combat rifle for this the splash damage kills them.there is also a perk that allows you to heal the brahmin with fire like with a shisqebob I think it is.but it takes time to perfect it solo.youll get the hang of it just sucks switching weapons to the staff n vice versa
---
Regardless of where we are you know they will extend it. Seems like all season based games do it now.
---
Hard?
---
All plans.
---
Mama dolces in the office has an easy one.
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary Intake. It's a level 3 though, but it's always locked for me.
---
Buck, buck, bucket
---
Wait... you did already buy the SS chestpiece right?
---
I once knew a man with a wooden leg named Smith.
---
I was thinking about trying to collect all the different alcohol and displaying them at my base but i couldn't accurately track them through the wiki , with the mr fuzzy toys i have a bunch of the different coloured bow tie ones but i didnt know about the jumbo ones,  everytime i get a new outfit i store it in my stash and ive recently started collecting board games
---
Here's the problem: 
---
You feel ultracite ammo is a requirement for you to play the game.
---
It isn't.
---
It's supposed to be rare, ultra powerful top tier ammo. Not the stuff you use 24/7.
---
The non silenced sound of the lever action is extremely satisfying and sounds powerful... sadly I never hear it because I keep a silencer on mine.
---
I love the idea of this everytime i go to a player vendor i try buying as much plans as possible but i often find myself with less then 100 caps and bascially having to hobo around everywhere , until i slowly grind events and get back upto 500 or so
---
Ugh. No. Every time I've seen an MMO implement an auction house or a market hub, it's hurt the game's community. It's a terrible idea and I'm not remotely a fan.
---
I've never once come across a CAMP where I couldn't find the vending machines. It might take me a minute or two, tops, but CAMPs aren't nearly large enough that you should be having that problem.
---
You absolutely Rock, friend!
---
Most of my scrip had gotten me garbage but there are days were it's a win.ive made out with some really good finds there bloodied rifles explosive heavy guns in the end you get alot of garbage but at times you find a gem
---
Reject the quest and wait a couple of days to redo it.
---
I did the same thing and she wouldn't work for months. I forget what happened that I didn't finish the quest, an update happened, time passed, and she never worked.
---
Finally, I was able to reject quests in the Pip-Boy, and I did so. Two days later, I could do her quests again.
---
Thank you for your feedback
---
Do you have all the magazines?
---
I just want my sheepsquatch plushie, firefly jar, and chicken coop. Hoping doing all my dailies/weeklies will net me those
---
I already have the chestpiece , underarmour alongside the sheilded plan and just the reguar right leg
---
bet he had better protection and legendary enchantments then me
---
Always nice when decent people are in the game with you. Had a guy stop what he was do I g to write me a mesage in Xbox just to make sure I got it. I had previously said on mic I was looking for it and he wasnt sure if i eventually found it. Nice people make the gane 10x better.
---
Literal interpretation snark?  Have an upvote.
---
Yes, they rotate through dutchess’ inventory
---
I mostly want the atomic power armor paints, they look really cool imo.
---
I've been visited by insult bot three times in two weeks now, think I got a good camp spot. Always brightens my day when it shows up
---
ya i agree. that was good.
---
Im in the middle of doing that ive got a fair amount from finding them in the wild and buying them from player vendors i have about 15-25 but theres still a far amount more i need
---
Non bloodied melee, it's ok not great. Bloodied melee, no, you will zap yourself to dead constantly. You could also do Tesla coils if you wear power armor. Its more consistent zaps, nice for tagging, and it doesn't cause you damage
---
I think alcohols were sort of lost track of after Wild Appalachia was released, since that added a bunch of alcoholic drinks through Biv's quests. Best bet may be to look in to which recipes you need (if any) from there. Though I recall there being a fairly comprehensive list of aid items floating around online somewhere.
---
There are 10 regular Fuzzy toys, and 4 jumbo ones. You can get the jumbos by exchanging 20 Mr. Fuzzy tokens at Camden Park. It is random as to which one you get, so I may take a while to get all 4. And, sadly, they can't be displayed.
---
I think there are 5 board games so far, with one being added as part of The Legendary Run, if I'm not mistaken. So that's a relatively quick set to collect.
---
It's a long grind if you plan on doing it and don't think you did something wrong if you don't get the Initiate paint, Bethesda removed it from some dumb reason.
---
What bout my underground camp? I have had playsrs say they cant see my banjo, and I have a vault boy pointing at it.
---
That's a good gun.sombody would trade something nice for it.aa does some extra damage then that added explosive it's a nice combo.put it up on that reddit page that cant be named.its a odd time rn w legendaries
---
If I'm at my camp and got customers buying, I always leave a bag of spare ammo/water/extra chems for them. Thank you!
---
I’m sorry. Why are you coming here confessing all this?
---
Or is this really an add for the $2 flux you sell on that site? 
---
Cause that’s what I’m thinking.
---
I keep going to terminals that people say are locked, and find them all unlocked. It's weird
---
That explains why I lost two of them today. I looked and looked and looked, no sign of her!
---
Heart of the Swamp is one of the tougher events, don't quit events altogether because you got your ass handed to you there.  I'm level 371 and it's a chore to tank the mobs and kill the heart at the same time so don't feel bad about that at all.  Nice to have the help honestly, even if it's just to distract some of the mobs.  Stick to the west side of the map or just tag and hide if you're in a tough area and you cant really help.  You'll get there.
---
Toss a grenade next to the case in the overseer's house, you can knock one loose.
---
Link?
---
It’s probably the new weapon dupe. Everyone using their second and third accounts.
---
I actually gave in and got the perk that makes a sound when near a magazine and started to realize just how few there are spawned around. Unless you go where you know they are they seem a lot rarer than I would have figured. I was like 167 or so before finally getting all 5 of the cryptid magazines.
---
Now, yes I agree. But had it been done at the time, it would have simply been a case of "These items weren't supposed to exist, now they don't." I'd still be fine with it because that is still the case, they shouldn't exist. But, they've become both collector's items and, in many cases, best in slot items.
---
I'm blaming the dupers for doing something immoral. I'm blaming people who purposely buy or accept items they know have been duped for doing something immoral. Yes. The way they do it doesn't matter, the fact is that the duped items should not exist in the game, and were produced by cheating. How long those players have been playing has nothing to do with it. It does not give them license to cheat, which is what you've been arguing this whole time.
---
Those who truly, unknowingly buy them are doing nothing immoral. But as I explained to another person, it's like using counterfeit money.
---
Even if you didn't print it yourself, if you try to buy something with it it will be taken away. You won't be punished, but the money is worthless and will be taken from you. Those who printed it will be punished.
---
I'm level 317, 1648 hours
---
Id like to add healers. Dudes who come swingin their shikebobs like its going out of style sometimes even saving and event.
---
I think im missing two of the regular sized fuzzy toys , and the fuzzy tokens i do whenever they appear but they dont seem to all reset at the same time and sometimes in the dross toss when i get them through all the holes it counts as a fail , Plus the biggest problem with the alcohol is that my stash space is gonna be absolutely destroyed as im hovering around 500
---
The only brother hood skin for the ultracite is the outcast paint you get at level 60 in nw. The t60 has all the bos paints, like others have said it's a grind. But you can just find someone to paint it for you
---
100% this. It sounds crazy but it works.
---
Thanks for the tip but none of my mates are playing 76.
---
I'm not entirely sure about the helmet but one incredibly easy way to get another firebreather uniform is to go to the overseer's house. Just go upstairs and take a left into her office. There's a uniform inside the case to your left as you enter. Throw a grenade behind the case and the uniform should fly out of the case for you to pick up.
---
I do too!
---
Oops, I'm like level 20😬
---
I have a great pc, I can get 144 fps a lot of the time but there very consistent dips below 70, in my experience it's never above 100 fps for at least 30 seconds. This makes it feel like the game is stuttering when it dips to a much lower fps. Also, gpu usage is never utilized to its full potential
---
I agree, I don't know how many times I've asked friends to take time out of their playtime just to help me switch a few things over real quick. We shouldn't have to do that.
---
D'awwwwww.
---
The bears and plushies have got to become CAMP items at some point. Unlock them for placement when you loot your first one, like crops.
---
Yes grenades!  When I hit her with a grenade it was like she was disoriented, and she stopped being invisible.   So I shot her 2 or 3 times, threw a grenade, repeat.  I am past that quest now!
---
Well, one way or another, it answers our prayers.
---
I wish i had enough crap that i could sell video game stuff for real money.
---
Thanks for the vote of confidence though.  :rolleyes:
---
Jebus christ i pretty much buy the most of mine from vendors from anywhere between 20-100 caps or if someone donates me there extras, ive probarly found around 5 by myself always being in the same place when i did my power armour runs at those mock brotherhood encampments ,The tales from west virgina fields have to be my favourite with there overall design and feel
---
Hope at marigold pavilion. There's an encounter there with a guy who hates them. There's like 10 opossums that'll spawn
---
I traded with a guy earlier who was giving me advice/what he does since he is unarmed build. You could use an explosive rifle/heavy for splash damage or auto Tesla when others show up just to tag. Yeah it not fun but neither is running to an enemy just to have someone else kill it before you even swing at it
---
2nd floor of Fort McClintock has a 0 level.
---
Weird, only way I know of is kicking deliberately. Could be a lag issue if you both were playing with friends on a distant server. Effectively doubles if not more the lag.
---
We have a UK member of our BoS Band who drops team occasionally, but he usually drops off the world as well.
---
Can I become allied with both factions by grinding dailies? I don't want to start a second character.   
---
And also if I finish one factions quest line, will it lock me out of maxing the other?   
---
Thank you for any replies!
---
I had this happen like last week. It was really odd...
---
I had a pack of ticked off feral ghouls chasing me when I ran up to her after leaving the area and running back hoping she would reset or something.
---
I was mashing A in a hurry so the ferals wouldn't grab my butt and gnaw my ankles and give me Rad Worms in new questionable ways. She still kept spitting out her after quest complete lines...  
---
But somewhere in the mashing, the quest started AND completed, almost at the same time. I got the quest XP and rewards at the same time the 'Talk to Chloe' went away, get x items appeared, return to chloe rapidly displayed.
---
I think it makes the accuracy and range go up in vats. But since it increases vats cost most ppl use the reflex dot
---
Tse weapons are shit
---
I think I could actually help out on the alcohol. I grinded his quests just to get rad ant lager and I have most of the recipes(even pre-war alcohol). I believe there are some you can't make and some recipes that you can't get from Biv(like hard lemonade which you get from the cranberry bog). Aside from the recipes, I do have a habit of hoarding alcohol for the additional strength for carry weight
---
edit: I think getting every alcoholic drink would up your stash by 30-50
---
Look they can't even get the basics down, let alone details that are probably way over their head 😂
---
On my melee character chloe's been ignoring me since a few months before wastelanders. Best bet is submitting a ticket to bethesda.. I've even tried rejecting the quest but that didnt do anything.
---
I feel that I've always had enough materials to make the ammo i need until about Wastelanders time frame. 
---
There's other people on here posting about not people able to get high rad fluids.  Everyone seems to be having problems getting it.
---
All my equipment IS top tier, and I've worked for days to get it like I want.  
---
It used to be that every nuke I saw I could get enough to make a couple of each flux and that would last me a month.  I maybe play 4 hours a week, so i don't consume that much, but lately I haven't even been able to do that.
---
Cant you just join or start a public team?
---
Hit 36 y-day , skipping all nw challenges. Just been playing  normally
---
See my lithe reply. There's a number of posts here about high radiation fluids not dropping like they used to.  So yes, I felt it was pertinent to post about it.
---
Why is this a thing and why isn’t this named after the Wild Wasteland after the perk?
---
I did buy the hard lemonade plan when i got there and ive been grinding the settlers trust so that i can buy those inside foundations which allow you to plant fruit and stuff on it that way i can have an garden on the roof and then have a bar with all the alcohol on display alongside berret or whatever the ally was called
---
Bloodied.... All the stat boosts from uny make you very sneaky
---
"YOUR the dumbass!"
---
Jesus christ people. This is an idea that just sprung up from this Reddit like a few days ago and although it makes sense, that is all it is as far as Bethesda implementing it. It reminds me of the the trump election all over again when people said "oh no hes a secret cabal genius, gonna drain the swamp just wait" and here we all are waiting like dipshits years later while coronavirus rips through the country and nothings happening. They're playing 4d chess insofar as they know they an only fix so much so quickly and on a slow as fuck timeline and the fact that they aren't talking is par for the course Bethesda damage control. If you are trying to convince yourself they'll release a whole new weapon system/combat system that coincides with Brotherhood that magically fixes all the new dupes then please stop cause all you're doing making more excuses for their piss poor QA. If anything we will get no significant bug fixes AND a new currency full of more buggy ass shit. 
---
Lets assume for a moment that this is correct and its a super elite pro game developer move (its not), what about the entire rest of the non weapon economy that is being duped to shit and crashed? How does that fit in with the master plan?
---
Oh wait its all bs and people are still finding ways manipulate bullion/notes/ss gear cause they never fixed that either.
---
I was wondering the same thing. Talked to Beckett and he just had a random rescue quest for me.
---
I never knew about the Jumbo ones myself. Kinda lame on Bethesda's part to not let you display them. Lucky Mucker is bugged out on me now. I can activate the quest, but I can't get the pail to run it, so I'm only left with the other two till they bug out.
---
What was the name of his other leg?
---
Basically do every quest each faction can have you do until you have to pick a side. I reccomend the settlers as the gauss shotgun is ridiculous and there are exploits to get raider rep infinitely, which in themselves aren't very reliable as it requires a specific daily quest. And yes you can grind dailies to become allies, but it is VERY slow. Good luck!!!
---
I absolutely agree! Since so many collectibles aren't proper CAMP items by default, I had always hoped there'd be a way to convert junk items to decorative ones, so we could pick and choose what we want to display.
---
Use to farm squirrels for this reason every (3 hours of gameplay) if you have Fallout 1st you can use your private server for this without issues.
---
1 @ on Hill at 'The Whitespring Service Entrance.'
---
2 @ opposite direction of the one at the hill after fast travelling to 'The Whitespring Service Entrance.'
---
1 @ 'The Whitespring Resort' (on your way after the 2 it is just before the ghouls at the carpark)
---
1@ on the field before the north entrance to whitesprings.
---
Lucky Hole mine is great for Lead tho youll need acid to convert the ore but still its a great go to source
---
I've noticed that running with Full Screen and not Windowed massively effects FPS. In windows I max at 60. Full Screen at 120. There are some areas with exceptions. Whitespring in general my FPS is 20 or lower out on the golf course to the Western side.
---
Also the game doesn't scale well with DSR.
---
People dont seem to always wanna join low lvls
---
This has also made MY night! Thank you for sharing!
---
Oh weird, I've never heard of it bugging out that hard! Hopefully that gets fixed eventually. Incredibly weird it happened at all.
---
As for the jumbos, I had just heard they were a thing we could get and got super excited about displaying them at my CAMP. Got super disappointed when they never appeared as an option in any of my displays. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Bethesda adds some more display options for things like power armor and larger collectibles.
---
Thanks, I'll check it out! I just raided the weight room in vault tech university which helped me a lot.
---
Oh my lord, do we ever.
---
My favorite is when I spam the join button and accidently send a friend request, oof. I feel like such a tool after that
---
If it did that nobody would join until the last second the lazy gits
---
I like the leeches that show up at the very end of an event like radiation rumble to get the rewards, but aren't there while all the fighting is going on to help complete it. Really pisses me off sometimes...
---
This needs more upvotes. High quality posts like this deserve visibility.
---
Thanks for the guide my friend!
---
That sounds like it would actually look pretty nice! I'm bad about building and just kinda threw together a field for whiskey production lol(3 str, then add party girl/boy). At one point, I added mutfruit for drug production(grape mentats)
---
Well, you are obviously a soulless monster who eats puppies and will burn in hell for all eternity.
---
Or you'll be a player who will get to keep enjoying the game they were getting pretty frustrated with even if it meant cheating a little.  If other players or the almighty Todd have a problem with that, well, they can get stuffed.
---
Yes please!
---
And it would be great if the usual ones were free.   Lock pick, super super, travel agent, etc
---
Although I started in the parking lot nearby, the travel was not easy, some f***  robot killed me twice, I lost almost as many bullets as I ate. Finally I made it to the bed and breakfastl, hacked the terminal and got my points. Something seems fishy about that place but I will go back later, for my time is done for the day. Thanks for being part of today's adventure, fellow vault dweller.
---
Lol. Free thing gets pop *TONIGHT AT 11*
---
I've been the leader of a public team and saw one of the other members get kicked somehow. I certainly didn't do it.
---
I was in the same boat then one day i decided to try it again and it magically worked.
---
Ohh, was it your first visit since Wastelanders launched? Definitely make sure to go back and rent a room, when you have time!
---
55 as of last night.
---
I missed out on playing on the weekend much sadly.
---
I can help you out. IGN Nukathulhu
---
Finished my last night's session with level 60.5, thanks to your advice about adding harper's ferry and abandoned bog town to my farming route.
---
I also kill a behemoth after ws sentry bots, a sentrybot at robco, and a deathclaw north of watoga at the end of the route. ~6.5k xp is always worth fast-travelling.
---
Spending about 3-5 hours a day grinding xp (getting about 480k a day on average throughout the last 10 days) I found it quite addictive (surprisingly) with more visual xp/score tracking stuff.
---
As some who doesn't usually run intelligence high enough to ever keep hacking perks on I absolutely agree with this. They should of brought back some kind of permanent skills like youd get every 5 levels in the old games instead of a pack of cards.
---
My C.A.M.P is literally just a massive brick block where ive got the ground floor as a crafting station hub with the second floor being where i display all the colas , bears , board games , mr fuzzy , magiznes in a side area and then the thrid floor my own private room where i have the bobbleheads and eventually the booze
---
No matter how many stealth effects I have the imposter always knows exactly where I am and ever laser spams me while my status says [Hidden]
---
I'm at the pick a side for each faction now so have stopped and am just doing dailies for each. Continue like that then yeah? Time isn't much of an issue, I need something to do in here anyway besides my possum/tadpole challenges
---
First thing to check is monitor refresh rate, game is capped at 60fps, but if your refresh rate is not a multiple of 60, it will cap the fps lower. ie. 72hz gets capped at 36, 100hz gets capped at 50 etc.   
---
The game itself is a turd and I don't think any hardware combination can get perfect frames 24/7, some areas run better than others, but your system should be more than capable of pulling 60fps in most areas, though I wouldn't expect it to be perfect.   
---
You can also try switching between fullscreen and borderless, I seem to get better performance and less crashes in borderless, whereas fullscreen had some issues.
---

---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights
---
How does that work exaclty?
---
Right? I'll dive right in there and stim the lower levels if they go down, everyone should have an opportunity to enjoy everything the game has to offer.
---
You can pick a side and keep doing dailies for the other faction, I just said to pick the settlers because they have no exploit to get rep infinitely
---
Just a random suggestion but had the legendary run been on the pts you probably would have already known about the auto completion.  As always ty for your hard work on the game.
---
Bath tub full.in mosstown.
---
I was at an insane uranium event today where all 6 players there ran around taking single shots at ever moleman and then move on, letting everyone get a shot at every enemy.  And when the legendary spawned, everyone would call each other over.  It was not pre-planned or anything, it was just a random encounter of really nice players.  Sooooo much loot. And so funny watching this constantly moving ballet of violence.
---
Those were fixed a while back. You need to make another character and go there. Which, thanks to vendors is much easier.
---
honestly i dont even want to help the brotherhood because i dont like them
---
Appreciated! I was gonna go settlers storyline wise anyway. Raiders are doomed to die anyway with their toxic, radioactive camp
---
My C.A.M.P. = 2 wooden platforms, 1 with work benches and the other with vendors and some random crap. Behind that is a line of water purifiers lol
---
Did you give that little girl duped plushies..j/k but really it was a enjoyable read about making someones day in the wasteland!👍
---
I put it in a display case with the connector on the side. Works like a charm.
---
Best of luck. I've been seeing it for 10k on PC when I'm flat out of caps, but never see it when I save up. I was lucky enough that it dropped for me on my first try back when the event was new but my friend and I have been searching for one for him since that time. It's never dropped for either of us since.
---
Arktos Pharma lobby.
---
Mama Dolce, go right from the entrance.
---
I'm just tired of everybody building the same two story, 2-4 room box house on the side of a cliff. Come on, I dont need to go into your giant empty house just to see the same present plans the last 30 guys were trying to oversell.
---
I've noticed that too. That's as annoying as when the imposter is facing someone else but the laser shoots out its ass and melts you when you're expecting it to shoot straight... 😂
---
They're not invincible, they're clipping into the brahmin who have extra large hitboxes, Riding Shotgun has the same issue with the mongrels. Best advice I can give is use an explosive weapon and shoot the ground near the brahmin, otherwise just slow it down and don't herd the brahmin, so when they hit the wolf spawn location, they're not all stacked on top of each other and the wolves separate a bit, if I'm solo the brahmin always take a little bit of damage, but this method ensures I can kill the wolves before they kill poor old Nuka-Cowla.  
---
\*EDIT\* I also use friendly fire and a shishkebab to heal them between fights if they get too low.
---
My .50 is just called “Ma Deuce”, submachine gun is “Chicago Typewriter”, and the .44 revolver is “Big Iron”
---
Same--at 35 as of today, as well.
---
Now it's in terms they can understand
---
The wastelander dlc dropped and NPC are back with the Vault 79 raid quest
---
That's definitely NOT what happened. Clearly you don't get how the game works. When you drop items they don't appear in a bag until after you exit the menu. I hadn't exited the menu before I crashed, so my stuff never spawned.
---
So awesome. ❤
---
The counter of Flatwoods red rocket (near or behind the register iirc) is a good spot.
---
I also keep it from perk packs that reason.
---
Is there still a pretty big community that plays?
---
Would be less AP with no scope?
---
I gave up on water purfiers since events give me more then enough purified water
---
that's a terrible rationalization. and it can be pushed to dangerous extremes as well.
---
"you don't need combat armor or a handmade. just use leather armor and the .44 you get at the start of the game. what's the problem with Bethesda putting legendaries in the atom shop when you can, technically, beat the game with the board that's craftable as soon as you leave the vault? stop complaining, gee."
---
Fo4 didn't have any of this BS. it's a poor comparison, but so is your justification.
---
thank you
---
Totally possible with 4-6h a day of grinding with easily obtainable buffs (relish/brainbombs/berry mentats), especially with lunchboxes and he mentioned using them.
---
I don’t know tbh. Finished the Raid with my friends but new players do this probably
---
They were US scientists, saying they were Enclave is conjecture at best
---
You never scratched his belly did you. Terrible. That's why he left.
---
Look in the pumpkin at the top of the front porch stairs when you go talk to Jack at the Pumpkin House. There’s usually bubble gum or gum drops in it. Grab ya a few and hold on to them until the next bubblegum challenge.
---
I have way too much bubblegum if anyone needs any on ps4
---
Gotcha thanks. I think I’m gonna get it and try to relive some of the fun I had on Xbox
---
They just do that... I have had so many pets (way more before Wastelanders) die or disappear in my care, that Steven King and ASPCA have me on speed dial.
---
Ah yes forgot. There is currently an event till September called the legendary run where you can unlock weapon (PA)armor skins etc and public teams were introduced too and I see a lot of players in every server on Xbox since the game is free on the Xbox gamepass
---
bruh, y'all need to go outside
---
It’s more than likely people creating $1 burner accounts for the dupe. You can get a GamePass account for $1. So with the ability to create multiple accounts for almost nothing is a dupers heaven.
---
I love the Tales from West Virginia magazines. Once I finally got all 5 I built a toilet sitting right out in the open with arrows and vault boys pointing at it, a neon "open" sign behind it and a magazine rack with those 5 displayed next to it.
---
Oh so the what do the public team have an effect on?
---
Oh jeez I come up with a lot of silly things. 
---
Get one of each Nuka Cola Vaccinated, Scorched, and My Blood's In It.
---
Random collections of the day - not to keep forever but just things like getting a certain group of junk items to display. I did coffee themed stuff this week - a clean coffee tin, clean coffee cup, clean coffee pot, and one other coffee themed item - then I'll put them in a display until I think of the next task. 
---
Other things I like to temporarily collect are board games, globes, empty bottles, dog and cat bowls, toy truck/car/rocketship, etc. 
---
Naked runs are fun - leave all your armor and weapons somewhere and pick a place to start, then you can only use what you find. (For an even bigger challenge, take off your perk cards - you can keep the one to keep your mutations though)
---
Completely change up your play style for the day. I usually run power armor with a super sledge, but there are days when I'll put a silly outfit on and run around with a crossbow or a sword, and change up my perk cards accordingly.
---
Try not fast traveling for a day. Just walk from place to place to do whatever you need. Use a survival tent or only use workbenches and beds that you find. 
---
Explore. A lot of people probably don't know there's a whole bunch of stuff on the rooftops in Morgantown, lots of notes and holotapes. Stuff like that. Really dig deep into an area rather than blasting through for a quest. 
---
Try to find weird little things in the wilderness. There's a lot of them, and they're always fun to stumble across. Teddy bear and gnome scenes, random skeletons posed like they were doing something silly. Not all of them are nukashine locations, so some require exploring to find.
---
I go with building since I am at 30 INT in solo team alone so prefer extra XP for everything I do and not just events.
---
bruhh ik people pay 5k caps for lunchbox services
---
if you reach 33 by the end of today then you are on target. If you are less than that than you are behind, but should be able to catch up this weekend. so 39 and 35 are both ahead of target.
---
The target for each week is 19 Week 1, 33 Week 2, 44 Week 3, 54 Week 4, 63 Week 5, 71 Week 6, 79 Week 7, 86 Week 8, 93 Week 9, 100 Week 10
---
Ghouls with saddles.
---
How do I start the event without making a new character and doing the quest all-over again
---
Explosive version has superb range. Basically shoots out fire bullets
---
Yes great idea , I would also like if they gave us the option as a list under the social menu too
---
I'll make a note on my pip boy future reference. Thanks fellow citizen of vault 76.
---
Mama Dulces has 3. One on ground floor, level 0 in manager office. The 2nd is on first sub basement level, 3rd is 3rd subbasement next to a cage that usually has a PA in it.
---
They won't do it. There's many things that don't get fixed. Like the respawn bug.
---
Nice story
---
Building and it is better to solo grind enemies than attend events.
---
This should definitely be a feature, idk what Bethesda is doing, if it would cause lag they can just make it take up space
---
Yes, definitely yes
---
Mine is only at 12 lol. I can imagine you're getting twice as much as I am. I forget the percentage per int.
---
I usually have 60+.  I vendor them when I get too many.  Most stores have them, common in vending machines, the school and fair have a bunch usually.
---
They stack since they are two different things one is just well rested and the other is very. I had them stack when I first got the lunch boxes
---
Mupawa. You are a whiny little bitch. That is all.
---
I just sent you a friend request. If your free I'm on now in a private server
---
Clarksburg Hardware store, in one of the cubby holes
---
What spots do you like?
---
At the start of Fasnacht I was dropping freebies for everyone, treasure hunter outfits and the like, people seemed really appreciative, especially the low levels.
---
But then by they end of the first week there were level 300+ people just crouching next to you in anticipation of you dropping loot so I stopped. What could a level 300 with a legacy gun possibly need to pick up off the floor I ask you. Get some dignity guys.
---
I try to keep around 100 each cuz they weigh nothing.  I use the rest to make serums if I need to hit the vendor cap on a slow play day or there is a limited time cap sink.  Nice to have them in the bank, def. not duped.  People with 5k each are however, no real way to tell.
---
I have one of every nuka cola but the vaccinated ones and i dont know how to get it im guessing i cant since ive already finished the associated quest . board games im in the middle of getting , naked runs loook fun , Thanks for all the suggestions ill have to make a word or notepad document for all of this
---
Building teams at +4 int will give you 8% extra xp on everything you do. Event groups are only worth it if you plan to purely event farm imo.
---
I've definitely had an uptick in people triggering my cards while I'm waiting for randos or my group to show up ... goes along with the people who think it's fine to gank the ISS/SBQ. If you're too cheap or too lazy to run your own silo or buy your own recall card, you don't get to melt the boss. All you're doing is making competent people strongly consider never starting an event on a public server.
---
Fast travel bug: put your weapon away before traveling.
---
Has anyone seen how bad line in sand gets now is stutter and drops to 1 frame a second if you have more then 2 people there. I'm on Xbox one X too it has to be there code or shot severs
---
Join one yourself?
---
They just look so different and look like actual books and dont look like they've aged much apart from that i like the gritty realistic art on them compared to basically all of the cartoon stuff across everything else
---
Suddenly the minigun goes from like 24 damage to 124
---
Make it lower and % based and this would actually be amazing and balanced
---
It's a funny fact for MMOs that the majority of players who play do so without paying and the servers are kept up largely by people who barely play but want to have everything anyway so pay.
---
That one is pretty good but the god roll would be something like +50% vats crit damage and 25% less vats cost.
---
But the stats that the 'dignity buff' gives you really suck...
---
You can only get one of the vaccinated types - you'll be able to craft whichever one you picked under healing at a chemistry station. The other two you'll have to buy/trade with someone who picked something different :) it's a fun little thing to do
---
I forget my stimpack number key all the time and the favourite wheel stutter has killed me soooo many times
---
Sometimes events like the messenger are glitched out or there are none on the map worth doing. Some take awhile to do, to even be worth it and then there's the chance you'll fail it over bs lol
---
And bubblegum in the floor cubbies at Clarksburg's hardware shop, dead ahead from the FT point
---
AH so i can get the one i picked i thought i couldnt get it , which made me kinda sad and when it comes to trading in this community im still figuring out everything since ive been playing for around 2 weeks so everything is very new to me
---
Unlucky! Found some in the Whitesprings laundry room on the first server I loaded into when it was a daily challenge.
---
I don't pay to not play games.  I just don't play.
---
This would probably break many weapons with totally new damage types (for that weapon) being accounted for. Knowing Bugthesda, they don’t have “the technology.”
---
I found them in player vending machines without even asking around for them. :) but yeah there are other ways in case you don't find them :)
---
Upvote
---
I was getting a box of paper targets tonight when I also triggered Dogwood Die-off. I'd seen it on the map, and considered doing it, until I activated the event in my pipboy and saw there was only 2 1/2 minutes left. Had I been able to see the timer on the map, I would have ignored it completely.
---
You can make q new character and rush the responders and fire breather tests. Then just transfer that outfit to your other character.
---
It may become a feature with the indoor spacing they're implementing later this year.  They definitely should for these smaller spaces, at least.
---
Bows are novelty weapons. They have no real place in end game situations. They can do "ok" at daily solo running around / farming. But anything where you need actually dps or to kill multiple enemies fast.. You are screwed. They are just too slow to use. Also, the VATS bug (first shot misses) hurts bows really bad just for the same slow to use reason.
---
Yea, bows are pretty sweet. I only have a 1 star Bloodied and it drops bitches, even when I have a lot more than a smidge of health left.
---
I want that and the ability to stack a flat roof or even an upper floor in the same slot as a top roof piece. No ceilings makes a builder sad
---
I prefer building teams just because there’s usually some downtime between worthwhile events and you can run west tek or the burrows for some kills as well as turn in dailies and benefit from them all
---
I think the only thing they don't get is harden mass and the other nuke items
---
If you are a real min/max end game player no, but if you like to enjoy the game and mix things up go right ahead. I try to be a mix of both myself, but it’s hard not to go in one direction or the other.
---
Yeah, and i dont use silencers on mines, sounds to good. Same with . 50 cal hunting rifle, sounds so powerfull (. 50 cal gives hunting rifle better sound if you doesn't knew)
---
But that makes nocturnal useless. :(
---
Bubblegum is one of those things that are hard to find when a challenge for them pops up. Remember to save all your bubblegums you get from levups (those you get every 5 levels) for situations like this. I have maybe like 50 i have collected here and there when i happen to see them.
---
I don't think there is anything better than the DCG or power fist. Spec yourself for that. Pick the one that looks the best to you cause once you're one shotting everything that little difference isn't going to matter.  
---
I leave myself setup for unarmed and I go around with whatever melee looks the coolest to me at the time. If I need to, I swap to the DCG. This is how I end up collecting melee weapons.
---
I'm going to start doing my quests naked and only used what I find as I work through them.
---
afaik - westek vats are for a fatman - maybe other stuff spawns , probably better off just running around vender shopping and buying a cheap 2k plasma
---
Shotguns do "magic" damage regardless of build if you use VATS. Are your friend's hits your estimate or actual numbers? Also DPS is over time, not single hits.  
---
If you want to melt SBQs though, just get a broken heavy gun.
---
thats how it should be.
---
And this warrants a downvote how exactly? -))
---
Hey now you've still gotten 3 stars which is impressive
---
Make sure your doing Davenport's quest line at the over seers home for both faction rep and the fisherman raiders for extra raider rep
---
Take a couple weeks off only logging in to vend/scrip/buy bullion until your weight gets down to playable levels.
---
Or make a mule and transfer everything over.
---
Or just get used to tossing 3 star legendaries on the ground like trash.
---
yea your absolutely right. i have the Final Word and a decent Flamer. i guess im just going to use them more often.
---
It's just a good way to give you a bit more carry weight
---
im barely at 28 and wont be too bummed if i dont finish it. just trying to get what i can
---
I like it
---
Yea, The Messenger is best avoided for sure currently.
---
yea i can see how that woud be annoying
---
Consoles are underpowered? What a surprise!
---
(Yeah im calling for downvotes 😁)
---
This is like, chapter 2 out of 100. But it's a great start!
---
Eh. You’re not wrong. 
---
Though, unless their teammate was killing things/getting hits, they shouldn’t be able to loot anything they didn’t actually kill. I could be wrong though. This is just how things usually work when looting corpses.
---
I mean cmon tho. I can run far more powerful games just fine.
---
Pretty sure players who aren't in your team can't loot corpses that you killed. 
---
Weird for him to keep running back and forth. Seems like he was lame as hell, I guess lol.  Pull your weight and don't leech off of people is what I've come to understand is the best way to not piss people off.
---
It's not just the menus line in the sand is now a  cluster fuck if more than two people are there it chugs along at 2 frames a second, I'm on Xbox one X and it's still terrible. I love the game but it starting to get to me. I'm supposed to enjoy this but feels like torture at times to many grinds not enough info drop rates are horrendous
---
2% per INT point.
---
I treat it as it’s own little mini-game within FO76 called mousey-hover-over-y
---
Well I'm just confused on the damage like why isn't the shotguns the best build that everyone should go for. But hey thanks I actually didn't know that shotguns have a "magic" damage.
---
Id prefer not. More popular means more toxic. Dont let the toxic people realize the game is good again.
---
Should be later today early morning
---
Finished my last night's session with level 60.5
---
Until that melee build ambushes you from behind. I took out a HW+50cal/autogrenade dude by ambushing him from behind with an axe while he was trying to crater my teammates with his autogrenade. He hadn't noticed me sneaking around the side.
---
Jesus adding this would give me one less thing to manage that shouldn't be as hard as it is. I don't play anymore bc shits getting too complicated to just log in each day. I shouldnt be stressed out by several menus just to re-set cards. Been asking for it since beta and ik I'm not the only one.
---
I've got a few wordplay names for weapons, primarily on my HW/Explosive Bloodied main.
---
Twin Suns: Two-shot fat man.
---
Twin Comets: Two-shot Missile Launcher
---
Leatherface's Handy: Bloodied Ripper
---
Flameburger: Bloodied Shishkebab
---
Vlad: Vampiric Ultracite Gatling Laser
---
The Real Fixer: Bloodied Swing Speed Wrench
---
its a great location especially once you have the excavator power armor set as that armor gets 4x from mining nodes and you get that armor jsut by going through the story fyi
---
My guess is tomorrow. That would be two weeks, right?
---
I’ve had a few players below level 50 in the event and never struggled, so maybe its you that is the problem or the group you were with in the event. I just can’t see how a lower level player being there effects you.
---
Eastern or western time I life in suisse
---
Yeah I realise 10% damage while aiming isn't really inline with VATS AP cost, but I figured it was still a decent roll none the less and being a junkie rifleman build, I figure I can easily switch out perks to use bows if I wanna give it a bash.
---
Adrenal Reaction, Ballistic Bock, Adrenaline, Bloody Mess, Gun Fu?  I think you can get 700s against SBQ.
---
They just make it easy to be in a team. I rarely see people working together on then. It's just a good way to share a card, get the 15% xp boost from inspirational and stuff like that
---
Yeah thats kind of what I figured, I think I'll hold onto it, maybe craft some explosive arrows and stuff and just pull it out for fun. cheers for your input
---
At the top left corner of the map, there's Tyler County Fair Grounds, as soon as you spawn there, keep left and there's a big warehouse looking building. Go in and there should be pumpkin pales and a Tinkers workbench. In the pumpkins their should be some bubblegum and some gum drops. If nothing is in them, server hop, and see if there's any on the next one. Be prepared because it's a challenge for them to be missing, but should be able to get one still. Hope this helps.
---
I think it’ll be in 11 hours when atomic shop and dailies  update
---
After every 5 levels you get a perk card pack and you get a bubblegum with it
---
Sometimes on shelves in and around Helvetia, in booths at the fairgrounds/camden park, and I think there's usually one in Pleasant Valley where the vendor bot is.
---
There's more but those are the ones I know of.  The wiki has a list of places too.
---
Not massively into min/maxing tbh, I will hold onto it to play around with, thanks for your input.
---
Ok thank you
---
Damage per pellet is the base damage divided by 8.
---
Each pellet does small damage, so enemy DR reduces it more than you'd expect.
---
Since he is using a magic weapon, the 8 projectiles actually trick the game into thinking your fire rate is x8 which allows it to hit the 200+ Fire Rate threshold.
---
Normally, he'd be hitting her for 1 x8.
---
I'll sell you one for 10K.  PM me.
---
it does, than you
---
Will definitely hold onto it to play around with, I'm interested in checking out the different arrows that can be made.
---
Ahhhh I gotcha. So what’s the aspect of the wastlanders stuff? Like why did they change the name.
---
hi-rad has always been hard to get relative to the other two. The other two drop in stacks of 1-3, high-rad only drops in 1. 
---
Your equipment is top tier, cool. Top-tier ammo gets used up. Nukes don't drop nearly as frequently as they used to is the big thing I see. I'd see multiple nuke launches a night a long time ago. These days? Rare that I see one during a session. Bethesda hasn't changed anything. The playerbase has changed their behavior.
---
Also, nukes that DO drop are nearly always on the Queen, and everyone fights outside the radiation, so there's very few enemies to get materials off of. No more whitesprings raids with 50 ghouls to kill....
---
Remember at rank 40 a score level is around 2k, at rank 80 around 3k.  Spend your atoms wisely!
---
Abbys bunker
---
Every vendor bot sells a recall card! It’s under the misc tab. You then need to combine the card with some  Fluorescent￼ flux at a tinkers bench. Then you go to the recall site and use the recall terminal. You can only do it once per two hours on a sever I think, but you can do them back to back if you jump servers
---
yea i know, but im lvl 83, so i got a lil bit to go
---
Dont compare single player games with mmo tho, in fallout there is millions of items in the open world, you can interact with, also lightning in this game is very demanding, i have fps drops on my PC to, you need ultra PC to run smooth and look good at the same time, so its not a surprise for consoles. Im playing with 30-60 fps with good graphics, cant play with shit graphics even, even 60 fps not worth it. 
---
TLDR: i can run alot of late games on high 60 fps but still lagging in fo76
---
Do you need one rn? What do you play on
---
Yeah, but to level up score its always 150 atoms
---
They just introduced human npcs in to the game. Something that wasn't there at launch, probably changed the name since it was such a big change to the game.
---
It added a couple new quest lines and some more end game grinding
---
Most definitely, I didn’t say it was not a good weapon. It’s junkies and it has 25%LVC, that’s pretty darn good.
---
Now you'll never be able to get married.
---
VATS is totally borked at the moment, the Gauss rifle is absolutely broken and useless in VATS since the legendary run update. It hits fine now, but it does basically NO DAMAGE despite damage numbers showing it hitting for 2000+, this doesn't seem to be affected by charging before entering VATS or charging AFTER, hit rate seems the same, but the damage does not register, or if it does, it registers about 5% of what it actually shows.
---
I use manual aim right now, until it starts doing actual damage in VATS again.  
---
\*EDIT\* A month ago I soloed the SBQ using my Junkies Gauss Rifle and mostly VATS shots, took me 15 minutes but I did it. Now when fighting even just a stock standard level 50 scorchbeast, which I should be able to just about 1 shot, its nearly impossible to down in VATS, despite the shots hitting and damage numbers showing.
---
No, they're still limited to the same effects to achieve magic damage.
---
I just added the explosive arrows. Now its filthy dirty
---
No point in buying ranks now. May aswell buy on last day of season.
---
Did they get rid or corner roofs
---
I suppose people just like to play Fallout — together, rather than grind RPG all over and over again.
---
Fallout 1st  then move them to second charachter in private server
---
I find that higher levels tend to do building so I roll with that.  Better chances at having all 3 use shared perks
---
Plus, they usually have stocked vendors and good base set ups.  Having teams makes things a lot easier navigating around
---
I know that my handmade ammo run 200 a pile.
---
Raider rp
---
I work a bloody rifleman and have a gauss rifle for my powerhouse slapper. Great for large enemies and huge hp pools.
---
In general, the first shot always misses. Doesnt matter if it is pre charged, or you charge after lockon. Similarly, I've found all the charge up weapons, like bows, are all but guaranteed to miss the first shot in vats. Even activating a crit that was stored that should guarantee a hit, will miss. 
---
This is simply how it has functioned for me. I usually waste the first shot and then it functions as you would expect. With some perks for auto target swapping and ap refresh on kills, as long as you keep a field of enemies in front of you it is a devastating head popper
---
I would recommend it as your big gun, and carrying a handmade or other faster rifle(fixer is cool) for your bread and butter gun. The gauss can easily hit 4k shots, but it doesn't really matter if you can one shot every ghoul with your basic handmade that has 30 rounds in the drum.
---
I don’t think you can name them anymore. Saw old guides about it, but sadly I had no option to name my Mirelurk Hunter “Pinchy”
---
Is VATS bonkers for all/most guns or just the Gauss right now? And I’m fine with manual (just need to get a scope if that’s the case) Gauss iron sights aren’t good for distance shots. (And I can hit pretty fat shots with both black powder weapons)
---
That's just a furious gun with suppressor perk equipped
---
It wasn't so much scary, but the first time I entered fort defiance, there was a fucking wendigo pushed up against the wire fencing  that separated me from him and the elevator, and i was both intimidated and overcome by laughter at what i can only describe as the chimpanzee door meme brought tk digital life before me.
---
The accuracy Stat is your VATS % hit. Scopes all increase accuracy.
---
Could you please add:
---
* The player who heals the friendly npcs in events using friendly fire
---
* The player who is willing to go off to another feeding station buy themselves eventhough the rest of the 7 people there are clustered on the first one during the project paradise? Usually these players are able to get the second station at least to level 2 which really helps alot. 
---
* Players who wait for everyone to shot the legendary before they kill it
---
Reflex sight reduces AP cost
---
nah i found some, thanks tho
---
What did the human NPC’s add to the game? Just them being there and some possible quests?
---
Yeah, I have a Standard Gauss (unlocking mods for it) and a AA 1* hand made (full auto)
---
So true! Never seen anyone interfering with what I did while I was in a building team and I was quite happy about it. I guess countless other team members I never heard from again felt the same :D
---
Thats the point, you pay the same price for a rank, regardless of whether its rank 10-11 or rank 99-100, so you may aswell save your atoms for as late in the season as possible to maximise their value. At level 30 1 rank costs less than the dailies you are given, by rank 80 it will cost 3k per level meaning you will need to do dailies and grind an additional 1k score to rank up, therefore the same amount of atoms gets you "more" if you use it at a higher rank instead of a lower or mid rank.
---
Brotherhood supports genocide. End the hate!
---
There is definitely at least one exploit around it, some people reached rank 100 within 72 hours of the update
---
You can’t in game, but that’s what I named him and referred to him as. He was a special boy.
---
Other things to note btw :  
---
Explosive damage doesn't work on SBQ afaik (including Gauss explosion).  
---
If your target is in combat, your sneak bonus doesn't count from what I understand.  
---
Bloodied/Unyielding builds have highest DPS once you stack all the things together.  
---
There's a bunch of broken weapons doing magical damage due to weird buggy things and mechanics. Shotguns and anything with 200ish fire rate trigger the bug. Look up Angry Turtle's vids on YouTube for more info.
---

Found this on this sub, most helpful thing ever!
---
(and yeah it's tomorrow)
---
Thank you.
---
Is your Gauss rifle working properly in VATS on SBQ and other scorchbeasts? I don't use the gauss in VATS on anything outside of boss fights essentially, but it hasn't worked properly for me since the legendary run update. See my post above to understand what I mean.
---
there's multiple ways to glitch through walls, most involve power armor. Lots of people see it as a challenge to get inside locked rooms.
---
Yup camp budget sucks. I see a couple people waving the Beth flag proudly, trying to put the blame on the users. Ignore them. They can't be helped.
---
Is this for nuclear winter too?
---
Im at the moement enjoying that perfectly perserved grind where you just press one button for hours
---
Everyone on this thread is a hero :)
---
Dammit, it took me three weeks to find Dudditz.
---
If they use ammo points then we could finally sell ammo to vendor bots
---
For me its just broken for the Gauss Rifle and maybe the gauss shotgun to some degree. They generally always hit fine but its just not doing damage. I don't know if this is happening to everyone or just me though. I roll with a handmade and a fixer as my main weapons and the handmade has issues with low accuracy (its a TSE) but the fixer is just about spot on every time, I don't think I miss first shots with it if its at 90% or higher.
---
&gt; i do not know the unsaid rules 
---
Rule 1: do not one-shot legendaries at a public event.
---
...
---
That's about the end of the rules.
---
Head to the overseers house after talking with Duchess at the wayward
---
Welp. I'm never doing the faction dailys then. I thought I was almost done but nvm.
---
I'm gonna get to where I want in the season pass and stop playing completely until next season. :D makes it more fun.
---
They’re sort of a novelty, but they’re a lot of fun. Not great for big boss fights, but even unperked, if you’ve got the stealth stuff working right, they’ll be a good time. 
---
They work fine in VATS, you just have to get the hang of it. Draw it completely—look for the tip of the arrow to be shaking a bit—, then VATS and immediately release. You have to get the timing right, it takes a bit of practice, but once you get it, you’ll love using it from time to time.
---
Possible he wandered into a random encounter and died.  Or your base was attacked when someone came to check your vendors (most likely). I can’t tell you how many times I come back to my base to see someone at my vendor with my turrets going crazy attacking a creature and they don’t bother to help even though they likely triggered it to begin with.  
---
Side rant:  Someone came to my base and tesla’d my Brahmin - killing it.  They did a heart emoji and went to my vendor.  I wanted to boot them out but there isn’t a way unless I left the server.
---
Couldn’t agree more. I was horde too, damn Alliance lol.
---
Hello,You can complete up to 3 quests for both faction, after 3rd quest there is Vault 79 raid. I would recommend you to complete all quests for raiders and settlers before choosing side ( vault 79 raid quest ).
---
TL:DR : Do all the quests for raiders and settlers, then proceed to raid vault 79.
---
In order to start these quests, you have to complete Inoculation quests and ROSE quests ( Top of the world ) for accesing raider quest line.EDIT :Main quest : [Vaccine for scorched plague](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/An_Ounce_of_Prevention) ( after this quest Overseer should contact you to start settlers / raider quests )
---
For raiders to unlock you will need to complete [this one.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Signal_Strength)
---
Lol, I've never had the patience for that! Good luck! :)
---
I'm having trouble sending msg I'm in a private server send me your name and I'll add you then you can join my game
---
Ah. So you’re saying it hits in VATS and numbers come up but it either does no actual damage or only partial damage? I only have a 1* level 25 AA handmade
---

I dont see the name can you let me know your IGN?
---
If I’m doing a low lvl event and a bunch of low lvl players show up I don’t bother killing anything unless they are getting wrecked. I’ll let them get their xp.
---
Uhuhhhh... some paints (or paints very similar to them) have come back. I've got a hot rod paint set that looks a lot like atom cats. Military I think came around once? Haven't noticed winterized but I had a 6 month hiatus.
---
Cheers I will definitely hold onto it and have a play around with it at some point. I have a heap of different weapons that I like to use at the moment, would be great to add a bow to the arsenal.
---
Google turtle magic weapons and you will get an explanation.
---
Have fun with it - I find that a junkies gauss shotgun is an utter beast in combat. 👌
---
I get almost 380 per Lvl 68 SM, sometimes almost 600. But I'm a high Int build, 38. I run with a group of 4 in an Event Team, we roam the map clearing all the events. Usually get around 2.5k to 3k per event. Things like scorched earth closer to 5k.
---
I've heard mixed reviews on which one is best. Build team will give you consistent overall increase of 8%.
---
Using your figures, 216 xp per kill for argument sake. An extra 16 xp, will take you a lot of kills to make up for the 1-1.5k extra XP you could get per event.
---
Basically, you could run around killing stuff in an event team, then run an event and be way further ahead.
---
But there is one Team which really works for Grinding XP. That's Hunter in a group of 4. Clearing all fissure sites on a private world. Friends of mine do that and they are getting 2.5-3k per legendary and 1-1.5k for normal SB. But man that is the worst kind of grinding and you'll be burning yourself out real quick with the game that way!!!
---
I'm not in the pts,but at first ,upgrades were not account wide. 
---
I read that it was now changed and that points are shared,so making alts to lvl 50 would be the fastest way to get some perk packs.
---
I'd also like a confirmation from pts.
---
Found 1 at the power plant main office
---
Find someone with fasnacht collectron, no doubt they have more than they need
---
How much shit do you have in your inventory? And I mean everything. I don't know if it affects the weapon wheel specifically, but all that shit in your inventory- holotapes, notes, maps, etc causes slowdowns anytime you're in your inventory. Dump all that shit in your stash or even better somewhere in the world.
---
I have zero issues on PC on most of my characters, but I do have a vendor/storage mule that has.... let's just say hundreds of pieces of equipment, ALONG with stacks of basically every non-perishable Aid item in the game, along with choice Junk etc.
---
His inventory menu can get pretty laggy, especially when trying to change things in his vendors.
---
One of my characters has a free vending machine with preserved food, lockpicks, meds, treasure maps, etc. and most people are pretty good about only taking what they need, about 25% of people take entire stacks of things (do you really need 3 of the same treasure map?), and about 10% of people just take everything. I once saw a level 300 player taking everything in there, including .38 ammo. I ended up putting a switch on it and turning it off when I'm not there; very few people seem to be able to figure out there's a switch even though it's on the back of the machine. I also have a pool table right by the spawn point with a sign that says "donations for other players" which I leave a bag on. Most of the time I return to camp there are more bags or people have added to mine. I've actually gotten some three star legendaries from that table.
---
Don't buy them now. Buy them later on the last days of the season. While it will cost 150 for each rank you will benefit buying them later as the amount of score per rank increases. It makes no sense to buy them now when you are at lower ranks. Unless you are planning to buy all ranks right now ofc.
---
Don’t know if it’ll help with your situation but I went into the advanced sound settings for my headphones, under Sound settings in Control panel, and turned on the “Windows Sonic for Headphones.” 
---
This seems to have fixed my issue and I can hear both team and area chat now.
---
I can achieve roughly 25k EXP per 5-8 minutes.
---
Oh.... I EXP grind too hard.
---
I'm still working 8 hour days, but missed out on a lot of time over the weekend because of ugh "Adult" responsibilities. I'm rank 55 as of last night.
---
I'm going to double check those numbers tonight.
---
I have some tests to check...
---
It's a mechanic, and I'm 99% sure they DID say something about it, as it was explicitly to discourage people doing exactly what the guy the OP is talking about. People would also try to instigate PVP during it, fishing for folks who had Pacifist off, for the same goals.
---
This is the way..
---
It's also entirely possible to get blown up. :)
---
Seriously, this event (and others like SBQ) needs an extension for the no-junk-drop timer for 1 or 2 Minutes after it ends - with the chaos going on there you often don't know where the sheepsquach is exactly, not to mention random legendary gutsys and the like. Not to mention the other robots don't despawn when the event is over, so you usually got at least half a dozen ballistic gutsys hanging around laughing at your pathetic 300+ DR imaginary armor. Oh, and exploding eyebots.
---
I've been killed at least 3 times after the event was over, and this event is famous for asshole vultures scanning for paper bags, it sucks major ass.
---
Too late lol
---
There are some events that give tons of XP and are really time efficient: Radiation Rumble, Guided Meditation, Line in the sand. If I solo these (especially bugged Line in the sand) it's 2 levels with XP buffs in 10 min. That's 30k XP or so, ranks up SCORE fast.
---
killjoy7777
---
Tell me about it but maybe they haven't gotten the plan for switches yet.
---
This fallout, not borderlands 3. 
---
I still like the idea tho
---
Yes I do being im also a bloodied build but most times I can jump over or around it. But I haven’t had any luck with finding any legacy weapons at vendors so I’m giving up on going. But to your question it always annoyed me and I would have to walk somewhere so I can get my rads back up lol
---
Yeah. Super nifty amenity, but at least add a switch 🙄
---
Rule 2: Don't not do the objective
---
What are you playing on?
---
I never considered that, it’s possible but kind of unlikely. But still, good point.
---
Just take multiple workshops and loot them once they get to 3 or less since that’s the max or go around and take some from common power armor spawn points etc. I wear power armor constantly and use Gatling lasers and I rarely have to farm for them. Once you get 30+ it usually keeps me going for awhile. Another thing to consider is power user in intelligence to increase how long they last
---
People can buy from vendors even with no power, fyi
---
I think your point is valid but it doesn't applies to fallout 4 and 76, and here's why:
---
Fallout 4 happens lots of years into the future since the bombs dropped and civilization has prospered a lot, just look how the Brotherhood of Steel has a moving air base and how the institute has literally the tools to restore the planet to its form from before the war. For me the fallout 4 theme expresses that hope and actually there are dark and terrifying themes, when it's night time or when you enter a dungeon, for me at least, fallout 4 keeps that horror feeling when it needs to and adds some hopeful themes when it has to.
---
Now Fallout 76 is settled 25 years after the war in the region of West Virginia, Appalachia. Now if we compared Appalachia to DC or Pittsburgh Appalachia seems like an **almost-heavenly place**, trees everywhere, green colorful valleys full of vegetation, not all the wildlife is hostile, the soil is more fertile than the ones from other regions of the US. I think my point is clear and fallout 76's theme wants to express the feeling of hope the post-nuclear Appalachia gives, after all, the game main premise is to rebuild civilization. 
---
But as fallout 4, fallout 76 still has dark and **sad** themes, that's something I don't hear since fallout 3, sad themes like the ash heap theme that's literally labeled as *ash heap lullabies* because the region is almost dead and contrasts in a horrifying way with the forest (in a good way). 
---
Now if we go to the toxic valley the same happens, it has in my opinion, a soundtrack that blends perfectly the feeling of hope (hope of being able to rebuild the future) and the feeling of horror (from seeing how places like the toxic valley or the ash heap live exactly next to regions like the forest or the savage divide).
---
So yes, I think all fallout games should have horror aesthetic and a dark theme, but fallout 4 and 76 already have that and it mixes perfectly with their worlds.
---
Inner corner yes, outer corner is a variant of flat roof.
---
Were you trying to use RadAway at some point?
---
Sometimes, if you go from the Items tab to the Stats tab and are on *any* page except the first where you'd use Stims and RadAway, any buttons you press will act on the last item you had highlighted in the Items tab. So on PS4, the button you would press for RadAway would drop the weapon you equipped before changing tabs, for example.
---
This game is so embarrassingly broken..
---
Bows are fun they said ... :D  
---
Bows are fun they said ... :/  
---
But sometimes I really dont understand how could I miss my shot, but it ends up in a free space between legs or between body and arm. :D
---
I always carry a gamma gun for that in case no rads near by
---
Yes! Preach!
---
The vats bug with bows missing the first shot, can be fixed when you enter vats THEN draw/notch the bow. If you draw the bow and hold it (similar to like the gauss rifle charge but dont shoot) and then enter vats, you'll miss that first shot
---
Multiple nw lasers weapons and been handing them out like hot cakes to the gamepass players no bans yet :p
---
I've noticed when the heat is on in a battle and you have to fix a broken weapon, I sometimes hit R for reload when in my pip-boy out of muscle memory instead of X then T for fixing it. Screen pops up with drop favorite weapon. Which I immediately decline.
---
My advice is always favorite or place a skin on your gear. Stops the accidental drops.
---
I doubt there is a inventory hack again.
---
I feel your pain. They added way to many random encounters to the same pool as pets. They should have just made more spots and separate pools. But what can you do.
---
Hope it wasn't me lol, I always wait at least 5 minutes before logging off if someone is at my base 😏
---
It functions the same no matter what enemy type I am attacking
---
upuranus66
---
AA is a good effect. I'd switch to semi to make use of rifleman perks for both guns.
---
Or now, accidentally leave your team and join theirs.
---
I’ve lost a deathclaw ,two mega sloths, a rad toad ,a scorched yo gai, and a analogy gaster to the liberator we that spawn by my house may they all rest in piece
---
I hate it when low level players prematurely start that event. I block them, shoot at them, and use the negative emotes until they get off the computer. Just please wait for more people to show up, there’s a timer for that reason. 
---
One time a lvl 28 started the event, in-spite of me and my teammate’s efforts to stop him. There weren’t enough of us, and too many low level players flocked and had no idea what to do. I wound up having to be a conduit for all three pylons, and my teammate killed the imposter. No one else got to hit it, because I was too busy staying alive and the noobs didn’t know what was going on. A complete waste of caps.
---
I have a Bloodied 33Vats hit 25 LVC bow and it's a beauty. I can 1 tap everything. Also have a Bloodied crossbow and a TSE crossbow. But are a blast. It can sometimes be a challenge when spotted but it adds to the fun. Its not a Queen killer or Encrypted killer but you can do decent dmg. Itll just take longer
---
You can trust me! I will only steal a little. You have my personal guarantee that you will get back at least 50% of the items you hand to me!
---
I have a walled outpost type camp and the refugee section of the camp is walled aswell (i keep the vendor there) but I've fast traveled enough to my camp to know the spawn for it so i just put down a couple of cut outs to hopefully point people in the right direction
---
I doubt that it was an “accidental drop” as I was using my Gatling plasma that was %150 repaired, the weapon disappeared plain and simple.
---
Collect 4 Moist Radkelp and place them into a Display Case at your camp.
---
As opposed to?
---
Damn those vault dwellers, with Stealth boy mark III, cutting onions !
---
No I haven't 😔 but now I *really* want to.
---
TBH my build is already screwed up. At early levels I took gunslinger up to rank 3 haven’t touched a pistol since level 20. I got scrapper because I didn’t read it all I saw was get more components when you scrap. I have bullet shield rank 2 and heavy gunner rank 3 when I was on my heavy phase. And I have rifleman rank 2 now.
---
I’m at 55. Done all the weeklies, most of the dailies, and plenty of west tek
---
This game is different than other shooter games i played in the past, in FO76 you can gain huge advantage over others just by owning certain items. Those who can’t play well in other action games and can’t farm their own gear, yet want to role play some ‘badass’ created a market for the exploiters. Those shouting at you are either defending their money-making business or attempting to justify the advantages they bought with real money. It makes me lol every time when wannabes armed with full sets of duped bs telling others to ‘git gud’, while they themselves can’t play without supplies from dupers.
---
What on earth is moist radkelp
---
Well I’m not quite sure. Maybe trading or some other interactions. And there is the possibility that they could bring a new feature to the game like the NPC humans can give you items or something. I’m not sure though.
---
Get a courier maybe
---
How did he loot if he didnt tag?
---
I was originally hunting for a megasloth, and I did get one but it died two minutes after I tamed it. I found Dudditz two days later, and decided a deathclaw was good enough, because I was not hopping that many servers again.
---
I want a sentient Baby Megasloth. And his Ally buildable should either be a Tree, a hammock or a tree with a Hammock
---
God, how is that even fun?
---
It will all be fixed in time and level ups. No worries just keep having fun
---
I used to make graves for each one until I realized I was living in pet cemetery.
---
I’ve noticed this too. I run a bed breakfast bar out of my camp lol. I have a vending machine with booze and breakfast food priced between 2 and 3 caps. Do you really need 4 Awesome Opossum Bacon? Well, I guess if you’re that hungry lol, but I mostly intended it as a “take one to show your appreciation.” So I usually keep extra breakfast food in my inventory to replenish. The same thing happens to the alcohol too, so I don’t think it’s necessarily due to the food buff.
---
Didn’t even have the weapon equipped or recently used it. we were just fighting a SB Queen I used my Gatling plasma and I was planning on modding this one next because I made my character a heavy build, the weapon disappeared it was a pretty easy match I was heading to camp to work on it after I fast traveled it wasn’t there.
---

---
No clue but this looks fun
---
This may seem terribly morbid but they died in the service of duty summoning the ledgendary pet I have now
---
And I can farm different fungi off their back every so often, like milking the cows
---
Yeah. I know after level 50 you can move perk points around or pick a perk card so I adjust it there. I was just trying to find what weapon type I like. Most FO games I like semi auto rifles but I wanted to change it up a bit
---
As someone who searched for this terminal for my mule account for 40 minutes. The issue is not finding one, but finding still hackable one. Had to jump servers 8 times, before being able to hack any terminal.
---
I just want to confirm, is this a double exp or double score weekend.  I read people saying it's a double score weekend. I want to know if I can complete my weekly's tonight.
---
nah raider RP would be killing the guy during the event over an over until they leave
---
Happy Hunting!
---
It's manual now it seems, pressing "A" on an xbox controller will put the mark over their head but I can't figure out what key on the keyboard will do the same. 
---
I was expecting the Fallout 4 style of the recon scope :(
---
The price is 150 atoms per level? Hmmm that’s pretty steep since all I want is that gatling gun skin.
---
idk, done it everytime it pops up...sometimes with 6 ppl showing up...have had no issues in the last two weeks
---
Dudditz was a two star legendary diseased deathclaw, but he was only a level 21. That’s why I kept him indoors, my house rarely got attacked and when it did, my house took the brunt of the damage. Dudditz remained unscathed, until he went for a walk today.
---
This was me for a long time.  It got so much hate and somewhat deservingly because of the horrible marketing mess that Bethesda was at its launch.  I’m hooked now though and glad I gave it a chance.
---
Pro tip: Don‘t get hit with a bloodied build, stack as much AR as possible, run Serendipity Perk, run bodyguard perk in a group of 4 and you enhance your glasscannon life a little. But yea, just-dont-get-hit. And if a Mr. Gutsy hits you AND you die, this is a clear indicator that you‘re a) doing something wrong or b) your gear is way to low to run a bloodied build „smoothly“. No homo, just sayin‘ 
---
I run a bloodied build with nerd rage and i dont see any problem with any mob.
---
Auto tesla rifle, problem solved
---
I'm still waiting for you, I've sent you several friend requests.  Add me.  upuranus66, come to me.
---
🤣
---
Damn w two star I’d hate it if my 3 star mirelurk king did that :( I’m honestly worried now since I think it happened with my sloth
---
On the bottom of the screen there's a greyed out option saying rank up. I believe that's it
---
Been using perk loadouts since just a few weeks after the game launched in 2018. I can not imagine playing without it.
---
There is little incentive for ESO (base game) to get removed.  They practically give it away every other month.  Leave it there and enjoy the extra player base that will likely result in some/many buying DLC and subs.
---
I can't play without Perk Loadouts (mod) I just hope the iteration of Beth is just as good or better. (I feel it may have limitations) it's so far off however...-_-
---
Youre the kind of guy who nukes a low levels base just because the guy has to use all his screws to repair his workbenches
---
I got a TSE Cryolator from Watoga vendor yesterday, assuming its a dupe
---
If I try it tomorrow and he bugs out, I'm blaming you =P
---
They are also so skinny they don’t block half of the screen like heavy weapons. Totally satisfying to use.
---
Fallout 1st is the way to go. I do it by myself and works everytime
---
I thought the somerset did extra damage to robots? Thats a special effect and may not show up in the vendor menu since we can't inspect.
---
why tho, it doesnt affect u in anyway. You would have done the event either way right? People get mad a others for doing the event and not doing the event, I never understood that. Why does you helping someone else a little bit at no cost to you bother you?
---
Fair enough...remember sometimes it doesnt move because the mob hasnt spawned yet or theres a random lone enemy off in the distance
---
I’m still holding out hope, he’ll be home when I login tomorrow.
---
Right, for me its totally broken. I figured it was a bug introduced with The legendary run, but now I'm noticing it may just be happening to me. When I headshot crit a scorchbeast for nearly 3k, it should die, or come extremely close, yet it only takes off the tiniest sliver of HP. Its practically unusable for me in VATS at the moment :(
---
I'm level 278 and my TSE lever action rifle is still by far my favorite gun.
---
If they were to add this it would need to be scaled by +1,+2,+3,+4,+5 or 5, 10, 15, 20 at most. 100 is a massive amount and dont see that happening
---
I think you're thinking of the Voice of Set...the one you get from the Mistress of Mystery questline.
---
The one I'm referring to, which i did buy, has no effect on it.
---
No im not a fucking monster, this guy was literally just playing the game and feels like he has to apologize for taking part in an event, people can do whatever they want he should have told the mob of people harassing him to quit being such whiners. As if encrypted is that hard to start in the first place...
---
I got a 3 star junkies mini gun middle of last week from that vendor and a 2 star junkies Gatling plasma gun that’s when I bought them and next day I see a video about a dupe happening. So I’m guessing that’s what I got also. But since then I have not seen anymore down there or any at vendors but if you goto market place everybody and their brother now have one.
---
Yes, yes I am. :)
---
Don't forget the one at clarksburg shooting range.
---
That does look fun, thanks great grandpa
---
..”and wasn’t aware that when you get a bounty you can’t see other people/camps on the map.” What did you expect for taking another players stuff lol?
---
Yeah but the more I mention this on this subreddit, the more I'm beginning to realise that this may be a problem affecting only me. It only happens with the Gauss Rifle and it mainly seems to happen on Scorchbeasts when they're flying around.
---
well considering i only picked it, not that...
---
Last time I tried, thinking "one more chance..." I was sat at the destination house with him, killed everything in town, retraced the route, killed everything within scope distance, sat through several respawns and the timer ran out...
---
You aren't responding here, in DM, or in game.  Don't know whats up but I'm out.  Good luck finding the plan.
---
Oh
---
I want gail living at my camp.
---
A real raider would just let him kill each wave, then shake him down for all the loot. Rinse and repeat.
---
Perk load outs are supposedly coming soon.
---
To be fair there are 5.56 and 308 Saigas in existence and they shoot really well.
---
It is unlocked at r60 of nw
---
I think it’s happened to me or a different bug. I could head shot with my lever action and 300+ pops up and the health goes to zero but they are still alive and when the health bar shows up again they are at full hp and no matter what I do I can’t kill them.
---
I've done that.. Also had a match where it was three of us on a team and a bush-hider left... my companion decided to launch a nuke but it covered the entire area of the small circle. Killed us all... no first, second or 4th place, it just said STALEMATE lol smh
---
The perk loadout manager mod already does this, and perk loadouts are officially coming to the game in the next few months.
---
Ive had that happen to. sending the energy your way. i have absolute confidence itll work for you tomorrow
---
Good luck
---
That’s crazy and yes fucking unacceptable, it makes me crazy every time. It pushed me to play melee and switch less possible but dear Bethesda that’s really embarrassing
---
Yep. Lvl 60 Nuclear Winter. The only reason I played NW was to get that paint.
---
TBH I don't care for the bow but love my crossbow.  In VATS it is great.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Looting the final boss should be an event objective or have the Sheepsquatch loot be part of the Event rewards.  If there is going to be a massive explosion, then we shouldn't need to loot it.
---
Raiders have Gauss Minigun and Armco machine
---
Settlers have Gauss Shotgun and Turbo Fertilizer
---
Choosing one helps lower the rep grind. Gold bullion you can get by doing public events.
---
It sounds similar, this one never shows a large chunk of their HP bar going down though, it shows mass damage, but only a tiny sliver of hp actually disappears. Like say it hits for 2500, its acting more like its hitting for about 100. I can do more damage with a manually aimed shot from my TSE handmade than I can with a charged VATS crit to the head. Even though the numbers shown show the Gauss rifle should be doing about 10x more damage.
---
Yes
---
I see that your tesla keyboard chained your first reply into another one.
---
You salty that my PC from 2013 performs better than your shitty console?
---
I’m pissed at myself atm because I just started my 3rd alt and still screwed up by doing that quest so early. I really wanted to hold off on it for a higher level to see if I could get a better leveled version. I just forgot which quest awarded it until I got a crap level 5.
---
I do.  My 'main' was swapping around weapons to try and figure out which one i liked.  Then i got my first, unmodded, LE rifle.  I've not changed it or since.   Even adjusted my perk cards to max out its effectiveness.
---
gotta live reddit
---
With introducing public teams and considering limitation of communication w/o mic - &gt; even I, lonely loner, total anti-social creep, un-reasonable introvert and non-talkative judgy observer, kick up my mic and talk, when it is mandatory :D  
---
( I still feel very, very, very uncomfortable while communicating with others, but thats my problem :D )
---
Camp's laughter
---
Yeah..good post. I've loads. Exploders Junkies Quads. Best weapon in the game.
---
Imagine your pvping against another player, you’re a bloody stealth build, invisible to their eyes. You slowly stalk them, having them in your crosshairs until the perfect moment. Just before you talk your shot, the last thing you see is...”target acquired.” You’re distracted, the enemy player now knows your position, and the enemy player blows you to pieces with their two shot explosive 50cal. The last thing you heard on your dying breath, was the insult of a robot.
---
I don't have any experience with Vortex but I have a decent amount of experience with nexus mods. The majority of the mods on there are already compiled into ba2 so you should not have to do that yourself (unless you really want to). The main thing is to place the ba2 file into the Fallout76/Data folder and then set up a Fallout76Custom file under the Documents/My games/Fallouot 76. This file is very easy to edit. Anytime I want to add a new mod, it literally takes me 1 minute to do. Alot of times the mods on the nexus will have an installation guide in the description, however, it is pretty much the same for all mods for fallout 76.
---
It's such an early quest, so I can definitely see accidentally getting it when you don't want. This one has nothing on it. I've been at this game for a year and a half and I've never seen one like this.
---
Mine is primed not because I need damage, but because I get so much more ammo.
---
Maybe the real problem is that even with ammosmith and super duper, normal ammo crafting yields are too low.  Try feeding a railway rifle for a while and you'll agree.
---
Ah ok. I think yours is worse because usually in mine they just stand there going through idle animation with no armor and weapon. They don’t attack or detect you (but VATS will still lock on to them in the middle of a fight, Hahahaha.)
---
Gamepass.
---
There wasn’t consistency to begin with, how in the world does 5.56 fit in a banana clip lol and you ‘swivel’ the mag into an AK’s magwell, not straight up insert like the in game animation. Don’t worry about realism, FO is in a different universe.
---
 Carry a gamma gun to easily restore rads.
---
Only run bloodied currently, so I get it, but it's not on the house owner to maintain your setup. Some out there also despise bloodied &amp; do this very much intentionally. I personally have mine activated by pressure plate, it's easy enough to run past before getting any reduction, but not everyone will go to those lengths (plus mine isnt a requisite to get to vendors).
---
I'm relatively certain that the ammo converter will be obtainable beyond this season as everything functional in the game that I can think of never gets taken out of circulation, only cosmetic stuff.
---
Yay! So happy
---
Ya i have to agree with the other guy, if you cant argue points you go against grammar. You are a gullible idiot
---
I wish Fallout 76 was my top, but even when I sum all the playtime of FO1,2,3, New Vegas, 4 and 76, it cant even get close to my playtime of DotA 2 ... :D
---
Honestly, I thought it was common knowledge to leave them somewhere where they’re optional or can be turned off for those who don’t want them used?  When I had one at my base, it was a given. There was 1 staircase to go thru and to the vendors, and another beside it without, at least until I got the switch plans to make turning it off an option.
---
I see my ESP is highly tuned then
---
I don’t want you tracking your glowing pustules all over my linoleum!
---
I think people kill the mobs for xp ignore the ore and failing the event, just xp farming.
---
Love this comment dude
---
If you still need someone I can join up after my NW match is over
---
This is legitimately part of the problem.  All the nukes are heading for prime and nobody is fighting in the nuke zone.  Can't get sufficient HRF.  
---
A secondary problem is the faction dailies and score challenge.  People are spending much more time doing those and less time launching nukes.
---
So what is the answer beyond "Nuke somewhere else"?... because people are gonna continue nuking the queen and spending most of their time chasing score and rep.
---
yeah please :)
---
gamertag is AytekinW
---
join my world when you can
---
Truly awesome
---
What!? Seriously??  
---
**Uranium Fever** and scrap the Mole Miner Gauntlets. You get 2 teeth for every gauntlet you scrap.
---
Forgive the dumb question but I needed clarification. Do you log in donor, drop items, log out, switch, &amp; log back in and wind up on same private server even with the 2 different toons?
---
IDGAF if you buy thousands.  If that makes the game more enjoyable for you, go for it.
---
I don't buy it, but I won't say that I *wouldn't* if I really needed more than I can get.
---
It's actually faster opening the pipboy, switching to weapon/help/whatever and looking for the item. And this is so embarassing.
---
My wife loves collecting the collectables in 76, Hearing her shout everytime she finds one she didnt have makes it worth farming for hours to help her find them.
---
That little girl and her family are treasures. I wish they'd remove display items from both the stash and build limits theres so many things that are awesome to share but leave you no room for 'essential' items. :/
---
I’ve seen even some high level players’ camps force others to go thru it to reach their vending machine, my conclusion is some people never heard of such thing as ‘bloodied build’.
---
Was doing a silo with a group on discord. One of them had the "Vanellope Von Schweetz" PA paint. She was kind enough to wait while I called my daughter over to come see. My daughter laught with delight at the pink sprinkels robot.
---
I don't think the fixer will ever have a skin. it's a skin for the combat rifle in itself, I believe.
---
Hey now! Everything must be clean! Do you realize how badly vault dwellers smell after they have been wandering the wasteland???? I will NOT have that smell in my house! I swear, sometimes it is worse than the smell of my deathclaw pet!
---
bloodborne says hello......
---
Supposedly part of the development plans.
---
Found one of these today, luckily they had maxed out their budget and couldn't afford a ceiling. One good marsupial jump and I was in, and their stuff was overpriced. So I helped myself to their scrapbot loot and got some gum for the daily challenge.
---
I was having issues with my framerate but I did 2 things I'm not sure if this will work for you though
---
1. Update your GPU drivers to the most recent version on Geforce Experience
---
2. Let Geforce Experience scan your fallout 76 it will "optimize it" for your rig as it did mine
---
3. If these don't work screw with Fullscreen and windowed modes
---
I did the first two and I went from something around 20-30fps and constant framedrops to a constant 60!
---
I hope these options work for you!
---
Old "Inside The Vault" stating it's a thing coming. I have used the PC mod however and loved it.
---

Sugar grove, back of the building.
---
ok well the two best answers right here :)
---
I have a switch on mine. And a rad barrel right next to it in case someone leaves it running.
---
Definitely duped and dumped.
---
What do you need them for?  
---
I scrap them in such high quantities that it'd be like someone asking where to find wood or steel! 😅
---
Time to bush camp my life away
---
Confirmed!
---
I would love to be able to tag the armor pieces that I currently wear as belonging to an armor set, then put those armor sets on the favorites wheel instead of individual pieces. As you say, the power armor frames already do this for PA pieces.
---
Strange.  I've been playing the game for 3 weeks and always had that backpack until the other day. Must be a glitch, like you said. I'll just add that to the LONG list of buggy crap in this game.
---
Craig, thank you so much for trouble-shooting me through all of this. This is still new territory for me. All it required was me picking up the flora to get it to pop up in the chemistry station. You're a rockstar man!
---
Still need to die?
---
He was talking about the tent glitch
---
yeah
---
Joining now
---
I guess the main concept is not letting him outrun you and I presume it's intended for him to reach the last level on the last day of the season. So if you'll still be falling behind by that time, he will win the race leaving you with no final rewards.
---
PC I'm afraid.
---
Another program such as discord might be an option, but would involve getting my brother to install it, make an account, remember to fire it up  etc. and he'll probably say he'd rather just play as we have been.
---
Chat still working when the game crashes or we have to switch worlds would be handy though, so I'll run it by him.
---
You can also get them from scrapping the Mole Miner Gauntlets.
---
Wholesome 76. Overseer is gleaming with joy right now.
---
Happy trails
---
I haven’t seen the pies piper yet either!!!
---
Forget about it guys with the legendary perks being added you won’t have perk cards to spare for 2 loadouts
---
Edit: the mention that they working on it and it going to release with brotherhood of steeel dlc
---
if that was you who just killed me, cheers :)
---
I have a videos of someone getting mad because I wouldn’t sell him my fixer
---
I may give the Mire Free Range another try, now that I'm running one of my characters as a bloodied build, but other than that I only do Free Range in the Forest or Savage Divide due to that first wave of wolves. The glowing wolves you get in the Mire are way overtuned - both in the amount of damage they do to the Brahmin as well as how hard to kill they are. Add in the clipping issues you get when they practically merge into those Brahmin, and Free Range in the Mire is nothing but an exercise in frustration unless you have a group of three or four players at the top of their DPS game.
---
all good now. thanks anyway tho :)
---
It was, no sweat brother. Btw pvp is not fair in the regular game. Fire rate is king. Map nuka quantum to your hotkeys and take the agent perk for stealth boys. Lmk if you wanna learn to cheat in pvp. Aside from sbq, pvp trolling is endgame time killer
---
I just want the Dark Matter skin to work for the Fixer when I finally get it, I do believe nobody has a use for a combat rifle when the fixer exists. Being the more stealthy version of the combat rifle, that all black skin would be perfect for it.
---
Glad you got it done!
---
Near the Sulphur Drink Fountain in Whitesprings. Probably the most common spawn there. If it isn't the Glowing Deathclaw, then it'll be three Yao Guai, or two Glowing Stingwings, or two Glowing Honeybeasts.
---
If that doesnt work for you, server hop random encounter spawn points and look for three super mutants talking about the Airport, and their old boss - then wait.
---
This happened for me as well today! Best. Event. Ever.
---
Just do uranium fever
---
I'm sure there will be a nuka cola themed one eventually.
---
Yep
---
Possibly, but some people definitely do it to mess with bloodies as well.
---
I had exactly this. I can't remember exactly what happened with Beckett as it was a while ago, but I remember something that seemed a bit confusing with the dialog responses.
---
Just played Fun and Games yesterday, and was making sure I chose all of the nicest/friendliest dialog options.
---
At the end, exactly the same as you said happened - she said it was really fun that that I was almost as nice as Gail. I then asked her if she wanted to &gt;!break into Vault 79 with us!&lt;, and (literally, her next line after saying I was nice) she said 'I don't know, you weren't very nice to me'.
---
WTF?
---
There's one also at Bleeding Kate's Grindhouse
---
Building everyday I load into a sever and start a building team and do all my daily’s and if I’m in a mood stay on for hours and grind, west tek and other locations and rank up at least 4 times, and I don’t ever talk to the people who join my team I let them do what they wanna do because they get xp to and if they do a quest and finish it I’m the group you get a little bit of caps.
---
This is fallout. We only allow to have +3 all stats enchanted armor here.
---
I've been blessed with a BE lever-action rifle and thus my endgame search for B fixer has kind of ended. Damage on that BE lever is far beyond all rifles I have (B and E separately). Low level mobs die in pairs to a one shot.
---
That is fantastic.
---
switch to BE lever. It's god tier.
---
See? That was your mistake right there. After stripping down, you should have offered him something in exchange for letting you live....
---
Thats all fine. Provided it's not an Events group. Then i expect you to show up :)
---
Different receivers will change damage and fire rate
---
Automatic fire to single shot, or vice versa?
---
&gt;But why would you do it so early?
---
This. Since you apparently pay per rank, and the higher ranks need more SCORE to attain, the economically rational thing to do would be to grind for SCORE as long as you can and then buy ranks for atoms at the last possible day.

Hm... Good ideas, but I’m looking for something more immediate. Stuff I can go to that will always be there in my private server, guaranteed spawns like hopewell cave and the substation. Also just found out that Behemoths also give a lot of XP too, there’s always one at the bog workshop and there’s one in a pond but I forget where. Big stuff like that is good, doesn’t have to be deathclaws.
---
If you every hear flute music nearby/in the distance, do a quick search around. Look for an eyebot just casually strolling along and he will have 4-5 nonaggressive rad rats following him. He's random but I typically see him about once a week or so.
---
Congrats on reaching that level.  You’ve figured out a farming routine that must work well.  Props!
---
beth needs to get off their lazy ass and fix this half-assed bullshit !!!
---
People don't want to be buying atoms for shit they would had been able to earn in a properly working game. The grind for repeatable 100 score is a fucking slap in the face for ppl who play solo aswell !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Get off your lazy fucking asses dev Motherfuckers !!!!!
---
Give credit where it's deserved. The water wheel... The slocum's Joe vendor .. the ammo converter (when its fixed) are all great. Nice too they finally acknowledged the auto complete bug and will work on it
---
I find it annoying that deco showers show +200 rads or whatever when they in fact take it away, what's that all about?
---
For most things explosive is better but in the Queen ffr is better. Explosive will also make your gun degrade 2x as fast
---
I think it’s just a visual glitch I’ve noticed radaway doing that to.
---
Oh no it's most definitely to mess with bloodied builds. Who let's face it don't always have the best reputation in the community. The bloodied build is all about one shotting everything, and the current loot system punishes everyone else when mobs get one shot. 
---
Personally I just have a switch on my shower and have it in a safe corner. I don't want to risk it getting broken.
---
Not elder lyons
---
Get material, scrub. My God.
---
I'll probably never use a gun on the queen, thanks for letting me know appreciate it.
---
The pond with the behemoth is by swans pond or what ever. Just turn around from the spawn point and hell be there
---
Why would they ever remove it after almost two years of being on the market. You get way more atom shop money then you would be getting from new people buying the name. The atom shop and memberships are the only  reason the game is still being developed.
---
Choo choo! *CLANK*!
---
I just want to use the pumpkin combat rifle skin in the fixer. I've got a full heavy combat set in pumpkin and a glowing skeleton hood. I tend ot use my combat rifle more than my fixer just because I love the pumpkin skin so much haha
---
I've never not found any in the baskets on the table at the building on the west side of the Tyler county fair. (Behind the "Throw and Bowl" and "Nothing But Net". I just grabbed two bubblegum to test the theory. (First try)
---
Conversely- Found a camp that had a radiation emitter and a big FREE RADS sign for those bloody folk who need a bit more carry weight. ( get the plans from Graham )
---
What exploit?
---
I had a wolf a treasured back in the day. Had a deathclaw gauntlet dink kill it (back when players killing pets was a feature) I left the server to no avail, even sent in a support ticket because I was that bitter.
---
I keep a supply of toxic goo from Westek on me for this reason.
---
Remember not to open more than 4, it bugs out.
---
Because the servers at Bethesda would literally explode
---
Double exp. Double score is the week after that
---
Server hopped 17 times and every single one was unlocked :I
---
Or just a simple filter on the map screen, you know.
---
I would do that but the weight screws me up, I have a hard time managing my inventory
---
yes, the private server you create stays for a certain amount of time (I think 5 minutes or so) as long as you do not enter a public server right afterwards. So you can drop stuff in a location or place it into a world container. You then log onto your alt, go into the private world and retrieve it. This is how I moved items to my alt.
---
Nope, but that's a really good idea that I hate because I've bought almost every one of them already and would slam down the atoms on the first day :(
---
Why should I make an effort to keep your build going? I like it at my door way to de-rad as I come in. Get over your bloody self amd wash up.
---
Ah I just looked it up, it’s actually an unmarked location south east of The Vantage, only reason I knew of this location was because I had a buddy camped out here at one point.
---
Thanks man.
---
It says double daily score, so it's for dailys only,
---
I made a sneaky rifle character with shotgun as a secondary weapon for close range. Then after the great nerfing I swapped the shotgun perks for melee, tried bloodied and unarmed. Was lost. Then about 2 weeks ago I got a TSE lever action. Now I'm a sneaky sniper again with the lever action as a secondary weapon for close range and a lot of strength points I don't know what to do with. Way more fun.
---
Tbh this is breaking news... The fact you can use canned coffee to get more air. Ty 😂
---
Ah that too, that’s also a good skin. All combat rifle skins in general should work for the fixer.
---
What I want to know is, are we going to have any way to reclaim our auto-completed SCORE points? I lost out on basically a rank's worth when a bunch of dailies completed. If there's no way to restore SCORE points, have they considered atoms for those who were effected so we can still get the rank level we would have otherwise gotten with the SCORE points?
---
You can also apply the ultralight mod for Scout armour too
---
What if we have the rad barrels set up on the other side for bloodied builds to get their rads back? They're really good, like opposite of a rad shower. I think it's the coolest thing Bethesda has added as a camp reward that has an actual use
---
How many quests besides dailies are like that though
---
I like seeing people who do that.
---
Scorched Earth is the worst for this.
---
I use a vampire shotgun + VATS and can two shot level 91 Deathclaws and other enemies. I want an other shotgun with other legendary perks but the thing recks everything regardless of it not being bloodied, junkies or explosive. Alphas and bosses are a bit more difficult (like the imposter sheepsquatch) It is a legendary 3 star combat shotty
---
I feel like every main settler quest I'd was finding somthing for someone
---
They made the servers global awhile ago for NW. Not sure why you're having so much trouble getting a match
---
If you are the team leader set up a building team, if you join an event change the team role to events just before the event ends, then switch it back to building afterwards. Best of both worlds.
---
I also keep mine on a switch at the bottom of my stairs . Sitting in the Mire so plenty of water around if extra rads are needed.
---
Omg first to say CHARLESTON FIRE DEPT GROUND FLOOR where the gun cage is near the vehicle storage area. Come on guys it's part of the lead run!!
---
Quiet, now go get me a dictionary (and read it), that's your errand for today :-)
---
i have no problem with score, also dont understand how you guys dont get Score from challenges. You must do something wrong. Playing when score challenges resets or bugged it somehow and put your in endless circle of auto completing.
---
I wish I sided with the raiders :(
---
“We gotta get another antenna for the communication array”
---
“I’ll get it”
---
“The hell you will, I’ll send Barry.. I’ve got something important for you”

**IGN:** “revolutionary 10/10”  
---
**PSN magazine:** “GOTY!”  
---
**Hamsters weekly:** “a distinct lack of hamsters”
---
And I heard good things about the wastlanders quest line:(
---
Just say you did, nobody will know any better :-)
---
Try finding a chameleon deathclaw or a scorched mothman 🙂
---
People need to have their rad showers use a switch, so people can turn em off and on at will, that's what I do.
---
I will
---
You could say a vast in improvement in vats :-)
---
How many years have I been playing? Lol it’s crazy there’s still something I haven’t seen 🥰
---
The fact it's only now in development is just really bad
---
That comes to my mind first. Wrong reciever + wrong perks :)
---
I used to leave free stuff in my vendors and I noticed that the genuine new low level players will just take 1 of everything. The high level players and their alts just take everything.
---
This is an inflated "comeback" because of the need to login and play everyday to even stand a chance at getting anything out of this "run"
---
That, and Gamepass.....
---
Sometimes I don't notice an event is happening and by the time I notice and get there it's ending. Can be done accidentally.
---
I'm not absolutely certain, but I think a recent patch improved the helmet resistance to vats. So like I've had days where I couldn't kill a super mutant before I realized that I needed to be aiming away from the head because they were all wearing those stupid propane canister helmet things.
---
I didn't see anything about it in any patch notes, but I was definitely getting headshot denied a lot while I could hit arms and legs perfectly.
---
The scorched in line in the sand don't wear helmets...
---
So I would see if you notice a pattern that I've noticed of late.
---
Nope not fixed. Happens 1 out of 4 times I go into VATS approximately. I just got off like 20 min ago.
---
Before the queen died?
---
That would make the visits from the insult bot less special
---
I took that idea one step further and wired each vendor to their individual garage door, and then wired those switches to a master switch. Great for when I want to keep selling, but also need to lock off high value items.
---
What cant we set prices by typing it... for Todds sake :-)
---
I've had sooo many good memories in NW both solo and in a team. Some of the best PVP action has happened in NW. It has so much potential I hope it expands and grows.
---
Around Xmas I would do a passive Santa Claus play with a prefabbed sled design. I'd just sit and wave to people. Most of the time they'd leave me alone 😂. 
---
Loved your story!
---
Each pellet of a shotgun triggers the life gain effect, so there's that. Then explosive damage on multiple targets triggers it as well. A swing speed knife will usually out-heal damage too.
---
F is for friends who do things together...
---
Is it a 3* by chance?
---
By the way, Meg has a message for you....
---
Saving this post is be interested in them too.
---
Just once I like to hear "oh berry got it for us why you where gone."
---
I agree with Hamsters weekly. However, I really dislike the fact that they make that same review statement for every game. 
---
I am not upset at Hamsters weekly. I am upset at the games for lacking hamsters.
---
Hadn't thought of the pellet one that's good. I run a VE 50 right now and that's perfect but I have a vampire meathook I'd like to use. It has 40 swing so maybe that could work. Thanks!
---
I have mine turned off at the moment, I’m waiting to get e radiation barrel so that bloodied builds can immediately get radiation back.
---
This right here is the answer.
---
I can say it’s 100% to mess with bloodied builds. The same as having the sun kissed perk card maxed out and joining public groups then sharing the perk.
---
What's that
---
Fluxes weigh nothing to the one have junk stash, so I manage to keep 10 cobalt crimson n violet n 5 fluorescent n yellow cake in the stash as back up, while converting other to ultracite ammo n modified all of my PA
---
Same here. Feels bad man.
---
I’m so sorry to my team!! I try not to be the first person to leave a fully bonded team of 4. But then I went to FT somewhere and the game had other plans.
---
For most people ( IMO) this is nit the case. Making a new account means looking your friend list and achievements. Whats the point of playing online game with no friends (Real life or online aquired). I just pay those 15€ every month for that reason. Also it would be so much hassle to do it every 3 months.... to save 14€?
---
Yeah my camp is right above it. I always walk down the hill and kill it. It's great for weapon testing
---
I’m not gonna take you seriously with a name like Fuzzy OwO, thanks tho bud. Go back to your 2000$ rgb setup that your daddy bought you and play the game at a slightly higher frame rate.
---
But at what cost.
---
It feels like everything around inventory slows down and had freezes the more stuff you have, the stash, vendors, pip boy, favorite wheel or even the weapon swap (right d pad) I noticed this after starting a new character/playing NW the almost empty inventory you have in these examples is the reason they run like butter  (almost)
---
Its a shitty effect from back in the day, you would get a shit ton of low level players at the queen making her scale to more players and making her unkillable because not enough damage to overcome the resistance scaling of tue low levels. Yeah if you are getting corpse loot at 25 keep on rocking.
---
Now that is how you rebuild Appalachia. This is why the fallout community is one of the greatest
---
There's a (usually max level) sentrybot at robco exterior. I pay him a visit as a standard part of my route. Gives the same 2200xp+ as the ones in the whitesprings.
---
Also, there usually are more sentrybots around. From the ws main building spawn-point go left through the arch and up the hill, you might encounter up to two more sentybots there (50% of the time it's assaultrons/gutsies which net about half the experience,so still worth it) Also, follow the road beside this parking lot to the facility entrance, there might be another sentry not there.
---
Well then your luck is better then mine lol.
---
I just logged in first time today and have already 5/7 of my daily quests already marked as done without getting any score out of them... Now, that's annoying.
---
Is it possible they renamed a standard .44 pistol?
---
That's pretty much all of the new features of the game so far. The developers I think are having a hard time balancing what we want and what would break the game.
---
Ooh 2200xp? What buffs are you using? I’m using Berry Mentats, tasty squirrel stew with Carnivore, Well Rested and broiled SB brain to get 1200+.
---
I was under the impression that the queen "scales" according to the number of players present, but it doesn't actually count a player as present unless they enter the nuke zone. Anytime I see a couple people go into the nuke zone, I know it's going to be a long fight.
---
Yes this is a great idea! I’m so sick of doing events and stuff and getting 17 .44 rounds and a leather right leg LMAO like come on  that’s useless for me.
---
My Survival Tent is right beside McClintock for the good old ballistic fiber farm. Realized this while stocking up on more of the ballistic fiber, and got my score up. YAY! :D
---
It's a fixed, flat amount of healing per hit (so "Vampire's" is a bit of a misnomer, since it's *not* actually a life-steal that scales with damage, which is usually what this effect would imply in other similar games).
---
This means that it works best on really fast hitting weapons. Fully automatics are best, or 40SS melee weapons.  
---
If you ever find a Vampire's Mr Handy Buzzblade, then you're literally immortal while using it.
---
And what's that?
---
Then you might like my camp... My porch has two sets of stairs - one labeled "mutants" (no shower) and the one with the shower is labeled "boring folks" ;)
---
Renaming is removed when you sell or trade an item. I bought it...it was 150c. It is in my inventory and still says Somerset Special. It shows up as scrappable at a workbench as well.
---
He said a hazmat suit too
---
(Night &amp; Day) when it's night time your weapon does 5% cryo damage and when it's day time your weapon does 5% flame damage.
---
[5%,10%,15%,20%]
---
Glad it helped. Make sure to never use another chassis, or you will lose the bonus, and you'll have to find a new untainted piece to do the process all over again.
---
I put my vendor on the outside of my bunker. 
---
The rad arch is in my front door inside of my bunker.
---
Oh the Mr Handy vampire sounds amazing! I need to see if this is available.
---
It should be desirable amount of ammo converted into desirable amount of ammo wanted.
---
That's why you have the option to skip levels for Atoms. The idea is balancing it between players who spend a lot of time playing and those who have less time. This attitude of entitlement to rewards other players dedicate more time and effort to obtaining for nothing is ridiculous. If you can't do it, too bad, so sad, try again next season.
---
Have you ever played a Bethesda game before? Fallout 3, Fallout 4, Skyrim, oblivion... they're all the same. They all have like 3 basic quests with different story set up or destination.  Go there, kill everyone, get the thing, bring it to me. Go there, kill everyone, get the thing, bring it to someone else, go there, kill everyone, fix the thing.  That's about it. Occasionally they'll mix it up by teaching a new skill or power or giving you a new weapon in the middle but that's all you're doing in any of them.
---
Going into this game expecting any different then complaining about it is the same as the people who complained before the game came out because it was going to be a buggy Bethesda mess and it was going to suck because there were no npc's then bought the game then complained because it was a buggy Bethesda mess and it sucked because there are no npc's. You knew what you were getting.
---
I see you mothman flair. You know that dude at crater thinks the mothman isn't real and his followers are weirdos.
---
I still have not encountered any npcs from Wisconsin. anyone else have luck with that one?
---
Can I convert missiles abd mini nukes into other ammo or only within the category?
---
Chicken is often canned by preppers today.
---
You think having the wrong caliber written on the side is bad, when I first equipped it the iron sights didn't even work right. I had to guesstimate where to shoot until I added a sight
---
I'm usually at 70+ int with herbivore + relish + berry mentats + brain bombs and +int team.
---
I am very curious what the British delicacy jellied eel is like.
---
I don't have one myself, but I've heard the effect is so strong on that weapon that you can use it during Encryptid and tank all 3 pylons and the sheepsquatch as well, as long as you keep it damaging something.
---
Other Vampire weapons can achieve the same thing, but the beauty of the buzzblade is that it never needs reloading and therefore the healing effect never stops, unlike gatling lasers and such.
---
You're... actually using that as an argument? So i have to pay to progress since i've got a life?
---
Hm... I wonder what the carnivore equivalent of that would be? Ah I imagine having a full builder team helps a lot too.
---
While we are at it, this should not just be canning but also with some items PICKLING.
---
Pickled Scorchbeast Brain
---
Also hit up my old best friend, Toxic Larry's Meat 'n Go. You can find up to a potential three squirrel bits there. Two in the fridge and one in the stove pot on the oven.
---
...But really, the hunt for squirrel bits is why I converted to Herbivore + cranberries.
---
That is a very very small percentage of Britain that eat Jellied Eels. Haha. I personally haven't. Sounds vile haha
---
I guess you can achieve pretty much the same high int value. Of course, it's with full unyielding set.
---
Just have the drops be Emblems of Valor or Heroism and then we can trade those in for gear, ammo, cosmetics, caps, hats, emojies and loot boxes. Boom, no problems are solved.
---
You can use both, have the builder bonus active while doing the event, then if you’re the leader, switch the team goal to events right before the event ends. Then switch back to builders after you get the event XP.
---
Why don't you people read Bethesda's official announcements before making "suggestions" that were announced months ago?
---
TIL.
---
Well I guess you have an ironic unique weapon.
---
He posted a routine in the other thread. The Line In The Sand tip alone got me so much fucking xp the last few days.
---
Yeah, in the post apocolyptic wasteland I'll just go up to someone and tell them I have "ammo points", steal some real ammo while he is laughing his ass of and blow his brains out the back of his skull.
---
I have noticed a improvement in vats....
---
It just doesn't feel right, you know? It doesn't feel like a fallout game anymore...
---
Bloodied builds are the biggest crybabies lmao. You're already playing the game on easy mode, stop whining.
---
wtf kind of mentality is this
---
You mean 15.7.
---
Ah I do use full unyielding urban scout armor, berry Mentats, broiled SB brain, well rested, tasty squirrel stew, and that little trick for Unyielding that gives you extra stats if you die and leave the server then come back. My INT is still only up in the 40s though.
---
I kill them then
---
Probably. Getting into trading on PC is very hard unless you have rare or good pieces of gear or plans. Best to just grind on imo.
---
Sorry
---
You have Obtained the Perk card "100% wholesome"
---
For a bloodied I always go faster fire rate, kills things quicker and don’t have to worry about accidentally killing yourself with the very little health you have if mobs get too close
---
It would be nice to have one that gathered cooking ingredients like sugar and spice and salt and the like. That I'd pay for.
---
If you dont wanna be clean in my place youre not welcome to shop
---
Once I got an IE one I have never changed weapons haha :)
---
It bothers me that they are trying to rush legendary perks before perk load outs... Like fix the issues with the first system before implementing a new set of challenges
---
I usually find a window with a workbench close enough to spawn inside.
---
Hi! New player here! How do i buy/get a brahmin? They're so cute!
---
I have indeded played a Bethesda game before and I must say  the majority aren't jammed with fetch quest
---
I dont even have one built at my camp anymore. i have so much radaway and i run a bloodied build my self so i don't have a reason to have one up.
---
Hey, you can put a fertilizer thingy (i forgot the name) from the resource tab of you're building mode :)
---
I like to run around without starched genes so rad showers screw me up if I forget to switch starched genes on.
---
Just picked up perk loadout manager mod and now include starch genes in my non combat travel/buy/sell/craft loadout.
---
It's not an argument, it's a fact about why it was designed that way. Cry all you like, doesn't change the fact that you aren't entitled to rewards other players work for without the effort.
---
When reading these types of stories, I honestly don't understand why there has to be so much toxicity in games. This experience is so much more wholesome then the cheating, abusing and god knows what else people do to each other in games (or in life in general).
---
Thank you for posting this. And of course, thank you for being cool people, as the father said :)
---
I can only speak for my build personally, which is a VATS stealth rifleman and the main reason I like it is because of the extra trait on it, " Improved stealth. Faster sneaking movement speed. " this along with 3 other legendary traits make it pretty hard to beat in terms of versatility, the problem so far is getting the one you want/need. I'm sure there are other reasons for it too, I'm not sure if it totally outdamages the handmade (if at all, I havent done comparisons), but I believe it is better in VATS, saw a video of a youtuber using a B2525 fixer from stealth to solo the SBQ in about 45 seconds.
---
I did figure that this is why not many people enter MY camp but I like the convenience of being de-rad every time I enter MY camp, your build is of 0 concern to me ;), my vendors however are outside.
---
JFC, just watch a review on Youtube or something instead of asking the same question for the 9 billionth time...
---
Got bad news for you the end game is a fetch and oh no the item I want isn't there or has not dropped quest 😡 I'm so frustrated lol
---
Ya unfortunately (figured this out the hard way) on 4x beam, each shot that hits counts as 4 shots and if you have automatic, you'll see the durability go by quickly. Also this won't help if you're using splitter, but if you're not, a forceful grip/stock will extend the durability of the weapon.
---
Stealth boost for sneak crits
---
Finish all your scout badges, little Tadpole.
---
I wouldn't use this if it was free
---
I agree, I thought it was a shit weekly, with your spare time you may be better off grinding the 10 repeatables, however bugthesda struck again and the NW weekly was completable by completing any NW challenge, so I still got it done, not that it helps you or makes it any better.
---
Hopefully bethesda are paying attention to people on their forums and subreddit and can adjust the dailies and weeklies accordingly, I'm not totally against the NW dailies, but I thought having one as a weekly was a bit shitty.
---
Because it's basically a 4 star legendary weapon.
---
Its set up with doing every single daily and weekly where u still won't hit tier 100 unless u still putting in a bunch more time leveling for that tier xp they made it so u have to only play this game only its a bad decision on their part cause so many people play plenty of other games too
---
Yes. If you don't have the time to dedicate to working towards the goal Bethesda has included an option to pay so you can still get the rewards you want. Getting them for free is a reward for being able to dedicate your time and effort to the game, they aren't meant to be hand outs you get just for having purchased the game. So your options are either a) put in the time and work to get them for free. b) Pay for them and help support the game. c) Accept that you won't get every OPTIONAL reward, the majority of which are simple cosmetics.
---
This isn't a single player game. You aren't entitled to everything they release. A staple of online games is releasing limited time, hard to earn items for the players that can and do work their ass off. If be thankful that they included a way for casuals to make it easier on themselves rather than bitch that you can't get the same items over the weekends that someone who plays everyday will.
---
It seems to me that vats has been almost perfect when i'm wearing my unyeilding armor than when wearing my stealth suit.
---
I used to use a two shot lever action before I redid my character build and loved it
---
Am I missing something or why would you need molerat teeth? The fucking thigs always need extra scrapping when walking away from Uranium Fever and so far I never needed them for anything...
---
Okay, you keep telling yourself that.
---
Personally i just have it that way because i like it that way, but you don't have to go through mine to reach the vendors, only if you want to use my stations or empty my water supply (i have 4 industrials running in the basement)
---
Uny double-dipping helps a lot, yeah. Also, I raised my base int to 14, I realized I don't need all the damage buffs I can get, 3 1* cards for heavy weapons are more than enough to one-two shot everything except bosses. It's ineffective to farm bosses for xp anyways so I don't do these events 90% of the time.
---
Because, like most people, I am a casual player who doesn't read release notes and saw something that is not implemented that would make life better. Also, if there's one thing I've learned from this sub it's that just because things are announced doesn't mean it's going to happen.
---
If it didn't break within 20 shots it'd be great :(
---
The problem I have is that people who do put more time in, aren't rewarded. People who can put a small amount of time in daily, have a much easier time than someone who could put in hours on end on the weekend. 
---
They really aught to have out some kind of mechanism in place for people who play 2-3 times a week to catch up by doing similar tasks to those who could get on daily. At the minute the only option they have is to grind xp, which is boring and takes 10 times longer for the same rewards.
---
Same, why would they need to remove them? So much sucks in the world right now, and a lot of us are using games as a big escape. Just let us have this. It's not like we're not still working for it.
---
Yeah that's makes sense
---
Well maybe you should start reading them, or at least doing a cursory search of Reddit. Fucking gamerdads...
---
It does seem quite odd. I can take take down a group of 4 scorched in a few seconds and get well of 400 exp. That wendigo took three of us between 30 to 60 minutes for a little over 500xp.
---
This is outrageous!! I thought they were removed after the event ends.
---
What if OP plays 14 hours per day on the weekends? They'd still have a much harder time getting the rewards than someone who plays 1hr per day.
---
When I was a bit newer to the game I used to do this and had a few people beg me to turn them off so they could get into my vendors. After this I started putting a switch on them so people can turn it on/off themselves.
---
It has an extra effect, and it has a higher base damage than the handmade I believe
---
That's not how this works. At all. Again, too bad, so sad, try again next time.
---
Yeah but i like the small community. The bad start filtered out the toxic people
---
Things like this i just save for playing on a private server with the homies. I dont bother trying this event in public servers.
---
Yes its my favorite weapon and I have over 2000 rounds for it because my friend keeps giving me all his .45 because he doesn't use it lol I love it
---
I got the contemporary camp bundle thinking it came with roof options. sadly it does not. Got sick porches now though so thats neat.
---
you need 9 to put extra claw on mole miner gauntlet
---
Thanks to the new dupe, it is possible to get one for caps. Just check out the market subreddit.
---
Good idea, but sometimes I want to see which players are already there. So the event icon has the highest level and then maybe a tooltip which shows the players at the event?
---
NOT gonna happen. Hate to bring down the mood here but as Beth has shown, any "camp item" plushies (i.e. sheepsquach, Placeable spooky time fuzzy, jumbo sloth) will only come to the game in atomic shop form. They are never going to just give you a way of doing this, unless that way is a junk to Placeable plans machine that you place a junk item into and get a plan for the Placeable form, and even then the machine it's self would be an atomic shop item.
---
There is a guaranteed spawn at the substation next to Appalachian Antiques.
---
Sadly i dont have a good one to use. I even got the starlit sniper skin for it :\_; but damn is it a fun weapon. Thankfully they fixed the annoying animation problems with it in 76.Reloading these rifles in Fallout 4 drives me up a wall and legit keeps me from using it in that game lol.
---
There’s a hot fix happening tomorrow, I’m assuming it’s for the dupe glitch?
---
That must be their only use in the game lol
---
Explains why I never needed them though.
---
step 1: make build team
---
step 2: when event is about to end change over to event team
---
step 3: after event is done change back to build
---
step 4: profit
---
You're point was that OP isn't entitled to rewards others have "worked their ass off for". 
---
My point is that someone playing huge sessions on the weekend might be "working their ass off" more than someone who just does the challenges every day. But the weekend player has a much harder time.
---
"Working your ass off" shouldn't be defined as being able to play daily.
---
If it was the other way around, and you were somehow rewarded more for playing for 5hrs+ per session, all the players that can play 2hrs per day but not on the weekends would be bitching as well. 
---
They've not found a very good balance.
---
There will be a hotfix?
---
For some reason in my servers the open-world terminals are solved, so I suggest the West Tek Rank 1 Terminal in the Protectron room. Two birds 'cause it should be a part of your runs anyway.
---
Why? We all love the free missiles, syringer, mini nukes and 40mm grenades!
---
Bruh, the laser guns come with recoil. I‘d say there are a lot more egregious issues here. And once legendary effects are taken into account, your gun using the wrong caliber is the least of your immersion problems. I‘d like to see a double barreled shotgun that fires 8 times before reloading lol
---
How is it selfish? It takes all of two seconds to flip from events back to building. And if you're at events with the leader then you benefit too, which gives more incentive to actually play as a team in an team instead of team of boats sailing in the night pretending to be a team.
---
That's why i bought another copy on steam for 20$, had to install another game tho. Its more a band aid than a solution, but still helped me to clear some space
---
You're a real ray of sunshine
---
I know - and it's not like we'll have another Christmas, either!
---
Friendly fire in Charisma + Shikebab
---
You can heal the brahmins 
---
Useful for riding shotgun too
---
That is so beautiful. You just gotta love the 76 community. Thanks for sharing!
---
I heard about the survival tent you get with fallout 1st but I thought it was only for the private worlds, but I was at one of my team members ones in a public world. So if you get first, you can sorta have a second camp. Don’t think you can build around it though.
---
Harder, sure. But also not impossible. If he played 12h/day Sat/Sun he'd have to earn 10,000 SCORE from the weekly repeatable to make up what he missed. That works out to needing about 10k exp every 15 minutes. It sounds challenging, but I can easily get 30k or more exp just from events like Line in the Sand or Guided Meditation in less than 15 minutes. He'd have to work efficiently, but he could do it if he wanted.
---
* stealth boost from inherent legendary effect
---
* highest DPS rifle (slightly better than a similarly modded handmade rifle)
---
* low VATS AP cost (much lower than the handmade rifle)
---
are you kidding squirrels are easy to find now that the creature spawns have been fixed (always 2 on the grass by whitesprings bunker near the dead yao guai) . not only that but since they also drop intestines make some mystery meat pies for insane carry weight and END buffs at the same time since all of its other ingredients are non-perishables.
---
If you aren't running a bloodied build then you might like the instigating lever action, double damage, double that if sneaking, then double it again if it's a headshot. With 3 single point rifle damage perk cards and 3 points in the rifle armor pen perk card I can headshot with mine for 1102 damage.   
---
Just a tip for those who may not know, 2 shot weapons only apply 62.5% of your weapon's damage to each shot.
---
Jesus Christ, how many BoS RP groups are there?
---
They should be, but the event script that does this occasionally bugs out.
---
This is a cool example of the current social polarisation in the world:
---
A. the owner of the base looks at the world from his own point of view (as everyone does) and places a shower where (s)he thinks it's most convenient and does not think about other player's (builds).
---
B. the visitor of the base thinks the world should accomodate him/her in the best way possible and gets annoyed when that isn't the case.
---
Have you been to the Mire or the Savage Divide to pick up the distress signal that starts the questline? The quest just don’t show up, you have to be near her to trigger it.
---
Without even adding anything, it would go a long way if they actually fixed the damn thing. As of now, it still doesn't fire right, the endangerol syringe buffs enemies, and the damage syringes are so laughably bad even in the forest that even for a challenge run it's not worth using. I remember somebody tried it and very quickly resorted to just bashing because it did much more damage than the radscorpion venom barrel. At the moment, EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF THE SYRINGER is either broken or pathetically bad
---
This is so wholesome as wholesome can get.Really makes you think about the world we live in.This girl has no idea about duping and cheating and all the ill things plaguing the game.She is a happy little soul exploring an interesting fictional world with the people she loves-her family.
---
And then you look at the real situation.Sweaty fatasses running around with cheats,duping items left and right and ruining the in game economy.Trolls and generally rude players that only want the legendary for themselves,that want to trick you and deceive you just to get an advantage.
---
I really hope the kid enjoys her time and meets only the nice people.If not in the real world,than at least in the game.
---
It's quite difficult to complete if there aren't many other people around, and there aren't rare rewards that make people want to come and complete it basically.
---
It's been picked up more recently with the teams but it was essentially a ghost town a week after Wastelanders release because it's so difficult to do.
---
How about just giving them reasonable inventories? It's kind of stupid that giant tank on water purifier can hold only 5 bottles. I don't want popup every 10 minutes that my resources generators are full.
---
I have to check this immediately. I just found 50+ iron ore sitting in my misc, god knows what else I’ll find there.
---
And then what do players like me get for playing every day AND the weekends? You don't seem to understand how irrelevant to the bottom line you are. You get upset and leave, nobody notices. The focus of the game changes to focus on lazy scrubs like you, the dedicated players leave taking their Fallout 1st and Atom shop money with them, and the game dies. THAT is what you are actually asking for, the death of the game.
---
No idea. I'm primarily a solo player. The groups I dealt with early on either died out or turned out to be an egotistical thirteen year old who had big dreams. lol
---
I was thinking about this the other day, and thought i i scrap a legendary i should have a chance to learn that effect,so i can apply it to a weapon or armor i create
---
In my experience, "no-one wants to do it" only describes the state of affairs before the advent of the Legendary Run. Ever since, this event tends to attract quite a few people who farm the glowing ghouls for XP. So it does get done, but few people bother pausing their XP farm to collect enough ore to increase the reward tiers of the event itself. Which sucks for someone like me who wants the rad barrel for their camp.
---
And yeah, if ever there was an event that justified the addition of an area loot button to the game, this is it.
---
Well, I have noticed like last night there were barely any events (which made game play way too boring) but the couple nights before, it seems the events were popping up back to back. At the same time someone kept laughing nukes for the SBQ fight I kept going to in between the events that kept me busy. I'm a level 361 and I have been to more SBQ fights this past week alone than my entire fallout 76 play time.
---
I know people who have literally exploited spawns that aren't anywhere near as far as this guy. He either needs a new gaming chair, or to share the exploit.
---
I'd in you to the one I'm in but I haven't been cleared to recruit new members yet.
---
Please keep it at 9, it's a huge stress relief. I'm over level 400 and doing the level up daily is translated to: kill 500 super mutants at Westtek. I'm starting to get burned out 😔.
---
My CAMP is pretty large and densely decorated, you can do a lot if you keep watch of what takes significant budget.
---
If they’re your friend give them the plan dude. Don’t prioritise caps
---
That's ridiculously adorable.
---
When I met one of my friend's kids playing on his wife's account, she just asked for Stimpacks and Power Armor lol.
---
So much this.
---
Sounds like a case o them Sabre Tooth Crotch Crickets to me. There's a shampoo now but you still gotta shave the twins
---
i just managed to fix it myself somehow.
---
i deleted the .ini files in MyGames/Fo76 map, restarted the game and fixed my settings ingame, walked to the safe and it all worked somehow.
---
must have been something wrong with the .ini file
---
Put a forceful stock on it, it will make it about 30% more durable.
---
This is indeed a very nice story and you were very kind, but what i really don't get is why some parent should let their childrens play this game instead of more appropriate titles. ESRB rating is not a joke, or just for others... there is so much blood and violence, monsters and aberrations, alchool and drugs, cannibalism, mental illness and what else, and also not all players are kind like you, there are griefers, trolls and so on. This father was near his daughter all the time but, for the love of god, let your children play with something appropriate for their age. Sorry, but i read too many stories with childrens involved while this game should be 17+.
---
I've placed the decon shower in my doorway, too.
---
BUT:   
---
a) It's deactivated and can be conveniently activated with a switch  
---
b) The vendor is outside the house  
---
c) There's a rad barrel in front of the house if you wish to contaminate again :P
---
Thanks, but I'll stay solo for now. Look me up if you need BoS paints, I know all of them.
---
I'm not gonna need one for a while. I'm nowhere near hitting Paladin. Thanks for the offer though.
---
Bed Bugs also bite, making you itch, but they're not an STD, same as Fleas or Mites.
---
It could be bacteria or mold causing it, but that doesn't make it an STD either, fungal toenail infections also aren't STDs.
---
Then, there's the fact you can catch it by yourself, and you can't give yourself something you don't already have.
---
Idiots don't know how to do it, basically. The ghouls spawn individually, and the other spawns are triggered by dumping ore. Cripple the ghouls, collect the ore, and don't dump it until the event is all but over. Spawns happen as the event completes and you can take your time killing them. Simple, but the gamerdads that make up most of Reddit can't even manage to optimise their builds by level 100, so what can you do? 🤷‍♂️
---
it should be a supported, its a very basic QoL feature. tons of people already muling, might as well support it officially and make it more accessible.
---
If you're on xbox, I can do all the ranks including Initiate. I've been playing since the beginning, back when we used to drop Initiate because it was worthless.  ;)
---
I’m certain the writers had the most fun when they were naming diseases.
---
Faster over explosive.  Explosive damage is small and breaks weapons fast.
---
It's easy af if you're not stupid, and I guess the Rad Barrel plans and hazmat suit people will pay 20k for aren't rare. 🙄
---
so what would you want for a medic type perk card?
---
Turn pacifist mode on you mong.
---
Pacifist mode.
---
It’s the same for the food items from Project Paradise, except those aren’t nearly as heavy. I’ve gotten in the happier of dropping what I have into the hopper as soon as o can since I make it a point not to miss that event
---
You shouldn't have to buy another fucking account to mule or pay a subscription either. its a basic feature that should have been in the game on day one.
---
I know it's been an issue for awhile now. Every since the Chinese stealth suit  came out, I have been wearing it. I also carry a full set of Unyielding armor and what I noticed is that I get way more missed shots with vats at 95%. When I switch to my Unyielding armor I have been nearly perfect.
---
He might be using unyielding double-dipping but I guess this is it. Considering my own experience, It's totally possible making 450-500k xp in 4-5 hours (and this is without exotic buffs like bobbleheads/magazines, my average has been ~480k a day for the last 10 days), 3-4 hours if you don't die and switch servers much. If he plays like maybe 2-3h more and with lunchbox buffs, it is doable.
---
Just because I have a memory and speak the truth is no reason to get snippy little fella.
---
How do I do that? I’m Level 144 and I never knew there was a pacifist mode
---
Because the event fails most of the time, so people just don't bother with it.
---
Go in to game settings.
---
Pretty sure it loses to the Handmade on muzzle climb for manual aiming though. It's the only reason I kept handmade except for the fact I've never seen a legendary fixer with my terrible, terrible RNG...
---
They patched that now
---
Damn. I'm on PS4.
---
I really want that Rad Barrel! As a Bloody build it is required to own. Also people are greedy when it comes to rad rumble. No one wants to take turns going for ores. Each players in 1 run can get 40 ores without having to backtrack and wait for respawns, meaning 3 people can do it easily.
---
1 person collects 30-40 ores, they tag out a defender and said defender gets 30-40 ores, then that defender tags out with the last guy to get the rest of the ores, deposit all together, complete it and kill and the enemies that are going to spawn at once. 
---
It's so easy but people are selfish, greedy, and stupid.
---
What do you want your camp to have?Do you want to sit on a deposit?Or maybe have a lot of water to purify?Or both?Or just build space?
---
I have my camp at a lead deposit in the southern part of the savage divide by the southern fissure site.There is an acid deposit right below the lead deposit,you can even get both if you place the camp just right.But what I love the most about the location is the stone arch and vantage point that I can build around.
---
This is the most adorable thing i have ever read on this app.
---
It's ward. His bloodlust does not allow him to wait for you to activate his daily. He needs to see death - immediately!
---
I'm joking, I think the Ally: Kill quest comes from the settler wanderer. She has several versions of her quest - a retrieve weapon case, a rescue civilian, and a kill quest.
---
We not, BUT we are dealing with stash problems RIGHT NOW at this moment, so i decided to help myself for 20$. And its nice to have steam achievements to . Im not saying that you should buy it, but its a love/hate relationship with this game, you know
---
Not the truth it's a opinion but ok
---
I dream of a day where builds other than bloodied come up.
---
Ive reached a point where I dont think people will ever stop asking for more even if they live in castles, thisll never be the game for it, itll never be like the excessive mod camps from Fo4. The servers and game engine simply cant handle it, if you want that theres games that are better for it.
---
You need to level up a bit. Even if you server hop so no higher level has been there Freddie Lang is always some form of glowing one and will murder you at that level unless by dumb luck the mole miners kill her, which is unlikely if they are also low level.
---
It's not easy if you're solo is the point. There's ways to cheese it which can be time consuming and a lot of people don't know about them, but other than that most people would think you need three people there to complete the event the way it was meant to be completed - one guarding each side of the compound, and then one or more collecting ore.
---
Those plans aren't as big as an incentive to do events as stuff like The Fixer plans at Encryptid or the Prime Receiver plans at Scorched Earth.
---
Their camp, their rules. 
---
You don't have to spend your caps there. Just spend your caps at camps that don't force you to go through a shower.
---
Commando you need +25% firerate and +15% reload speed.
---
Rifleman you need +33% Vats chance and either +1 Perception/Agility.
---
That's what I believe the ideal way to have the weapons are. You can either have Junkies or Bloody for either, Furious is a 3rd best if you land your shots.
---
Don’t know why you’re getting downvoted because it’s a real shitty mechanic/cash grab, but yes. Those of us that don’t have countless hours every week to play both game modes are SOL. 
---
Though, even if I didn’t have a job and a kids, I still hate NW. Battle Royals games in general are lacking in play time unless you hide as long as possible and to me that’s annoying and boring AF
---
Pretty sure there already are a few, and there's a mutation as well.  
---
No enemy in the game warrants the need for a medic tbh
---
Gave me a pretty good trip down memory lane when I first got to play the Sharpshooter perk in Killing Floor 2. The headshots are Chef's Kiss.
---
Some asshole is chopping onions at my desk at 0500...
---
/wholesome AF, I guess the AF takes away from that.
---
I'm trying to think of other builds but I could only of 3 viable one's, Junkies, Medics and berserker if your brave i guess.
---
Yeaa.... im not crying, youre crying!
---
There is a map showing all resource deposits if that is your priority. You will have to google it.
---
Other things to look out for are enemy spawns. If your base is too close to an enemy spawn area, you will have to build alot of turrets which will eat up budget. There are some locations that rarely get attacked. If this is your priority, then what you can do is find a location you like and place your camp there. Do not go overboard building stuff initially. Instead, build something simple and temporary and see how often you get attacked at that location. If you find the attack frequency acceptable, then you can build a permanent settlement.
---
The third thing is the free fast travel. You get to travel for free to your camp. Some people choose to build their camp in the center of the map since that will make it more cost efficient to travel to different locations for dailies.
---
I solo it all the time. The only difficult part is getting enough ore. Any player that isn't a total scrub already has the Fixer and Prime plans. Sounds like you should still be sticking to events in the Forest, tbqh.
---
I have to disagree. I paid for the game, therefore I shouldn’t have to use micro transactions to enjoy it to the fullest. If it was free to play, then yeah. But the $60 I paid for the disc was me “supporting the game.”
---
Bows mainly are used (in my personal experience) when you don't want to waste bullets for you main weapons and don't want to bother using a melee/unarmed weapon. I use it when I'm in The Forrest, Ash Heap, or Toxic Valley since enemies are low level enough to take out easily.
---
I tend to use X-01 because of rad resistance and if lets say im in whitespring, the glowing ones do rad damage so rad resistance is quite important and i dont really see a difference between t51 and X-01 except rad resist but ultracite i think might be a tiny bit better or worse, cant remember but good mods are a pain to get and strangler is basically ultracite with better rad resist, its to you but i do have a fairly modded X-01 therefore it is my go to but its what suits you.
---
What are you, the fun police? Let people be happy. She's supervised and safe, leave it be. You have no right to judge somebody else for their parenting. Don't like kids playing the game? Don't let your kid play the game.
---
That's true. When it comes to muzzle climb, the Handmade is better.
---
On the forum they've mentioned a hotfix to log what is happening with challenges auto completing. Not sure what else it's for.
---
whenever i stumble across such a camp, i simply just ignore the vendor and steal what i can (water, collectron etc) and go on. these guys don't deserve any bloodied caps.
---
Get an xbox.. never have these issues
---
😉
---
Forgot to mention that the mission waypoint is at the PA station saying "Build excavator Power Armour Left and Right Arms". Only scrapping option is available.
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
Now you're just talking crazy. I state something that is either  true or false and you're answer is that it's my opinion? That doesn't even work. Either Bethesda games are full of fetch quests or they're not. It is not a matter of opinion. 
---
Now that you've shown you don't even have a basic understanding of how words work I'm not going to waste anymore time debating the amount of fetch quests in Bethesda games with you. 
---
Good day.
---
Whereas the person who plays 1hr per day just has to take some photos, or kill a couple of legendaries, or build a few things.
---
I just don't understand why they are trying so hard to get people to log on daily.
---
+15% reload, couldn't you just put the quick magazine so your vats cost less and you reload is just as quick? making that effect mid tier on rifles in my opinion.
---
easy mode is &lt;20% hp?
---
Totally agree. Even though I use just one "set", it it really annoying when I switch over to the Stealth Suit for a while and then have to re-equip the whole set piece by piece. I always forget the underarmor :-/
---
It wont be for the fast travel or no damage glitch im sure.
---
My main weapons are a .50 hunting rifle and a non legendary Fixer. I’ve actually noticed my accuracy decrease for seemingly no reason. I’ll have to try my bow out though. Even with 95% in VATS, it misses more often than not unless you and the target are stationary
---
Any time I come across a camp with the shower at the door, if I can't jump over to get inside to see what they are selling,, then I just don't bother. It's just they lose out on a potential customer. I mean they placed it there for a reason. For me if I were do put up the shower at my door, my vending machine would be on the outside because I don't  hate, all caps are welcome.
---
Also if you’re in a public server someone may have killed the target
---
Waiting for fucking 8 seconds before gotdam game starts to fucking finally refill ap with endurance , agility maxxed and max running perks and ap full gear. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH YOUR SHITTY SERVERS !!!!!!!!!!!!! FIX THIS CRAP AND GIVE US SOME GODDAMN DOABLE OBJECTIVES INSTEAD OF THESE FUCKING ASS RAPING CHORES THAT ARE JUST DANGLING UNOBTAINABLE CARROTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
why should we have to waste time just to go shopping at your camp? every shop is trying to please the customer as far as possible.
---
Because that would let people ignore the "endgame"-level requirements of flux and ultracite.
---
Ultracite ammo craft for a lot more than regular ammo, so I don't see why you would use the ArmCo or the Ammo Converter to get them. At most, use them to get 556 and trade the 556 for ultracite ammo.
---
It says 14.7., sorry my bad...
---
Oh ok thanks i never noticed.why wouldn't the include the mechanic on all events it really doesn't make sense
---
Great write up.   
---
Something i noticed in my own gameplay that you might have wrong however regarding Lunchboxes.
---
I also had the idea to use one lunch box, wait 50-ish minutes to use another to reset the timer and prolong the overall time with an XP buff; However, what i noticed was that after doing that the buff DID say 1hr 50%xp, but after 10 minutes (the remaining time on the original 25% buff) was up, the buff went back down to 25%xp with 40 minutes remaining suggesting that each tier of that buff does keep it's own timer?
---
I've not had the lunchboxes to test this again but i'm all but certain this is what i observed the couple of times that i tried it myself.
---
&gt; Bonus. Public Groups The 2 choices I see are events and a huge 100% exp at completion or building with up to a 4 INT 8% for everything. My suggestion run build team and switch to event at the last third of an event.

Unless you're team is actually playing alongside with you, this screws over your team mates that just want to building XP boost.
---
Don't expect people to hang around in your team long to max your bonuses if you keep doing that for each event.
---
I don't understand why the water wheel isn't a skin for the windmill. Like the PA skin that adds the horns, they could've added / changed the windmill's geometry. It already turned and made power. I don't know enough about coding, but I would think changing how it looks on the outside wouldn't change how it functions? Then there's no chance of it breaking.
---
I reckon a filter/legend would be incredibly useful.
---
Faster reload 100% you don't use vats with heavy guns
---
not much :D just ragdolling around until respawn ;)
---
I had a mini heartattack thank you
---
About $19.99
---
Except that when you have lots of people all opening lunch boxes together you can easily go over the 100% XP bonus... at which point your bonus is now 0% - not 100%.        
---
     
---
Congrats. You all just wasted your lunch boxes.       
---
Will this bug be fixed before double XP weekend?
---
takes too long to spam
---
Yes. No other build has all the synergy with perks and mutations Bloodied does and Unyielding armor raises all your stats. It's the lolnoskillz build.
---
Bruh it’s just a game calm down, bethesda is just letting the dupe ride out because before the dupe was public single individuals making thousands of dollars behind closed doors. Multiply that by 100-1000 people (worldwide) and you have a profit margin potentially far higher than bethesda even makes from all their fallout 1st monthly payments. we don’t even have 5 star legendary weapons yet. The moment we have 5 star shit it’s gonna make everything duped or not look like trash either way so idk why you take it as such a personal attack to you. the only thing that really happened is they’ve taken the REAL CASH VALUE out of in game weapons simply because they’re now obtainable. If you gave that type of real value to a IN GAME WEAPON/OUTFIT your just simply addicted to this game and you should take a break, it’s not real life these just things happen.
---
Ahh yea then scrip it
---
This ^^
---
Then you can't apply perforating mag that ignores I believe 10% armor stacked with tank killer would be 46% which is almost half. Which is a lot of damage against bosses.
---
Thats halfassed lazy bullshit on the devs part !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So now we gotta keep up with the reset or were fucked during their shitty grinding fuckfest ???!!!!!!  They need to get their heads out of their ass fix this broken ass game before moving to new content and NEW PROBLEMS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
So I guess fr and rw are the 2 best 3rd perk for heavies?
---
god mode
---
Might be a silly question but do you have a frame to craft the armor?
---
ideed. fast, powerful, light. beautiful tool.
---
If you have fallout 1st, you can just go to private server, drop what ever it is you want to transfer and use your other charactor to pick up without worring about other players finding your stuff before you can get to it. If you don't have fallout 1st then you gonna have to find a suitcase or something that has unlimited space to drop your stuff into and then take the risk knowing that someone may come across your stuff and run off with it.
---
Rw isn't that great either. Once you mod the gun it still weights a ton. You are best off using bear arms. Fr is the only really good one imo. I guess 250drwr is alright as well. But fr is the only one that makes much of a difference to me haha
---
Wouldn't that be painful for the deathclaw? Their cells were formed due to radiation mutation or would you think that the hard scale skin forms a exoskeleton type like barrier? 
---
I would also think Ghouls who radiate with radiation would also find decontamination showers to be extremely painful unless they had already lost feelings in their nervous system
---
And this is why I'm not a commando lol, totally forgot about the armor penetration from the magazines. didn't realise it was almost 50% armor penetration tho that's pretty nutty.
---
Many of the NW dailies were completable in less than five minutes, so while I too would xprefer for that challenge not to appear again, it definitely wasn't too difficult to complete. Especially when factoring in that the bugged limited time NW challenges counted towards this weekly, so if you didn't unlock the christmas stuff you could have comlleted it in about 251 NW XP.
---
Faster fire rate is good
---
THIS HAS PUT ME IN THE FOULEST FUCKING MOOD !!!!!!   FIX THIS FUCKING PIECE OF FUCKING GARBAGE  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LAZY MOTHERFUCKERS !!!!!!!!!!!!
---
You can build them at any power station. It's the power armor registration that needs to be completed in the instance.
---
If you were able to construct them before, you should have the plans learned. Are you placing a power armor chassis down when you try to craft?
---
Yo
---
Mine does not have a switch, i have every plan that is camp related, my shops are outside but beyond that your build is your problem, not mine :/
---
Oof
---
Then don't shop there lol
---
You could probably get there by playing every spare minute you have and min maxing xp gain.
---
Very likely this person used some exploits to get there. Not full on like the people that got to Rank 100 when it was impossible to do so. 
---
However, if you do the math, it's a crap ton of XP this person has gained. Like in the ballpark of 5-7 million XP in just around, what, 2 weeks ish?
---
Isn’t that about what they cost after you buy atoms idk haven’t got one in a while
---
I'm currently playing 3-4hrs a day myself, have been for about 4 months and was for around 1yr after launch. 
---
I don't think people who can't get on every day because of real life could be considered "lazy scrubs" for it.
---
In a system with a catch up mechanism you would get exactly the same reward as someone who could put exactly the same amount of time (total) into it so how would that be changing the focus of the game?
---
All I'm trying to say is that you can be dedicated to a game, and "work your ass off", without having to play every day. 
---
P.S. no one is suggesting anything is taken away from people who do play daily. Are you this annoyed about the fact the dailies can be done in less than an hour each day? What reward do we get now for playing longer than an hour a day? It would be the same in a system with a catch up mechanism, it's just that daily play wouldn't be as required.
---
If you don’t have a rifleman build, you’ll probably want an automatic rifle, like a handmade. I would actually recommend trying to find a two shot. Other than that, definitely go for fire rate.
---
I carry 5 of them as they break so quickly.  
---
Wish they had a ghillie skin for them
---
Don't do the objective? O\_o why this?
---
Shame that random people opening theirs will also cause your stacks to bug.
---
That's just not true. Every post with math about the issue didn't factor in the repeatable XP challenge, which you need to trigger quite a lot to level up, and only factored in the amount of points one could unlock the first day. We've since had days with more challenges, and double XP and Score are coming up. And you can be 100% sure that the community challenge will involve SCORE as well.
---
I didn't realise getting hit twice and then dying is considered easy lmao.
---
I run bloodied and I approve this message. :D
---
It definitely is a pretty tame building spot now. I have only had 1 scorchbeast and 2 mole rats in the last 2 months. All the videos I watched to master the build site described multiple scorchbeast spawns mid build. The spawn frequency is so low that when I did eventually get attacked, Beckett forgot how to  handle the pressure. The dude was useless.
---
I do enough for the Adventure mode challenges only and I'm in my early 30's and I've been playing every day.
---
You compare that to the average player, you're actually doing quite well for yourself.
---
FUCKING LET THE HACKERS AND CHEATS HAVE THE GOODS!!!!!   I"M  NOT BUYING GOTDAMN FUCKING ATOMS FOR THIS FAILED ASS CONTENT THAT DIDN"T SELL WORTH SHIT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Is this your first online game? The vast majority do this in one form or another. If you're not giving players a reason to log in everyday you're probably going to start losing them to other more interesting games. Offering daily challenges or login bonuses are a way to incentivize players to keep coming back. It's a way to reward them and give them a goal. The more "sinister" side is that you're also a lot more likely to continue to put more money into a game you've already purchased if you find yourself playing it everyday vs only a few hours over the weekend.
---
To be honest I'll save them as levelling fairly decent at lv 40 right now only just gone 2 weeks in and nearly caught the green ship up so I think I'm cruising through nice and easy. To be honest I dont want to be done too early as it feels nice playing the game at my own leisure rather than getting burned out with exp farming for something I'll get eventually
---
That's the best spot in the game in my opinion.
---
The entire point of the pass is to get players to login every day to pad the numbers out for the board. Why is that so hard for people to understand? There is already a catch-up mechanism, it's called paying Atoms to skip levels.
---
Yes, they should increase it. In the mean time maybe you have some heavy budget item you can get rid of: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eo80ev/so\_we\_found\_out\_the\_exact\_cost\_of\_every\_camp\_item/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eo80ev/so_we_found_out_the_exact_cost_of_every_camp_item/)
---
Id rather send the Fully Integrated Security Technotronic Officer
---
Sure but this is Bethesda. Why would you expect anything less from them.
---
AAA says nothing about the quality of a game or dev, just the scale of the production.
---
What's the point of having a lot of damage if it gets negated by the armor of the enemy? I'm a Rifleman and I dome enemies. Commando is for run and gun people. Both have qualities. Rifles is just better on ammo consumption and high single shot dmaage, meanwhile Commando is great for DPS but you burn bullets fast. Pick your poison or just have fun and roleplay.
---
Insult bot, the second biggest troll next to ward
---
I wish I could upvote this thread again! After posting in here and nearly considering changing my entire build to go bloody to use my BE Lever Action, I decided to go vendor hopping and I just so happened to find a JE Lever action at a player vendor, as soon as I saw it my jaw dropped and I paid the 13k then and there, so happy. I have been after one of these for months, since I rolled my (now main) and I couldn't be happier. Thats one more weapon off the list (until I can upgrade it to a 3\* JE). Now for a JE fixer and JE handmade :D
---
Sounds like a git gud problem. You act like us veteran players have never used a Bloodied build lmao
---
I’ve found that l (I’m assuming to enhance realism)  the 95% only applies when you and the target are stationary. You also have a better chance matching their movement speed and direction, but good luck with that. 
---
I love the compound bow with the plasma mod, but I have my bow in storage until that changes. Rifles are just unfortunately better and you can put suppressors on them
---
honestly what my preference would be scenic or interesting features
---
I really need ballistic fiber. How do I get it from there?
---
What level are you? Once you get up above 100 then you rarely spend caps except for fast travel, so bouncing off max is normal, lower levels you tend to spend/need more.
---
Just loot every enemy you kill and sell their weapons to vendors and all the junk and aid you dont need at the same time
---
Hopewell Cave
---
Make a ton of the purified water stations and lock them, get your charisma Hard Bargin perk to rank 3, and sell the waters to vendors. The worst way for caps to do that, and max out and save up caps to buy a serum recipe. Then craft serums and sell those.
---
Another thing people do is they grab every gun from the Uranium Fever event, then waddle down to the Whitesprings Station and sell them all to the train vendor guy. I usually get rich from just selling aid back to, I always get way to much radaway and and stims and I sell them back.
---
It really should be able to use the same skins, since it already uses the same mods...
---
This. You need to put a power armor frame into the PA station to be able to craft the armor pieces.
---
Thanks man that's helpful.
---
Can I also ask if you know what the best 3rd perks are for tesla, cryo and laser rifles?
---
A ripper or chainsaw would be the same effect ye?
---
You need to start that one manually. Just go to Big bend Tunnel East and up on the platform to the right (above the power armor frames) is a mobster looking dude called Vinny. talk to him and hell have an option to start the event if they are ready to go. Theres a cooldown period so if the option isnt there try later. It just means it may have been run recently already
---
I have 10 industrial water purifiers that makes up the bulk of my income.
---
5x waters per purifier, times 10 - that's 50x waters, each one brings 5 caps each - that's 250 caps every 10-15 minutes.
---
Once I hit vendor limit I start buying scrap or plans, then sell more waters to make back a chunk of what I just spent.
---
Also selling all ammos for 1 cap each, magazines and bobbleheads for 100 each, plans for 20 caps flat rate... you soon get a reputation. 😁
---
You can start it at Big Bend Tunnel east entrance. Spawns 1 guaranteed legendary and gives a pep roll and trasury notes among rewards.   
---
Since they buffed carnivore I'm addicted to pep rolls :D
---
There are some items that have balistic fiber. I think I remember 3. One is behind the counter on the metal shelf, another one near the locker room and a third on in the back of one of the armored vehicles. Military outposts like all the brotherhood ones in the cranberry bog usually also have one or two items that contain balistic fiber.
---
You can also buy it in bulk from NPC vendors.
---
For the tesla and cryo I'd also say fr. They are not vats guns so fr is best. The laser rifle is a bit tougher, but 25lvc, fr, and perhaps 15vcf
---
You have to trigger it at I believe it’s called big bend East. Find a guy named vinny and he’ll get it going. It’s a good event with a guaranteed legendary half way through. You can trigger it again once per hour one the same server.  So if you find him and it won’t start, someone already ran it. You can server hop or just wait.
---
 I'm 117 I rarely pick up weapons since my carry weight is low as hell. I've taken up trading and buying things from white spring,both of which get very expensive very fast.
---
Hopefully one day we’ll be able to craft the different varieties like you can with NukaWorld in FO4
---
Ah, the angry customer "I'm never shopping here again" line.
---
Yo Nathan, I see you on new alot 
---
Now I see you're a bigger lore junkie than me, you're my new hero
---
Yeah I can see that. Weight is the reason I went for the Grocers backpack mod. 90% reduction on food and drink weight added up to way more than I expected.
---
freddies runs are decent on hunting
---
If it's too hard then don't play a glass cannon build?
---
Lmao only happens when the game decides to fuck me over m8
---
On the flip side, making it so that the people who can only play on the weekends (and I'm not talking about just for an hour or two) have a much harder time with a boring xp grind as the only way to progress, will just push them into something more interesting. 
---
There's a better way to balance it, to keep daily players and people who play longer sessions every few days interested at the same time. Win-win surely.
---
I don't play other online games religiously. I played Destiny and ESO for a while but lost interest. I asked on here a while ago and many people said that other online games with seasons had some kind of catch up mechanism.
---
From wiki: *"The Fixer is a customized combat rifle. It also possesses a unique bonus to stealth and movement speed while sneaking, even on a non-legendary version.*
---
*The Fixer provides a stealth bonus equal to three pieces of shadowed leather armor and increases movement speed by 20% while sneaking. Additionally, The Fixer has higher base damage than a normal combat rifle (+/- 20% depending on the equipped receiver)."*
---
The Fixer is the highest dps (automatic) rifle in the game atm. And in addition to that, as a combat rifle it is cheaper to use in vats than handmade (2nd best).
---
Yeah, I went all the way into the bunker with no signal.
---
Damn. That water purification one is hard since vendors only get their caps from you specifically. Selling ammo is a tad hard for me since I use everything other than fusion cells and .38 which I recently turned into ammopoints in mass. I'll give serums a go once I can afford a blueprint or two and uranium fever is also a pain for me since I only get to kill about 5 enemies since the events always swarmed with people one shotting enemies.
---
I am playing on my private server so no one did it before, he is saying slow your horses
---
sell stimpacks, radaeay and radx, every time you turn around there's another 50 of each taking up valuable space.
---
There's a ghost?
---
Where did I imply it's hard? It's more risk, not hard. All I said was you're at higher risk of being two-tapped.
---
You wouldn't happen to have a link to that post? I've been searching the forum but I can't seem to find it :)
---
You could just drop your junk in your stash and hang around other players. Someone will take you out
---
Bolton Green table settings is another that isnt always cleared too. They weigh 1 lb/kg each.
---
Why does everyone say farming Brain Bombs is hard? If you use Mappalachia for the ingredients, it's super easy. I can get up to 50 Brain Bombs crafted after less than 2 hours of farming a few servers. The bonus lasts 90 MINUTES as opposed to 30 minutes with the Broiled Scorchbeast Brains.
---
If you're using Good With Salt 3, then keep maybe 7 BB's on you and store the excess on an Alt to keep them from losing condition. One 2-hour run can keep you going for a month... Unless there's a DXP weekend, then you'll probably use them all in one weekend if you're going full-force.
---
Unrelated to what I was just saying:  The bonus you get from INT starts shrinking dramatically after your INT gets past 25. It's not a set 2%. FYI.
---
When you craft it, do the pieces get legendary effects?
---
It's actually one of most fun events in the game.
---
I personally don't go for ores most of the time because
---
1. it is really annoying switching to stealth suit and then having to re-equip my armor piece by piece while being attacked
---
2. if there are low levels and I go for ore, a scavenger regularly dies in the meantime. If I can defend them even against deathclaws while others cannot, why should I stop defending?
---
If the event is full of high levels, I may go for ores, if i'm in a good mood and don't mind swapping out the stupid armor. 
---
So you should add "lazy, annoyed" to your list.
---
Me too i have like 120 full ones.
---
"A bad craftsman will blame the tools"
---
the thunder mountain sub station in the bog usually has a ants and Kevduits theory is that deathclaws and ants are mortal enemies so if theres ants theres a deathclaw not far, i also found 3 near a red rocket in the mire but i dont know if it was a random encounter or a guaranteed spawn
---
Hmm that’s weird. Is she in the bunker? And are you above lvl 20?
---
Lmao
---
You can use the public teams in-game to find people in your current session, or create one yourself. Don't worry about having a lower level - people are generally quite respectful and the worst that'll happen is you get kicked out of the team and have to find a new one.
---
When I'm in a team with a low-level I try and help out with some spare junk or aid when I can and I'm sure others are similar, plus you'll be able to fast travel to team mates and their CAMPs to use things that you don't have access to on your own yet.
---
Had it happen twice now, so I stopped using them.
---
Would have stopped playing long ago without that mod.
---
You have to have a power armor chassis to build at the station.
---
That’s why I put a switch on mine and put it up against a wall
---
I am playing on my pvt server when i do my daily quests and hang around solo, and this Vinny Vedecci guy keeps telling me slow your horses
---
I think you're overthinkin it bud
---
While big numbers is fun, I dont see the benefit of using lunchboxes this weekend. As far as I can tell its a flat % to xp, as is the weekend buff, which means the lunchbox does not give you any more benefit than any other day of the week. On the other hand, most good xp farming spots will probably be crammed this weekend, meaning you’re running the risk of wasting time on your buffs relogging over and over. I see everyone is really hyped for the weekend, which is good, but if I dont see any benefit of saving all lunchboxes for this perticular weekend.
---
Sneakspeed is irrelevant if using speed demon though
---
And if using Unyielding armor with over 30 agi the stealth is no bonus either
---
Considering there’s no way to draw aggro and that damage resist has decreasing usefulness... Tanks aren’t really there in the normal sense of the term. 
---
Coming from a high health/vanguard melee.
---
It's bugged on 1st private servers, try it in public.
---
&gt;The entire point of the pass is to get players to login every day to pad the numbers out for the board
---
That's my point. Why? Why fudge the numbers and make it look like daily play is the be all and end all? What about total time logged in? Is it really more profitable to have people logging in for 1hr per day, than having people log in for 10hrs at a time? 
---
It may well be more profitable, and it may be the best way to get more people paying for atoms. I just feel like it could balanced better, and still be just as profitable.
---
Well it depends on your level. When I first started, I picked up everything. Now as far as weapons, if I have multiple of the same weapon ( I scrap some and sell some). I'm a level 361 and even now everytime I visit Whitespribgs golf club and if there clothing around, I pick those up everytime and sell ( with my Unyielding armor, grape metals, and the hard bargain perk card maxed out) I get up to 29 caps per golf outfit. My vending machine I sell 99% legendary items but my best sellers are the .45 and 5.56 ammo (I tend to put up atleast 1,000 of each for sale a 1 cap each). As a matter of fact all the ammo I put up for sale is at 1 cap each. 
---
Unless the person visiting our camp to possibly buy something are low level players, everyone else are looking for legendary items even if they are buying just to scrip them in which many of cases I have done because im at or close to being a max caps.
---
Yes!     I even named my fav the Lincoln Repeater. My rifleman build keeps 3 on him at all times, with another 10 or so in stash.
---
This right here. People act like you level up in a vacuum. Unless you're getting all your exp from NW (which I doubt any significant number of players do) you're constantly getting extra SCORE from the weekly repeatable. As a level 400+ I earn more SCORE from the weekly repeatable when I grind for the level up daily than from the daily itself. Then you've got the extra SCORE events that you mentioned.
---
Its really amazing how many people completely miss these facts and instead have a knee jerk reaction to some bad math. Anyone who realized the previously mentioned facts should have also been able to figure out why those calculations were conservative estimations at best.
---
Probably. I never bought any atoms
---
Ballz Bethesda, the reason i am paying for 1sr is grinding and especially to have a peace and quiet hour in events, bullshit, hope they will fix it, especially adrenaline because it made me underpowered a lot, I am bloodied commando build with be handmade and ffr fixer
---
The Enclave's mortal enemy is China.
---
It’s literally in the name of the gun. It’s a handmade. It’s missing a dust cover ffs
---
There's a max cap limit? Most I've ever had has been like 4kish and I'm lvl 117
---
Yes, it is more profitable. Daily player numbers are the only metric that matters. You can feel how you like, doesn't change the facts.
---
Yeah, would like ghillie skin for railway rifle, shhh im sniping
---
There's no 200 year war between the Enclave and the BoS, there's a 40 year one started by a yokel descended from a yokel from a vault in California.
---
You're saying your build makes it much easier for you to suddenly be killed?
---
I don't know if this is true, but people say that private servers are just empty basic servers, which means that some one could have done that event earlier in that world. The server just became empty and you inherited that world as your private server.
---
But this is just speculating and I don't even know if this is really how private servers work.
---
Why are you replying twice? I read the forums closely. And I don’t see those kinds of posts. A search can’t up with one 25 days ago, then two months. 
---
Anyway your cheating post was removed. So go pedal your cheating elsewhere
---
I just clicked on Valseek's profile and it's their most recent comment.
---
Its 7 weeks, so no, it bang on. I rounded up.
---
&gt; I try to keep around 100 each cuz they weigh nothing
---
Your "nothing" adds up to 500 Ponds for non-f1ster, because a single flux weights in at 1 Pound.
---
save your perk pack gum, it counts
---
They weren't Enclave scientists, there is absolutely no lore to even allow room for this speculation.
---
"Yeah no worries about doing the same thing I do every other day Rocksy and thanks for the 5 missiles and a mini nuke I'm gona have to drop" 
---
🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Thanks, I'll check it out :)
---
Do have any source for that or should I just take your word for it?
---
Bethesda has actually used a similar mechanic before in Elder Scrolls: Oblivion (Shivering Isles). [Something like this would work.](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Dawnfang/Duskfang)
---
Can anyone explain how percentage bonus works. Does it apply to basic XP? Or does it apply after XP calculated with INT multiplier?
---
I think the deathclaw would be happy in the long run, living in a nice and clean enviornment!
---
That's still basically the same problem as doing it manually though. I shouldn't have to keep altering my data folder every time I want to enter the mode, especially when it's harmless mods that offer 0 advantage in pvp. Having to launch a 3rd party program first, or opening my folder to delete something are a tedious waste of time when I just wanna play a game. 
---
Also Bethesda owns ESO too and it allows 30thousand mods in PvP so idk what the deal is with 76.
---
The only advantage carni has that I'm aware of is eating scorchbeasts for agi and end buffs and the int buff takes less mat farming. I'm finding that sweetwater buff is a godsend for some of my blind range builds.
---
Until they fix the VATS issue, no.
---
This will be my last "help" post I post. Every time I post anything helpful, I get down voted.
---
yes! Its my back-up/longer range weapon  and it was my favourite to use in NV - I used a TS one (only the 1*) until Mumbles blessed me at the weekend with an executioner's/explosive. It feels so satisfying to use.
---
They weren't Enclave scientists.
---
It's definitely inventory related, I have to offload all unused notes, outfits...basically have nothing other than what I'm using and only then do I get a smooth transition between weapons when using the wheel.  It's appalling frankly how this game works sometimes.  I'm on One s.
---
I hope you are wrong, because no matter how cool.of a person you are, you will end up in my enemies list, like Sheldon Cooper's.
---
Mothmaaaan take you Emil
---
The Brotherhood is absolutely not aware of the Enclave's existance at this point in the timeline.
---
I happened to find on this morning right inside the door at Mama Dolce’s
---
Bango
---
Faster reload, reduced weight and 250 drwr are the good 3rd perks for heavy weapons.
---
I like Rw cause i usually carry a queen killer weapon and a one shot gat gun for ammo efficiency
---
thank you!
---
Because me must do nothing except worry about garbage battle pass with lame cosmetics and only work on building my beautiful camp. (Mindset of most remaining players in this game)
---
"It just works."
---
Look for military ammo bags. :) One military ammo bag is I think 2 fiber.
---
I've always wished I could favorite entire armor/equipment sets, but that wish was mainly so I couldn't drop/sell them, as well as from being stripped naked by Hazmat suit.
---
I tried my hardest not to go Bloodied build by endgame but now I'm rocking 19% HP all times. It's just too strong compared to other builds and it's not really high risk at all.
---
There is no Enclave in DC for the next century beyond a ZAX supercomputer slowly going insane and Control Station ENCLAVE is still isolated from the rest of the wider United States by the time of Fallout 2.
---
Oh I always pick them up but didn’t really know what they were for. Cheers!
---
I use the endangerol syringer on my support bow (suppressor) character with vanguard armour....problem is things die so quick anyway it barely seems needed.
---
Some of the best skins in the game, too. The wooden inlay one is especially *classy*.
---
Could put a purpose to the Presidential room. BoS has you investigate it. MODUS temps you to betray the Brotherhood.
---
No I said it's riskier, slightly harder but that's to be expected, is it not? I'm not saying I'm not incapable of taking risks lmao
---
But you will never catch me:
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Z%C3%A1topek
---
Nope, the double XP events will come soon. It should be easy to get more tiers then.
---
The mistake here is implying I'm a bad craftsman, which is wrong. 😏
---
Totally possible without exploits. A streamer I follow is already hovering around Rank 90 just through min maxing.
---
Sure, Jan.
---
MODUS' Enclave is not the Enclave seen in the other games, the Enclave that had nearly two full centuries to develop their personal vision of what the Wasteland is and how it should be. The two share a name and their origin but are separated by about as much time as we do from the Industrial Revolution.
---
Depends on the build. I have a heavy vats bloodied unyielding build with a b3325 lmg, its working great.
---
It's not a bug. Go somewhere else and loot a bunch of stuff, it's based on how much you have picked up, not how long since you were there last.
---
I don't owe you any proof. 😃
---
VTU, middle building. When you enter the atrium, turn left, pick the locked door then jump down to the lower level. There’s a level 0 terminal there (the one used for Heart of the Enemy).
---
Got a three star Nocturnal lever action a while ago, it's been fun going through 1,700 rounds or so. I just need some mods, specifically a suppressor.
---
I don't owe you any belief in your words.
---
I will try that thanks for the quick response!
---
She does, she has way lower HP when you solo it but once at least 1 other person joins in it's scaled for a group.
---
Meanwhile pistols and explosive are like just there like.
---
Bethesda: “Cmon time for another nerf”
---
Pistol and explosive: “Yes honey”
---
Wait, what's a good way of putting a tamed creature inside your house or an interior of sorts? I once placed a fence around my megasloth and it sorta just teleported out. Any suggestions?
---
The Lost Hills Brotherhood has no idea the Enclave exists and won't learn of them for the next century and a half. There is no 200 year war, there's a 40 year one from Fallout 2 to Fallout 3 and that's about it.
---
Whatever that means
---
If you do enough damage to loot you *aren't* leaching, bugger them. Keep doing what you're doing.
---
Oh, so you can't read OR play your chosen build properly. Interesting.

Angry turtles very good explaining Video about enemy and item (Re) spawns
---
Sometimes if I close my eyes I can pretend it's the Varmint Rifle from New Vegas.
---
Sadly they move too fast. It would crash the server.
---
We know exactly when their disdain for each other first began: 2241.
---
I have one of each, explosive has area effect damage, but can kill you if using it too close.  Things die so easily in this game it's hard to tell what is better without calculating stuff.
---
Possibly lol. I personally consider it as critical thinking as I love the small details and depth when it comes to subjects like this.
---
It happens when I have a lot of junk or weapon pickups on me...
---
The bonus from INT decreases after your INT hits 25. It's not a set 2%, FYI.
---
I experienced a bug with Ward (shocking, I know) where I tried to start his daily quest, but his initial dialogue sounded like I already had the quest, but then it gave me the standard dialogue options where I can ask about him and Foundation. I manually aborted the quest and hopefully it fixes itself tomorrow
---
Only half the time. The other half is wasting the time of non-bloodied builds.
---
Before clicking on Private World you can press R to toggle between allowing only team members or all friends to join. The text that is displayed is the currently selected setting.
---
Thanks for catching us up to speed! Really appreciate the openness to communicate the behind the scenes.  
---
So far my main concern with the NW challenges are the increase in requirements (6 Stimpacks used up from 3) and the ones that require playing with other people you know or willing to waste time (revive another player). I really like the NW challenge today of just setting up a CAMP or the last 30 minute ones (maybe reduce this to 10-15 mins though as one match lasts around that time on average). 
---
Other than that, hoepfully the 9 dailies stay! It helps a lot those who don't do NW challenges and gives more incentive for those who do!
---
Do you know if the line in the sand glitch can be manually ttiggered, or if it's random?
---
One at Tygart Water Treatment inside the building on the top floor. Ideal if you're doing Ecological Balance.
---
You can buy some from the Atom SHOP, but make sure you read which PAs they’re for. Last I knew many did not work for the Excavator and/or Ultracite
---
Pets can just disappear sometimes or get killed. My old sloth disappeared. Assumed he ran off. Then my deathclaw got murdered by a pack of yao guais
---
Lmao what, it’s someone else’s camp, built by them, with their resources for their use. I get how it could be annoying but it’s part of running that build. You get benefits but they require up-keep and maintenance. So no, I will not change my highly functional base design for the off-chance that you decide to visit and use my shit. If having to stand near some waste barrels or in some water for a minute every now and again is to much to ask then perhaps bloodied isn’t for u :)
---
talking about adventure mode xp
---
I always go for ores
---
I do understand your concern, though I'm under the impression the little girl just played around the camp he had set up. I could be wrong, of course. Here, it seemed to be a nice way for them to interact and be creative together. I'm sure there are other titles they could play that would be more appropriate overall, but I get the feeling the father was being very cautious about what his child was being exposed to.
---
I don't think there is need for medic/support or tank builds in this game. You can sustain yourslef easily or you kill it faster than it does any damage to you.
---
When you pick up an object, said object is refreshed 20 hours later from when you picked it up.  
---
but this will be different on public servers.
---
want reliable material farming, use private worlds
---
Also carnivore has better carry weight buffs.
---
You can just edit your ini files, i made a tutorial a while back.
---
Sure, but a buzzblade has more reach.
---
I suppose technically a chainsaw out-damages it, but I don't think you can get legendary chainsaws.
---
&gt;Getting them for free is a reward for being able to dedicate your time and effort to the game
---
Here's the point the other commenter is making.
---
Example: You can earn all rewards playing 1 hour a day 7 days a week. Or you most likely won't for playing 3.5 hours a day twice a week.
---
In this example the 2 players log on and play Fallout for the exact same amount of time, yet one would likely miss out on all the rewards.
---
FYI, you can buy a mod directly sometimes (not the plan) which can be attached directly to your weapon. These are often cheaper as well.
---
Never knew about the more making others spawn will save it from now on
---
Unfortunately no. I was adding up all the Adventure Mode XP I was getting in NW and having passed 10k, I didn't get score.
---
Nope, bethesda wants you to suffer, please buy some more atoms (fuking daily scrip killing me the most)
---
Have a Vampire Gatling Plasma - This ensures that stim packs are my most frequently sold items
---
Ah yeah, forgot anout that. No more pepperoni rolls for us veggies 😢
---
Then don't come into my camp, I don't want people bringing in their filthy rads and having to clean up after them.
---
(it's a joke, I don't have a decontamination shower setup)
---
I completely understand that feeling! I try to do my best to help my girlfriend find what she's after, and she does the same for me. It just feels good to show that little bit of kindness, even if it is just in a game.
---
I'm sure there's some reason Bethesda hasn't done that yet, though I can't for the life of me figure out what it is. Fingers crossed we at least get a camp budget expansion (that doesn't immediately break something else. =P).
---
This is a good way to go.
---
30k
---
Do yourself a favor and delete this while it's still Euro hours, murricans are going to downvote you in masses. It's the same thing every single time someone brings this up.
---
That's absolutely adorable! It's small moments like that that makes 76 such a great experience, even when the game itself presents so many problems. I hope you're able to share more happy moments like that with your daughter soon!
---
Wholesome &lt;3
---
Current character gets consumables like lunchboxes but all characters seem to get craft able items (I unlocked the sink and ammo converter on my secondary character but also had them on my primary
---
Stop doing that. Fusion cells are a hot commodity thanks to the d*ped lasers and teslas.  
---
If you're running a combat rifle or Fixer, swap the receiver to the .38 version to burn that crap ammo instead of getting the minuscule return the converter gives.  Then sell the .45 you would have otherwise used.
---
If you're using a hunting rifle, switch to a .50 receiver for more economical ammo and sell the .308 to LMG users who need it in heaps.
---
because the PC version is a console port. just go look at the tutorial for the legendary run. it tells you to use the d pad.
---
I really don't get the ammo points, why don't they just let us scrap the ammo for gunpowder, lead and steal and let us craft other ammo. It would be way easier. They could make the ammo converter a mod for the tinker bench or a tinker bench v2. I unlocked the ammo converter yesterday and I have never been this irritated while playing this game.
---
This is incorrect. You need to pick up around 180 other items for things to start respawning again. 60 for containers.
---
Wait, You cant get the nodes and the stone arch together?
---
30k per character.
---
Yeah, the catch up mechanic for this game is the ability to spend Atoms on ranks. You can argue that they could have a better balanced system, but this is also their first attempt and you can also argue that this achieves Bethesdas goals better than a more casual friendly system would. End of the day they're trying to drive more profits is their main goal and getting casual players to spend more on Atoms to rank up and nerfing the free Atoms "hardcore" players get so they'll more likely spend real money for them in theory should do just that.
---
I just wish that the hotfix would actually fix something, anything even and not only brake more in the game.
---
If i remember well, at the start at the game Somerset had no legendary effect, i was surprised on my alt after getting AA version last year. Like very early days
---
Lol, yeah its possible I'm sure, which means he needs a new chair, cause those some sweaty numbers. In my opinion its far more likely he's got some kinda glitch going cause if you spend 8HR a day grinding this game, you gotta be unemployed.  Share that 600 covid cash cause us essential sacrifices are suffering here.
---
Craft and sell Marine Tactical Helmets to Vendor Bots. Easy Peasy. Around 30c each. 1 Glass, 1 Plastic &amp; 3 Rubber.
---
I thought you could upgrade it to a higher level afterwards
---
It will become a x amount of points. And you spend them on the ammo you need.
---
Yes, it counted
---
you need to continue the story to join them (more specifically the overseer questline)
---
you can max reputation with both at any point (including after the story)  but it is highly recommended to do both faction quests to the point of no return before siding with a faction (they make it obvious when you hit that point)
---
How do you get the ammo converter?
---
Or you can go to the main page &gt; about &gt; and then click the “Bethesda Replied” bot’s page, and go to its comments.
---
What if you want more enemies to spawn to get more Xp and loot and maybe you have more chances to get legendaries? Even with my unoptimised build I have no problem covering one side alone.
---
Edit. Lately the event is so full of players I hardly get any legendaries, so I just collect ore and hit what I can.
---
I've never quite understood it myself. I can understand frustration or disappointment or anger with losing or failing, but to be outright mean or rude over it, or to actively do something to inconvenience other people and players? It's so much easier to be helpful or provide teaching moments, or just be kind overall.
---
Thank you for your kind words, as well! I honestly didn't think there was any other option besides "give the girl more plushies", so it was an easy decision for us to make! (Oh, and I went around for my girlfriend afterwards and restocked her collection of bears and Fuzzy toys, so she's got her own set back as well)
---
Have you run out of materials. You can make it so it only shows things you can craft/place
---
Cool, I got it, also good to hear they are going to have more days with 9 challenges :)
---
You can still get the buffs from the foods but it will not satisfy your food needs.
---
There's better ways to get XP and ignoring event objectives to kill legendaries just pisses off any other players actually trying to complete the event.
---
Hmm, it may be the settler. But it never triggers when I actually talk to her. That’s why it’s weird.
---
Sadly, i think u cant get the copy for linking accounts anymore
---
Nope. Opposing food gives no buffs at all now.
---
Not anymore.
---
As was said, private server. Use a suitcase or other feature with no maximum weight, in case the drop bag gets glitchy (I’ve had them despawn before). 
---
If you are really worried, do it on someone else’s private so they guarantee a server lock. Just don’t take a lot of time moving it over, servers still crash.
---
Yes, I’m on public. I’ll be more careful next time it pops up. Maybe I’ll catch it.
---
It's at 25, 50 and 75 IIRC correctly, so don't panic if someone else throws a couple early, but try to let them know to hold onto it, I usually just drop my PA in front of the hatch and they get the idea.
---
I know that, but I also know that I'm not out of materials, especially considering a lot of the things giving me trouble use basic and abundant materials
---
You can barely fit 10 foundations in camp circle. I would love to see that distinct structures you call village.
---
over rated in my opinion.
---
Will always take a Handmade for accuracy and recoil.
---
When did they change this?
---
thats horrible.. thanks...
---
&gt; do you really need 3 of the same treasure map?
---
Yes. I won’t even go to a location without a minimum of 20 for that spot. The more you have, the more you can get. Do it with a team there to maximize benefits.
---
It does outdamage the Handmade but not by much.
---
It’s no biggie, free xp and quest rewards for doing nothing I suppose
---
i don't think it's needed.
---
on Fast firing weapons it's like an unkillable god roll.
---
looking at you my beautiful 3* Vampire Handmade Automatic
---
Where did you get "ignoring event objectives"? I never said that. Don't pull your raider tricks here. I collect ore, but deposit it as soon as I leave one cave.
---
Sad ppl downvotes you just because they dont understand the game mechanics 😂 but i guess it was the same ppl who still use explosive for the sbq
---
Edit: do you use quick hands for the lmg?
---
Gotta wait for the instanced interiors
---
When they change the total to 100k this would be a an awesome idea
---
I really dont care about these downvotes here, but thank you. :)
---
I know enough on how this game works to know not to drop shit on the ground I dont want to lose.i get you didnt back out of the pip boy and you crashed but c'mon shit dont always work here
---
If your those or u are the people who also dropped a bunch is duped plans at a train station thx
---
Bruh. I ended up running a silo to beat that challenge.
---
That’s what I’m doing
---
That’s really cute lol
---
Well I missed that completely I deleted her and put Beckett in my camp after finishing I thought that was it. Oh well every loot I’ve discovered from either the miners key or from the map fragments has been rubbish anyway
---
And here me thinking it was the millions of useless legendarys I'm hauling about because I refuse to drop good scrip lol, thank for heads up. 😃
---
I don’t think you can man.To get both nodes you have to place the camp on a stone coming from the wall halfway between those two.I think you can’t build much higher than single floor shack around the lead extractor.
---
You should be able to build a small outpost out front of the acid cave,but I don’t think it reaches very far from the stone wall.
---
You might need to try this out on your own,It’s been a while since I relocated my camp there.
---
No, there is no crossplay.
---
Well I’m not going to make an offer to take that from them.
---
I saw the lemonade guy at the very start of the game and I couldn’t get anything as I had no caps and I’ve been trying to find him ever since but to no avail
---
Abbie's Bunker is my preference, too, but this really only works on a private server.
---
You don't need to collect ore if you're defending. People just need to stick to their role, heavy gunners in PA protecting the main room while runners in stealth armor get the ore. The way you wrote your comment made it sound like you were ignoring the event and only focusing on killing enemies for XP.
---
I see. Kind of cringe but luckily I'm used to disappointment.
---
I’m sorry if I offended you I just know that my friend really wants this
---
I use a lever action,fixer and suppressed handmade in a stealth semi auto build. I tried a 50 cal sniper as a longer range alternative but cause of that I can't use a suppressor which sorta fucks up the stealth portion of my build and it's damage was at most 5% better than mylever action. That and the fact that it kicked like a mule made me scrap it. I'm not sure whether the damage trade off is worth it for the .38 but then again damage numbers in this game have always confused me so I can't say much
---
Wait doesn't the pressure plate deactivate the moment you step off it?  Do you have the plate inside the shower itself or just outside of it?  I was looking for a way to do this and still have it look good but couldn't get it quite right, so I used a switch instead.
---
You haven’t dude it’s cool!
---
Ok :)
---
All you need is brown sugar doest kill them
---
 but rotts their teeth. 😜
---
Says the Snallykaren.
---
Imagine manually aiming a rifle in FO76. VATS Commando is only OP if you don't forget the VATS part.
---
Honestly they probably assume like most people you have pacifist mode on and aren’t trying to start pvp. If you get a bounty in a group of that size you’re going to die.
---
Do events like uranium fever, tag all the enemies and sell all the loot afterwards, sell serums to NPC vendors, marine helmets are another easy way if you have the plan. I also sell all my excess chems and cooked food.
---
You should be able to hit the 1400 daily cap limit easily once you get a few methods started.
---
After that selling stuff in your own vendor is the way forward, armor, weapons, ammo, serums etc.
---
Your rads eat through my wood flooring, just don't be a rad dump
---
Mine is in front of my "maintenance shed" which just has my fusion generator, chem lab, and floor safe stash container. The garage door is hooked up to a switch that also activates the shower, but since it's a garage door and hence double wide, you can easily avoid the shower. Plus, there's a side door so you don't have to go anywhere near it.
---
Thats not how it works for me, i pick something up. about 20 hours later, it has been reset.
---
atleast in private worlds
---
If you place it right next to it, you can stand on both at once!
---
I’m a carnivore stealth food build and I like to carry Stingwing Stew (+3 PER), Softshell Mirelurk Cake (+3 AGL), Smoked Mirelurk Fillets (+30 LBS), Tasty Squirrel Stew (+20% EXP) Steeped Thistle Tea (+20% Crit Damage) and Steeped Fever Blossom Tea (+5 AP Regen).
---
I wish there was something like the vault from Destiny 2
---
\+ each level is harder and harder as you progress to higher levels, so dont be surprised when you must spend more and more time for level up these 8 ranks per week
---
Regardless, stop turning in cells and sell them in your vendor. I've had no problems clearing West Tek with a .38 mutie slayer Fixer.  There is a damage trade off, but as long as you maintain stealth and have the right perks, it's not bad and you're using ammo you'd otherwise be basically  throwing away.  
---
.45 is hot right now thanks to the sea of new god tier fixers floating around.  Anytime I've put any in my vendor it's gone pretty quick.  If you use a marketplace, you can make that happen even quicker.
---
Before the new perk cards I'd have said grab an xbow for the recoverable ammo as they used to be affected by the rifleman perks. It's also largely silent.
---
Awesome! Thank you for sharing that.
---
What week are we on just now?
---
I had already made my point though. To quote Aristotle "They started it"
---
Found that out after my friend bought the game. He instantly uninstalled it. They are losing customers by not having crossplay
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af3hl4/vampires_effect_on_legendary_weapons/edwgvo1?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Good explanation here from "Aten_Ra".
---
All of us have different circumstamces and we all play the game as we see fit. And yeah, a good chair is a crucial part of successful grind sessions :D I'd personally recommend Herman Miller Embody, it's pretty much the definition of comfort -))
---
Hmm, someone recently edited the wiki to add the info that this may be related to the misc quest for cashing in your tokens which you get at the end of Lode Baring. Not sure how correct that info is, though it might be worth a try.
---
(It would certainly explain why doing the event again fixed it for me - I tend to cash in those tokens ASAP because they weigh 0.1 each.)
---
Wait there's a daily cap limit too?
---
Then you can reinforce it. When you just devolve into grammatical Corrections you are becoming the fool
---
Its more powerful than your standard combat rifle not sure if its stronger than the handmade might be negligible but it does have a bonus for sneaking added to it even if its not legendary so it's as close as we get to a 4 star rifle for now
---
It would be nice, but with all the hacking that goes on in the PC version  I can't see them ever doing crossplay, at least between PC and consoles.
---
aah padawan.
---
Welcome to the GRIND :)
---
you will learn to HATE Can't Use Furniture Ward. let it flow through you
---
This reset will be the start of week 3
---
Let's see if it happens again this week. I've heard that if you log off 15 mins before it updates and wait at least 15 after it does to get back on, it should not happen. I'm gonna try that :)
---
So it *is* harder? Your last comment said the opposite.
---
I think we are just starting week 3. Afaik it started on the 1st of July but I might be very wrong about this
---
EDIT: it started on June 30 (I started on July 1 lol).
---
Today we started week 3
---
Do not get confortable tho. Higher ranks require more SCORE and it'll be harder and harder to rank up. Someone calculated that in order to reach 100 you need to do all dailies and weeklies + farm the repeatable one a few times a week. But double xp ans SCORE weekends will help break that barrier a bit and help those that are behind.
---
IMO if you stick to dailies and weeklies since the start you'll get to 100 with time to spare. 
---
We started week 3 and I'm at rank 33
---
EDIT2: yeah, as others said this is off and it's a 70 days/10 weeks seasons.
---
To be on track you need to be rank 33 before todays reset (the start of week 3)
---
I think we’re about to start week 3. They said after two weeks you can start paying for levels with atoms and I’m pretty sure that’s tomorrow
---
Thank you I will try this when I next get on
---
Good point. I'm happy it's harder to hack on console and not many can be bothered to do it.
---
Ah great, I’m ahead then lol was worried I wouldn’t be on track.
---
Wow 100%?  That's amazing!  Crazy how you polled every single player that plays the game!
---
Just seems 90% of players on the servers I join are all below level 20. Makes events and like you said, the sbq impossible to complete if not very difficult
---
Yeah I've experienced this quite a bit. Had about 80% of the server being under level 30 but I feel it is a good thing so I usually gift them stimpaks, ammo etc to help them on their way. I hope it encourages a friendly community (and hopefully keep/entice new players to stay for the long run).
---
High dps very low vats cost. You can use the stealth suit but a full uny set is better imo
---
I thought it was only going to be 10 weeks and run through mid September
---
Yeah, the end of the Crater or Foundation quest lines culminate in the raiding of vault 79. I don't think you can get into it without completing them.
---
Or have it attached to an arrow like a comic strip thought bubble, so the place you click is away from the event area a bit.
---
Yup, same. What gets me is them taking workshops then doing absolutely nothing with them cause they don't know what to do. I try to get them to join me as I would gladly place the shit for them but they never join. Lol. 
---
Good ole' Bambi's. (Bambi's = new player)
---
I’m just gonna leave this here...
---
https://m.imgur.com/wH4Uv2q
---
What I'm doing is saving up all of my big guns ammo and stuff until I get a server doing one already, or the server has plenty of high level players.
---
Ah ok may I askis unyielding good for ? I’ve been playing since beta and always just sold my unyielding armor to other players
---
Nice! I'm doing good too. Which is unusual for me :P
---
The voice of set as long as it's in your inventory you can craft it to a higher level.its weird. It shows in craft menu only if you have it on you
---
Which brings it to a 70 day challenge. Not 100...This math is way off
---
I got a bloodied one a while ago and it’s my main weapon.
---
It give you +15 to all your stats but end. So it gives you a lot of ap and makes  you very sneaky
---
I started a new account because of this. It’s kind of fun trying sbq and encryptid at level 20 lol
---
Stopped looking ended up opening  a perk pack and got a cola perk gum
---
I got alot of good leggys from Murmpgh?px@ghh, love her
---
like BE15RL 50 cal, BE50DRWA HM, B2515 CR, ....
---
those I all got on my second bloodied char with high luck, with my main full health heavy gunner, I recieve alot of crap, so boost your luck I guess
---
I jump on to collect scrip ,, score and gold then I’m done , the game has become a chore and bores the shit out of me ....... I also like helping low levels because I can make almost everything they are after 😘
---
Damm I’m gonna have to start getting this then
---
Bloodied weapons require low health to use correctly. Unyielding procs at low health, giving you potentially massive boosts to your stats, agility being important for sneaking. With a big enough boost, unyielding armor will give you better sneak then other armors
---
Okay I’m gonna have to get a set of this
---
Yeah, my BE lever doing 4k damage is so satisfying.. 😏
---
What I was trying to say is I want more baddies to shoot not less, but I also want to complete the event, I should've added that part to make it more clear.
---
Yeah. I have no clue where he saw that it’s gonna last 100 days. That wouldn’t allow 4 seasons since there is only 362 days in a year.
---
They stated I remember that it’s 10 weeks with a 2 week rest period.
---
Find a high level in your game and ask them nicely to craft one for you, the weapon not the mod. Not that expensive to craft. What level and platform are you on may I ask?
---
I did this and after about a week another suit spawned in the display case.now I have a extra
---
I agree. Drives me crazy. It’s why I keep a good stock of toxic goo.
---
Well done, apart from the drugs, they'll be your ruin :-)
---
I believe military grade duct tape has it too.
---
The bad guy starts at spot 30 to account for this too. Sorry OP, I wish it were easier by doing 1 rank per day too lol
---
It's on pretty high demand right now because of the seasonal model. Along with boosting agility for sneak rifle builds, the boosted intelligence stat can get you massive exp boosts if your farming for SCORE
---
I'll make note to watch out for this myself.
---
Put on pacifist mode and this will not happen. 
---
Also, they didn’t get your flux. Flux disappears from bags on death.
---
I was thinking of trying to farm but it’s too late at this point I’m level 7 on the board and those atom packs are looking mighty tempting right now
---
Easier said than done however, lots of cost/trading or lots and lots of legendary modules :-)
---
I prefer to trade my vast inventory means if I bundled I could acquire a set
---
Ok, settlements may need help, but in foundation... Everyday a stolen object... C'mon!
---
That would be great, something like the public teams list.
---
Yup just looked it up on Bethesda website. June 30th through mid September so OP is going to have to rework that math because it’s only 10 weeks
---
It’s a fun event. I only did it once but liked it a lot. Wasn’t sure if I did it right. I killed a few ghouls, went to collect ore, deposited them and we completed the event.
---
Does Inspirational work if you're alone on a public team?
---
Because adventure challenges arent active in NW
---
My camp is like this too, none of the floors can be deleted claimin it'd make something unaccessable, despite nothing else attached to them.
---
I think it's basically a bug caused by using staircases at all, and/or 'replaceing' a staircase to an atom store one. I had to rebuild my camp only for it to do it again when using the buggy AF vault 76 stairs.
---
They probably mean from npc vendors because they only have so many caps
---
I wouldn't buy board ranks today unless you're positive you wouldn't rank up anymore, which doesn't sound like the case since you're still playing. The early ranks are WAY easier to complete, but the later ranks have really high score bars per level. 
---
If you can be patient, waiting until the last week of the season will save you the most atoms. 
---
And, I'm not farming exp at the moment either, but I'd recommend reading up on an exp guide, and just hammering out exp when they do a triple experience weekend soon. Grind as much of that as you can, and then buy ranks if you absolutely need to
---
Plus there are a lot of perks and mutations that synergize with the build - Nerd Rage, Serendipity, Adrenal Reaction. And with the new public teams feature, you can always be on a team (even if actually solo), so Herd Mentality and Inspirational can always work.
---
It's even harder on xbox, my cursor likes to continue moving left/right after I stop.
---
I am currently farming for the xp boosting items but if it gets that bad then I may have to spend money
---
And you're proud of that?
---
I'm exclusively using that now. Except for Scorchbeasts when I have to get my Lullaby out of my stash
---
Looks like Actuarial notation, kind of. In any case, we’ll see. All the mathematical forecasts works with what we know so far. We don’t know with certainty what this team has in store for us in the future.
---
I’ve thought about quickhands, but i dont like the randomness.
---
And my luck hasnt any free points anymore because I have to use grim reapers sprint to keep the ap alive.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Btw do you happen to know if Brain Bombs are effected by Herbivore or Carnivore?
---
It’s so weird because I can get past all the laser grids and use the lift
---
Think that was needed to be done by mid april or something.
---
They're still rewarding you for your time and effort. Just not the way you expect them to. As with most online games, Bethesda wants players to log in more often vs for longer periods. It's more beneficial to them to have a player log in an hour a day every day vs once a week for 7 hours.
---
They could have gone all the way with time gating like they have with other content but they at least made it so it's possible to grind more when you have time. It's a lot more fair than some of their other mechanics.
---
Deeper in there's a room with several big vats of inert FEV, probably talking about those.
---
Double score weekends only affect dailys
---
Mine is hooked up to a switch on the only entrance to my base. If I need to dump rads, I hit the switch, run in, and turn it back off. 
---
If another player wants to do the same they are welcome to. The only thing that bugs me a bit is when they don't turn it off when they are done. 
---
But I give other players the ability to use or not based on the switch that is right in front of it.
---
20 odd every run after you scrap the gauntlets
---
Sell shit
---
Take an upvote, you sly dog.
---
You know what, it wasn't. I've never used power armour, I was kinda "saving it" for when I start exploring cranberry bog. So I just have to find a random chassis spawn and bring it there to recraft. I'm vexxed I didn't try to rationalize it like that. Ugh.
---
I've been trying to get one also and I'm on Xbox as well bert102176 the one time that had a bunch of people doing the mission it froze on me since then I can never seem to get any help doing it.
---
I would say it's not worth it. Deathclaw gauntlet and powerfist will both do much better than the gauntlet would. It's fun to play with I suppose, but the damage isn't quite there. I haven't tested it against my mole miner, but I think it would be somewhat similar in actual damage numbers.
---
Alright thanks :D
---
Will be restocked again today and then probably again next week. It depends, they put specials up for a couple of weeks and others refresh every 7 days :)
---
Hey all. I've been watching this thread and waiting for update 20 to resolve this problem. When update 20 didn't fix it, I opened a support ticket. The tech's just reset the quest for me and all is well. So open up a support ticket. I did waste a lot of time with them playing 20 questions. Here's what you need to tell them:
---
The support form will ask for Challenge Name (Crash Landing) and Description. Also tell them before they ask: Quest Name, Quest step, Details on what is blocking you, make sure you have "power cycle'd" your console or verified your PC game files, name of your username, character name.
---
Not at all! Its way too slow. Have u ever tried to realod a Quad one? Its taking for ever and looks stupid.
---
I prefer Hunting Rifles as a non auto alternative.
---
Yeah I never thought of that because I've ignored all power armor related gameplay and don't fully understand how it works.
---
I play mostly 1st person but will switch to 3rd person if I'm using melee. I tend to use throwing knives and shotguns but I also carry a melee weapon as a backup, usually for those pesky molerats.
---
I'll buy it if you are looking to sell it. LMK
---

---
Weird! Are you entering through the mysterious cave or the shack that goes directly to Vault 79?
---
Learn something new everyday, thanks
---
Good to hear! Figured there was probably some logical explanation for it.  The game has quite a few bugs but that was the first time I had ever heard of that being one of them lol.
---
Honestly you are better off not picking any until you've built up a stock of the other materials anyways unless you plan on drinking it once it spoils, it happens fast.  Nothing like picking a bunch and then not being able to get high rad fluids to drop AT ALL.  Get mad just thinking about it lol
---
Guy got mad at me when I was level 17 and was able to loot her
---
My mole miner is the best I have currently, that's a junkies swing speed. My Deathclaw is instigating but one star so a little slow. Powerfist is junkies one star. Guess I'm looking for someone to put me off and tell me it's a bad idea lol.
---
Thankfully not pc is plagued with hackers and illegitimate weapons. 
---
So glad these are not a bane on console.
---
Is it double score or double xp this weekend?
---
the lineup usually changes every tuesday. usually.
---
XP
---
I've got like 4 different legendary variants I use because I can't bring myself to part with any of them... so satisfying to use tbh
---
I always loved Lincoln's Repeater from FO3. Not only is it lever action, it makes an awesome sound.
---
it was rigged from the start
---
seriously though, I'm saving the atoms they give me to jump over some of the last levels
---
Rads are pretty heavy closer to the flower which makes it a no-go for some builds who dont want to swap out for a hazard suit/stealth suit.
---
I've got an instigating lever gun too!  Sneaking headshots, on a critical, I've gotten over 1500 damage.
---
Soooo much fun.
---
play the Wastelanders main quest. the pawn shop stuff, up to 79's front door, was added to tease wastelanders and test the instanced interiors.
---
Well, all the ones I've tested are the same effects bloodied, power attack damage, and reduced damage while blocking( doubt this does anything at all for damage, but for testing purposes it makes it easier). I used my gauntlet for about a day or 2, but honestly just didn't do what my others did.  If I were to repeat the grind on another character though I would definitely have this be one of the last things I get.
---
If you are on PC, I can build one at your camp.
---
Ok so what you have to do is first is speak to the 2 by the wayward and go and speak to them then work your way through that questline. SPOILER!
---
**Stage 1**( *if your new to this quest and dont want spoilers im doing each stage one paragraph at a time so go along as they should be in order*)
---
&gt;!You will have to listen to the overseers broadcast in the quest The new arrivals. The next quest is to vaccinate the factions which you will have to of completed the final responder quest, which will prompt Strange Bedfellows where you have to vaccinate raiders and persuade meg to vaccinate the raiders which you need to have completed the old raider quests with Rose. Then you will have to do here to stay where you persuade Paige to vaccinate the settlers which you need Aubrey.!&lt;
---
**Stage 2**
---
&gt;!Once you completed those quests you will have to 'prepare' for the ending so id recommend doing all of them up to the finale to get as much rep and rewards so lets start with settlers.!&lt;
---
*Settlers:*
---
**Trade secrets:**
---
&gt;! Trade secrets will come up where you will have to speak to Penny Hornwright at the Hornright estate because paige will need a huge drill and Penny has just what he needs so you will get her what she desires so Paige can borrow the Motherlode. Retrieve the schematics and head back, Also note that you will have to find clues in the hornright estate and theres difficult enemies up there so be careful, i can help you if your on ps4.!&lt;
---
**Invisible ties:**
---
&gt;!Then invisible ties, speak to Jen because she knows how to counter the laser grids, a stealth suit, find her mother whos a former spy to get the schematics for them(Id 100% reccomend as it costs ALOT of bullion and is untradeable)!&lt;
---
**Duty calls:**
---
&gt;!you need some qualified experienced soldiers to pull off such a dangerous mission like this and your in luck as there are some soldiers in an abandoned bunker. You need to get some heavy duty tools and the captain sends you over to RobCo to build a robobrain to build them( theres alot of robots) bring the tools and meet them at foundation. !&lt;
---
*Raiders:*
---
**Cheating death:**
---
&gt;!in order to breach the vault meg needs a heist expert but the problem is he is no where to be seen so speak to Caleb and intimidate him with either strength or charisma to tell you about Lou's whereabouts. then track him down to a mine. The mine is heavily booby-trapped so be aware. Kill the nasties in the mine and convince  Lou to not commit suicide at the end the speak to meg.!&lt;
---
**Fun and games:**
---
&gt;!You will need some cavalry to pull of the heist so whats better than a small daredevil and a burly mutant, Gail and Ra-Ra. Their last whereabouts where at Grafton Steel, travel there and go to Grafton Steel underground and destroy the security robots, they are leveled so be careful, then speak to Ra-Ra. She wants her favorite toy before she leaves so find her toy and theres more robots, then she says she is hungry so give her some food and proceed to the boos, an assualtron, kill it, remember to keep an eye out for the prototype steel mill helmet. More robots, defeat the legendary sentry bot thats guarding her toy. be nice to her or she wont get the unique helmet so dont say be careful and stuff i think.!&lt;
---
**The Ol' Weston Shuffle**
---
&gt;!Speak to Johnny Weston at the crater core where he will direct you to the watoga civic center where he wants you to rescue his friend Hal. You will have to survive 3 rounds of ferals, floaters and finally a legendary Grafton monster where you will have to kill them in a certain time. escape the area with Hal and speak to Johnny.!&lt;
---
**Siding with crater/foundation and division on wealth/from russia with lev:**( *Important stage, id recommend looking up the rewards with what side as they both have unique untradeable weapons*)
---
***After you choose this you wont be able to progress the finale with the settlers and vice versa but when you choose this meet meg(raiders) or Paige(settlers) at the vault***&gt;!. But something has gone wrong, the opposite faction sabotaged the raid so if you choose settlers, Penny will be getting held up at hornwright industrial HQ where you can either kill or make a deal with Hijack, complete a maze and recalibrate the Motherload. If you chose raiders fellow raider Lev has been paided  to sabotage it and kidnap Lou and steal the detonator. Interrogate Megs suspects and find out who it is, rescue Lou and then find the detanator, Go to levs hideout and get the detanator from him.!&lt;
---
**All that glitters/Buried treasure:**
---
&gt;!You have made it to the end now now you will raid the vault with the faction you chose in the previous stage now you will have to steamroll through the vault and get to the gold, you will meet the secret service which arent pleased to see you and agree to let you have the gold but theres a slight problem, theres no power so go to the generator where you will find a ghoul named Digger now you will have to reset it and theres alot of ferals here. Go back, tell AC that powers up, ive seen people reporting that digger can be legendary so if he is definitly kil him as hes nice and all but you dont see him again. Speak to the faction leader you chose and choose how much you want to split, if you keep it all you will lose some reputation, if you do half and half you gain some with the faction and finally you can do you keep 500 and the factions get 250 each with gives a bit to both. now you have access to the eternal grind of wastelanders and you will be drip-fed new content over a while so enjoy:)!&lt;
---
Wish I could get a good one to use ... was my best weapon in Fallout 4 to take down big stuff in one or two shots. Haven't noticed if you can also pin down the limbs on the walls in 76 though.
---
Seems like the ‘Bloodied Build’ community is quite sensitive and feels the need to be catered to by all other players. In a game that is based on giving you the freedom to choose how you want to play why should anyone pay your ‘build’ any mind? It’s not my job to maintain your character.
---
Or just go into the old world radio 2s fallout radio stream.
---
Edit: on youtube
---
I agree, also the event xp bonus is not needed as XP gain is capped at 4000 XP. On a double XP weekend, with XP/INT boosts and/or lunchboxes you can expect to be always at the cap.
---
It's random between 1 and 3*
---
Thanks for the reply and help, I'll just keep up the secret service grind!
---
I have a vampire's mole Miner and I'm wolverine 
---
so there's your answer, bub
---
My decon is normally on switch set to off though i have come back to folks leaving it on
---
Thanks. Is that a guarantee of what’s to come?
---
The Settlers Gauntlet deals slightly less damage when compared to identical DCGs and Powerfists. But it's not always about the base damage as a weaker weapon can actually be as good as, if not better than the alternatives with the right effects. if you're after a specific legendary it will also free you from relying on random world drops or expensive player vendors in the never-ending search for the last point of dps. But will it make any difference outside of the boss level fights? Probably not.
---
Enough to bring a tear to a man, wholesome indeed.
---
I use first with my stealth build and third with my heavy gunner.
---
In NW, third for awareness and first for combat.
---
 I've used a handmade far more than the fixer but I had always suspected this. Thanks for verifying
---
If it is not broken like every 5min...
---
I haven't and am not commenting on the reasons or the wants of Bethesda. I am not providing opinion on aspects of in game content. I'm pointing out the major flaw in your argument, with a somewhat specific example that highlights the hole.
---
Speaking specifically about the legendary run and it's free rewards. The 2 people in the given example will play the game the exact amount of time yet one receives all the legendary run rewards and one highly likely doesn't. That is the opposite of your claim that all the rewards are for those that "put the time and effort" in to it.
---
Although I agree with that claim in principle (because it can be true when generalising). It doesn't apply to the specific legendary run and all the related rewards as per the given example. Because, an individual can put equal, or even far greater effort than another individual yet not receive all the same (legendary run cosmetic) rewards.
---
Gamepass and a current sale will really give it a boost
---
Thats the dumbest thing ive ever read lol
---
Check your drivers for option like vsync and low latency mode, they must be disabled. Seems like i finally got rid of this problem.
---
Last time I ran into an obviously young kid playing this game, he was running around in his underwear, level 10, getting demolished by super mutants. I came in and wiped them out and crafted and modded some weapons and armor for him, and followed him on a couple quests. I said at one point I had to hop out of my power armor because I was out of fusion cores.
---
Kid drops a bag of like 50 100% fusion cores. 0.o
---
I help people build camps and I've had people ask me to place rad showers in doors and in places people can't see till they walk past and the brutally honesty of why I'm asked to do it  - most people know it annoys bloody builds and that is why they do it
---
they hate constantly having a bloody one shot all the legendarys in a fight to get all the loot not to mention almost every hacker people runs into are bloody builds downing 5000 bobble heads and then one shoting the queen stealing the loot from everyone 
---
and why I don't place things like this in my camp I can understand the frustration of both sides and why its being done
---
Brain bombs are effected by the Herbivore mutation. They give +6 INT or +7.5 INT with Strange in Numbers (but I think that gets rounded up to +8 INT).
---
I thought this was a feature more then a bug. If I was unarmed and a person with a gun had high ground. 
---
My first thought would be fall back and find cover.
---
The same when you run silos the broken motherboards or whatever they called, stay in your inventory and they weigh a ton
---
How
---
Oh awesome! Thanks for letting me know!
---
Oooh thank you ! Hopefully get to look at some new items then 🤞🏻
---
Herbivore brings it to +6 INT... Add Strange in Numbers and you're at 7.5.
---
If you have a friend. Take a workshop and get them to place an Ammo Convertor down. 
---
Get them to lock it at Level 0 and then clear your bounty.
---
I use 3rd person mostly then switch to first person indoors.
---
the problem is it is common knowledge and that is why they do it
---
people forget that a lot of people specially high lvls really REALLY despise bloody builds
---
let me see if i understand. You and another guy were contesting a workshop so because he kept taking it you destroyed his CAMP?
---
I7 7600K GTX 1080 and triple monitor 5760 x 1080 at 60fps. I think there's something off with your setup.
---
The zoom seems to help, on Xbox. My problem is I usually don't zoom until the second attempt
---
More weapon skins are probably coming in season 2 or 3.
---
I have been visiting you recently. Your mutant entrance was much appreciated - i even took a photo\^\^  
---
 https://imgur.com/ugrZFdH
---
Bit of a different aspect, but the menus a bad, very bad. Sometimes I can select perk cards with my mouse other times I have to use the keys. Have to scroll through everything in build mode, why can't we just point and click on what we want. Recently I can't use my mouse in the pipboy when changing tabs. Sometimes you use tabe to go back other places its esc?
---
Thanks todd
---
Ha ha ha, this is great! I possess all of the suck when it comes to pvp. Wish you were in Xbox
---
USUALLY it changes. we might not get anything new today, just different sales.
---
Nice!!
---
That just means it needs to be optimised on PC as well.
---
Lol 20+ people I know that bashed the game when it first released, when their favorite YouTubers would say fake or super exaggerated info about the game told me they’d never play fallout 76 even if someone bought it for them, well I see at least half of those people now on every day playing it
---
Get the radaway recipe from whitesprings bunker medical bit. Use greenthumb perk and pretty much pick up all the glowing mushrooms from between river near vault 76, to flatwoods and then west to the edge of the map in the dried bed.
---
Abraxo cleaner and turps can be found for antiseptic and set up some purified water at your camp.
---
Craft using super duper, chemist and alcohol with happy go lucky perks and take some day tripper. 
---
Try to use hard bargain perk when selling and grape mentats for better charisma. Should be able to make bulk to sell for 1500 caps a day from the vendors.
---
Other perk i use is parma farma and spend some tine finding chems everywhere to sell alongside my radaway each day.
---
Should actually be around level 33 today
---
Seems a perfectly reasonable escalation to me.
---
While I'd rather have seen this end with a nuke straight to the camp, those are obviously too easy to avoid with the whole three minute warning.
---
And they said the old Karma system wasn't in these newer Fallout games...
---
I think I scare most new players when I pop by....level 526 here.
---
low level = low level basic weapons. You start unlocking more powerful weapons as you level. For instance the Lever Action Rifle is at level 25.
---
You need to kill higher level enemies to get higher level enemies OR find plans to make weapons and craft them yourself.
---
You can buy a LOT of plans in this game from NPC vendors. Like. Apparently there's 1300 plans in the game and i reckon you can easily buy 1100 of them. (most weapon/armour mods can be learned by scrapping weapons and armour)
---
Cannot remember the Wasteland quest having rewards that scale. BUT you may struggle if you're not higher anyway. The treasure hunting quest for the wayward gives a legendary but TBH you'll be swimming in legendary items after 50. If in doubt just do everything but the main story and wastelanders stuff. There is no hurry.
---
Another negative point I noticed: There are less people buying from my vendor, because if there are more low-level players on the server, there are less players online who can buy ammunition or weapons (lvl 50) from my vendors in general.
---
Seems like the logical thing to do, no?
---
Edit: 'MURICA
---
It does slightly less damage compared to others with the same Legendary effects however it's main positive is it much much lighter.
---
I’ve also done every single weekly and daily and I’m at 37...have you ONLY done the challenges then immediately log out or something? I haven’t done any pure grinding just for the repeatable SCORE XP either. Just playing the game. I figure I will only resort to doing that if I have to towards the end.
---
Yep. I looked at the guide, it agrees with you.
---
Oh yeah thanks for reminding me
---
edit:i did put it in there in on stage one, i dont think i made it clear enough though but edited it so should be more clear now, thanks
---
I'm not a hundred percent certain here but I don't think I can run Youtube playing music in the background on the XBox
---
May RNJesus bless you.
---
I built mine just Southeast of Harpers Ferry right were the south fork of the river becomes much wider.    I can jump from the cliff onto my deck.    I have my water purifiers in the water and my crops on my roof.    I like that I can hear the water running through the rapids.  
---
 I’m a very short walk from the Free States vendor which is nice.   I’m on PS4 , stop by and relax on my party deck and do some shopping.  I have a guest bed if you want to take a nap.  
---
Only downside is that sometimes the fast travel point puts me in the water.  Oh well!
---
But once you learn the plans, those pieces can also be dropped by the purveyor and at events
---
Honestly, I was having a hard time justifying the cannon when I built it. I didn't think it had  any practical uses because it took so long to fire, but in that moment I was happy I had it and now I don't go without it. When one doesn't own a Fat-Man, the artillery cannon is the next best thing.
---
When people mix up your and you're and they're not being a clownshoe i let it go because i am not bothered. But when someone is being a gonk and does it. Oh boy! I have to point it out. Mostly to annoy them and please myself. I don't point out punctuation. Or spelling. Just the your and you're mix up. Le shrug
---
You have a link to the forum post by chance?
---
Cant you just scrap molester gauntlet.
---
If I could have a collectrons getting me nuka quantum..
---
Then god help everyone in my camp. I got dirt floor to grow corn and razorgrain.
---
Like a shine business.. &gt;.&gt;
---
Such a wholesome moment! 😊
---
Thanks for your response (:
---
I’m on like rank 15.. lol rip
---
Weapon drops are boring, if you are focusing on shotguns then scrap all shotguns to unlock plans and sell the rest.  Levels are partially dependant on area, once you do the forest go North. Plans are picked up or purchased from stations, or by scrapping weapons and armour, you will never get a base gun plan from scrapping, eg combat shotgun, just the mods. And rewards are scaled to level on main quests, most I have found to not be the best item you can get, get the quest legendary to help you out at low levels, buy legendaries from players after level 50as caps will not be an issue. you don't hit the top of the skill curve till after 70.  To help you out ask a higher level player to make you a better weapon with full mods, most will help and probably won't charge you. I am on PS4.
---
I play on pc I'm not that active during the week as I work I jump on do dailys then go off but if you want to add me I play during the weekends and have a lot of free time if you need help with anything my ID is jackdread96
---
You can get Level 15 shotguns at Camden Park, plus do your daily Mr Fuzzy token quests for prizes. That's where I picked up mine, on an older character.
---
Also, I highly recommend doing the quests slowly. I'm pacing them about 5-10 levels per main quest, e.g. I'm currently Level 19 and I'm just about to go to AVR Medical for the first time - the first quest after Morgantown airport. The quests start to venture into harder areas post-Charleston fire station, especially if you're playing on a public server.
---
Yh I get a lot of looks when I turn up at the wayward in T-65 😂
---
I love this event and don't mind  doing it at all only trouble I have is I'm so heavy of scrip I can't run tunnel but I'll walk my turn when Its due
---
Can you imagine the disappointment when I found out that I had to work with the raiders never mind that I couldn't kill them on my BoS character. Was worse than in F4 when I couldn't join the raiders against the Minutemen.
---
- - - People who start Encryptid. Some folks might not realize that to start this event more than once you need to pay 2,000 caps plus use a stable flux to craft the Assaultron Recall Keycard. It's why I never pass one up and why you're a cool person if you start one.
---
I've probably spent over 50,000 caps purchasing the Assaultron Key Cards for the Event. This is to ensure that other high level characters that temporary join my party have an objective and access to an event that keeps them occupied and challenged. As a consequence I also take it upon myself to be some or ALL the conduits to ensure success.
---
- - - People who collect ore in Radiation Rumble. This is a huge one. I can't count the number of times I've been the only one who collected ore and we get bad rewards as a result. If you spend the 2 minutes collecting some ore instead of farming XP you are an absolute legend.
---
Again I take it up myself to be that member that collects the Radiation Ore. Whilst this means that I have to resort to wearing Power Armor, having abundant anti radiation medication, Radaway and Stimpaks the Event isn't a challenge.  So all the credits should go to the players that defend the workers from the creatures.
---
Why don’t you start with yours?
---
Hit 39 last night
---
Is it berserkers? That’s probably why

played the fist 900 hours or so in fps but then i swapped to 3rd and haven't looked back since. It looks cooler. Love seeing my nurse with her responders backpack running around with her gauss shotgun murdering mutants.
---
This is being toxic - this sub’s definition of “toxic” is anyone who PvPs, anyone who’s a Bloodied build and pretty much anyone who disagrees with their opinion. And as for the game being good again? Imma have to disagree with you on that one chief. This game is still a dumpster fire, but it’s our dumpster fire. And it’s always been like this.
---
Let's do my wife's- as she's a total bitch tonight she's running full unyielding on me so everything is +15 right now.

Update 20
---
You have to consider that for Thorn armor you need vault steel and for Secret Service you don't need that.
---
Buddy i dont understand a single thing you’re talking about
---
Oh! so you are just in the entrance. You need to enlist the help of either the Raiders or the Settlers to blow open the door.
---
I run several set, and just rename them to have some prefix for each set so i can easily find and equip them. something like 1) chest weight - 2) chest SS damage - 3) chest unyield. This way, they are top and sorted so i only have to click all 3) named armors for unyield build. It would be better if they add some kind of set manager, but at least it works...   
---
Sorry for my bad english

Figure of speech darling, calm yourself lol

He had a bounty or what? You cannot hurt him or his camp otherwise

Please clarify

I place a switch so that people can choose wether to keep there rads or not

If I pass a workshop, I’ll take it, and drop some artillery. By the end of a play session, I can usually call in the full force of the brotherhood most places on the map. 
---
Artillery strikes and vertibot squadrons are almost practically useless, but they make for an incredible display of force.
---
Because I don’t want to take any chances that you may be carrying around that corona with you and I don’t want you infecting everyone in the wasteland.
---
Technically, you can jump 10 levels with the atoms you get from leveling....
---
If her parents allow her to play it she can play it. Just because you believe something doesn’t mean it’s necessarily true, and she was even under the supervision of her father
---
I would actually prefer a system like the Treasury Notes. Turn in as many Legendary as you want, for Script Notes. But keep the limit at 150 daily. So that way your stash is not over limit with crap. Only keep ones you want on your vendor. 
---
Could even do a turn in option for XP. Turn in 50 stars worth of Legendary would give you a level.
---
Xp this weekend.
---
Hey this is dope, what platform?
---
I can totally understand that, I will say though. You can't start getting gold bullion, which is the endgame currency, until after you complete that mission. And it's a slog once you can start grinding, so it might be worth while to get it done sooner rather then later. Your call though!
---
Thought so thanks!
---
i LOVE RR. will even go it alone. and if its full i'll be dumping cores early :)
---
Out of prob +50 RR, only ever managed one 4/4 completion.
---
Many 3/4 because people just want to farm ghouls so we always end up short.. My personal eye roll moment is when all is going well and someone emotes come here for legendary. Other players leaves their side to tag whatever prob crap legendary, and then the scavengers die.
---
good times :)
---
I think this happens when someone places their FA 1st tent to block the normal spawn points. I have seen this happen twice and both times there was a tent blocking normal spawn points 🤔
---
Correct answer is *not often enough*.
---
True answer you want is Tuesdays I think. So like now. I judge when shit goes out the window by the bigger packs showing '2 days remaining' etc.
---
Some extra pages in the atx would be amazing, as I feel it's so narrow despite the semi regular flip.
---
Oh I see where do you buy things with the gold bullion? Do you not use caps anymore?
---
Pc sry forgot that part
---
The answer is what I’ve been saying: don’t have every single gun primed. Have a queen slayer gun primed, use regular ammo for everything else. Prime is not a requirement for your gun.
---
Otherwise, launch your own nukes.
---
He might have. I'm only an occasional player so im not really privy to the intricacies of the that kind of thing. I shot at him and chased him off after he stole my stuff the first time so maybe that had something to do with it? Im not really sure.
---
Great idea!  I have fast traveled to a few of these, only to see the timer count down the last few seconds, as soon as I spawn in place, but before I can even move my character.  :(
---
Wow this sounds like a legit business! Great idea 👍🏼
---
I mean, you could NOT go in...The placement of my shower in my base is for my ease of use not to cater to someones meta
---
Do you know what the range is on those things? Might play around with them later
---
Its under quest items Not explosives
---
Lmaoo thx just tryna give people something to do tbh
---
Why did you have to put that in such a despicable way? Like sure, paying for levels through atoms is a valid thing to say, its NOT a good way to treat dedicated fans who simply dont have the time to log in every day but it is a way around it, sure. 
---
But exactly where in OPs post was he being entitled? He asked if bethesda could throw people like him a bone, no reason to be a dick about it
---
Yep 1 to 3 stars. I’m working my way though the set now. Have a Vanguard Torso and both arms Vanguard so far. Two are 3 star and one is 2 star. I’ve rolled some junk along the way though. Shame no deep pocketed for anything other that the torso though.
---
So there are three vendors for Gold Bullion. Vault 79, The Crater, and Foundation. The two faction vendors require their reputations be leveled to access all of their items, but the Vault 79 dude offers everything up front. 
---
You still use caps for most things, but the newest "Best" gear requires you to get the plans with GB
---
yeah they hit damn hard :)
---
had a level 12 on mic with us at AWOL armaments last night. good times
---
Because I felt like it. Cry to your mama, idgaf.
---
Str. 4 per. 12. End. 3. Cha. 9 int. 12. Agi. 6 luk. Over 9000
---
My bad, I over looked that line. Thought I did say it was before the bombs, which meant it was before the Enclave, but I’ll make the distinction if it makes it clearer.
---
you sad little man
---
Well I’m looking forward to that all the gear I seem to win or find right now isn’t great. I’ve traded most of my legendary stuff and then bought a 3 star gun with the scrip which was rubbish
---
Everyone seems to be forgetting that this is (or at least was) intended to be a survival (lite) game. Ammo scarcity is supposed to be a thing. Use multiple weapons, find the most efficient ammo crafting techniques(hell railway is just steel right? Scrapper, high intelligence, scrap every weapon you find... maybe use cheap AoE things during group events like Line in the Sand and Uranium Fever so you get kill credit and can loot and scrap more weapons), boost you damage (seriously, one of many reasons bloodied builds are the best is because they require so much less resource upkeep since they kill so fast).
---
You'd think so, but the day before yesterday i managed to do it, visited a camp to check out the shop and since it was on the cliff over west tec i started sniping the super mutants below, the guy walks over and HOZES the area, i did not even know a machinegun was capable of the kind of spread, i was a bit miffed and emoted in kind which prompts the dude to try and hose me down, but I'm pacifist so no dice there.
---
Still i felt a token of my displeasure was waranted so i head over to charlie, and bombed his camp, took some doing since i never launched a nuke before, but i guess he was at least semi afk, or figured it was being dropped on the usual targets because he was very much right there at ground zero.
---
My VFFR Tesla is insane for keeping my ass alive in big encounters
---
Neat I didn't know about the 4k exp cap TIL
---
I agree.  I have read that NW is a PvP thing, so I have never even logged into that option, because I have no interest in PvP.  I ignore the daily/weekly challenges tagged "NW", but doing just the regular world challenges moves me along the board quite nicely.  NW is definitely not necessary.  :)
---
No......your a dirty dirty boy. Only clean people in my shop.
---
No Shirt No Rads. No service
---
Bro. Have some faith.
---
That would be amazing
---
If it’s not nailed down, sell it! 
---
Some good items are water, golf outfits and skirts, straight jackets and auto assault rifles.. 👍🏼
---
I just went and collected the air/soil/water tapes for the daily quest and hacked the 0 skill terminal that unlocks the building doors at Tygart water treatment
---
Not sure if something change with the game.or me but since Wastelanders I get weird motion sickness if I try playing in 1st.
---
Im a bloodied build but ALWAYS go for the ores. I just hit the shower to remove rads and run in.
---
You can always catch some legendaries running in and out, I dont know why other people dont.
---
I LOVE the sound of the .50 cal, but can't justfy using the gun since the lever is superior in recoil, reload and time between shots, for the same damage.
---
Since he picked the locks on OP's harvesters he will have definitely had a wanted level :)
---
Who's graham?
---
Spend your material wisely, skrub. Mein gott. :)
---
Do you still get bounties for picking locks of other players?
---
Nice!
---
yes you can Ally to both.
---
You can however only complete 1 factions questline. juggle both till game tells you to choose.
---
Yeah. 80% of my deaths are from lag. 15% from poison damage. 4% from the imposter sheepsquatch. 1% from having too much fun with secret service Jetpack.
---
Has never happened to me on PC.
---
Ahhhhh....then I must keep trying. No one seems to be dropping too many nukes as of late.
---
I guess we're done here, rofl. You've lost all context. Brush up on your trolling skills - get a job, and we can do it again another time.
---
Nah. Game runs like crap, I kinda fixed it by setting presets to medium then reducing shadows, got 120 fps.
---
Especially since wastelanders, favorite wheel locks up my Xbox One X all the time.
---
I would realy like to try this out but unfortunatly the ModifiableWindowsApps folder is empty for me and the fallout76 install folder does not contain any .ini files, it does contain a project76 file but the system does not let me copy the file.
---
do you have any idea what i could do?
---
Speak for yourself I'd take this. I'd take any camp related perks as that's where I am 70 percent of my time.
---
They have to be the irradiated ones to use in Brain bombs.
---
1. Drivers are up to date. 
---
2. Might try second option, thanks!
---
3. Already at full screen and presets set to medium, got better performance, instant 100-120 fps.
---
You do! It's actually the only way to get one anymore.
---
Ok thanks. Already tried full screen and medium presets and got better performance
---
I guess we're done here rofl. You've lost 200 dollars. Brush up your financial skills- keep your job, touché. :)
---
Wow i wish i was as clever as you, how about you get off your survival tent
---
Precisely this. I run into a camp that I think is trapped or is trying to force me into something I don't appreciate I move on. To each his/her own.
---
The prevalence of dupes is why I actually don't play the game.
---
Burrows are decent. I go there if I’m in a server where people are already running xp routes.
---
Same only I found a way around it, you do have to go to west tec and get to the decontamination area witch is connected to the room with a curtain for a door. When you get here just look down and press (x for Xbox) (O for ps4) and Idk about computers.
---
Anyways where I am going with this is, when you drink that water you collected it gives you +125 rads you drink like 5 and you've gained back +625 rads. 
---
So if you come across those camps go though their decontamination shower and when your on the other side, drop one of them to show that their decontamination shower is worthless and did nothing to stop you.
---
And I'm at lvl 25.
---
Still congrats.
---
Unless you have healing factor or any other autohealing things then you dont need your rads because your still low health
---
I should have taken your advice. Just got the plans and went to make it to realise you need rank 5 makeshift warrior. FML.
---
I have no problem with the PVP aspect of it, that’s the nature of workshops. I personally would rather just see an epic gun fight at the end.  
---
But it did explain why the Level 3 locks didn’t make any difference.  Once you take control of a workshop, you take control of any locks.  So the locks don’t mean anything.
---

---
I have a bunch of points left over but i really can’t justify their use. I’d have more left over if luck could run into the negative.
---

---
You could mimic the PA approach by stitching all the pieces to an under armor piece of your choice. Similar to the PA frame. As someone who is working on getting SS armor, I'm dreading the hassle or juggling and renaming all the pieces.
---
why don‘t you roll for unyielding SS armor with WWR reduction then? all of the things you named can go together. but good luck with that RNG. 
---
that aside, i totally agree. it was a mod for fallout 4 and i miss it for 76.
---
Would be like 5 pixels
---
Same when I find someones store blocked by a decontamination shower I always drop like 1-5 toxic goo to show those people that it does nothing to those of us who are smart
---
killing 9 creatures in nw isn't time consuming... it can take like 2 or 3 matches lol
---
An other reason might be: 
---
many players are OP. Most of us put in the effort not to insta-kill legendaries and don't mind that. We can shoot the nearby ground or the legs.
---
However ALWAYS holding back is a step too far for me. I grinded and traded for months to get my OP gear. So in between the bigger events I go about my business alone. If I would join every simple event, low level team mates/players would be complaining about not getting the kills. You simply do not want me there. In my eyes, I'm doing others a favor.
---
Allowed?
---
None.
---
But people use them anyway.
---
Unfortunately, there’s a number of issues that arise with this.  It would be neat, but unless they can find a way to prevent people from spoofing in real world photos into the game, as well as dealing with the resolution of the photos and compressing them down to a smaller size and still be visible, I don’t think we’ll ever see this as an option.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who loves the lore and small details of games/TV shows (TWD/AoS)
---
3star legendary shovel!!!
---
Just killing a shitload of monsters. Also lunchbox buffs are a godsend.
---
That’s where my camp is too except up on cliffs on the lakebed’s southeastern edge between Riverside and Summerville. Wouldn’t rifle through someone’s camp including breaking into shit though.
---
I think you're overestimating how hard it is to grind exp, especially with unyielding gear + a lever action that one shots all mobs without having to sneak. I did this while still working, lol.
---
I messed up my special early in the game 🤣🤣 I have like 13 strength 6 charisma and 2 or 3 of everything else 😭
---
I never go anywhere without my Junkie's swing speed shovel.
---
I literally did most of this while at "work". My job is a cakewalk right now.
---
10 weeks is 70 days not 100
---
Well said... same for me.
---
Have you gotten the dark matter skin for the combat rifle. Does it go on the fixer?
---
I’m at level 32 so I’m doing ok, should make it up during double xp and double daily weekends
---
I would do the same only I would go further, I would lose a nuke card...
---
True but my tip was more for the Everyman. Most players have the ammo Convertor including people who have started new after Gamepass. 
---
Sadly not everyone has access to a Nuclear Bunker.
---
Yes, it does take a lot of time but tedium is subjective. I've spent a lot of time on trading before all this. Killing all these mobs gives me a chance to use all my toys finally :D
---
True. NW challenges are easy and i'm overseer rank 11 lol. The one that took me the most time was "play for 30 minutes"
---
Someone actually got to use the artillery finally
---
If there was a magic player vendor who sold ultracite, would would be the most frequent ammo needed by the community so this magic vendor could stock it? 
---
I've made my caps selling normal 5.56 but am starting to get excess flux. Considered dealing in ultracite rounds but wanted to focus on something that'll move fast.
---
Most buffs are based on your base yes. But using lunchboxes while already working hard on the grind would be resourceful.
---
Awesome, glad I was able to help someone!
---
This page explains farming and respawning.  Basically, farm 180 world items for the older items to drop of the rolling list, and they will respawn.  For containers, it is 60 items.  Check the "How to Loot" section on that page, for the basics.
---
 [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) 
---
I do a LOT of looting, because gathering and crafting are usually favorite parts of these games for me.  If I do a full loot run through Flatwoods, grabbing every little thing that is not nailed down, and checking every container, including mailboxes, it normally resets any other area I have cleared out before.  Plus, you don't have to spend much time fighting anything in Flatwoods, so it is a quick and relaxing loot run.  Tyler County Fairgrounds is also a good spot for clearing world items, with all of the paper trays and cups all around the ground, plus there is one booth with about 30 glass bottles on it, which clears about 30 items off your rotating world items list in only 2 or 3 seconds.
---
9 dailies until july 21 i think. And in other weeks. But not everyday until the season ends
---
Great to hear, keep it up!
---
Ok I recently had time to do this, and I went in there to find that there was no PA there. I'm currently relogging since maybe someone took that PA in that server, I'll get back in a moment.
---
No, I'm on PC, sorry.
---
Yea that’s up to an hour for 1 challenge. That is time consuming.
---
Check out my first post and the replies I made in that thread, should give you all the info you need.
---
It can with a fallout first tent, but I've never been able to get it to work consistently.
---
As fun as this would be, it would have to be only visible for the player.
---
Hey slightly off topic but you can place random items you find like that on shelves? How is this done?? I had no idea and I’m like 80 hours in lol
---
Ionized meat.
---
My character lives off this and inert flux
---
You do realize that it deters people from spending caps at your vendors, right? That seems silly to me.
---
I have two vendors on my deck and one inside the house behind a decontamination shower where I sell only Bloodied weapons.
---
TLDR
---
a list on the map with running events -daily &amp; random- would be nice too. so you dont have to fiddle around the map every time to look for events.
---
edit: u/nukejockey had mentioned this before, didnt see it...
---
As a bloody build I agree with you. Most of the time I can find my way around it anyway.
---
Letting a lil girl playing fps games is what i call great parenting...
---
On PC it is adjustable in an ini file
---
Yes I have, and no it doesn't unfortunately.
---
If you are on PC you can through editing ini file.
---
It’s a key feature of any spatial mapping system like ArcGIS to explode out details around a point and present them in a contextual fashion
---
Wow, witty comeback. And you not even finishing high school and all
---
Yeah I really don't want some 9 year old yelling GeT GoOD KiD, while obviously being killed multiple times. Or YoUR TrAsH, or GeT No ScOpeD. The moment that happens I will nuke their camp, then I eather make them leave or I make them waste resources in the end I win. If they stay on the game when they get to the edge of the nuke zone I'll turn on my mic and just say *get good kid*
---
Thanks! I was kinda getting sick of old man mose!
---
Where'd my 200 go? Did you steal it, to try to buy a shitty Deluxe edition of a game? Wouldn't likely notice an hour or two worth of salary missing. Probably better spent on food.
---
Desperation of the poor, I suppose. Sounds like you needed it more than me.
---
sentence not right but me not know how
---
Yeah my point exactly
---
Yeah radstag corpses have a habit of disappearing very quick post patch 18/19. It’s not you, it’s an unintended feature.
---
It's a common thing with games created by the shitty Creation Engine. Stuff fall though the ground.
---
Yes the right request coppers don’t matter this takes priority!
---
I empathize with this. I'm bloodied melee, so I have to wait until everyone else tags the target. Sometimes I don't even bother because I don't need another legendary taking up space. That's all my stash is these days, legendaries waiting to be turned into scrip.
---
it doesn't even take that long; you can generally find 9 or 12 ai in one match if you can live long enough to find them/know where a lot spawn in an area. and a good match is maybe 20 mins long
---
Also if you kept backups before previous updates you can revert to any of the animated backgrounds since launch :)
---
Which AAA game?
---
Generals steakhouse right next to the front door. Also Abbys bunker has one...
---
No one is whining. The point of the post is that you are losing out on caps since you cut out a portion of shoppers. Some players don't even realize bloody builds exist. When I message players and ask if they can turn it off so I can shop, they have always been happy to, and they get caps. Positive interactions all around. Now you on the other hand.... Show me on the doll where the bloody builds hurt you...
---
With the only choices being which faction you want to grind the most on and which sidekick you want to annoy visitors to your camp.
---
Sounds like a lot of fun, my ign is the same!
---
U can buy it bulk at WSS...
---
Get a mining helmet and mod it with a bright light. You’ll never use the pip boy light again, and you’ll actually be able to see in the dark - so much better.
---
Aye. Good idea. I usually make them a modded pipe pistol and a melee weapon of some kind.
---
yes they do
---
It does almost exactly the same damage as a power fist.  I think maybe 10 less, which is nothing.  The advantage to rolling a few gauntlets is that you could and most likely would get better secondary effects than you have on your existing DCG/Power Fist. 
---
The power fist has one advantage though because you can mod it for puncturing, which adds some degree of armor penetration.
---
Wow that’s an enormous bummer
---
right? i'm nearly lvl200 so maybe it's different for me. one i struggle w is the revives, esp if i'm not playing w friends but randoms - harder to get revives that way. that's the only more "difficult" one for me imo, rest are easy peasy
---
“______ liked that”
---
Yeah, for some reason they don't let you put any skins on the fixer.
---
You don't have to :) I just want to spend my caps at your machines.
---
Poopoop poopoop poopoop poop poopoop 💩
---
Sometimes it's missing but it is a static spawn for it. When you do get one only transfer out the bits you need rather than moving/taking the frame. That way you should be able to server hop and it will still refresh.
---
Sweet man I add u and hop on over
---
Everyone feel free to pm me ur ign or post it here if u want to play or check it out
---
Once I got it, this was my go-to sneak weapon in FO3. Extremely satisfying to use and packed a punch!
---
Right up until the sixth ghoul charges you and things get a little exciting...🤣
---
They’re just way more boring and the definition of repetitive
---
Ok I just wanna confirm this, but I'm camped near Gorge Junkyard and I've been pranking nearby lowbies by launching artillery at their camps in passive mode. I'm not *actually* fucking their shit up am I? I've been laughing my ass off thinking it's harmless but I just wanna make sure.
---
Just cripple the legs of the ghouls with a shotgun, grab some ore, make sure the npcs dont kill the ghouls and complete the event if you really are there for just completing it
---
That would be awesome!!!
---
No, Bethesda are fully aware of the mods which is why they insist on checking the .INI files once per launch and only disallows them in Nuclear Winter
---

---
Yes I found it now, already had the helmet, got the torso and arms, and also didn't take the frame like you said. 5 out of 6 servers gave me nothing. Thanks for the help!
---
I’ll hold my breath on actual new players. Even on game pass and no one at work noticed or cared.
---
Honestly, coming from Sea of Thieves and Red Dead Online, I expected this community to be just as toxic but I have never had a single bad apple ruin my day in-game. I've never been shot at and never had to shoot anyone (so I have no idea if PvP is even enabled in-game lmao).
---
I haven't played FO76 due to burnout but I will always remember how awesome this community is.
---
I feel you. Came back after a break late last week; rank 10 checking in
---
You have to log back into Adventure after NW. But, it's only the Adv XP you earn in the mode. Meaning you have to actually kill things to get it.
---
Because it is always the same people that sacrifice themselves to collect the ore and get jack shit for it in return.
---
I've found that if you come back to the spot in a few minutes, there will be a lootable meat pile where the corpse should have been.  This is true with all corpses that fall through the map.
---
Thanks for the heads up.  
---
Lvl 30
---
Maybe i'll actually do some NW quests.
---
I don't know... You seem pretty certain, darling.
---
Yep can confirm it works
---
The Adv xp you get in NW from killing AI/PC's in game counts. You'll see it if you log back into Adv anfter NW.
---
Edit: The overseer XP does not count towards it. Makes run&amp;gun more rewarding than stealth&amp;hide.
---
Ummmm...if you read the TOS third-party mods are not allowed.
---
I used to be one of those in the 2000's (I was in my late childhood/early teens gimme a break haha). The fun in it was that in real life, everyone was nice so it was refreshing to be the bad guy for once.
---
Nowdays everyone around me is an a-hole so I love making people's day in video games.
---
because of unyielding yes, it is. your agi is so high npcs can't see you. Bloody is this games easymode.
---
Ey dry lake camp gang!
---
I can't place mine without it blowing up a few minutes after it being placed. Its a really odd glitch lol.
---
Is "neither!" And option? 🤔  
---
Take the Grocer's or Chemist's mod that you buy with gold bullion. Reduce weight (of food or chems, respectively) by 90%!
---
Ouch. It would have been cool to go but im on ps4 haha. Do the games work?
---
Pretty sure these are 20 hour timers, or less. It starts from when you first sell something to the vendor or turn in bullion.
---
Smiley is a different beast. Buy from him between Sat @ 8pm est and Sunday @ 8pm est or he tends to bug out.
---
Traveling Super Mutant merchant, and host of Meat Week.
---
That. Save yourself some perk points
---
I mean if they have passive mode turned on they can't be killed unless they engage in pvp themselves.  The game tells them that directly.
---
the double xp weekend bonus is its own multiplier, so the lunchbox bonus will also be doubled on double xp weekend
---
so very basic calc (ignoring INT etc.): 1) no weekend / no lunchbox: 100 XP, 2) weekend / no lunchbox: 200 XP, 3) no weekend / lunchbox: 200 XP, 4) weekend / lunchbox: 400 XP
---
Yeah, happens to me too. Items take a few seconds to show up. Quite annoying.
---
I find that I get at least half of my caps per day from cooked meat. I have Butcher's Bounty on almost all the time so I'm constantly getting tons of meat. I also have Green Thumb on. Blueberries, Tatos, and Mutfruit are two caps each with my 4 charisma and 3\* Hard Bargain. It probably helps that my camp is in a place surrounded by blueberries but that all adds up. Over a play period without really searching I get like 50-60 of them, which is an extra 100-120 caps. I also tag junk that can sell without being bundled together. That also adds up quick. It's all just a bunch of small things that add up to 1400 by the end of a play period.
---
I actually really hope it's a new feature haha. A big kick in the nads to the RMTs
---
You're absolutely wrong.  Our group has killed hundreds.
---
The Rumble is the best event in the game right now. It's fun and is a good place to get XP, various junk, and legendaries(although maybe only 20% are max level). I think the most I've come out with is 6 legendaries and usually 3-4 so I can't think of any other event where you're very likely to get that. I'm almost always playing with friends on a team, and this event is a 4/4 scavenger breeze even with only 3 of us. My tips:
---
1. Do. Your. Job. If you are defending a side, stay on that side. If you're running, then just run, especially if you have to tag out a defender later. The way to fail this event or not get to max reward level is to have a lack of coordination and communication.
---
2. Defend with your back up against the platform. The closer you are to the middle, the more likely you will be in range when your teammate kills something on the other side so you'll get extra legendaries and scrap. You'll see everything coming at you. If you are at the intersection of the tunnels you can't look down them both at the same time and you will let something by behind you or spend half your time spinning around. If you are moving back and forth between the two sides you will let something through.
---
3. Keep the turrets repaired because the ghouls focus on those.
---
4. Communication helps a lot: all the defenders don't need to pull off if something starts beating on the scavengers on the side.
---
5. If you don't think you can deal with the addition of floaters, deathclaws and snallys, then hold your ore til near the end. Farming the ghouls is a tiny bit easier than dealing with 3-4 deathclaws plus ghouls at the same time.
---
6. As a defender, if you aren't one-shotting the ghouls, it's better to tag each of them so they focus on you instead of the scavengers. 
---
7. Level 3 Blocker perk + Rad-X:Diluted and a Glowing Blood Pack make dealing with the ghouls beating on you a breeze.
---
8. Like Encryptid, if you aren't on a coordinated team, wait for other people to show up before you kick the event off.
---
300 meters, last I checked
---
We've all seen where they take 1 shot every few seconds for literal minutes to coach them into shooting back, or standing in their way then they fire
---
I figure they don't want caps, and that's fine by me. I didn't really want to scroll through their 600 mounted head plans anyway.
---
Hmm mine hasn't done that in a while I was hoping they fixed it 😔
---
I really don't think so
---
Yes working on the casino tour rn actually
---
Will be done in maybe a hour?
---
right now I found a vendor with tons of weapons/armors and was waiting like 5 minutes, still nothing was displayed  
---
Agree, sometimes you have to wait, but still sometimes it just don't work
---
Server lag is bad at the moment, for me anyway, example would be terminals take ages to load or just don't load at all.
---
As we have the challenge now up two weeks in the row and also the news on the season mentions that you get SCORE by earning XP I expect that the 10k XP challenge will be up the whole season.
---
lightwood laminate*
---
Where did u get that info? The last xp weekend the buff said «increases xp by 100%»
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they would actually have to add a "character" into the game, whether it's another add on or a faux secondary profile. I just don't see how this engine would do it without just creating a entity even if it's only the inventory, maybe a "mail box" skin. So everybody would have 2 "characters" in the session, doubling the size, breaking the game. 
---
Yes, I know many games do it, I've played many with the feature. Those aren't Fallout 76.
---
I use the reduced weight chem one. Really makes a difference, but that or the grocer one (especially now I'm XP/stat maxing using carnivore and SB meat so carrying a lot all the time) is perfect. 
---
I only JUST got the tokens for the high capacity mod, but honestly the space it creates will just be taken back up with the extra weight added from what I'm saving with the other mod, so it's really no better.
---
I'm hoping for the Vertibird PA skin, but it could be anything.
---
Honestly saying, I'm facing this issue for weeks
---
I don’t usually go after toxic people because they feed off of that. I just do my part to take care of newer players/low levels. The same has happened to me as well, still does when I start a new character for levels
---
So basically you are saying you want to keep cheating to try to jeopardize cheaters? It makes no sense to me really.
---
Damn, I’m sorry. I guess it’s a popular one.
---
Yeah I'm not saying what they're doing is right, but just don't fire back. Simple, really.
---
That one is probably the most time consuming for a lot of people. However, it can be done entirely AFK.
---
Spawn centerish map to lower chances of the first circle or two murdering you. Find a bush. Assume the Bush Wookie position.  Do some housework/read/etc and check to see if you're dead every few minutes.
---
A **legacy** ironic unique weapon.  What a find!
---
Do the daily challenges and collect the rewards you earn.
---
Exactly what I do
---
Rad rumble is toxic public. I’ll do it all day private with friends. But people take hack weapons and all they do is farm kills. Nothing else.
---
one very important tip for the rest of your time in appalachia:
---
Many events have a **'startup timer'** to actually start the event. You usually have a little less than 10 minutes to do a certain action that starts the event.
---
=&gt; on difficult events/events that you find difficult, it is important to **wait out this timer a bit so other people can join** and therefore make the event easier.
---
\* only exception is 'One Violent Night' that is currently bugged, there the startup timer IS the event timer (and the event timer is useless and should be disregarded).\*
---
Neither is item duping, but we all know how quick Bethesda reacts to *that.*
---
There are perks that increase carry weight/decrease item weight, armor mods that will help, and calibrated shocks for PA add 50lbs each.  Fix your carry weight problem and start selling everything that isn't nailed down.
---
Source? More info is always good and info for this game is lacking.
---
Would you mind doing so for me sir?
---
Ive been around awhile. Had a lot of great gear that I worked hard for. And I really don't care that others now have it. The more the merrier imo. The rng in this game is pretty harsh and I personally find it more enjoyable with great gear. I know many others don't share my opinions and that's perfectly fine
---
And yeah, it's the much lesser of two evils to me. One is greed, the other is generosity
---
I think they were designed with the assumption that players would do one or two at a time, then move on to other things and come back later. That was a silly assumption, but it feels that way.
---
Datamines aren't specific other than what patch they are part of. There's stuff that was mined months ago that has only recently been released and loads that still hasn't surfaced.
---
Sweet
---
Hey, he asked a question. I gave the correct answer. 
---
People use mods on PC but by the TOS, they aren’t allowed.
---
That’s a fact.
---
Beth doesn't care if you use mods
---
Mine has a on and off lever
---
Word to the wise, if you are intent on doing NW challenges every day, you may want to leave the mods alone. I get locked out of NW automatically for modified game files, and all I use is perk load out manager. 
---
Because space is not an issue on my HDD, I reinstalled the Beth launcher version of 76 as "vanilla" so I could do nw challenges and then use my steam game to mod. 
---
I mean it makes 76 like 150+ gb but if you have space for it and care about those daily and weekly SCORE from nw, I've found it just works.
---
I know, for that many hours I want to be an NPC in Fallout 5
---
Yeah, that's my favourite joke in the whole franchise.
---
Same here. Plus, just in case someone forgets to switch it off, it's far enough away from my vendors that a Bloodied build would have to go out of their way to get hit by the shower on their way to my vendors.
---
I like that idea. I always give gifts to player under lvl 30/40 mostly aids or sometimes some nice low level legendarys I get from events. But to have pre made bundles would make that job way easier!
---
You ever need any help or company out in the wastes and we happen to be on at the same time, I'd be happy to follow you around. Mind you, my main is level 106 and although I try not to one-shot everything... That said, I tend to hold off on shooting unless my teammate is either being overrun or has at least gotten one hit in. Also do crafting and modding services of certain weapons, charging material costs, but occasionally free for low levels depending on how many screws I have. And always happy to throw a couple Stimpaks your way. IGN Witchgod.
---
Well imo your attitude is the problem with radiation rumble :p
---
Hopefully it gets sorted out real soon 😳 damn.
---
Also, may I ask how you have a little "raiders" thingy next to your name?
---
it's such a ridiculously underwhelming reward for an incredible achievement, that it feels intentional; like it's a joke of sorts.
---
The railway rifle gives back a lot of spikes and only takes steel to make them.
---
That's so sweet!
---
Duplication of in game items is making people a lot of real money selling on those certain places, I often wonder if some of those people are kind of 'in house' if you get my drift?
---
No I have have full blown video of me running over to the wolf, pointing handmade and unloading on it and Nothing. I have zero issues with Riding shotgun.
---
Indeed so, but it's definitely not quiet.
---
I'm level 749 and I can get my INT up to 64. So... I'm the source. If I take a Berry Mentats now, I only get a small amount of XP difference, as opposed to when I play on an alt with lower INT and take a Berry Mentats and get a larger difference of XP.
---
Not all low levels know this though, I garentee if you go around the world you could easily trick a low level into shooting you
---
Wish I knew where the plans spawned for it
---
It's just the latest FOTW meta.
---
The recoil is horrid, but you can get it to almost 0 AP cost. 
---
I prefer subs and handmades personally, for the dmg and recoil, but I don't use vats that often, and don't sneak.
---
Please, you say woman but you know you want that red rocket garage.

Nearly a full year of your life for like a dollar. So great

How the hell are you selling radaway?  That is literally falling off of every shelf and out of every corpse in appalachia.  People actually buy it?
---
Make sure to do each of three quests before choosing who you side with. They're 500 reputation each. Not a good idea to ignore it
---
Oh it’s beautiful!

On the right sidebar click "Community options" and then on pencil right near "user flair preview" and select whatever you need/like and apply :)  
---
And don't forget to check "**Show my user flair on this community** "
---
Just use a mod manager. There's one that lets you press a button for 'NW mode' which disables your mods for you.
---
Two installs of Fo76 to get around the problem is *insane.*
---
Pretty sure it's like 20 cents haha
---
'PLACACHIA!

Or is it?

Ah. Back to the drawing board then.

i feel its not meant to be an actual goal, just a way of tracking your in-gane hours
---
Make or join a public team at your discretion. Sometimes you have a team that sticks around for hours, sometimes you don’t. 
---
At the start of my session, I will either join an existing Builders Public team or make one. If folks done join within the next 10 minutes or so, I’ll join any ol’ team to ensure I get my inspiration buff.
---
Tbh I doubt they did it on purpose, it’s likely for their own convenience but didn’t realize some builds need certain rads.
---
with all the hackers on pc? no
---
If these high level players are using the game's built in mechanics (no cheats or exploits), they are doing nothing wrong, equally if you choose to bring down retribution on them using the same game systems more power to you, being a wasteland cop is a valid RP choice.
---
IMO
---
Definitely don't want this. They grossly over value arrows and cross bow bolts. I'd much rather get 30 .45 and trade that for 30 arrows.
---
I already farmed last XP weekend using all available INT and XP buffs and leveled 120 levels only that weekend. I did some calcs back then and it was its own multiplier.
---
What the fuck are you arguing here? That you are not going to share a card cuz you don't have to? I really don't get you contrarians, for you this is just a room for an argument. It is courteous to share cards, it is discourteous not to (if you are able). Discourteous people get kicked. You have a right to be a douchebag, but not an obligation.
---
My assumption is, based on the fact the most recent one uses how the system saves the NPC Vendor data and the character data through a UI exploit, that simply changing the UI isn’t that easy of a hot fix, likely would break a number of other things.
---
The natural thing to do here would be to reverse it so that it would apply to us. It's basically a shower designed to remove radiation so you would need to figure out what the analogue for humans would be.
---
I've seen that happen a few times as well, but wasn't the case here unfortunately.  In the 10 or so minutes it took to make this post (had to do it twice, automod said there were too many ellipses in the title..?!) no meat piles could be seen.
---
Well if ur right i couldnt be more happy👍
---
What is WSS? I know you can buy stuff but I don’t really want to pay for mats. Don’t people normally just pick them up?
---
Keeping the Wasteland clean since 2077...
---
I've tried all the tricks and fixes on my home network and no change really, it's all pretty random and variable. I'm guessing just plain old server lag or the internet is suffering from the effects of a world pandemic.
---
There are plans for switches? I need this. 
---
New to the game. 
---
I do have a decontam outside my building. All vendors are outside on a sep level. Still have had people bitch and not explain why they were so angry. Now I know. 
---
Still don’t know why they HAD to use that ONE door into my “house” when there are other with no decontamination rings.
---
Avoid toxic players at all times. You can’t fix bad behavior in a game that allows it nor should you.
---
yes pretty much haha, getting 250 score for chewing gum or something else that can be done in minutes then suddenly asked to get 10k xp for just 100 score ain't doing it for me
---
The issue is, there's no way to catch up if you miss days. Which is bullshit. Every other BP I've seen is progressive, and you can pick up where you left off.
---
But not BGS. They keep trying to lash people to a daily required grind, and F those of us who can't.

Huh so NMM? I used nexus for stuff like fo4, but found it more intuitive to manually install stuff for 76. Let me know what you use, i'd appreciate it.
---
Also, no lie, I only want to do all that so I can REdownload the beth launcher version and get access to the pts. 
---
I have 2tb storage, not really sweating my insanity (yet)
---
The chem weight one is the best for me. It can easily save 100 pounds of your backpack
---
CANT Wait 😝
---
there arent 10 days in a week
---
Sorry i mustve not been clear, vendor bots not other players, usually all my chems and excess water clear the bots 1500 caps out each day.
---
.45 and 5.56 rounds at 1 cap each are usually a hot item from my camp in the mire. Anything i sell to players is dirt cheap and never far off the 30k limit with a 1000 rounds of most ammo types waiting to go.
---
You do realize that people are duping to sell on RMT sites right?  Not all dupers are Santa Claus running around the watseland handing out presents.   Did it crash their market?  Kind of but if you have 10x the supply then a 10x price drop doesn't really affect your business.  If anything it makes it better.  I don't think this is hurting RMT people in the way you think..  Cheating is cheating and it is wrong.
---
Maybe but I think it’s less likely that they would risk their sales just to mess with a few people. I mean it takes only a couple of gamma rounds to get all the rads, the camp owners really don’t gain anything. Non bloodied builds with a good weapon can one shot those poor mole managers as well so there’s not much difference. Bloodied only makes a difference in boss fights.
---
It's the "free upgrades" and taking decent stuff from low levels that gets me
---
I had picked up like, a pepper mill or something on the way, and that’s all I could find
---
Ahhh, dude. You're the best!,😎👌🏻thanks a million!!
---
It's the offering free upgrades and taking decent weapons and crushing moral that gets me
---
'Fallout 76 Quick Configuration' available on the Nexus is what I specifically use.
---
I can litterally stand in front of the sbq with my vamp mini gun and take all she can dish out no problem
---
No you just have to find it manually, because if I recall it doesn't show you the skull or the marker anymore. But I've definitely found mine after a couple deaths when I've forgot to re-equip serendipity and died stupidly :D
---
OMG this gets posted weekly. It's just a way to check how many hours you've played.
---
Yes, this is the big thing. You dont have to slog down there again until you have all six pieces built despite what the quest marker says.
---
not just for rep but for rewards. if you dont do the settler's quests, yoy don't get the free chinese stealth suit and will have to buy it later with bullion.
---
Yep - twice today
---
Bethesda's 'member'? I mean, buy a player dinner first.
---
Thanks mate
---
Jesus man, the kid was supervised and making a collection of teddy bears. If he was letting his kid run around with a knife cannibalizing ghouls; then I could see your point.
---
As someone who's level 334, wouldn't you be annoyed if someone took your best legendary?
---
True!
---
Why would you have 3 hours of junk on you though? There are camps and red rocket stations all over to stash your stuff. 
---
And as for your question i don't actually know.
---
It’s probably bugged just like ‘kill tough creatures’.
---
If it was around for a long period of time it would very much so hurt the rmt market. Look at borderlands 3 there is a very easy dupe and there are serval subs set up to just give people gear. If this dupe sticks around it would be much more likely for people to be giving gear out.
---
gotcha. thx
---
So you just came here to criticise?
---
No if you die again your stuff is still there but the marker will be on your new death if you had any junk on you
---
Or perk set swaps... like... come on... how long has this game been out? I know it's 'in the future', but... come on...
---
It’s a great event, and super valuable for XP. That part can be frustrating, as nobody want to give up kills to go get ore and actually finish the event. 
---
The key is this: 
---
It only takes 25 ore to get credit for the event. Maybe not the best rewards, but it’ll complete and you’ll still get 4 Treasury Notes. 
---
No single player should collect more than 25 ore. Go get 25, then go get kills. If anyone there wants better rewards, they can contribute too.
---
No seriously, I know people who dislike bloody builds and have told me they intentionally do it to screw with them.  Maybe not all players do it for this reason, but some definitely do.
---
With all the crappy console controller people moving like robots in pvp and getting dominated, while ruining teams with people on keyboard/mouse. No.
---
This is a good idea. I'm level 16 playing on PC.
---
How the heck do you lock terminals like the Amco or Scavenger bot? I rarely have ANYthing in there because people keep coming through and cleaning me out.
---
Correct. But you are you saying that?
---
I agree.  I bought that set, thinking the signs could just be "flipped over", like in the vault.  I had no idea they were just two separate regular signs.
---
Thats why i recommended doing invisible ties as rep is a pain to grind and the plans are RIDICULOUSLY expensive
---
They can smell the fear and the 295/285 carry weight....
---
Aaaaaaa it’s like in the middle of nowhere,  maybe it’s not worth looking around for an hour haha
---
Big issue in the last 2 days on PS4.  OP is correct, you have to fast travel far away or you get stuck in a loop.  Dieing really does suck.
---
Yes... Where does it say I said it was?
---
Yeah but it's not going to stick around.  It may take another week or until next patch but they always get patched or temporarily patched.  It's going to be fixed eventually here so it'll be around just long enough to fuck things up.  It's going to be better for RMT sellers because now their product is much more accessible.  I bet they sell 10x more BE gatling plasmas at $10 per weapon than they did at $110 per weapon.  Sure, you have to sell more now to make the same amount of money but your customer base just grew exponentially due to the price drop.
---
Thanks! Helpful answer
---
Despite the issues with this game sometimes, really what keeps me hooked is the fantastic community. Thanks for sharing this story :)
---
No explosive. It's already got an explosive effect as standard. Everything else is fair game.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/221/ is easy and one click enabling of NW mode.
---
Look on ebay or another special site, some "vendor" sell hacked weapons / legacy. they have 9.999.999 quantity of each weapon.
---
All of that is not due to the dupe, it's generated with software (the weapon and the quantity).
---
For once, everybody can have profit, not only hackers, everybody.
---
(and hackers aren't banned, i can see actually someone selling 9.999.999x any legacy BE15r, and he have sold this for months)...
---
Nope.
---
When I didn’t know anyone on 76, I made my first friends playing NW with a mic. Also made some buddies by posting on here. Just keep trying and you’ll soon have a little group you play with :)
---
"100 days, 10 weeks"
---
your exact words.
---
You have to use conduits and floor mats you use the shelves in the "shelves" tab but there were some Atomic shop displays that look like shelves but sadly it's not in anymore
---
Wouldn't that imply that if you are not irradiated, you can't shop there?
---
20 not enough..... Most guns weight more.. A sledge/fatman/missle launcher about 50
---
Save the gum from your perk card packs.
---
Charleston Capitol, WesTek, pretty much anywhere.  Enemies will generally scale for you.  Look for other players active at events and join their group.  Try to tag enemies higher level players are killing.  
---
Some higher level players don’t like leaches.  Others don’t mind at all.  You just have to keep trying until you find a group that matches your needs.  
---
At level 25, the story quests generally have a level up built into them.  So that’s a good grind as well.  Working your way through Wastelanders Vault Raid isn’t a bad idea.

100 ranks, 10 weeks is what I meant
---
If I see a low level struggling near my camp, I’ll craft a quick handmade and throw them some 5.56 to go with it.
---
Cool. I've only seen experiments with up to 40ish int done.  
---
As I said, info is lacking on what works and how for this game. If it is a linear rate you'd be getting 226% xp at 64 int. If you're ever up for experimenting, kill some of the same enemy repeatedly with different int and check the differences. Not sure where best to share the results thereafter though.
---
We don't have that kind of stuff on my platform, only duping so I can't speak on that but I do know how the situation is on my platform and you can't spawn in 99999999x  of a MIRV minigun on xbox.
---
It really is a moot point.  No one should be getting "profit" off of RMT whether it be hackers or dupers.
---
Looking at my 1* UNY SS Leg piece.
---
editing your post without admiting your mistake doesn't make you any less incorrect.
---
It's how bad things have gotten; we're now getting the latest news from their junk.
---
We literally have a nuka cola manufacturing facility at our disposal. It really needs to have an adjacent workshop that can produce colas.
---
I just walk away they lost out on my caps I will just give them to someone with more consideration to my bloodied brothers and sisters
---
And I do a brotherhood rifle with 308, but that's unfortunately not the topic I mean, increasingly I've seen low levels promised things like free upgrades and their weapons taken, legendary included
---
I've toyed with the idea of buying some levels but I know it would be a waste of atoms.  I am rank 42 after 2 weeks.  I will easily finish within the 10 week period so going to save my atoms for all the CAMP stuff that I know I will want in the shop. 
---
The challenges are so brain-dead easy and take such little investment of time, even I, a frivolous purchaser of atoms, cannot justify buying any ranks.
---
this would only get implemented if Beth could sell you the gift wrapping and bows..
---
..but I like your idea.
---
Interesting, apparently the bloodied shoppers never mess with their camps though lol
---
You edited the post..
---
Nope. I’ll save atoms I earn for the end. But since they are going to keep two extra challenges a day, a double xp and double score weekends, I don’t see a reason to pay for me getting to the end
---
Two per gauntlet scrapped.
---
agreed with u. and i'm on pc, yeah xbox is a little bit less exploded, you don't have all hacked weapon like pc...
---
I see "100 ranks, 10 weeks".
---
Depends how many ranks I need on the second last day
---
Those players suck.
---
I try my best to balance the scales by paying it forward.
---
I'm really glad we don't have to deal with orbital strike 50 cals xD
---
because he edited it. i'm not the only one who pointed out the error, look at the comments.
---
tbh, pretending they did nothing wrong instead of owning up to the error is what bothers me.
---
Right, and if the reward were some awesome reward all it would do is encourage people to afk on the severs all day
---
Thank you so much for sharing your route.
---
This does not happen now. I’ve lost several legendaries the past week and no pile ever appears. They just melt into the ground, gone forever
---
Just dont shop at places where an asshole has an arch mounted. They are only doing it to mess with your build/mutations.
---
He replied the same thing to my comment after editing "100 days" out from his post
---
Furious FFR is cool
---
You said 2 or 3 matches. 20 minutes each is up to an hour. Even 20 minutes for 1 daily challenge is a lot compared to the other dailies.
---
I put my decon shower on the side with a rad barrel to tweek it.
---
Hahaha, true. I’m more of a 385/195 kinda guy, though. :P
---
Yes I edited.... I made a simple error, but if you used your intuition, you'd know what I meant.
---
Well played by you and your girlfriend. That's the kind of things a little kid will remember for a LONG time. Kindness is the wasteland (and real life sadly enough) can be hard to find at times.
---
Is there a cap on how much the next level will cost?
---
You can also just buy one level at the end to more than make up for it
---
I think its just 150 per rank for all ranks?  someone can correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Actually I didn't edit that part. I edited 1 word. Days to Ranks. I did not edit what you say.
---
No, it’s too soon. Why would I do it today?  
---
If I’m not going to play between now and the end of the season, then I clearly don’t care enough for the game to need the end rewards.  
---
If I’m going to be playing between now and the end of the season, if I pay for it now, all those dailies and weeklies would be wasted.  
---
Even For people who are going to whale, it doesn’t make any sense to do it until the last week to finish the rest.
---
We still have a trade menu that only allows you to "trade" by selling things for 0 caps... but people getting ripped off all the time isnt important to them apparently...
---
I'm on track to finishing it before the 10 weeks. I will use the atoms for the last ranks and only if I fail for whatever reason. If bethesda makes it harder to get to rank 100 I will not spend atoms
---
and instead of saying "oops, typo, i fixed it", you got defensive and pretended you did no wrong.
---
again, THAT is where i have an issue. not tue mistake itself, but your inability to admit wrongdoing until pressed for it.
---
Look above......
---
I'm just stashing all my atoms I earn through challenges and the season incase I need to buy ranks at the end. With what I currently have plus what's to come, I should be able to buy out the last 14-16 ranks. I'm not looking to spend real money so I'm doing challenges I never thought I'd worry about. I just want to end this ASAP so I don't have to log on every day. But I'm not opening up my wallet today. I'm at rank 31 and there's no way I'm buying that many atoms. It's just pixels.
---
Yeah it’s super dumb, I’m pretty sure is you level up with adventure mode xp in NW it doesn’t count that either.
---
I came to ask what i believe to be a fairly reasonable question. Maybe you got caught up in the adventuring which is doable. We've all been there. 
---
But you possibly losing 3 hours of junk is on you there. It wasn't one of the many bugs in the game. It was something that could have been easily avoided if you had stashed your stuff regularly. Like. Happened to me in the early days. Once.
---
That's exactly what you edited. You first said "100 days 10 weeks" and now it says "100 ranks 10 weeks". I was pointing out that 10 weeks is not 100 says but 70
---
Yea I don’t plan on doing that but we’ll see. It would make sense for an atom perspective (costs 150 but you get 500). Double score weekend should help a lot
---
Yeah, customer service is a problem area that I do wish they'd commit more resources to. I get that customer service folks mostly end up dealing with complaints, so it can be tough for them, but other companies still manage to be good to people.
---
Yes! I could buy them being concerned about something like that being OP if we didn't have workshops that can make bullets or fusion cores, but we *do*. Unfortunately, though, they tied the plant to a main quest; I doubt it'll ever be included in an update because the workshop being claimed could interfere with people running the quest. :(
---
It helps to have someone do the code and you already be in the house. The code didn’t work when I got it then fast travelled but did work when I had someone reset it at the computer while I was at the keypad. 
---
Also, if you find someone with the key, you can loot that room without needing to go through that hassle. You just miss out on being able to open that dome when ever you want. 
---
If you don’t find someone by 6 pm EST today, comment here again and I’ll open it for you or help you with the passcode.
---
no no i meant each rank - every time you level it costs more and more.  is there a cap to that cost or will the final level be like 6,000 SCORE points?
---
Definitely not today. I might buy some levels in the last week if I'm near a reward I like the look of, but with the way the score-per-level increases it seems sensible to me to buy levels as late as possible. If nothing else, buying levels before the double XP and double score events seems especially daft.
---
OHHHHHHHHHH okay my bad i misunderstood.  I'm honestly not sure on that.
---
Why would I? I do plan on playing over the next 8 weeks. Even if I didn’t grind challenges I would no doubt earn at least some score.
---
sometimes.. and for various reasons.. people need to learn lessons the hard way..
---
Gotcha.
---
Join a building team if you're just wandering around killing enemies for the INT bonus (XP bonus)
---
You cannot have the two at the same time
---
It’s still there. 
---
But seriously... stash your loot more frequently.
---
No. You get 1 slot for a mod.
---
Anyone buying levels now is silly. At least wait until the last week (assuming you don't hit 100 before then) 
---
I have 5500 atoms sitting there and i have no intention of buying any levels. Even if somehow i don't get to the end.
---
My point is though, it tells you about passive mode right on the screen in plain text.  So all players should know about it.
---
Yes 3rd is 15% critical fill
---
do they all stack?  Still working on a 100% XP bonus from I assume 2 lunchboxes....could it go higher?
---
How do you even fire the artillery? I think I’ve placed it once. It may have a little terminal attached to it or some option if you get close enough but I’ve never noticed
---
I regularly bomb peoples camp with my artillery, its never done any damage. I had figured it was turned off.
---
Unless you have to be wanted in order for it to do dmg to a camp?
---
I just do it for shits and giggles, its loud and shakes their camera, but otherwise harmless.
---
I have passive turned off, still no dmg.
---
pretty sure that if someone had a camp near mine, i would build artillery and regular bombard it regardless.  its the wasteland and you need to practice better social distancing buddy.  i have pvp off anyway so itd just be an annoyance right.
---
Yes there are. Basic on and off switch like in FO4. 
---
Hahaha and yea we use the one door with the DECON showers because it's the obvious choice. 😜
---
With that weapon, you really should go for any of the magic effects. Those include instigating, junkies, bashing, improved vats, or limb damage. Any of those effects cause the damage to be incredibly high in VATS
---
OP was referring to the general 1st shot miss vats bug. No it hasnt been fixed. It just seems to be intermittent. Magic effect shotties are a whole different issue.
---
No, you cannot have both the Emergency Protocols and a Jetpack on the same Power Armor Torso. Power Armor is limited to only 1 Mod and 1 Paint Job.
---
White spring station
---
crazy, when did they make it so people force you to go into their camp?
---
If we got this in 2020 I'd be shocked.  I think this will be something they work on for 2021.
---
Go into build mode and look at what you want to lock.  There is an option to build a lock at the bottom of the screen.  On Xbox it is one of the left shoulder buttons, trigger I think.  Then just pick a lock level.
---
"Legit"... Yeaaaa...
---
Google it. Mods get touchy about discussing exploits.
---
Nobody knows. Doubtful in the near future though.
---
Mostly great suggestions, with one observation:
---
A RadX syringe could/would massively be used for griefing. 
---
"No mutations for you!"
---
I go into Black Water Mine, kill the mole miners for their weapons and glowing meat. It doesn't matter if you get encumbered, you can limp down to the White Springs train station right outside.
---
The same way you lock everything else, in build mode. Just make sure to lock both the terminals and the hoppers on collectrons and ammo machines. 
---
I once found this camp on PC where he had very high walls to his brick house. I thought it was kinda odd so I used Marsupial and my jetpack to fly up to his roof. Except there was no roof and now I was inside his house. He left his ammo machine unlocked. It was fully stocked with 333 rounds of .45. That is the limit that ammo type caps out at after 4 hours. I took it all lol. If it's unlocked, it's free as it's part of the game to loot and steal. You gotta lock up your stuff. I lock my water farm as it's part of my daily 1400 cap income.
---
I would've done it for you but I'm on Xbone.
---
True, didn't realize it. Good point!
---
The highest level legit player I know of is the twitch streamer Alrex who I believe is 2100+ now.
---
I've heard (but not got around to testing yet) that the bloatfly syringer is useful for farming high radiation fluids.
---
WTB 500 Leader bobbleheads legit
---
Easy mode is bloodied with B2525 fixer automatic, unyeilding set and VATs to head. Easy peezee lemon squeezeee
---
Yes sir...on Xbox while in build mode, LT will bring up the lock level options
---
When I first started and used a two handed melee build with 15 strength those mods helped but now I only use 9 strength for heavy weapons which I do swap out for perks like pack rat and study frame when push comes to shove but it's only ever a 30ish pound difference which helps out a bit but my build is just a lot of agility, perception and luck so strength isn't exactly my strong suit to put it absolutely hilariously.
---
If only I could sell inert flux,purified waters ugly cousin
---
It's cool you made a valid point that silos have plenty of Terminals.
---
Gotcha - from some other comments there’s an option to lock somewhere in build mode. Ashamed to say I’m a level 97 and didn’t know how to do this.
---
I've rolled two 3* uny chest pieces that were really good except I don't run bloodied. I'm trying to get a full Vanguard set. I really wish we could trade or sell these to others who know the plans. Right to the scrip bin it goes!
---
Gamer tag checks out
---
I'll be sure to give it ago
---
Random number of stars, random modifiers. But a guaranteed usage of one legendary module per turn wether you like it or not
---
I love this story! Reminds me of when I let my 5 yr old son play for the first time. He met a another young boy couldnt be no more than 7 or 8 who was so excited to teach my son how to play fallout it was honestly one of the best experience for him, I talked with the boys father, he told me his son hadn't had any luck playing with appropriate people on here and playing with my kid made his night, they still play sometimes lol
---
nope. plenty of time.
---
We don't know but I'll be damned if I've got none left only to find out they do. 
---
If they don't then I got plenty to keep my double exp weekend going on much longer then the time given haha
---
I second this.
---
This is the only good news from my preferred shift at work being forcibly changed. I've got ALL that time to myself for this now.
---
that, or, people are just playing the game and that's how they like their camp
---
Indeed it is..however not everyone plays this game to make caps....I just like to build and explore..so /shrug you do you :D but don't tell me how to do.
---
Still within the game's mechanics, the game is pretty easy maybe they are doing a service by adding some spice to the game.
---
It is how it works for you / everyone. You're obviously picking up enough items within those 20 hours.
---
Cooked glowing meat sells for 9 caps a piece, make sure you have super duper equipped.
---
to much to read. starting tomorrow. just spend 150 atoms for that level and done.
---
Yes it increases by 25 score for each rank. So I believe the final rank will cost 3500 score. I may be off by a small amount but it should be in that range.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
But for a long time Ultracite power armor was bugged and you could install Ultracite JP's on any piece of the PA. So Ultracite Jetpack Arms are a thing.
---
This is patched now, so these are legacy items, but some people still have them.
---
Nope. You can have a now legacy ultracite arm with a jet pack on it though ;)
---
A dev?
---
Because there is no “legit” way to be that level.
---
😂😂😂
---
Wow. I just want to thank you for the Platinum. Though I've had my account for almost a year I haven't been very active and am pretty unaware of all things Reddit. Thank you so much for the Platinum you're amazingly generous.
---
I always farm Radiation Rumble. I never play to complete it though, only farm ghouls.
---
I replied "100 ranks, 10 weeks is what I meant" if you'd given me just a minute! Not everyone replies straight after, I'm busy with life, work kids etc. Instead of jumping at a chance to put someone down, give them a minute to reply!
---
Definitely. The lever action is my favorite rifleman gun. It’s what tempts me back to rifleman from commando. 😂
---
I know of a player whos ~2000
---
If you actually read [the actual TOS](https://bethesda.net/en/document/terms-of-service) you'd know that mods are very much allowed but you use them at your own risk.
---
However when they do and get flattened by the high level that should surely be the best lesson to not give in and shoot back right?
---
My "friend" plays on ps4. Last night he showed me how he duped not only BE, JE stuff, but the new ss armor and gauss weapons too, as well as how to trade them. He is about the least hacker type person I know. If he is doing it, it is completely out of hand.
---
i quit doing it when all the good legendary rolls i got were on non max level gear. morale killer.
---
buy a second copy. and be your own transfer mule.
---
Guess that's the new witch hat then?
---
Im not sure tbh and i dont know how it works i only know how it looked and for the 1at 2 waves he hid and the it looked like he was jist checking bodies
---
Used to be able to put jetpack mods on any part of ultracite armor so you could jet pack your arm or something and then still protocol the torso.  Believe they fixed that recently though so not really possible anymore.  That was the only way to get away with it and only with that one armor.
---

I saw a guy one time who was about 2600ish. First and only time anyone that high. Saw a couple in the 1000's. Most are in the 500-600's I see of a higher level.
---
That guys name is kinda fitting, no?
---
Power it with a generator and then all you gotta do is throw the smoker grenades it provides in the chest attached to it
---
Ill-gotten is the gamer's tag? *press x to doubt*
---
Potential r/usernamechecksout
---
Not today. If I miss a level or two, Ill buy them on the very last day.
---
I mean just look at the name of you needed any indication if it was legit.
---
The easiest method is to open the documents folder for 76 and remove the custom ini. You have to relaunch the game anyway so just drop it onto the desktop and put it back when you’re done
---
'adding logging' ... ive used that line before - it basically means, 'the code is so convoluted, that it doesn't give us any clues why this keeps happening',
---
a toxic one, ironically.
---
&gt;"The named ghouls in the GECK chamber being the Free Staters who shot the blasted thing"  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Hello, I'm a vault raid runner myself and I just wanted to inform ya that it wasn't the Free states that blew up the G.E.C.K in vault 94, it was actually a small group that was send by the mayor of Harpers Ferry way before the Free states left their bunker. The mayor didn't have an issue with vault 94 but because of a busy schedule, a group was sent to investigate whether or not the ambassador of vault 94 was telling the truth about sharing resources. Unfortunately, the worst possible choice of people (4 to be precise) were sent and killed the vault councilmen because they were to paranoid and desperate.   
---
&gt;The free states remarked on a few terminals and holotapes in the bunkers that they felt an explosion (likely the G.E.C.K going off) and mentioned how radiation alone couldn't have caused such radical changes within the Mire. Some time after leaving there bunkers, they discovered what happened at vault 94, mourned the dwellers tragic fate and took salvageable research on a "red vine" (likely the specimen the G.E.C.K mutated) to create Radshields.
---
If they remove pvp this would be a good game for crossplay. PvP is kinda pointless in this game anyway, as it's not rewarding, a waste of resources and time.  It takes 0 skill and it's all about your loot and build. It's how people who are bad at skillful pvp games get off because they have a chance at wining for once. 
---
Before you say that's wrong. It's not, I stopped playing this game for months when NW came out. I play alot of Fast paced shooters and BRs. I'm considered a Sweaty Player and do tournaments time to time. I come back to play NW with a friend to help him get wins and try it out. We win the first 5 matches with me having over 20 kills each match. And then I said, "I felt like a bot. I can't believe someone can make such bad stick input for a game that you wanted pvp in. 
---
So just removing pvp altogether would make it more viable because of the unfairness MnK and Paddle have. If the aim mechanic s were any better, I don't think that would matter much.
---
Ok weird i dont understand why he was checking the bodies out. I didn't see a teammate anywhere. But i have him a reason to fight lol
---
I've found one on the second floor of one of the hangers, named and on the ground. I wasn't able to loot it though.
---
It's a clean room,  that means it has to be kept clean!
---
I'd like the faction-specific military caps....but I bet I'm disappointed.
---
My character literally depends on my rads. If i have none, I won't be able to fast travel to and from your camp.
---
That’s a possibility. It’s also possible that there’s no way to prove whether someone duped or not, even if he has impossible amount of rare items.
---
I find this petition funny, do you know how many people that plays the game don't come to reddit at all or even so speak English to understand  your plea? So yeah whenever I go to a camp and in front of a vendor there is a decon arch, they aren't usually English or really high level or been playing for that long to realize. So chill lil bro!
---
Shelling out caps? You can’t afford to fast travel? Maybe you should walk?
---
Actually Explosive does exist however not from crafting. 
---
It can be awarded when doing an Allies Quest for a weapon though.
---
And your reply was "10 weeks is 70 days not 100" not anywhere in my post did I say that, and the only word I edited was weeks to ranks. Nothing else was changed. It was your assumption that makes 10 weeks 100 days, not mine, if you'd read between the lines, like most did, you'd know that. Again, another person that would rather criticize than help. Putting someone down is far easier than helping, as I was trying to do in this post.
---
But then you have to wear a mining helmet.
---
Console has it way worse tbh. But on PC its manageable
---
I appreciate the offer.
---
Sure, check your chat
---
ive had this thought, that camp interiors, when added this year, would be populated with your other characters and allow you to trade with them...doubt it will happen, but it would be an interesting way to populate your own base.
---
Yes, and the Fashion Police will be on the look out for you.
---
They removed GTA
---
I have both and change them out whenever is needed. It's a good idea if you are just using it to free up perk card slots
---
Never did it with Witch Hats, as the helmets sell more. Used to be the top hats but they were nerfed ages ago.
---
You catch it from the lusty argonian maid...
---
I used to be on a spot in the toxic valley south of the crashed space station,now the crater.I don’t know if it is still possible to build there tho.
---
Otherwise I can’t really remember any spots with lead+water.You might wanna check the map online.
---
Wait you can attack other players with that thing? I honestly have no idea how it works.
---
Nope. The only things I really wanted were the Ammo Converter, Bow skin, playground thing and maybe the raider cage thing. I’ll have that last one in a few days and will likely get to 100 anyway, but if I don’t, I don’t want any of the other things enough to shell out money.
---
Ah scotland where we get all 4 seasons in one day lol
---
Whoa hold up!  You expect them to follow through as advertised?  They’re saving those as “new features” to entice that year two renewal.
---
Its a *camp*, not a mansion.
---
Just did the quest, adn i have to say, it ate A LOT of screws and black titanium (basically got 0 now, and my armor is broken, but i will manage i hope xD), but now i have the workbench in my house. Thanks a bunch
---
awesome thanks!
---
Definitely play around with them! They're so widely unused I feel in game, and a missed opportunity by players for FUN TIMES to be had by all!!!! 💣💣💣🥳🥳🥳🎊💣💣💣🥳🥳🥳🎊💣💣💣🥳🥳🥳🎊
---
All they need to do is disable the button to pull up your friends list in a vendor. Doesn't seem too hard.
---
Is there is a triple exp weekend planned...?
---
Technically both have 1 per day. 
---
However it does seem strange that Crater rotates between two options.
---
About how big is that on the map? I don't exactly see a scale ingame
---
The entire game is just fetch quests. There’s hardly any other kind because of the lack of compelling npcs
---
only took them two fucking weeks...
---
Oh my bad y'all, let's be grateful that it took them two weeks to give us any solid info on a game breaking bug for the newest feature they're pushing.
---
LMAO you're daft aren't you?
---
I'll explain it to you as if you were 5.
---
You said: 100 days 10 weeks. 10 ranks per week
---
I said: 10 weeks is 70 days, not 100 days
---
You edited it to: 100 ranks, 10 weeks. 10 ranks per week
---
Understood?
---
I’d like to be able to transfer or copy Xbox characters to PC, just because I started on Xbox so I have way better characters there. And I’d like Atomic shop and FO1st memberships to be cross platform. 
---
That said, PC/console cross play, with all the hacking and nonsense? No. Xbox NW with controllers against mouse and keyboard players? No.
---
so completing an Allies Quest has the chance to give an explosive Gauss Shotgun (if you've learned the plan) is what you're saying?
---
you're being downvoted for stating something 100% factual. i don't even care for NW, and i especially hate that they essentially force us to do it, but this can be done in 2 games *easily.* the "play for 30 minutes" took me longer.
---
Join teams.
---
If you prefer to continue the story lines or are not a natural team player then select builder for a small but always active xp boost.
---
Events teams are only good if you actively get involved. I don't care about team player levels at high level events as long you are running around shooting. Leachers at any level may get kicked especially on a busy server.
---
Imo at L25 you're better off sticking to progressing the story lines and sitting in a stable building team.
---
Well its their camp, that said I simply skip their vendors and go to the next player.
---
If you do the mission to become a pioneer scout and head to the I believe sunny sky ski resort (or something along this elites) you can repeat an obstacle course for as long as you want to get xp and other stuff
---
Will I?  No why now?  Will there be people who do?  You bet. Gotta be first!
---
Sometimes I have to exit and re-enter the vending machine menu before it shows up.
---
Really wish, in general, we had some kind of "loading" icon for vending machines, like we used to have on lootable corpses, to distinguish between an empty vendor and one that's just slow to load.
---
It does yes. I've seen someone get one personally on Xbox and this:
---
[Gauss Explosive on PS](https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gr8um2/is_the_gauss_shotgun_supposed_to_have_explosive/) 
---
Shows it on PlayStation also.
---
made me smile, thanks for that
---
Yeah, it would be nice if Foundation had another mission-giver.....heck, even Sunny sending you out to gather supplies or Penny asking you to collect scientific readings or something.
---
I always gave Ward the photos also to balance it out.
---
3rd persons pretty buggy with aiming/picking up items. I only use 3rd person to walk about sometimes.
---
Confirmed! I cashed in the tokens I had stockpiled, dropped the odd ones out, and the audio clip is no longer playing!
---
Thanks for the help Responder.
---
Crater has two but only one is active per day. Also, Foundation daily gives max 250 reputation, while Crater ones give max 225. So i would not complain so much about it. To get same amount of reputation raiders need to do extra daily like the Ohio River Adventures one for the missing 25 rep.

---
No. The season is helping me continue to play. If I bought everything, I wouldn't get on much
---
Misunderstanding on my part, as I associated Harper's Ferry with the Free States in my head and thereby took the Mayor, and the four respective yahoos, to be Free Staters.  
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
You can do both "retirement plan" and "the importance of communication" every day
---
Oh I see it’s rotates but yeah I’m tired of ward it’s repetitive
---
Is this because they don't have a fix for the auto-complete bug, or because no one would finish the Legendary season otherwise?
---
Yes! I was just thinking this yesterday after buying the plan from a player's vending machine. I run it with a double barrel shotgun as my secondary another very satisfying gun to use.
---
Set a marker on the map. Walk 100 meters away from it. Three times that distance.
---
The difference is they can better hide it with a compelling narrative and characters. The entire plot of Fallout 3 is to get the GECK but you would hardly think of it as a fetch quest.
---
Then count yourself lucky because you are not supposed to be able too. 
---
It's supposed to rotate between the two.
---
The biggest thing that needs to be mentioned here is the huge int gain from being a low life build with a full set of unyielding armor. +15 int = 30% flat xp gain before any other buffs, not to mention all the offensive and defensive benefits of being bloodied/unyielding. Low life builds seem to be far and away the most common way of playing from mid to end game.
---
The egg head mutation is another +6 int/12% flat xp gain.
---
Same thing happens to me but I've had it since day 1 of wastlanders please help
---
don't forget to lock the container AND the computer. that are two seperate actions
---
Without any exp glitch its impossible.
---
Yeah, honestly didn't even know it was part of the advertised benefits of 1st when I got it. Would still like for it to be implemented at some point. I'm honestly starting to just knock out my dailies then go back to FO4 since I'm mostly a builder and have nothing to do except grind levels for when legendary perks come out. Even then, I already have enough for one maxed perk and probably won't ever make legendaries an actual grind. Already have all the best gear to date so the only thing that's going to be able to hold my attention is more building.
---
going for a sniper/shotgun build
---
Honestly can't wait till this is patched out.  Makes what should be a 5-10 minute queen fight into a 25 minute ordeal.  Glad it makes someone happy.
---
My camp is at the white springs golf course so i use mine to help clear out ghouls in the houses nearby when i’m legendary hunting
---
no, the few that actually play this game, play it like everyone else.
---
Roger that! Thanks!
---
Weird. I do them both pretty much every day. I definitely did while grinding for rep.
---
I understand that but it’s repetitive I always expect the same thing from ward Atleast with rosicky there is a chance the run raider is dead or alive when I get there
---
My biggest tip for you would be to pick 1 of the 2 weapons. Using 2 weapon types severely limits your damage potential
---
Don't think they picked the locks, just took the workshop instead to access the harvesters!
---
You know what.... It's not worth it. I make an error of 1 word, "100 days, 10 week, 10 ranks a week" instead of "100 ranks, 10 weeks, 10 ranks a week" and 2 people jump on the chance to criticize and down vote me. Instead of being helpful, and waiting for replies, they jump on the error and down vote everything I say there after. As soon as it was posted that I made an error, I corrected it, and posted that I meant ranks, not weeks, even that comment was down voted, and ignored to extent that I DIDN'T admit I was wrong! This will be my last post on this sub. I won't miss the constant nay Sayers. It's funny how just 2 people can ruin a helpful post.
---
Then you have a very lucky bug. Or letting them tick over to the next day.
---
Just in case, a bit of an FYI: things that extract resources have a capacity limit, so when they reach max storage they stop producing. The time it takes to fill up varies by extractor type, but you definitely want to empty them more frequently than every 3 hours.
---
Thx. I'll check out camden park. No idea what the mr fuzzy tokens are. Need to look that up. Thx.
---
My completely unfounded optimism is Q4 2020. Still after my FO1st runs out, I think, but I hope it isn't a 2021 feature. I may have a hard time sticking with the game until then, lol.
---
It just works, well it does if you have a wallet.
---
Not to sound mean or anything, but youve been had.
---
So what you need to do is do all the story quests for both factions until you get to "Side with ____" for both. Then choose whomever.
---
For Dailies, you've got Ward for Foundation and Rocksy or Wren for Crate. If you get Rocksy, don't kill the Former Raider, send them to Foundation instead. You'll get Rep for both factions. Crater also has the Mirelurk Meat daily, and Davenport's Photo Op can be chosen for whomever. I recommend helping the faction you don't plan on siding with for the final story mission.
---
Also, there are Random Encounters scattered around the map where you can help members of each faction out for more Rep, look up a few of these spawn locations and do as many as you can, server hop, and repeat.
---
EDIT: Also, until you max out Rep, always decline a reward. Do everything you can for free, you'll get a little more rep.
---
It's gotta be a certain distance from the artillery itself though to work!
---
Get Chem weight from the raider rep grind. Means you can carry way more stims for Born Survivor 1 to use. One of the best way to keep really low HP builds alive imo.
---
Also means you can carry more medical items - and those have a great sell value to weight ratio.
---
Ha my issue is I’m in a endless grind for my “gotta collect everything” addiction. They sucked me right in with this season stuff. Nobody to blame but myself. I don’t even play the game for “fun” necessarily, more habit. Get my daily SCORE and gold, rinse, repeat.
---
Is that because you only like to build really?
---
I wish they'd just acknowledge one of these threads, but I'm guessing it isn't one of the approved topics for the CM team :/
---
Ok, nice but I want to spend my badges on a mod, question: is the rad resistance powerful enough for me to spend the badges on this mod? For ex to not make a lot of rad management anymore?
---
That's what I thought, since I've run into a few during my play &amp; they were normal levels for the time.
---
It happens WAY too often lately. I get that, or my quick wheel is blank entirely, and I have to try several times to get it to work. Half the time it's quicker to equip through your Pip-boy lately than the quick wheel, which defeats the purpose a wee bit.
---
500 doesn’t do anything close to that, you’d need 5,000 or even more. Most people chug them down and stack rugs. If you manage to make each rug (one of the cheapest camp items) give 4k xp each (20-27,000 Bobbleheads) and you blueprinted a stack of let’s say 50, you’d make 200,000 xp each stack. From level 1 you’d clear the Legendary Run in 110~ stacks of rugs and you’d go from level 2 to level 525~, all of this in about 10 to 20 minutes
---
No, it’s supposed to be one or the other.  Sometimes I can get lucky if I didn’t do it the day before and get both, but it’s supposed to be only one or the other.
---
Ward is currently bugged for me. Everytime I start a new session his quest pops up and I can complete it. This might have been more valuable weeks ago when i was still grinding rep. Im at ally already now
---
Depending on your build int plays with the amount of xp you get the more int you have the more xp you get per kill, using mentats will temp raise your int by 2 points! Join a group and hang out with them.
---
the reason crossplay isnt a thing. is . i create a hacker pc account. dup. everything under the sun. as an example a backpack for pc is worth $5.00 but the same backpack is worth atm $75.00 on xbox. i then create a xbox account and transfer my char. the ebay list the items . and boom make a grand.... plus the NW pc hackers are enough to make it to where no one wants to even play NW on pc anymore.
---
It does not do as much damage as the power fist, but it's still a great weapon. The biggest gripe I have with it compared to the power fist, is that it has a constant white noise when it's equipped. I still use both the gauntlet and the power fist, and there's just something more satisfying about the 'ka-chunk' sound when power fist deploys. 
---
I've never noticed it stunning enemies because it typically takes them out in a hit, it might do some electrical damage to them in the meantime. But much like the power fist, the gauntlet is quick to take down enemies.
---
They're both great and they both provide plenty of damage to subdue most anything, even a scorchbeast.
---
After it attacks you can hit it in the back at its exposed core for an "easy" kill.
---
Definitely considered the bigger camp budget in my 1st purchase though, so that was crap.
---
exploiters already reached rank 100.
---
Thats why i have mine on a button so any player that wants to use it can
---
Same. Luckily I've gotten it down to a science and am usually done in under 20 minutes. My one set of tasty squirrel stew and cranberry meatball sliders has lasted 3 sessions without being reapplied, lol.
---
Shoot it a lot, and don't let it shoot you
---
May I ask what aa is
---
Thanks 👍
---
Oh wow I wish that was the case for me I’m Tryna get my rep up now
---
Yeah i'm scrapping everything i can find. Taking it slow. I'm not that interested in min/maxing. Just focussing on having fun in the game. I wonder around basically everywhere without a plan lol. So many cool locations.
---
It just happened for me twice in the Charleston DMV. Both times it was ghouls crawling out of piles of rubble and I killed them too quickly and they fell underneath. Five minutes later I had meat piles.
---
Yeah you're mixing perception and strength weapons. Once you pick one and boost the perks for it the whole thing will fall into place for you.
---
Generally, it's every Tuesday.
---
Some weeks, they rotate items in and out on flash sales.  Rarely, they introduce new items during the week.  But there is always an Atomic Shop update on the official Fallout page that describes the schedule for that week in advance.
---
Like I tried to explain, it is misused in the queen fight but can just be fun to mess with outside of that one instance.
---
Jesus dude, slow down.  I just hit 33 last night and I'm happy.
---
Personally I’ve always imagined it as an awful combo of jock-itch &amp; swamp-ass.
---
I have one better...food build with mutations, bloodied unyielding build. That the easiest build. My third build of four.
---
I'm really hoping they expand on the blue ridge caravan sometime soon.
---
Many people are great in this game. They just enjoy helping. It's wonderful. Then there are a few bad apples who like to build trap camps and blow up others camp with explosive bait that turn people off
---
For me that's definitely the most replayable part. I have probably 4 vanilla characters on Xbox alone with all settlements maxed several times over just in vanilla FO4.
---
Damn how did you knock it down that quick?  Do you do the 3 daily gold quests too?  I feel like I spend too much time doing chores. Maybe I’m not optimizing my sessions. I use the squirrel stew but what’s the sliders all about?
---
What a waste of atoms and real money.
---
This is absolutely gorgeous. You and your girlfriend are unbearably sweet!
---
I wish we could just use more legendary modules for a guaranteed three star.
---
Thanks. Will definately listen to your final paragraph. There's only one first time to experience the levelling and locations etc...
---
I must be doing it wrong. I run straight for the ore, right past the ghouls. I usually just run frantically from hall to hall, and repair turrets as I sprint by for drop off. Once I've collected them all, then I'll do my best at killing ghouls to protect the people while someone else (hopefully) does some gathering.
---
Eugenie is my "Ghirl"
---
It wasn’t an advertised benefit
---
The body can turn into a robot junk pile though. If it's gone, you can scrounge through the junk piles around the area until you find the right one.
---
I saw something weird at LitS. A group of scorched would in the air right in front of the sonic generator and just fall out of the sky in front of it.  Everyone was on the wall and facing inward just shooting them like fish in a barrel. The entire event went that way.
---
Even if you were decked out in full Secret Service armor with Rad Resist legendary rolls, with a rad resistance backpack mod, and had taken a RadShield, you would still have to micromanage your rad resists and rad levels, and you *still* wouldn't be able to run around a nuke zone without a RadAway enema every few seconds. The only way to avoid it is to wear Power Armor, chinese stealth suit, etc.
---
So considering both that and the diminishing returns on DR/ER, if you put a gun to my head and forced me to choose then I would pick the High Capacity mod (if the Grocer's and Chemist's were out of the question)
---
I wish i had an ounce of your creativity or patience.  I avoided settlements like the plague in 4 and hate building but it's just cause I suck at it.  The camp interiors in Q4 might be something you are interested in hopefully.
---
more like he hasn't finished the main quest yet. Max your Raider rep before finishing the Wastelanders vault. After it's down to one.
---
Also, one you visit a location, is it saved to the level you initially visited it? Or does it reset and scale accordinly?
---
I'm on PC btw.
---
Yes, but some effects are restricted.
---
If I had a dollar for every time Bethesda has been asked to nerf bloody builds, boy oh boy.
---
This is the passive aggressive response to everyone that thinks their "carry weight, extra searches on ammo/caps/meds build" should somehow be just as powerful as a bloodied build.
---
Bloody comes with a huge trade off. In order to get the full effects, we have to be at ~10% health. If we even think about moving the wrong direction in a fight, we're dead. 
---
Totally worth it for the damage though.
---
That isn’t the problem. I specifically need weapon weight reduction.
---
Hard no. There's nothing on that board in the later stages I want (except the chicken coop... I want a farm....). 
---
Plus, I'm putting my money where my mouth is and I'll buy the shit from the atx once the next season lands. I don't think it's a one shot deal for the things on the board and they'll be sold off for atoms anyways.
---
Yeah, I don't get it honestly. I dont care for the build myself but I have no ill will to those who use it. A little petty in my opinion but I guess we all play the game in our own way. Lots of good people in this game and lots of asshats as well. Lol
---
If you have fallout 1st you can transfer between characters
---
Anti-armor
---
I was using Armored for the longest time on my Bloodied for the extra DR, then I switched to Grocer and rarely switch back.
---
If you're playing Bloodied and have 4/5 Unyielding pieces and Radicool perk you should NOT have a carrying capacity issue. I can carry a ton of crap and I only have 2 points in my Strength SPECIAL, the rest is from Unyielding, Radicool, and Mutations.
---
Also, backpacks weight 1 lb. If you can, carry 3. I carry High Capacity for when wearing Chinese Stealth Armor (since it takes away the Unyielding), Armored if I'm feeling I need it, and a Standard modded with Grocer's which reduces all my food and drinks. The Grocer reduction can make up a huge portion between Standard and High Capacity without sacrificing DR.
---
I do building for the general xp boost. Don't know why 90% of teams are event teams. Just switch your team to event right before the event is done.
---
But I do agree there is almost no point to not being on a team
---
Sliders are just OP for bloodied builds. Over 100 bonus health so the most tanky build possible is with nerd rage, serendipity, and ricochet proccing. My bloodied guy is much tankier than my dedicated tank when I have those going. Also I grinded T notes like crazy early on and have been sitting on like 750-800. It fluctuates if I play more, but my settler daily is glitched and I do some events in the 20 minutes I'm on usually so it trends down slowly with how I play right now. I already have max two so I don't do the raider or overseer daily.
---
I don't understand forming another of the same kind of team when there's already a team with a few bonded players on it. The only benefit to being a 'team leader' is to kick people or change the goal of the team. I guess it's just human nature to want to shoot your big toe off in reality as well as video games.
---
That's pretty interesting to know, i presume this is only he case for the shotgun and not the mini etc?
---
I saw a camp once where the player had empty vendors visible and one hidden underground full of stuff.  I assumed it was just really low-level, non-violent griefing.... kinda subtly brilliant way to annoy shoppers drawn in by the numbers.....
---
Def wanna rebuild appalachia
---
As a bloody build that's what I do, I leave. Not my place to complain about someone else's camp.
---
Alright, thanks
---
Yeah. That feels like low hanging fruit and is kinda BS that Beth didn't even try to adjust it. If it caused stability issues they could have rolled it back with a statement about them "working on it" and that would have been more satisfying/placating than what we got.
---
They were advertised as future features when it first came out. They’ve since dropped any mention of it. I’m sure somebody can dig up the original announcement that mentioned it.
---
I mean, Lone Wanderer is still nice for the AP refresh, buuut as a previous Lifer of Lone Wanderer, I go Public all the time now, running Inspirational (shared) and Bodyguards.
---
I always start a building one, for the int xp gain, and because if I join an events one, and don't do every event that pops up I usually get removed from it. I will also switch the team type if I go to an event, usually right before it ends. 
---
So, that being said, I'm happy with my solo (most of the time) building team with my herd mentality serum.
---
Not high level or not been playing long?  How’d they get the plans, the flux?  You use your damn brain, lil bro.
---
I started my 3rd character to make the level up challenges easier, since it's a bit harder to do at 170, but I've found it's a lot more fun than I expected to experience everything with the Wastelanders addition as a newbie than I expected!
---
Another lv25 here and I feel exactly the same. People are so lovely, and it's definitely made me more thoughtful when seeing lower level players. And nearly everyone I meet emote waves at me at stations etc. It's a really lovely wasteland out there.
---
The thing is, all this stuff anyone else can have so it's not really unique now, maybe in a year or two someone will see the secret fireplace and freak out, but not this year. It'll be interesting to see what else is sold in the atom shop along with these rewards. The rewards arent half bad, but, just my opinion, I'd prefer some of the stuff at closer increments. For example, give us one of those cool power armor skins at level 25, not level 75 or whatever it is, but that's just me.
---
He didn't drop server in the massive time from launch to landing?
---
Hell I put all my armor and junk away, FT'd to a nearby spot, walked under the nuke and took it to the face with time to spare.
---
Ah ok I see. I don’t run bloodied. I need to make a list of what actual items I want for gold. I just get it out of habit with no plan of what to buy lol.
---
If people are out and about  completing quests while on an events team, the team should be set as either building, or perhaps better Roleplaying.
---
The bonus CHA from roleplaying will increase the XP and Caps you gain for someone on your team completing a quest.
---
No problem, I made the same mistake myself. 
---
I really hope that with the wastelanders update, Bethesda will have some dwellers still alive in these vaults and have them give us missions to help fix their vault. P.s, to add to the whole rebuilding America theme, I kinda want to do something similar with what they're doing with Atlas and have a community challenge where we bring material to vault 94 and with our high intelligence characters, contribute to repairing the G.e.c.k. and use it to terraform the toxic valley after stopping Grafton steels from spewing out toxins.
---
I adjusted my inventory on my higher level character who actually has vendors and lowered the prices a bit, and it's helped a lot. I mostly have been selling lately to mitigate the nearly-full stash issue, so the caps are just icing on the cake. I just hated the idea of dropping stuff outright.
---
It just works.
---
Treasure maps from the mire and big I believe. As well as distant thunder. They are quite rare drops though
---
Nah just going to take it easy now, wait for double XP weekend
---
That was my first thought when I read this. No matter what type they’re usually full within 30 min I’m pretty sure.
---
I think one of the main complaints here is not only the time but your focusing on doing something the mode isnt made for. If I wanted to kill creatures I'd load into adventure mode not NW
---
Yup, my favorite gun in real life too.
---
As a bloodied build that doesn't really bother me. I carry enough spoiled food that even if my rads are fully cured I can get back down to about 40% health.
---
If they were smart they would’ve focused more on this because that feature alone would sell 1st subs. Problem would be how do you allow bigger budget in private but normal in public?
---
I had 100+ maps that i went through in cranbery bog but still couldn't find a single one. Thank you
---
Did you get the 200mm camera mod from the davenport quests yet?
---
I get Well Rested, Public Building Team, pop some Mentats and hit up Whitesprings. You should be strong enough to take on the ghouls (there's also a few safe spaces to retreat to) and rack up some XP.
---
No, as I said, I held his attention by way of PVP. You must not have read that part.
---
Well its still buggy in some aspects but its all fallout style so if you werent pissed of by that in the past it wont bother you now too Hardly. And yes you can change the appearance of your character but in my eyes this is a completely Nonsense Feature as you will wear armor 99% of the time. But there are a lot of cool Outfits nice Helmets and so on.
---
I Fell in love with the teddy bear suit wearing it for like two Weeks now haha
---
Food and purified water both regen health, not to mention popping stimpacks when Serendipty doesn’t proc, and some people run Radicool. 
---
‘yOu dONT NeEd yOuR RaDs’ is such a stupid response to the OP.
---
Do they really? I can't understand why, though. If a build works for someone, what does it matter? I personally don't prefer running one for myself, but if someone else does, more power to them!
---
Joining a team is the first thing I do after joining server, even before checking map for Encryptid, Radiation Rumble or Scorched Earth.
---
Sounds about right, yes. :-)
---
The thing is, you need 75 ore gathered to even have a chance at getting the rad barrel or any of the other rare rewards and there are 40 ore in those shafts. Which means at least two full gathering runs. The ore respawns quickly enough that you might -  might - get in two runs if you start gathering as soon as the event starts, but I haven't tried that yet myself.
---
Fallout song gets old fast if you played all the games ! This is strait up more songs be open minded https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7olpTqGzGrYuI76ZBlCLgs?si=6luqh1MbSRikMRvTnaBe1Q
---
No way. I could buy the first 2 seasons right now but I think it's a waste.
---
Right, they made it so you can't pull it up during the loading screen, which was stupid.  Pretty easy fix you would think
---
They asked if he had a degree in theoretical biology.  He said he had a theoretical degree in biology... so cut him some slack!
---
It might be the mire and savage divide. I'm not 100% sure, though I've heard it's just 2 regions. And they are suppose to be quite rare. I'm probably going to blow threw all my maps soon and hope to get some. I've got every other pa plan haha would like to finish it off
---
I’ll tell you how to do and you can’t stop me. So /shrug.  If you place your showers before your vendors it’s not for your ease of use.  Did you forget that the rest of us play this game too?  You have a whole camp.  Placement before vendors is just bad practice at best, dickish at worst.
---
I don't think so, but I could be wrong! I know you can with the Voice of Set, but idk about the Somerset.
---

---
Pick up wards stolen equipment and put it in a trash can somewhere 😂
---
yes. Didn't use it though.
---
I’m not about to undertake that math but maybe if you spend all your waking hours playing with XP buffs you can rank up pretty high?
---
You need to re-spec your build if you need to switch back armor just to fight off some ghouls. Also name your armor and they're all at the top of the list. It's a couple seconds of work.
---
Secret service helmet has this light as a default as well.
---
Oh good Lord, this changes things! That's wonderful news! I'm going to try that out!
---
I did some testing and saddly it does not.
---
It isnt too bad if caps went to my main but I would be pissed if gold bullion went to a mule.
---
If only you could put it in a display case. :D
---
It’s not about the rads.  It’s the fucking mutations.  Replacing rads is easy.  Making more serums... gotta get flux.
---
YOU CAN, on PC atleast.
---
Nice try, Todd
---
Same. I have full SS but don't feel the need to she'll out for the buttressed material mod because it's already fairly beefy. I'm sitting on about 2k gold and already have my God roll Gauss Minigum, Gauss Shotgun, and Plasma Caster (still kinda sucks but I love the hell out of this gun).
---
what do you mean by cap? like, the most you can cash out from a single action is 4000?
---
Yes, it is whining. Getting rads is the easiest thing to do in Fallout, you're an entitled little bitch. Git gud.
---
I'm 100% with you. Anyone saying this is negatively affecting the game is either jealous, or they don't understand and value good gear. I'm so happy and glad people have access to pretty much every gun and outfit in the game now, no more countless hours of bulls*it trying to find one item. This helps the game and the community tenfold.
---
Meanwhile.... I'm gonna go attack a scout hall as my badge rate is utter bullshit. Ive gotten ONE badge in about 20 events. I can't even begin to fantasise about buying those mods. 
---
No wonder the scouts and brownies are dying Irl. Kids need badges u motherfuckers!
---
Keeps giving me the knife paint job to incite me to self harm over it. I see you Tadpoles.
---
I never said that your time is equally valued. The reality is Bethesda values daily log-ins more than binge playing. That first hour or two of playing is rewarded far more than your 7th. Doesn't change the fact that you are still rewarded for your time.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Thank you for answering! One more thing, is pvp a lot bigger now? I remember at launch I saw nobody fighting each other and it was just a big rush to gain access to nukes from the enclave.
---
I think you could be right.  Last night I tried it with my combat rifle and Perfect Storm and it switched back and forth fine, but as soon as I switched out to the AA 50 cal sniper, it stopped switching correctly again.
---
Couldn't agree more. So glad to know that I'm not the only one! :D
---
Xbox player here. If you haven’t played since launch, a LOT has changed (I’m surprised you are unaware of Wastelanders dropping?). The DLC brought in human NPCs in the form of factions, companions, and good ol’ hostile NPCs for you to fight out in the world. There’s a few more currencies to farm for different things other than caps now (you can scrap legendaries for “scrip” which you can use to buy random legendary items from a vendor in the Ash Heap), and gold bullion for new weapons and armour as part of the Wastelanders DLC endgame grind. There’s even free season passes added into the game now, which add even more of a grind into the game! In terms of glitches, unfortunately there are still a few going around, from simple visual bugs to duping glitches that are breaking the game trading economy. 
---
Overall the game has gotten MASSIVELY better since release and if you are a fan of the Fallout series I actually would recommend this game now, it’s still got a ways to go before it’s anywhere near perfect, but I’ve been playing for the longest continuous time since launch and I’m still enjoying it. Obviously others will have differing opinions and other things to add, but in my opinion, if you like fallout, you’ll probably like this!
---
Also, the community is probably one of the nicest I’ve been apart of out of any game I’ve played long term, which has probably also contributed to why I’ve enjoyed playing it so much.
---
All joking aside, one of the last major publicly known dupes was known as ‘the waiter glitch’ and used the waiters inside the Whitesprings dining room.. 
---
This had already been a well known exploit, had been patched out, and then suddenly came back with a subsequent patch..
---
At that time I thought it had to be one of two things, really. Either:
---
A. They did it intentionally 
---
Or 
---
B. There is a very low standard for performance for the bunch working on this game. Pick the reason you like.. 
---
I guess the jury is still out but.. I felt and still feel like before a patch goes out that a perfunctory objective would be to take an hour and check the most well known exploits.
---
Also then, like now, legacies and their ilk had recently taken a sharp upturn in value.. (in February JE lasers were around $60 on eBay vs. a week ago whenever one would show up it’d be 4 or 500 or more )
---
I love it. I used one with VATS perks for ages and renamed it "Ole Glitchy," since this was the time where there was a weird bug with weapon ammo. Then I got an exploding one and "Ole Splody" was born.
---
Thanks but is there a youtube version available? I dont have spotify, too many streaming servies already... ;)
---
should be a quest to nuke foundation/crater, then fight something there
---
Same here! I don't think they can be carried over to deposit into the hopper for the next round either, so that's a double whammy right there. I was with a group trying to do it last night, and half of them wouldn't spawn. One disappeared before I could pick it up, even. It would have been nice to have been able to use some extras picked up in other rounds rather than fail a stupidly easy event.
---
Early levels throwing knives are your friends, especially with sneak, stick to the forest areas near 76 for the first 15ish levels, grab a melee weapon early on so you save ammo
---
Agreed. Ivl 43 over here
---
For sure. My biggest hype at the moment is the interiors. I hope they have an available "root cellar" type that would go well with my current mothman cultist build. Everytime they introduce a new budget glitch I can't help but build that thing out more. It's pretty marvelous but it also means I usually can't change anything or move because I'd have to downsize :/
---
ZachyChan...if that's not the best alias I've ever heard...10pts good sir.
---
You can be a level 1 players, join scorchedbeast event and get decon arch. Also you could get your flux gifted from another higher level that doesnt use this sub to know this. Also, I got my decon arch gifted to me when I was level 15 by some random dude. Anyway you arent ready for this convo.
---
He didn't hear the train coming over the sound of his duped ass shitty guns then. Apologies, I have a short attention span....
---
Can I have a donut?
---
As someone else already pointed out, a lot of people do this maliciously, not because they have “the freedom to choose.”
---
You could make the same argument about trap camps though.
---
I’m not a bloodied build but I do use the mutations.  Do you play without mutations?  If so you are missing half the game.
---
Ok, I'll experiment today and do both then make sure I can again tomorrow. Pretty much every day I do one in the morning and then one in the afternoon.
---
Grab a empty PA Frame, it will give you 10+ strength even without the pieces. Use a melee weapon initially ... review your build and get your strength tree up ..  it's better to decide on a proper build either melee weapons or melee early on in the game .. What strength perks do you currently have ? 
---
Whats your favorite weapon right now ? Stick to the middle and west of the map for now until you get a decent level. When you get to level 15, grab some raider PA with all the pieces, you. You will notice how much it helps.
---
Well, we're all in this wasteland together, after all!
---
https://youtu.be/tzBGEqkwCoY - from another comment :)
---
Thank you I had someone help me build up my camp a bit yesterday, game is much tougher than I thought.
---
I wouldnt want any crossplay with PC servers tbh
---
I’ve been meaning to post this idea myself
---
I’d say just play through the story, and the big side quests first off. You get plans, XP, reputation, complete challenges, and stumble apon parts of the map you can either grind for mats or build apon in the future. After you do most the quests and factions you like then it’s all just playing how you like to play
---
Well in my 95 level old experience i never ever had a pvp confrontation nor have witnessed one. I have tried nuclear winter like two Times but in my eyes its complete shit.
---
So my answer to this would be: no, no pvp at all
---
There is a pacifist Mode you can turn on in the settings that makes that you cant harm other players with your shots and vice versa. I think its turned on by default
---
Lmao keep telling yourself that
---
I think you should find some Nuka shine... Chug it down and let the game come to you.
---
Great advice with the throwing knives.  I went from 2-20 on my alt just with throwing knives
---
So I did that and I am at camp. Where can I find it? It's not in my craft and I have looked everywhere else.
---
Honestly they should just make it to where it increases budget and not build radius and allow it in public. Not all CAMPs are equal and the budget already doesn't correspond to poly count or any other meaningful metric. Camps in some parts of the map are more likely to lag the map than others (I occasionally build grouped camps and budget busting on 6 different adjacent camps will cause zero issues in the Mire but for some reason make the server crap itself in the Ash Heap. I have no idea why this is.
---
I got 3000+ right now and don’t even know what I’m going to do with it lol. Just mindlessly grind away. Got SS and buttressed mods, SS shielded underarmor, ammo thingy and the gauss minigun. Might go for the PA set next idk.
---
It has a bit of a learning curve, you figure it out after a bit :)
---
And what about mutations? “Oh the bloodied guys are so bad, fuck them.”  Stay on the ground you non mutant twit.
---
I used to have my C.A.M.P. set up in a power  transmission tower due west of Monongah Overlook and northeast of Morgantown.  I built from the cliffs over to the tower, and had stairs down to the base of the tower.  It was a nice view, and the regular spawns at the base of the tower were all small critters or radstags.  (Radstags were nice because grilled radstag gives a +20 carry weight, but squirrels, rabbits, fireflies, and frogs all spawned on a regular basis.)
---
It was nice and peaceful.  Beckett likes the mountains too...  (He does not like the toxic valley where my current camp is.)
---
3rd for and outside roaming,  1st for indoor/ farming
---
I use a B/SS/1S deathclaw gauntlet and it seems to do the job pretty well.
---
Agreed. I spent a lot of time building up trades and finally getting several explosive plasmas quite awhile ago. And I have no hard feelings that many people now have them. Like literally 0 fucks that they're now wide spread. I am super happy to finally get a je version, I've offered almost whole inventory (which is not half bad haha) and not been even close to getting one. I love that more people now have access to great gear
---
Nevemind. Found it
---
And you have been downvoted by the idiots that ruined this game.
---
I have pack rat that’s it.
---
Welp, I know what I'm doing tomorrow. Binge watching a bunch of fo76 videos to catch up and start my adventure! You guys are extremely helpful, thank you so much!
---
If you aren’t getting drops from events and treasure maps then you could always farm power armor frames in Morgantown although that’s super boring... if you’re wondering why Morgantown it’s because it’s low lvl and there’s two frames super close to each other one at the train yard and the other is at the shack with all the mines in it
---
Yeah I can’t recall if they were referring to budget or radius. You’d think budget increase would happen soon across the board with all the atom shop things they sell that you can’t even place without running out of room.
---
On PC it’s always crowded. Without xp boost it gives 2 100 score challenge complete each time. That’s free 200 score each time! Everyone is crazy over this event sometimes it’s hard to get kills!
---
It's only the bog.  Think thousands of maps.  You can also get them from distant thunder event.  It took me 5months and untold amount of caps on the market page buying and digging maps.
---
Might want to add C. 
---
-	Owner of the base has contempt for the most OP build in the game, so to express their anger, they purposely place a rad shower in the doorway to prevent them from coming in, less they lose all their rads. 
---
Let’s not pretend people aren’t also doing this on purpose. This thread alone shows that.
---
I think trying to plan it all out to the end isn’t worth it since they appear to actively be making changes (added 2 dailies just now, who knows how many future double daily periods they’ll add or score adjustments they’ll make between now and the end).
---
The Ally quests they were all fetch quests
---
They were mentioned as examples of future benefits as 1st evolves over time. They were not advertised as benefits included in your subscription.
---
Also, it’s still on the fallout 1st page in the faq. So I don’t know what you mean by they dropped any mention of it. They still are examples of **future ** benefits not included in a subscription.
---
Oh so they're all this short?
---
Lowkey glad to hear it. I'm finally finishing up with the quests. Just have half of Beckett left and all of Daguerre. It's nice that these are a good quick ending then IMO
---
It’s because they have vendors, what with all this entitlement the disabled have with their parking spaces and ramps?  Just don’t spend your money at stores that force you to use stairs.
---
Yeah. I guess PA is probably going to make the list after I finally kit out everything I've already got. I wish the "Magic" Gauss mini I had worked on the SBQ. It triggers the magic effect on every other enemy and shreds the Alpha/Imposter/Colossus but the explosive effect is entirely negated on the queen so it just works as a normal one. I think hypothetically a junkie's FFR one would still be magic but it's not worth grinding for at 2 modules a pop. I'd rather fine tune my armor first.
---
I'm 103 now and I still use them just because its so satisfying
---
https://fallout76.fandom.com/wiki/Resouces_map
---
There are no water locations Marked as it doesnt count as a resource, but helped me Overall
---
*Points to the legendary on the ground they didn’t get loot from.*
---
Relax, dude.  I felt bad for screwing up someone's plan - that's not a crime.  Stop being so critical of others.
---
This is a cool example of idiots polarizing a simple request.
---
I mean, you have a very good point.
---
My go to for roaming the wastes. Thanks Bob! https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0sOWzxVLmj7GUnfhG41Ckf?si=LXvZqVzaRiijpol8qLDXaw
---
I’m playing at between 7pm-10pm UTC+8 though. The demographic of players might be different hence the difference.
---
Fuck i love you.  No joke, and yes, perhaps I'm nutty bar,  but I lost interest in 76 awhile back, thinking I was just bored.  
---
I realized when I put on a Hollywood handbook podcast instead of listening to the in-game radio and i can now say the boredom i felt was due to my options of 'ambient noise' or the same effing song every 5 min.
---
I truly challenge anyone like myself to try and play again with this or another media of music/sound for the background and while not all will be like me, im guessing im not the only one who had this issue and is once again excited to play fo76.
---
Happy to help! If you have the game pass for Xbox on PC then you can get 76 off of that as they just added it last week :)
---
Many things are expiring today, so we should get a decent refresh for once. Doesn't mean new stuff necessarily, but probably some new and old stuff will show up at 12 est. Today.
---
They said "larger" which I think is where the confusion comes from. I always assumed budget which could still work on public servers, but a lot of people took larger to refer to the build radius. Either way, something resembling the feature they teased us with would be nice.
---
They are adding ways to get score and make it easier, yes. At a minimum though you can benchmark based on what we know. They aren’t making it harder, that’s for sure.
---
Me to! So deflating to not be able to get any legacys even with giving away a whole characters inventory, and then going to mumbles and praying for a decent 3 star drop. This is much better and makes the game fun. I just traded for my favorite gun (FE90RW Plasma) and I've been using it non-stop and enjoying the game more then before. There's a bunch of saps who are around level 70-110 and they have no idea how long it takes to get good stuff, whereas I've played since beta, and never gotten a legacy besides a few explosive harpoon guns.
---
Im getting it on Steam unfortunately, I'm just glad for free dlc
---
If you’re on Xbox I can place some for you.
---
I might be wrong. But every Tuesday they add stuff to the atom shop so I’m assuming there should be a small update around 11-12
---
Nope
---
its 100% extra melee damage. i use it all the time when im fighting strong stuff and just need to get out of that location.
---
I just started back and noticed the team thing.  So basically its for charisma builds to actually have a purpose and also share exp and caps?
---
I had thought it was for a specific event.
---
I have been wanting to create a charisma build lately, it would be nice if this was making them useful
---
I used one with the suppressor, then took it off despite having the damage and sneak bonuses, and enjoy it much, much more than previously. It's accuracy vs. OOMF has made it a constant in my rotation as far as I can remember. 
---
I feel similarly when I use many of the pistols, and look forward to using some of the better ones when I (finally) finish wastelanders.
---
Had a dude come into my CAMP earlier today (he was about level 135 or something) and ask me if I need any items and if I joined the FO76 community yet. So rad. Sounded like he was Finnish.
---
I wish they had perks/more throwables(stars and such).  I still think the most satisfying weapon is the shovel.
---
in packs they are.. yes
---
otherwise they all unlock at certain levels for you to choose if you so desire
---
I'll be sitting on about 5150 atoms after my montlhy atoms from first. That's about 34 levels i can potentially buy. But i'm at level 37 of the pass right now so i'm quite confident i can finish it in time. If i get really bored before the end i guess i may purchase the last 10. But my first choice is to finish it legit.
---
You can express an opinion without being toxic and calling someone’s literacy and comprehension of language into question.  Saying good day doesn’t make the behavior any classier either.
---
This happens if you "accidentally" find one of the stolen items when the quest isn't active. The item stays in your inventory but the game thinks you've found it, and Ward gives you credit for funding it without actually taking it from you. It's definitely convenient if you want to skip hunting down the raider each day.
---
Nothing on the official forums - so doesn't even look like a hotfix is coming. We'll just get the reset of dailies / weeklies and new Atomic Shop items at Noon EST.
---
\[Ronnie Shaw liked that\]
---
Oh its great, the noise when you hit someone is perfect
---
Already spent caps to get there, “lol”
---
I give away most of my extra plans for free at my CAMP to help new characters out. I also sell the Treasure Hunter event clothing for dirt-cheap. Another player emptied my entire "FREE SHIT" vendor out of the 30 or so plans and outfits it had.  
---
I noticed their CAMP was right next to mine so I went to check it, and yes, there it was. They had put all the items they took from my vendor to their own at 100 to 1500 (Ultracite jet-pack plans). I decided to drop some Wasteland Justice™ on them.
---
They seemed to be AFK just standing in the CAMP so I went to a silo and nuked it all. Since they were AFK they didn't notice the nuke until it had obliterated the CAMP and they kept dying to rads trying to get their stash up and fixed to get a hazmat suit on, while I was standing next to them in my stealth suit making grumpy emotes and watching them die.
---
Showed them :P
---
i think i got lucky. under 600 maps and i had it all. not sure if i had it under the 600 maps but i used them all than looked at my plans and i had multiple of them all.
---
I mean, good idea and all. But you can already do that. Sure it won’t be a “present” but you can definitely drop stuff for them. 
---
I understand what you want is like a preset care package so it has all those stuff in one item. Instead of having to manually drop every single item for them. 
---
Hell, if you unlocked the plan for the BOS recon rifle. You can craft/upgrade a level 1 gun variant of it. So they have a really good weapon to hold them off for a while.
---
Great idea!
---
They are randomly generated based on the perks that you can possibly have for your level.  So in other words, a level 5 is not going to be opening up a perk that unlocks at level 50 in a pack.
---
Yeah that’s another really good thing, all DLC is free, and every season pass will be free as well. The only thing you have to pay for is stuff in the store, which is mostly just skins, but occasionally some stuff for your camp.
---
I don’t see it in the FAQ here unless I’m blind or looking in wrong place: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st
---
So they’re not included but potential. Why bother mentioning them at all then if there’s no plans to follow through?
---
I prefer Building for the general XP boost, too. And I know what you mean. My public “team” often turns into a wolf pack of one.
---
Rad emitter is *hot trash* compared to the rad barrel. 
---
I only recently went bloodied, and since I hadn’t gotten the barrel plans yet, I tried the emitter for the first time, and it’s *extremely* slow to active, doesn’t always give you rads despite standing right on top of it, and it has a durability bar. 
---
You can spam a rad barrel and get your rads up super quick, no durability either.
---
OK so confession for me, I discovered the radio back when I first started playing the game because I'm an actual wimp, and the scary music that would come on during a mission when in a building on my own, knowing I'm surrounded by those fat sweaty turd lookin' ghouls, would make me so nervous and anxious. So I put on the radio and I felt so much more at ease. *And didn't turn it off for months after.*
---
My favourite song in game is Anything Goes - hands down. I turn it right up when it comes on!
---
So yep, I feel you! The music changes everything. But I've listening to it hundreds of times over so stumbled across this playlist and it's so enjoyable.
---
Yea it’s just like the all kinds of folks we encounter in real life, but the screens hide people’s identities so assholes are more willing to reveal their true selves online lol
---
This would just prevent the glitch. Nothing is really ever fixed when if comes to video games released after 2017. Plus the friends screen is bugged in more than one ways.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
My brother was like this. I offered to buy 76 for him so we could play together and he said he wouldn't even play it if someone bought it for him. Messagede on the 9th to say he'd caved and got it on gamepass
---
Thank you 🍻
---
Same with Abbie’s Bunker
---
Haha that's great.. would love to see two camps having all out warfare, each with a full team fighting..
---
I always made a shit ton of Witch Hats since they only costed like 1 plastic and 1 cloth or something like that. Could easily clean out the vendors with that. But they upped the required materials, probably around the same time they did for the top hats.
---
Don't think I ever found the Marine Helmet plans so never used that method.
---
And here I am a, full health mutant, who think you are all dicks.
---
Ok what is this magic thing I’ve heard about?  I’ve yet to learn what it actually means. The gauss mini is considered explosive by default right?
---
That's Awesome! Thank you for all your help I'm heading off to go to sleep now, but thanks for all the help! I really appreciate it.
---
Duping ?
---
If you’re looking for a “go to this area and it will be on the table” answer, well unfortunately there isn’t one. Power armor plans seem to only be able to obtain by doing treasure maps. They have a chance to spawn. Could be on your first map, or your 98th plan. I got the entire Raider power armor pieces by doing treasure maps throughout different areas. 
---
But I usually buy plans from other players whenever I see them on sale.
---
"... only given me one fetch quest. "
---
oh you sweet summer child.
---
Sucks that it ain't on ps4, would have loved to do it not for the prize but just for fun. Looking forward to your tour though!
---
I keep trading my Mr. Fuzzy tokens to buy those giant ones from Camder Park and then dropping them at CAMPs of people who obviously are collecting teddy bears, like me.
---
Are you playing on PS4? I was in that area night before last, Lv44, and saw someone with a good sized camp setup, artillery piece, and a Santatron. If so, howdy! I was looking for workbenches and didn't find any and didn't want to pick locks just to get rid of being over-encumbered as I marched my way from the Ash Heap to the north end of the mire where my camp is set up.
---
YOU DID WHAT? IF I'D HAVE KNOWN YOU'D DO THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED TO ASK
---
What about the dupe you guys going to fix it
---
I usually just say “no green stuff here” and move along to the next camp.
---
Lol guess it doesn’t matter either way because it’s not happening. Yet. I would not be surprised if a new list of features pops up for year two to get people to renew the yearly.
---
I just don't buy anything from them.
---
I don’t think he has problem getting armor pieces, he/she is probably talking about getting the plan, for each piece of armor.
---
Wwwwhhhhhhhhhhattt?!?!!?! Your reward is forfeit, good day!
---
My answer. Easier to be the bad guy.
---
Happy to help!
---
I have a shower in my door way for the casual players, but I have a garage door open a floor up so that those folks (including me) can masupial up there to avoid the shower. 
---
Dunno I love the rolplaying idea of having a shower in the door, like the entrances or vaults or bunkers do.... But yeah secret door in case
---
the only reason I'm trying to get the t-60 is because I cannot find the mod plans for the life of me even after doing sbq multiple times. the drop rates are rediculous
---
Because bloodied builds can one/two tap most mobs, so people get salty when they kill legendaries during events before anyone else can tag them. 
---
Although thats completey moot, when you don’t need to be bloodied to do that. Junkie’s will do the same thing, so it’s just misguided anger at bloodied players.
---
He probably thought he could get loot but that you got to it first.
---
Does the garrahan miner PA effect the ore gathered?
---
Also I have opposite problem than OP. I'm happy to gather but nobody shows up to kill the mobs!
---
whats the best way to farm maps? I usually just collect them from my xp runs
---
Vids up in fallout76 settler build Reddit
---
This doesn’t allow me to post vids
---
Wait, is this THE Elianora?? Please be the actual real Elianora! :D
---
I found a place with plenty of room for large water perifiers and just run Lucky Hole Mine with my excavator PA a few times a week.
---
“Please keep calling out the tough ones”? 
---
Are these participation trophies now?
---
No worries friend, I hope you enjoy it when you start playing again! Happy to help with any other questions you have in the future if you wanna reply to this thread!
---
thanks! I'm gonna try this out right now
---
They usually announce it ahead of time, suprising really, thought there may have been with the current dupe.
---
Buy them 100 caps on market page or player vendor.
---
Thanks for this! It there any specific zones/methods to farm exp? I heard west two is nice, the radiation rumble event is great, project paradise isn’t too bad, right? Any insight on if I’m better off server hopping for those three things? Or are there other places to farm while waiting for events to pop?
---
This is the only gun I have ever bought a skin for. I love my lever.
---
Yes you did.
---
That Quack Doctor is so great, and more raider content is always welcome. If the Chally stuff is Meatweek rewards, it's better than an Atom Shop bundle, I love the content but wouldn't pay for it.
---
I'm on Xbox and it's the same for me, they both are active/doable everyday.
---
Foundation does have 2 if you do Davenport's Photo quest. It all helps out in the end.
---
Not me, chief! I'm on xbox, but I'd I was there I would've helped you. Us Seven-Sixers gotta stick together
---
Yes. Basically any weapon with a high enough rate of fire and one of a few first or secondary legendary effects (instigating, junkies, and a couple others for first, limb damage, +30% VATS accuracy, and a couple others for the second) do dramatically more damage than they should. Because it is the effective rate of fire rather than the listed rate of fire, explosive weapons like the Gauss Minigun or weapons with the explosive secondary effect only need 100 rate of fire to trigger the Magic effect. What that does in combat against enemies with large health pool is it glitched and does really low damage per shot, but seems to add each consecutive hit's damage to the next hit's damage limited apparently by the lag of the server (lower lag is actually better for this effect).
---
It is definitely a glitch. A magic Minigun can kill a level 95 behemoth in about 1 second.
---
I've made multiple posts and nobody seems to have any
---
yes, any given action be it killing, finishing an event, building will max at 4k exp. Talk from shady people who did the god-mode exp glitch could only get 4k exp per action
---
I just dont want to be a part of your team. I like running around alone and not feeling like I have to do things with a team.
---
Absolutely! It was my go-to rifle in 3 and New Vegas, and I was excited when Far Harbor brought them to 4. As soon as I saw they’d be in 76, I knew I was making a rifle build again. 
---
My only real frustration is that they are (along with Gauss Rifles) the most broken rifles in VATs, which really dampens their usefulness for my build.
---
if only there was an option to sell vital equipment to the raiders and tell that to Ward's face... :D
---
The flyboy helmet changes it to a more yellow color
---
What system?
---
Yeah I’m surprised they didn’t just disable vendors and work on a fix in the meantime. Seems like that would have taken a couple hours to implement. Oh well...
---
Xbox one
---
I have almost 9,000 atoms and will not spend a one until the end.  It doesn't make sense to buy now when I have weeks to keep playing.  I will get to the end and see how many levels I have left.
---
Closure was more valuable than 3 bullions notes and 5 missiles. :D
---
If you're on pc you can do that in the files.
---
That item is the single most expensive item for bullion in the whole game.
---
Maybe that's when they'll implement it, lol. "Hey, we know you decided to not renew your annual subscription but look at this *shiny new feature we just finished developing*."
---
Yes? We're playing their game every day, grinding away. That should be enough to complete the board. None of them are "tough" as in "challenging". They're tedious and time consuming.
---
Usually low levels that havent discovered bloody builds yet
---
Oh I'd love to. I sided with the raiders and everytime I go to him for a daily he says he tells me he can't believe I'd show my face before saying I'm the only one who can help him lol
---
Yeah.  What makes it so bad is that they don't even do anything to dress the process up and make it more interesting.  You just fast travel to Area 'x', pick up item/kill NPC, and fast travel back.  
---
There's more than one, "quest" in this game that has you spending more time looking at loading screens than actually *doing* anything.
---
It’s not about playing with friends. Right now I’m guessing the majority or new players are dupe accounts. Friends list doesn’t matter. They create the accounts, and use them to dupe. The account gets banned who cares, pay $1 and create a new one.
---
They may have removed from the faq. It was NEVER included in the membership benefits table though. The membership benefits table is what is “advertised”.
---
They included it there so people know to maybe consider 1st in the future. It never was advertised as being included in your subscription. We don’t know whether they still have plans to add those features (though a month or so ago they did mention mod support is coming). The fact is they were never promised to be available in the near term.
---
[Edit: it’s still there on the announcement page](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-announce)
---
&gt;	Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence. We’ve also received a lot of questions about playing Fallout 76 with mods and this, too, is something we’re excited to add to private worlds in the future.
---
Language is intentionally vague and they certainly are not advertised benefits in any sense of the word.
---
Well, you don't unlock ALL their plans until you hit Ally with them, and then you can't lower your rep from there as far as I can tell.
---
You can be alone, but also on the pub team for the benefits.
---
Crater also has the one where you can abuse an exploit by leaving the conversation to get endless reputation.
---
Yeah, I'm sure I do both all the time.
---
I even split the treasure and gained ally status only a few days apart with the Raiders and Settlers. I figured it was because Rocksy doesn't let you refuse a reward for extra rep.
---
Edit: On PC
---
I'm lucky to have friends playing, we just jumped to die from fall damage and revived each other.
---
Oh really? Once you hit ally you're locked in as such?
---
Nice. Thanks alot, you made me feel better about my purchase and the inevitable 5 levels of makeshift warrior I need to now get!
---
If you’re looking for mods. The brotherhood vendor has them. The one in watoga. Not the train station, the one inside with all those buildings. 
---
Sometimes you can try your luck and go to whitespring and check the brotherhood vendor there. You can simply buy the plan for the mod, or just the mod itself.
---
Returning player(played very little at release though), if I drop stuff at the Vault 76 entrance how long will it last and will others be able to see them and pickup the items?
---
The realest of real Elianoras! :D
---
*throws a curtsy*
---
If you are just after mod plans it's a little easier at least, treasure maps and distant thunder as others have said.  It's the plans like "t60 left arm" that are a giant PITA.  
---
Kind of hard to do legitimately now but holiday gifts are seriously the best bet for actual PA piece plans.  Only knew one or two plans before the holiday event and by the time it was over was only like 2 peices short of being able to build full sets of any PA.
---
Also for mods, any brotherhood vendor should sell any and every mod plan you need for the T series armors.
---
I assume so, I slaughter friendly Raiders and Settlers I come across in the wild all the time. Nothing. The others with them don't even fight back.
---
Foundation has/had a exploit aswell.
---
This is great.
---
This post gave me second hand revenge satisfaction. I hate it when people nab my sh*t.
---
U actually can lol
---
Scrap the pieces for a chance at the plans
---
Agreed. This "Legendary Run" isn't fun. The fact that they made the timing so tight on it just proves everything you said. Everything they put in this game lately seems designed not for fun or for the benefit of the player but to make some suit happy with numbers.
---
You're the best! Much love and keep blessing the fallout universe with all your awesome work! I feel like I just met a celebrity
---
This has been happening to my friend and I a lot lately.  I chalk it up to server lag due to the influx of Games Pass players this month but who knows?
---
Looks like you're gonna eat the 50 caps then lol
---
September, the 15th I believe.
---
Are you all playing through GamePass? u/_FatFist_ u/butihaveadollar u/Mucronsrevenge u/MrInvisible17
---
Will there also be a free to try in this event?
---
I have 70 gifts ive been saving, guess I'm gonna be opening them now
---
I believe mine is two shot fast fire rate and reload?  I gotta double check. But it doesn’t melt anything like you described. Does good but not like that.

The super mutant run is huntersville, west rep, national Isolates radio array, and the steakhouse.
---
Those are good plus said events and line in the sand.
---
Ah that's right enough, I remember now, cheers!
---
That poor robot. He’s just not that smart. I have lost count of the “jumped by raiders” I’ve told him in efforts of getting some reward from him. After maxing both out, I do sell them to him... and sometimes I don’t, for old times sake. 🤣
---
Yes. Very much so. I mainly notice it when the numbers come up that should one-shot something, and it just stands there until I shoot it again. 
---
I also noticed it on the Windigo boss. Was hitting for 140 damage per round, so it should have gone down in 500 rounds max. But it took more like 2-3k.
---
I just got one yesterday:D
---
Oh, that's more than I thought. Thanks!
---
That's the beauty of public teams. You can play 100% solo as always, while also getting the benefits of the team.
---
First night of public groups this event was done in ~two minutes. Now it’s max timer and level 2 rewards maybe.
---
In the packs, they are random. However, every time you level up you have access to choose **any** card that can be used at your current level. 
---
If you are talking about NW, they are random.
---
Aaww:D
---
Well, in case you play 76 on PC, I hope we bump into each other sometime! :D
---
I have my decontamination arc in my garage (it's the entrance to Sofia's "Ground Control" I built), so it does get in the way of access to two of my work benches... But only my workbenches.

And despite that fact, I still slapped a switch on it to turn it off. Like, it isn't hard to hook up an "off button". 
---
I'm not a bloodied build, but I understand the annoyance of it. 
---
So, guys... At the very least... Just slap a switch next to the bloody thing.
---
if you dont want to buy them from other players vendors (between 20 and 150 caps each) you can always farm them. they way i did it was draw up a map of easy to kill/find crown enemies and go around the map and farm them for a few hours. while the map i was using is now completely out of date it did work for what i needed it to before wastelands hit.
---
Gunsmith is perk that i would recommend any player taking ranks in. Your guns breaking slower is a huge boon at lower levels when resources are harder to get, and it helps you keep up with your own gear. Also, putting points into your intelliegence special gives you a permanent xp boost. Having 5 points into INT and gunsmith will mean 50% slower breakage, the ability to make and mod almost any ballistic gun, with a 10% permanent xp boost as the cherry.
---
Exactly. I keep wanting to pick up my hunting rifle again, especially for the ghillie skin I’m about to get, but it’s just so inferior to the lever or even the gauss as far as low fire rate rifles. Much more of a tactical squad weapon for a sniper but that doesn’t really go down in this game, sadly...
---
Aligned makes vats cheaper
---
Id say the only really noteworthy difference comes with aligned stocks/barrels as the give some bonus AP to use in vats.
---
I noticed that with my commando vats build as well since patch 20 was released. I think it might be seriously bugged, I'm aware there are some perks that broke with that patch so possibily vats has broken too. It's seriously gamebreaking for me atm, I literally just force myself to login to do dailies for score and even that's a pain because only after 5 shots or so the damage is registered. I'm also eating up double the ammo, is just not worth to play like this. 
---
But I don't want to change my build because of bugs. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.
---
Why do people keep saying they are time consuming???  I've never once had my dailys take more than an hr (this includes the leveling one and I'm 200+)
---
Dailys
---
1: chew gum 3 secs 2: kill ten scorched 60 secs 3: biuld 5 floor or wall decorations 10 secs that's 750 score in less than 2 mins how is this time consuming? You just want everything handed to you on a silver plater and spoon fed to you is what it sounds like
---
Yeah that’s a shame. I’m a bloodied and build and just got a TSE yesterday... hoping I can trade it for a BE lol
---
Not bloodied, but don't want to lose mutations, so I'll just leave
---
Shoot the ghouls’ legs out. Make sure they are all crawling. Then no more ghouls will spawn and you can solo this event to max rewards.
---
Happens to me all the time. I try to work around it by burst firing and holding the critical button. Crits usually guarantee a hit so holding the button while I burst fire forces the game to register damage. I’ve noticed it since patch 20. It sucks and needs to get fixed.
---
I’ve had this happen to me a couple times on my Xbox
---
I do and that works the best but get kicked
---
I get this issue from time to time and what fixes it for me is to load up and log in to a different online game. Close said game and relaunch fo76. It has worked every time for me.
---
Line in the sand is another good one. 
---
Generals Steakhouse has Super Mutants, although in my experience theyre usually low levels which is odd. 
---
Robco isn’t amazing but has a decent amount of bots. 
---
There is currently a sort of xp farm, but I’d rather not mention it so it doesn’t become common knowledge or patched soon. It does give you 10k xp every few minutes though.
---
I don’t see stuff like this much. One guy I met on 76 always dropped Nuka Colas when I visited his camp. He was a sweetie for doing that. Would always drop something as well. ❤️
---
Didn’t know that, thanks.
---
I see. I’m not a primary vats user. I’ll use it to center the camera or on low level high volume stuff like mole miners or scorched. But I tend to ads more.
---
I've had many a workshop taken from me by high levels. I'm off doing quests and they just come in and swipe it. Its never a lower level, only ever a lvl 200 or higher. Like WTH? Im far enough in campaign to actually use the nukes, or else I would gladly do something that petty. I'm a lvl 70 who minds their business, but that is one of my peeves.
---
Omg, this is the worst thing.
---
Finally someone acknowledges the auto-complete at Bethesda.
---
It's just such a high failure rate if you don't have more than a couple people who actually do the objective.
---
I have one issue with this event. And it's other players. I know I can slaughter ghouls easily, so I usually like to defend for the first minutes or two with the asumption that others will gather ore, basically just to make sure things are under control. However, most of the time no one else will go get ore. So I'll go, and a good portion of the time at least one NPC will be slapped to death by the time I'm done with one tunnel.
---
It's probably been about 1 in 10 times where I've gone to it and there's been either enough bodies to have things go well, or at the very least a couple people that actually know what they're doing. So I usually wait a few minutes to see if anyone actually joined the event before I waste the time fast traveling over there, just to be disappointed. Because it really *should* be a fun event.
---
Until I yeet a Nuke at you
---
I tried that, I open just the last played game and tried another, nothing happened. My Wi-Fi is extremely slow so it's going to take a while to see if it worked or not.
---
Yeah sure, won’t be on for a little while though. Don’t need caps, just provide the mats.
---
Since this post i have moved my decontamination shower
---
Trying to trade a TSE for a BE one lol. I had a BE one but it glitched and disappeared from my inventory, never to be seen again..
---
Yea I'm ps4 and have a helmet and chest plan...sucks.
---
I tend to go for aligned, for the same mentioned reason, as it makes each shot-per-VATS cheaper.
---
However, you can also opt for the ‘forceful’ stock... as this also keeps the VATS bonus, but dramatically increases the durability bar, which means more shots before needing repair.
---
Wasnt the antler chandelier a NW reward?
---
If so, you cant place it at others camps
---
7 weeks left as of today. This began the 3rd week. So you’d need to get about 14-15 ranks per week to hit the rank 100 before the 10th week. Not hard to do at all. I’m at rank 30 for the past 2 weeks of it and I haven’t even done the nuclear winter challenges. Just boost your xp gains and you’ll get ranks pretty quickly.
---
Then you use your hotkeyed mele weapon!
---
Taco Tuesday?...
---
(servers shut down)....
---
(eats tacos to drown sorrow)...
---
(servers come back online)
---
(continues eating tacos)
---
lol.. you serious?
---
if they were going to fix it before the next patch.. it would be done by now
---
It's a shame when I do the follow me emote nobody turns up. I don't even have push to talk on. I was telling the other 3 people in the party to get there ass on me.
---
They missed out on tapping atleast five 3*** legendarys.
---
It was 70 days from launch but no exact end date was specified, except ‘middle of September’. Presume 70 days is the 15th, as that’s a Tuesday.
---
Bummer. Reinstalling the game should do the trick. The very first time I had this issue I did a reinstall and it fixed it. After that I read about the trick of launching a different game and that has worked for me when I get this issue. It seems I get this issue every couple months.
---
start one yourself than.  90% of the players dont care what level you are as long as you give them a bonus.
---
Anti armor because if you miss one shot on a furious you reset it. And max damage bonus I believe is 50%, 10% per hit til 50% max on 5 shots in a row. While Anti Armor would be more consistent for more enemies.
---
Thats fine, I deserve it and would love if someone took the trouble to do it lmao.  I've nuked my own camp a few times to take cool pictures of it in the nuke zone.
---
Sadly, no.
---
Keep trying on the market page and vendor hop.  Unfortunately they put maps in the misc category on the overview so invest in travel agent perk because you'll get to alot of camps with trash or serums.
---
(builds dumpster)
---
"displayed"
---
if you do that . you will get the people who create a toon justot do the level up challenge daily. and they will take it and its gone. never drop items to anyone below lvl 3. that is the level a person has to be in order to complete the daily SCORE challenge.
---
the game only seems to completely shit its pants for me running it through steam. opening a crafting bench or my stash or cooking or the fav wheel, framerate drops to 5-10ish and everything i do has a massive delay. social menu is slower. accidentally scrapping things i dont want to scrap happens a lot due to the delay (been through so many padded blue jackets that it's not even funny).
---
not so through the bethesda launcher only using the same account and toon on the same pc. seems to run fine - for a given value of fine, obviously - but no delay on benches or stash etc.
---
it's super weird.
---

---
Th at what I did for an explosive handmade I have. Just dumped the durability mods on it. But I feel it’s only for that reason and that there are better options.
---
Atleast we can scrip them.
---
delicious lead water
---
I just want you clean when I turn on the radiation traps, so you suffer for the maximum time.
---
u lala what a surprise.
---
One can hope they fix it soon. Lol.
---
Honestly Bethesda has been very pro raider with this dlc.... atom shop are also a prime example of this. 
---
There are random encounters that can help with getting the rep but again there is more raider in counters then foundation I noticed. Like I sided with the settlers and I still maxed out raider rep while my settlers rep is at “friendly” still.
---
Are you hard farming for that level up? I can get most of the challenges knocked out in under an hour, but leveling takes way longer when I'm just playing normally after I get the easy challenges done. 
---
That said I don't have a grinding build so must high level enemies give me ~100 xp so that makes my level ups take much longer.
---
This is more about the Legendary Run than actual levels, since beyond the dailies it’s 10k XP per 100 score.
---
Forceful stocks are your friend.
---
intensity in tent city
---
i am well aware i can craft all kinds of items for them , including weapons and guns. crafting 1 item that give 20 items vs locating 20 items before they run off
---
I just do them for the 9 tnotes, but not the fucking radio  vacuum tubes!
---
Im Level 23 now  yeah.
---
Dumb question of the thread coming up. Does this only work with those groovy rectangular Vault tec generators? Also how much power do they put out?
---
500 caps they cost apparently... blimey
---
Absolutely! Here's a video tour. Since I recorded this I've made some slight changes which I'll note below. 
---
https://youtu.be/-tH7L3ADxSs
---
The Responder Village includes: trading post (i use a log cabin for this now), community kitchen (now Becketts Bar), armory, primary residence cabin, bunkhouse, private sleeping room, lavatory, clinic, workshop/ power plant,  and a Chem shop with a band stand tacked on the side. 
---
I've updated some of the structures with some of the atom shop stuff that's come out since April but really the camp structure has remained mostly the same since I built the place before wastelanders
---
https://youtu.be/ElLSKWFsOIc heres link for the trailer lmk what ya think
---
I know it was bugged awhile ago and you could, the water wheel as well
---
Of course, I should've clarified about forming the same kind of team. LIke I've had building teams with 2 people on them, and then someone comes along and forms a new building team for some reason.
---
Mmmm 3 weeks ago i put some NW rewards on a friends camp. If Beth didn't patch it, you can do it
---
I'm set up there too. I feel like it gets a decent amount of traffic which is good for selling.
---
Yeah, none of those trigger the "magic" effect. FFR only helps if you have a magic primary effect on a gun that can't usually reach a high enough rate of fire to trigger it.
---
On a positive note I finally got the Field Medic achievement because of the decreased life expectancy of new players.
---
monkeys could fly out of my butt too.. lol
---
I hope it does Work. This is the first time it has happened since I got the game, since launch. It was fine when playing on my main but I decided to play on my alt and when I loaded in after an extemly long loading screen I got the error code and tried to load back in to fallout and got the msg every time. It happened the night before to when I tried loading in to my alt again.
---
Yes this, I always start a Building team and switch it to Events when I actually go do an event. If I’m hunting SB I’ll switch to Legendary if I come across one.
---
Dude. You needn’t pay folk for that kind of thing. 
---
Which missions you want help with? I’d understand if it was for the big kahuna missions: Encryptid, Project Paradise or Radiation Rumble, but whoever helps would earn sufficient rewards from quest completion in any case.
---
What time you on?
---
same
---
Oh absolutely.
---
Works with all the little ones but the others blow out smoke. And it’s 3 but lights ect only need a source of power near them.
---
well put :D
---
Ah was wondering what the point of that type was.
---
What does the Endurance one do? Other than boost endurance?
---
Join a public team and use your mic.  I’ve made a couple new friends the last two weeks using this method.
---
Stupid Flanders...
---
I made a bunch of lvl 20 fixers and put them in my vendor. Along with a sign that says 200 rounds of .45 free with purchase.
---
Starched genes card!
---
High levels can get a level 3 terminal in the lobby of any nuke silo (pretty sure, I did mine at site Charlie).
---
Justice? You were giving away free shit so they took the free shit. Surely what they do with it after is up to them?
---
Just an update...   but we did successfully pull this off last night.. this time with no hitches.
---
Since there were not enough high level players on the server to have a chance at the SB Queen, i nuked Whitesprings.   First let me apologize to the guy that had his camp placed right on the corner of my nuke zone.    I totally didn't see it until after the fact.   Thankfully he did get logged out before the nuke fell.
---
second.... the Whitesprings was a total dud.  we only found like 2 legendaries in the area, and there were almost no spawns, most of the place was just empty.   its this something that has changed?
---
No matter it was still a fun night, and i did make quite a bit of XP.
---
Man I wish we had that. Such a pain you need to activate a critical
---
(sad peppermill noise)
---
NW what is this?
---
I know only one Battle  Royal Modus, its in the WWF/WWE.
---
i wouldnt want this for a heavy weapon at all. but i would like this on auto rifles as im unarmed and use tormentor to cripple scorchbeast wings to make them land.
---
im on now
---
They legit can’t do that. It’s 2000 score per level at 40. 
---
Dailies barely give enough for one level. The rest relies on the repeatable.
---
I join teams with my shiny new level 1/2s fresh out of the Vault, when I can’t be bothered to grind XP for the level up challenge on my mains. The Int boost is small but helpful for the extra XP.
---
What weapons do you use? Curious to see how it would benefit you.
---
Aside from the interior design/material classes (which is the lack of options rather than your fault and I see what you were going for!) It looks really cool and definitely one of the more "civilised" camps I've seen here that are community based
---
the mission is called belly of the best
---
Have you checked Mappallachia?
---
how did he kill your friends?
---
I wish their range wasn’t ass, i am on the cliff side near Foundation and all I can do is launch artillery for aesthetics.
---
i have to use the brotherhood emergency transponder
---
It's not just you.
---
I think there is disagreement between the client and the server over whether or not the hit was actually committed, and the client is responsible for the damage number.  So, on your end, you think you hit it.  But the server looks at it and rejects the hit.  Possibly because it sees the relative position of you and the Scorchbeast differently than you do, and believes you missed the shot.
---
That's great! Makeshift is a good card to have if you do much melee anyway especially if you want to regularly mod your weapons. You'll cover those levels in no time!
---
It'll be patch 21, I'm sure (August 4th).
---
Lovely story, count of Monte Cristo vibez
---
You're talking about, hands down, the easiest set of dailies we've had that I can recall. It's not always like that. In general I don't think any of the Adventure mode dailies have been a big deal, though. Nuclear Winter ones can be a bitch, on the other hand. For every "place your camp!" or "use photomode" there's a "kill 9 creatures" or "revive 2 players" which are undeniably a tedious affair unless you luck out and find a ton of creatures, have friends or at least some kind of communication about helping each other with revives, or love Nuclear Winter so much that you don't care how long it takes to nab those dailies.
---
So yeah, I'm fine with people "calling out the tough ones" so I don't have to spend so much time in a game mode I have little interest in other than playing some hide and seek occasionally.
---
Also, I think the Legendary Run should at least be FUN if it's going to have some challenge to it. It's a board game theme, so why are so many of these challenges boring as hell?  They should have done some kind of Fasnacht-style ongoing event that rewards a little SCORE every time you do it. Or more oddball challenges like "kill something with a flare gun". I dunno.
---
The poor brahmin :( it wasn't his fault
---
If I had a camp near a silo, I’d sell those and keycards and troubleshooter legendaries.
---
I mean, really, nobody is forcing you to go through a decon arch.  Some players (me) have one  for personal use and the vendors are just for passive income.  So it isn't really a big deal if I lose a sale here or there.  I also don't put a switch on it because that takes precious space from my camp budget which is already strained.   The placement of the arch is also thematic, to decon someone before they enter my C.A.M.P so that they don't spread their dirty, dirty radioactive mess everywhere.
---
In addition, I don't know if you were genuinely interested or just being kind of shitty but here's a few more "town" style builds. Both these iterations were built on the same spot, near Charleston Fire Station, hence the name "Chucktown" for my camps. 
---
First attempt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKc4JY3d_6w&amp;t=76s
---
Chucktown Rebuilt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiA5yzy8xBw
---
I miss Preston.
---
Auto rifles. I think those are the main people who would benefit. My main is heavys (lvl 340) and I would never use it on him. But my commando toon would use it all the time since every other or every third hit can be a crit
---
That'll show him!!
---
My friends heeded my call for aid, and tried to shield me. He mowed them down like a bunch of younglings.
---
You can also get an encounter to fight some cannibals that are holding them hostage here speak to juliette
---
Yeah well at least it provides useful bonuses like the stealth and pretty much a direct upgrade from the hazmat but with damage and energy resistance and stealth capabilities unlike the SS helmet for 1650 bullion or something stupid like that
---
You should get that checked. Too much radiation.
---
[You seem to know a lot about it](https://imgur.com/guq6VSL)
---
:D
---
99% of it is scrip as its not max level, and most people either don’t read the instructions or just refuse to mine ore. 
---
I for one prefer no one showing up now, as I can kill every single ghoul and get 300~ score.
---
Haha, you're a quick learner.   Stealing has been in every fallout game, this is the mf wasteland
---
I kept a Vampire Combat Rifle just to paint it with the pumpkin paint. 10/31 twenty-four seven.
---
thx
---
This is why Fallout 1st is vital for me. I farm a lot of Acid but if I take Hemlock on a public server, I guarantee it'll be taken from me. I do all my farming now on a private server. Problem solved 🤗
---
I run bloodied and the high capacity backpack. It’s fine, the only time I would notice it is in the nuke zone but I swap to Chinese stealth anyways and wear it and have to take a radaway diluted every 5 minutes or so. It’s not that bad. I just carry multiple backpacks anyways, I have all of them and swap as as needed. I usually start with the armor one, then when I get too heavy I swap to a chemist or grocers, then swap to a high capacity. But then I don’t notice too much of an issue or take a diluted radx and then leave the high capacity on and forget about it
---
Yea free stuff to use not to resell for themselfs.
---
I had not considered or even realised that. So I appreciate the information. That does change things a little :) Thanks heaps
---
I definitely would not use it as a perk and would avoid it as a legendary effect..
---
I have no issues dealing crits manually
---
Yes, and it's terrible.
---
With VATS specifically, it's often like that particular limb will just refuse to take any damage, full stop.  It's not unusual that I have to cycle through different parts until I find one that does.
---
Lol, just basic math, with each bobblehead giving 5%, youd need around a 1,000 to 1,333 times increase on the original xp, which is simply converted to percentage and divided to get your total
---
Did not know that either, so thank you very much. :)
---
Hahah thx yeah the lighting and wiring really kills the budget sadly just waiting for a camp glitch to make the casino better
---
Doesn't work with PA, for plans. Doesn't work with anything for getting the base weapon plan.
---
I didn't think it was possible but you managed to find a way to dumb down the combat to a lower level than it already is at which is impressive.  This would effectively reduce combat to just point and click which it already is for the most part.
---
Thank you. I’m looking forward to the upcoming patch! :-)
---
So what roll should I aim for as a non-bloody/junkie player to maybe get the magic effect?
---
to heal rads off of others i slip into open groups and share the card that heals rads during the day, other times ill share autostim. also, idea for decom arches, link them to a powered door, locked in till clean.
---
If you run ore you don't get the XP, loot and legendaries of the people not doing the work.
---
That is an extraordinarily awful design.
---
Most people aren't capable of killing ghouls fast enough to stop them from causing the event to fail.  So most people don't show up.
---
Usually 1st person for me, definitely while in combat. Only switch to 3rd person when I’m running around the map for extended periods of time.
---
I'm right near the lake bed on the eastern side. I've noticed how popular that area has become lately
---
Is the clown trailer one no longer worker?
---
thx :)
---
Get them both. They're situational. Then get all of the other ones when you get the chance.
---
How did you fix it on Xbox? I have uninstalled it and I'm now reinstalling it
---
Once I hit allied with both sides I did the same thing and swore off the rep dailies too until I realized Ward has the best daily in the game.  2 fast travels and 1 kill for 11 scrip and 30 GB (3 treasury notes).  Plus I'm always curious as to where in foundation I will find him lol
---
but score is independent of game mode as it contains both NW and adventure mode challenges
---
They also can be found in locked toolboxes in the Mire and Cranberry Bog
---
Decontamination showers in real life just wash off surface radioactive debris so if they hurt from it it would be because of the pressure the water comes out in, maybe if the shower used STB it could burn but not due to some molecular changes occuring, it would be more of a surface irritation due to the compound.
---
Source: have to know it for my job
---
I have never joined a public team and did anything with the others. Give me my 4 Intelligence, my Strange in Numbers, and caps whenever you do stuff.
---
Strange in Numbers, Empath, and Herd Mentality. All the reason you need to join a team.
---
Had to move my camp because I went through 3 servers tonight that didn't have room for it in that location. Now I have a lovely view over the cliff near site alpha

So are you saying it should work with the basic generator I have? Because I tried that &amp; failed.
---
I have all of the non Atom Shop generators listed here. I tried it with the smallest one
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Generator_(Fallout_76)
---
The only downside I've noticed is the lack of nukes going off so less flux to harvest, but I can just use my secondary if I run out of ultracite ammo. However in saying that, I did manage to sell 21 building plans yesterday to one player so I think thats really a bonus
---
That is brilliantly cruel and sadistic.  Would you like a job at Vault-Tec?
---
Bloodied...the Karens of the wasteland
---
VATS is pretty point and click as it is... High AP and Bloodied Commando can shred things easily.
---
hi just wondering if you still have the link? wanted to look at it on the forums myself.
---
Now i have to say i just did the same event woth 2 random guys and they recked everything lol i was running around with a shot gun trying to get kills. So without that bad experience 1st overall pretty dope game
---
I thought that's what VATS was.
---
hence the "which it already is for the most part" portion of my comment.
---
Nah it’s patched
---
Oh what was it? Do you have a link?
---
yup hence the  "which it already is for the most part" portion of my comment.
---
Mandala Workshops haha.
---
Some people really don’t want their water taken. Haha. You gotta do what you gotta do to survive. I’d have given you water had that been my camp, then again when I do have water sources I leave them unlocked. I get so much from events.
---
I am so gonna fuck with my brother tonight. LMAO, thanks for the info
---
Because it's explosive....
---
Legacy lasers are super fragile.
---
Only reason I clicked, was curious if someone actually killed something with it.
---
Should be able to. Progress is tied to Bethesda ID
---
In it to win it. It’s Monkey Stein or nothing.
---
Explosive melts durability.
---
? What’s the bug
---
i would much rather see a perk go toward being able to "mini crit" outside of VATS.  think like old overdrive, used the living shit out of it until it was nerfed/changed.
---
only time i really use vats is when im trying to find where TF the last few enemies are hiding
---
Don't take it personal, at 359 myself i kill anyone with a bounty when im not busy only because of the kill 76 players with a bounty challenge. If he did continue attacking afterwards all you have to do is walk away, and don't look for revenge.
---
What does? The generator to power it? I’m gonna play around with it tonight though for sure
---
Could the beam splitter be making it worse than it should be?
---
Ya, you’re not really missing out. This was a one off event for sure. Artillery concept is awesome, the execution leaves a lot to be desired tho.
---
That's pretty cool, can you add any customized images, like screenshots etc?
---
Ya, the communication in the game needs an update.  Anymore I drop what I'm doing when I see the "follow" emote.  Either they need help or they found something they think I might want and they are being nice enough to share it. When someone goes out of there way like that I want to support them.
---
Hey Griggs heres what i did to get ally faster with both camps
---
once i hit Ally with the faction i chose at the end of wastelanders  (raiders) , i started giving the davenport photos i took of Crater to the NPC at foundation  i lost 0 rep from the Raiders once i hit Ally  , it helped me get Ally with them way faster , also the random encounters are a grind but can speed things up too  marigolds pavillion / slocum joes
---
I have most of the red rocket ... But yes if there's a prefab.  Yes.

Welcome to the newest grind. Rerolling for 3* Unyielding SS armor pieces. I have two and really good chest piece and one decent leg. Been at it for months.

It wont let you put in any after you put in one even if you have a stack of several hundred like i do
---
It wasnt the guy I stole from. Just a high level looking to get some caps Haha. Funny thing was when I snuck into his camp, he was selling purified water for like 5000 caps. Apparently he is a real water enthusiast.
---
I guess this would free up a finger from holding triangle all the time but it's not like I need the extra digit for all the complex button sequences this game has. It would be a hard no from me, I'd prefer a perk with actual utility not just unnecessary QoL.
---
Idk.  But it's still probably gonna break really fast no matter which mods you use.
---
i think they meant the extra technical data you already have can't be used to trigger/complete the quest in rapid succession
---
Instead of coming over to borrow a cup of sugar, he could be coming over for murder... !
---
If only we could trade these. I have two really nice vanguard pieces I don’t use but can’t scrap.
---
Got a link on anything to the info?
---
I’ve had this issue several times, especially in VATS. Drives me crazy.
---
You can win it with 2 people. You just have to defend the scavenger in the back room while one person collects.  Then swap places and do the same thing.
---
Only thing that would improve it would be max level ghouls.
---
I. GOT. MY. REVENGE.
---
I’ve only been crafting with the damn modules for a month or so...I was pissed when I realized they didn’t fall under the 25% off sale. But I guess it makes sense, we would at least know what we were crafting at a 25% discount, buy from mumbles and it’s random...weapon or armor. Good luck man
---
I’m at work at the moment. I will be on later, about 7 hours from now.
---
The mission that you’re on is part of the main quest line anyhow. You need to find the 5 little radio towers scattered around the cranberry bog  area, get the ID card from the dead soldier at Glassed Cavern and go to the top floor of the Asylum / Fort Defiance. Mission done!
---
throw them away and pick up a freshie..
---
Sell your Crater pictures for Ward for no reward and turn in the device for no reward. Only way to really level Settlers post missions.
---
I would avoid rad resist in perks / mods etc. Its really not very effective. Even if you stack it up to say 900+ somehow it still wont compete with Hazmat / Stealth Suits / Powerarmour for when you really need it (ie nuke zones).     
---
I guess Id go for the high cap one if the choice is between the two.
---
You shouldn't have to do that
---
It absolutely is worth it. It's cheap to get and even though it technically isn't the "best" unarmed weapon, it still hits really hard and is way easier to obtain than deathclaw gauntlets and powerfists.
---
I highly recommend it to use even if you plan on getting a bloodied swing speed deathclaw or powerfist - it will be a great for in between.
---
[Preston LOVED that]
---
Yes the beam splitter breaks it even more
---
Thanks.
---
Shame about that.
---
100%. Explosive makes it degrade 2x as fast. The splitter makes it degrade 5x as fast. Both makes it degrade 10x as fast. Derogation is proced per hit.
---
I'm level like 250 and only until 10 levels or so ago I even knew this was a button for crits. 
---
I can't tell you the amount of atoms I missed for skipping the crit challenges. I could never get them to process.
---
People are morons.  They whined there weren't NPCs in the game when we had Rose, Biv and great questlines like Mistress of Mysteries or discovering what happened to the Brotherhood.  Literally some of the best NPCs and quests in the Fallout universe.
---
But apparently stupid people need to have some fake "choices" to hit enter on for it to be an NPC in their "minds" and not just them talking through your pipboy.
---
So now the world is filled with "NPCs" that constantly vomit vacuous lines over and over any time they get triggered by proximity, and some of them will give you terrible fetch quests, but, get this, you get to select meaningless options in a menu, so HURRY, herp derp, it's an NPC!
---
Saddly no
---
I’ve seen people sell it for that. The water better give me 1,000 damage resistance and full days play of hydration for that cost. Haha. 😂
---
I don't know if it will help, but I've renamed my armour so that they all appear next to each other in the pipboy. For my main armour, it's: aa Chest, aa LA, aa LL, as RA and as RL. My unyielding set is: bb Chest, bb LA etc. Totally agree that one button preset would be amazing, or if we could put it on the quick wheel would be amazing too (imagine if when you're low on health in a fight switching out to a bolstering/unyielding set to save yourself!)
---
The 5 ‘emergency transponder’ things look like little satellite dishes on a tripod. You’ll know it’s the right one, as it’ll produce a button prompt when you’re close enough and facing it.
---
how do you even get the artillery? been on and off the game and I've been back for a week now.
---
Can you bomb any camp anytime or only after provoking attacks
---
ok.. hold them and never be able to use them.. I dont care, its not my inventory
---
People before machines. Put that ally to work.
---
a bloodied explosive laser is literally a glass cannon's glass cannon
---
Where you throw the flare
---
1. Rate of fire over 200 or over 100 with the explosive legendary effect.
---
2. At least one of the following legendary effects: Instigating/Junkies/Medics/Stalkers/+33% VATS Hit Chance/+50% Limb Damage/+Bashing Damage.
---
That's all you need. The effect triggers more consistently on unlaggy servers. It is very apparent if you have damage numbers turned on because the damage numbers will be far lower than the damage you can see on high HP enemy's health bar. The rolls I'd like to have are bloodied rolls on guns that don't need explosive to hit 200 effective fire rate, like a bloodied +limb damage Gatling laser would be sweet for easy SBQ solos at little cost.
---
You can bomb at any time but it won't do any damage unless they have a bounty
---
We had better and more compelling quests before "NPCs."
---
Happening all the time. If I back out of vats and go back in it seems to work. Needless to say it has gotten me killed more than once.
---
Zenimax make more money off the crown store sales so it make sense they will leave it for free on both gamepass and psnow
---
this guy gets it
---
It's a minor thing. If you're searching the military wing as soon as you find a technical data stop searching the desks. Go hand it in and then server hop. When you go back to the military wing anything that was left in the drawers could now be a technical data. Rinse and repeat. It's not ideal but it makes it better.
---
That's what I meant too ;)
---
(sad brahmin noise)
---
Im not saying i wont do that, but this is a shitty mechanic that beth needs to fix. Im not looking for some alternative method of doing it by a player, im looking for beth to fix a serious problem instead of having we the players create our own shitty fix for it
---
I started watching WestWorld recently and for the first time in my life saw this gun in action -)) Looked very cool and the fire rate was much better than in this game, actually. Now I want to try it here, I guess I got couple good ones and a character already proficient in rifling -))
---
What do you mean
---
Unfortunately if you could spam the safe with all those pre-BoS tech data sheets you picked up then you just know they would be added to the Dupers list. Maybe allowing as a daily if you already have the data would be a good compromise, and it would trigger as it does now if you had none and picked a new one up.
---
Obi wan would like to know their location.
---
He was probably just doing you a favor, clearing your wanted flag
---
(Builds Chandler Bing out of Antlers)
---
Thanks, definitely will use this while i wait for beth to finally do something about this
---
lol. It sounds funny, but I walled in the entire red rocket megastop with those chained tires as walls and built max number of heavy laser and missile turrets in little tire pill boxes. It was satisfying for my workshop to be able to fight off the 2 waves of scorched on its own.
---
Because the whole playerbase of a game isn’t your community.. you are here so you probably part of the /r/fo76 community.  There a bunch of fallout 76 non toxic communities. 
---
Wanted the game not to have a bunch of ppl because of it is stupid lol
---
Yeah, I've been levelling an alt that has full strength to utilise melee, shotguns and heavy weapons but it takes alot to get all ranks of all cards! I'd previously prioritised shotguns for general play and heavies for SBQ but will spend a while ranking it up to roll it. Thanks for the help again.
---
They should work exactly how pleasant valley tickets work, literally the same mechanic. I’m in the same boat and I’m saving them because I think they’ll play a role in the upcoming dlc
---
Have you "rebuilt" your ps4 data cache? if not, google it, it solved a lot of my issues.
---
as long as its the same platform
---
RR is an easy 5-10k exp plus 4 treasury notes , I always do it on pop up
---
It used to didn’t it
---
(looks at Zorbo's green ship so far ahead of my ship on the game board)....
---
(anxiety intensifies)
---
No? I have no clue about mechanical stuff lol. I'l wait and see if the glitch isn't fixed when it's done reinstalling.
---
Exactly there’s no reason for there to be so many yet be worthless once you actually want to use them. The only people who would hate this are those BOS role players who want to feel like their skin is exclusive
---
The Nuclear Winter ones are definitely too disparate in terms of their difficulty. Revive two players compared to deploy your CAMP three times is completely different level:
---
Deploying your CAMP three times takes approximately 10 seconds once you're in the game. You queue for Nuclear Winter once, deploy your CAMPs and then you can keep playing or log out. There's no randomness - you can do it immediately, with or without a team, on one map.
---
Revive two players relies on a whole lot more. Firstly, it requires you to queue with a team, which some people don't like doing anyway. Secondly, it requires you to stay closely enough to your team that if they are downed, you can revive them. Thirdly, it requires that your teammate doesn't die before you can revive them. Fourthly, it requires that you don't die first. Fifthly, it requires that nobody else on your team revives them first because it's also their daily challenge and the right thing to do to win the game. And you have to make sure of all of those factors twice. Even very fortunate circumstances will probably mean you're playing one full game of Nuclear Winter. In reality, from when I've played Nuclear Winter before, it would probably take three or four maps to complete at least.
---
I’m not 100% sure where I got it, I think it’s one of the pretty common camp plans you get from capturing workshops...But if you’re on Xbox, I’ll place a couple for you and you can just store them
---
So *thats* what has been happening at my camp yesterday.
---
Lol same
---
Lmao 😅
---
Seems like a problem for a choice you made
---
Hopefully they do, but Bethesda isnt great with integrating obvious already built potential game mechanics into new content
---
Exactly but keep in mind achievements on steam don't trigger retroactively
---
If they fix Adrenaline they break some other important perk and then its patch 22 ...
---
Totally justified. And I’m glad you got your stuff back. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
---
I watched a YouTube video. It’s not hard at all and with a little practice you’ll have filled up shelves in no time. The way to do the wooden one is very clever.
---
ps4 sadly. will look into it and try to get some cause i need some cool stuff at my camp.
---
Apart from fallout I have no problem. The only other game that isn't working properly is RDO, that just crashes when I play but there's no surprise there that's just the game. But there are no other games that blue screen.
---
Again, I do-people tend not to join unless they’re low lvl too and some servers lack low lvls. The inconsistency is why I’m posting here
---
If you search 'atx datamine' someone did a post with all the datamines up to the last couple. It will be quicker than me trying to link stuff on my phone.
---
I've got plenty of melee and non primed weapons.  My fixer is standard just because amp is so easy to come by, or my shotguns, etc.
---
But the ones I want to use, which i don't think is too much to ask, are prime.
---
When it does come time for a queen i don't have the ammo i need for my big guns.
---
You can play however you want, and I'll play how I want.   We all do it differently.
---
I’ve not had a problem using them. What are you trying to do?
---
Endurance gives the extra HP per point, but also having a higher endurance reduces the AP needed for sprinting.  So makes sense with exploration so you can get around the map a bit faster.  It’s also supposed to reduce your chance of getting a disease, but I don’t know any of the numbers behind it. 
---
Luck gives a bonus to crit, but also increases the amount of durability of found weapons and armor.  Which is pretty useless IMHO.  But then again, it’s listed as casual so people can just use it for dicking around I guess
---
Afraid not. My main was originally a "utility" build so gathering PA plans to craft sets for my friends was my first real endgame. I tried an ungodly number of times thinking it was just a low chance for mods etc. like heavy weapons but unfortunately it wasn't.
---
Sir I would like a shielded marine wetsuit? Would you sale me?
---
I set up south of whitespring by the golf course river and regularly use my artillery to punt neighbours to other servers.
---
Yeah, i know a few of them and it doesn't make any sense that an in game skin that requires a piece of paper should be exclusive lol
---
It may or may not have been part of a bundle (with the wagon and/or silo) I can’t remember. But it was definitely offered just by itself because that’s how I got it.. 
---
I haven’t seen it for awhile I would guess it would be back late summer or early fall.

Taking into consideration that the Good Morning/ Evening sign is one of the first interactive display items we come across....  There doesn't seem any reasonable line of thought they'd be separate static signs, which no one would want in comparison.  It's almost mind boggling.
---
Hey gary why does people joining events at the end make you upset?
---
So kill the bot before it speaks. I'm untouchable now!
---
Wow. Thanks this is extremely helpful. Looks like I’ll be taking off my beam splitter until I find a better explosive gun. Thanks for the advice
---
TS is really only useful with area-of-effect weapons. I sold a TS Minigun yesterday, not a God weapon but for a lower level player it could put up a good wall of lead. I'm also carrying a TS Gauss Pistol, accuracy is pretty pants but it's excellent for bug clearing at Campfire Tales and similar.
---
I did roll a TS Plasma Caster and took it for a workout. The slow, visible shots really display the terrible, worse than terrible, accuracy of the system - should have been called Two Shot Random Accuracy
---
Some folks just like doing trading and market stuff.  I respect that far more then the ones that amuse themselves forum trolling.
---
Oh i see why you complain about people joining events at the end, you complain about rng too
---
I maybe wrong but I remember some type of mailbox being datamined. It may have been just a camp item but I know Rifle Gaming covered it months and months back well before wastelanders I think.
---
Just a ton of generic people. Raiders, settlers, etc.
---
Basically so everyone doesn't have the same 5.
---
Maybe he was hiding in stealth and sniping?  There’s a legendary armor effect called chameleon that makes you invisible when crouched, so maybe that’s what he was doing?

You get the plans from fort defiance. In one of the scribes rooms on a desk ... think a terminal is in there too

All of your progress will carry over from Bethesda.net to Steam and vice versa, with a couple of exceptions:
---
* Steam's achievements only activate if you're playing the Steam version when you complete the trigger.
---
* Atoms (the premium currency which can be earned through in-game challenges) are specific to the platform. So if you log in via Bethesda.net and earn your atoms from the initial challenges then you can only spend them on a Bethesda.net login. They stay there so you can either spend everything when you change what platform you use or just come back to that launcher if you want to spend them in future.
---
There's a bug that means workshop icons show as regular location if you switch servers. 
---
Should be good on the first log in after booting the game.
---
It's one of my favorites because the bombs fell on my birthday.  The world celebrated the largest fireworks show ever just for me.  ;)
---
I have killed hundreds if not thousands.  When you are drawing her aggro getting her to land is not hard.  The people who think it was only because crippling wings was nerfed very clearly only had a single tactic for getting her to land.
---
they still exist, their map icons got an update, why? no idea
---
Good source of quick treasury notes, but I understand the thinking!
---
They are still there but there is a visual glitch which puts a fast travel icon instead. For me it's pretty random, sometimes I see workshop icons and sometimes something else. However if you try to fast travel to said icon (take the "cars" icon a the Tyler County Race Track, you get an error "You cannot travel to unowned workshops". I believe Bethesda did respond to a post about this, no doubt it'll get fixed eventually.
---
Nice, I’ve been looking for this exact lever. Is there something in particular you’re looking to get for it?
---
Why are you posting this?  Looks to me like your trying to sell something.
---
Even super casuals should have no problem getting to 90 and then spending the 1500 atoms they got to finish it.
---
The only way you're not getting the full season is if you play so little you aren't even getting the weeklies done.
---
I could be wrong but I thought it was a flat x2 to all XP gains. 
---
Hopefully someone can confirm for sure.
---
I never said you are not rewarded for your time. I also said I am not referencing Bethesda reasons and opinions.
---
I was pointing out a flaw in the method, that defies  the base idea of 'time and effort' within the design of the specific pass. Yes it only applies to outliers, yet your insistence on ignoring consideration is why I felt compelled to interject amongst the discussion.
---
Hopefully that makes it clearer, maybe?
---
That’s up to them! If the system doesn’t allow you to set rules, then you have to accept you can’t dictate the terms of your charity.
---
Oh an other inventory bug. I can't equip any weapon. They instand unequip them self. All I can do since yesterday is punching things with my fists lol
---
Did you try to server hop or to restart the app?
---
When the Double XP weekend rolls around, you'll get those ranks fast then you'll wonder what to even apply the perk points to after a certain point.
---
So entitled. Lol "this guy's house isn't set up the way I want it, what a dick". Yea makes sense.
---
The plans have a static spawn on a desk on the 4th floor of Fort Defiance.
---
I’m only around lvl 70, get as many of the biggest water purifiers as you can in your camp. It’s like 25-30 purified water every 15/30 minutes (not sure exactly how long) then get lvl 3 hard bargain... should be easy to max your caps. You’ll want lvl 3 thru hiker though because the weight of the water adds up.
---
Just buy 1st
---
There was no window he was in a building up the stairs in a corner
---
Yeah, I've tried restarting the game and also tried different servers. I'm assuming I'm just missing some obvious setting somewhere, because this has been a persistent issue for me. I haven't been able to play much, but it's been like this for about a week.
---
Hmm sure
---
Would be cool. If you also could treathen/offer protection/romance etc. them for excluding/including some tracks, or steal them afterwards and burn them or something
---
I just unlocked the pumpkin and bat weapon skins in NW and it makes me so happy.
---
Seems like this would be an easy add for a future season's SCORE reward.  They've done this a few times in the current run, with the UFO and the raider decor items.  I'd hope the plan would be for the full bear set, or maybe divided into two squares (bear set 1, bear set 2).  It'd be pretty lame to have one bear unlockable at a time.  Add a Mr. Fuzzy set or two to the tracker, and I know a lot of people would be happy to grind to collect the whole set.
---
I can think of a number of pre-existing world items that I'd like to see added as CAMP buildables if they were sufficiently cheap and/or a good bundle of several items in a themed set.  A bundle of industrial machine tools, electrical wall components, and/or random computer consoles would be pretty excellent.

Next patch will be interesting, lol, what will they break this time.
---
Yeah. Like in every other fallout since 3 I'm pretty sure you can meet all the main radio station protagonists. Kinda gutted they didn't do it in this one (yet) 
---
But yeah to have dialogue and possible romance and benefits would be good too!
---
A few weeks ago there was a guy who kept trying to initiate PvP with everyone in my group, we had 8 people split between two teams running around Appalachia getting shit done. No matter where we went, who's camp we were at, or what event was going on there was Captain Meat Hook wearing the classic Halloween skeleton costume being a douchebag. We could have blocked him but we really wanted to see how long he'd go on for.
---
We decided a plan, we'd run all three silos at once. One diversion nuke will be dropped on the queen, the other two will be dropped on his camp. First nuke hits and he smells loot, he travels down to the event and while he's there we destroy his shit. He left us alone after that.
---
If your in a build team the workshops dont show as workshops.
---
A vanilla Damage Lever Action will compare more favorably than the TS/ 50/ DRWR Lever Action. The rolls are below average for a Lever Action. They’re almost inconsequential given the context that LAR are used to kill enemies, which is generally stealthily and in one shot.
---
TS, as you already stated, is a no go for semi-automatic weapons. In VATS, I’ve had the secondary bullet miss. While aiming, even more so.
---
I do that to everyone I meet. Even if I'm just passing thru an area another player is in, I stop and wave and keep on trucking.
---
I normally don't have alot of extra stuff to give, but last night I saw two lvl 2 players at 76 while I was at my base, so I stopped real quick and made up a set of lvl 1 leather armor upgraded the protection and put pocketed on them and stopped by and dropped them off with 20 super stims and 20 water. (would have been more but I had just sold almost 100 water 5 minutes before that)
---
Point being, I had folks drop me stuff when I was low lvl, so it feels right to do the same.
---
Yall keep up the good work, it does make me want to get on more often to know so many cool peeps are around.
---
Iirc it's the same for one of the gatling guns. (The one you got from old survival mode it's a two shot one I just cant remember the name of it lol )
---
There's a guarantee spawn for the plan on Taggerdys desk in Fort Defiance if youre far enough in the main story to just walk in and pick it up. It also sells at one of the NPC vendors for pretty cheap, pretty sure in Watoga, but not 100% sure.
---
I also found adding level 3 Luck of the Draw perk also helped. I use Weapon Artisan to repair it to 200%. Then I swap it back to level 5 Gunsmith. Between all of those I am only having to repair it about once per day, maybe twice per day on weekends when I can play more.
---
 There is no way you were able to get 9 AI kills in NW, and complete all the other dailies in under 60 min.
---
It took me two full match wins in a row to get 9 AI's, or 40(ish)+ minutes of actively looking.
---
Building team is so much better.  Events don’t happen often enough.
---
How about every tadpole and possum badge??
---
Definitely my greatest achievement in FO76. Took me about 8 months!
---
Yeah I was like that with my first character - stealth rifleman/commando. Wanted to play another character that could tank, punch people in the face and fire big guns! It's a nice change and having fun!
---
I’m not even against them being exclusive, but just exclusive because I can’t cash in the hundreds I have is insane
---
I would love a quest line, that added new music to the radio station. Maybe even they would be able to sell some extra songs in the atom store. Like songs from alle previous Fallout games. That would be epic.
---
Why not just do the ammo crafting bundles some of the vendors sell.  No fuss and wouldn't cripple folks that don't have ammo converter.
---
I think you need to Bulk it first
---
This is the answer I've been looking for, thank you. I'll consider selling my current legendary and playing with a vanilla lever gun for awhile and see how it feels.
---
Not done yet.. 😆 was just asking if ppl get done with it what happens.. But I am half way.. I play for like 7hrs to 10 a day..
---
Just hop in with randoms and talk to them. I had mine completed before my regular team got on.
---
I setup a similar station for myself and added all the songs from Fallout 3, NV, 4 and 76.  I also added some extra tracks, mostly rock from the 50s and 60s, that I think compliments the existing lineup.
---

---
Oh, and for Country Roads I use the original by John Denver.
---
The game vendors (robots, Grahm, etc) won’t buy most junk unless it’s bulked. You can sell it in your player vendor at your camp.
---
Beautiful.
---
You can bulk it at a tinkering workbench and then sell it to a vendor.  Raw cloth by itself will not sell to vendors (and I think is common enough most players won’t buy it either)
---
I rolled a hell of A lot of secret service and I will say the balance does lean in favor of 3*. Rolled many more 3* than 1*
---
Sure. Glad I can help.
---
Now that I've suggested it, that may not be true lol.  PA is definitely in the loot table for holiday gifts but I'm thinking t60 specifically may not be.  Just checked because I was curious what all plans I was still missing and opening up t60 I only know the torso and that's it.  All other armors I know the whole set or am missing one piece.  The vast majority of those plans I know came from gifts for certain though.
---
Sound like I should set up a shower to get to my vendors and only sell toxic goo. LOL I'm really not that evil, but that was my FIRST thought when I read the ops post.
---
I used to be set up there, but supermutants make rude neighbours.
---
I appreciate it's flatness tho, great for building!
---
That would make them Pay to Win, so no.
---
You had the same with my TS plasma caster, except at least in VATS it appeared to be a lot more accurate
---
I'd love it if this idea could be for your own use, like set up outfit, under armour and armours to one slot so you can easily equip it after getting out of a stealth suit or if es ting to equip a full troubleshooter set for encryptid then switching back easily
---
You should be able to tell how bad the accuracy penalty is just by using it. Generally two shot is garbage because the rounds split so quickly after they leave the barrel. So for most of them they're forced as close or medium range weapons. Like highway said, you can tell this especially well when using something that has a slower projectile like the plascaster.
---
What a fantastic response.
---
GTA isn't ESO...
---
Howdy, partners! Swing by Lakebed Books next time you're online. :)  
---
Plz don't bomb me though; I'm just trying to spread literacy.
---
You can’t build it at another player’s camp, sadly. (Unless there’s a bug I’ve not heard of.)
---
Thank you! Just a question, is it like radios in game? Like galaxy news radio from fo4? Or purely only songs? Im still grateful either way, its just that im on ps4, so spotify is the only way for me to listen to music while playing...
---
I used to have mine hooked up to a switch that was also connected to a siren. Anyone who wanted to lose rads would also get a surprise lol.
---
Yeah, Bethesda really needs to address this
---
Yup, was doing The Path to Enlightenment a couple days ago and occasionally I'd have to shoot a firefly 4 times even though 1 shot is a massive overkill.  I'd get damage numbers each time.
---
Sometimes this is the server being slow, you get mobs dying with a significant delay after you shoot them, but more recently it's just showing hits that aren't actually registering.  Had SBQ fights where I've done more than enough damage to kill her myself with a dozen other people there all shooting her too.
---
Game was increadibly buggy before but post 20 it's gotten to absolutely absurd levels.
---
oooh nice will go look for it.
---
I have all the weapons I want, so maybe rare plans or I’m always looking to upgrade my unyielding armor types.
---
Its just bad now, back in the day it was 100% per bullet and it was crazy op. I think they just need to make it 2x on shotty and maybe things like gausse have a bigger ray. Basically I think it would be cool if every weapon had different optimal legendarys
---
speak more of this food build
---
It's just songs! I actually prefer it that way. But yeah I listen on Spotify on Xbox :)
---
At least Beckett’s final reward is decent. Daguerre’s feels like a kick in the nuts after enduring all that tedium.
---
Some people leave the team to start their own as currently, Herd Mentality will give bonuses if you're the team leader, without the prerequisite of being close to teammates that normally is involved. This allows +2 to all stats just by being a team leader since you are technically close to yourself.
---
No, I never use them. Don't need it.
---
I wouldn’t expect this to change, it’s behaved like this consistently since launch as far as I remember.
---
Ohhhhhh, so it's from heeeeere. Was a sweet surprise in a vendor XDDD
---
Yep, I run around with two pieces of level 30 unyielding armor and I paid about a thousand for each
---
Level 20 &amp;under with nice rolls definitely hold value for mules or low lv pvp toons.  20-40 not so much unless it's a god roll or legacy
---
Well I'm going to start my own groups for now on and do that. Not sure if anyone has been doing that in the groups I've joined. Thx for the tip.
---
Thank you so much i just finished the quest:)
---
Best I can do is 3:50
---
Good luck with it. I think that the Gauntlet and the Power Fist are the most fun weapons in the whole game. [Here's a bit of action that I caught a while back with the Power Fist.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/fcsq8x/more_fisting_for_your_scorched_face/)
---
15c, I have to make them, didnt even get to whip some up :(
---
https://youtu.be/bUmKUWzbDxg
---
I don’t really know what plans are rare but I do have a lot. I have 3 backpack plans if you’d be interested in those? High capacity, and the two armor ones. 
---
I also have a 2* JE Lever that I would happily throw in a bundle with them if that would help.
---
People just thrive on conflict and seeing it where there isn't any. I'm sure 99% of people who force you through a shower just don't know what a bloody build is.
---
Just remember the exp bonus form intelligents caps at 25 (50% exp )
---
Any you pick up after the first one do not and count and never have. It’s not really a bug.
---
Every single one it feels like lol
---
It would really depend on how much your selling them for. Right now you probably could sell them with the game out on game pass and all the newer players as long as you are camped near the wayward or something. Or you could save them for alternate characters.
---
In some cases, I avoid joining teams when I know that I will be doing a lot of server hoping.
---
Why not? Pvp is allowed in the game, rando took something of OPs and he punished him for it? I see no flaw in the execution of said plan
---
No way lol
---
most of me was hoping this was a troll and 10 hours of mothman dance.
---
Okay that makes me sad.
---
Pretty much unsellable. The only way is to have good rolls priced very low as your potential buyers won't be at the point where they will have many thousands of caps to spare. I tend to scrip, or even sell to station vendors if they are heavy (they will only get several hundred caps best) and I've run out of scrip scrapping points which is usually very soon after log in.
---
Edit: maybe a couple of exclusions to the unsellable rule - Bloodied and Unyielding. The bonuses attached to these may make up for the lower levels, and my L150 still uses sub-L50 armour pieces.
---
It's worse damage wise but better weight wise.
---
The advantage of it is that you can just craft a bunch and get what you want rather than spend forever trying to find one.  Especially if you've stockpiled hundreds of modules.  Which I have.
---
There’s a guaranteed plan on the desk, in the Brotherhood commander’s laser locked room, at the top of the asylum.
---
I can craft you a full set of T60 armor with emergency protocols and calibrated shocks with the BoS Elder paint, if you're interested. I had to trade a legacy weapon and 25000 caps to get a full set of plans. They are unfortunately somewhat difficult to acquire.
---
The emote is used when you use the lunchbox. I assume the pet emotes will be similar and not used whenever.
---
I've only tried it twice, the first time it failed, then when I left the game crashed and I had to reinstall the entire game 3 times to get the game running again. The second time nobody did it right and it failed. Most of the time I don't do it because nobody is ever there.
---
I mean, unless you enjoy it! I have a level 25 instigating death tambo that only weighs .5 and is hilarious to beat up low level enemies in events or week wandering the Forest
---
I’m just being dumb and quoting that old meme. In reality..it takes me 15 minutes at least...
---
Shhhhhhh. :(
---
I think my first time through I probably did it in 15? Then again I didn’t stop to read any of the terminals and the room where you have to repair the mainframe just soaked up a lot of my time cause I just didn’t have the components on hand to just make them. Also on PS4 and solo because my friends are still like level 20 and refuse to try and get higher
---
Today is the start of week 3. So counting this week it should be 8 more weeks to the end.
---
I want to help Beth add more bluegrass Appalachia music, they need someone with some music knowledge
---
How do you do it ???
---
I use lower than max level gear for leveling whenever I have a new toon
---
I farm Leader of the Pack for gear to use while leveling mainly.. but have purchased items out of vendors on occasion
---
I should also mention you need to be far enough along in the Wastelanders questline to reach the 4th floor. You need to be past the part where you visit the DMV.
---
Was there a pirate yelling at you to surrender your booty? Because if so, that was me lol.
---
You can also craft outfits with it to sell to vendors if you're low on plastic.
---
It is though because there are ways to go back and keep doing it
---
i'd settle for optimization in general.
---
i know the sheer quantity of mods on weapons/armor, overkill lighting in many area's and the way cells are loaded causes the biggest lag.
---
with fallout 4 i made my own personal mod to tone down the lighting in the worst offending area's, removed multiple mods from weapons and armor that felt useless like bash boosting mods, short scopes, etc and shifted the stats those mods would have supplied to the next sense making mod slot so the stats from a short scope would be added to a reflex sight, the vats reduction on some mods added to the base weapon, etc.
---
game ran somewhat smoother, if i knew how to alter cell referencing and caching i'd probably make it much smoother. but for now i have a max of 6 cells loaded at once, the moment i go beyond that it "unloads" the oldest one similar to how the base game does it but base game was around 15-20 cells at once
---
I haven’t tryed. But can you change the assigned key in the control settings.
---
 No. When Wastelanders came out there was a lunchbox emote. It was your character holding a lunchbox and doing a “come here” motion with their arm. It was available for quite a while. I forgot which update removed it. Now that we have lunchboxes they can bring it back. It’s completely separate from the animation you’re referring to.
---
My screen name is the same as Reddit, and I'm usually on from 6-midnight Eastern time (except tonight, won't be on until late due to Real Life).
---
Warning, I'm kinda chatty so don't friend me if you want to play in silence. :-)
---
Yep, you remember correctly
---
Noobs, I have transcended and reached enlightenment. Nukes are sent by brain waves conjuring the energies from a section of timespace that goes beyond the realm of reason.
---
There are?
---
Yeah. It’s to slow it down. There are quest specific rewards from that one. So if you spammed 50 and got them all right away you’d never do it again.
---
oh, i’m not faulting the PVP at all, but it being a contested workshop is the reason the level 3 locks don’t work. once you take over a workshop, the ownership of the locks change
---
Why the hell would you scrap the camera. That thing is AMAZING for taking action photos when stuff wont stay still for photomode. It's literally a mobile photomode and one of my favorite parts of the game.
---
Damn same like me. I don't get rid of this no weapon bug lol. But I don't think yours is a setting issue.
---
Tbh I can totally understand this is fucked up even if this is no game breaking bug at all. For this would be the dead. I have over 100 weapons in my inventory haha
---
Yeah I’ll think about it, are you Xbox?
---
My camp is at FT Defiance, I placed a cannon and regularly drop artillery on line in the sand now. 🤣
---
Actually, double the reason because I think events get harder the more players that are present.
---
Lmfao. Epic karma
---
I'm sorry guy, but you've been juked by your friend. Never just drop stuff on the ground if your not prepared to outright lose it. Just prepare for a long walk to the nearest camp, workbench, or vendor.
---
Not sure what to tell you other than don’t worry about it, he wasn’t benefiting from your kills, you only get rewards for enemies you tag or a teammate tags.  Most players in fo76 are helpful and friendly.  There are bored and clueless people everywhere these days, just enjoy the game and don’t worry about others.
---
Some of you say bloodied is so easy after you name a laundry list of items they gave to get to be viable, you think full unyielding sets just drop every where lmfao. I feel that most people that complain have never played the build and are just salty they choose utility over damage and it’s no ones fault but your own.
---
Someone dropped it for me during the Faschnaut parade before I even had a camera. That awesome person made my game 10x more enjoyable when I did find one because I'm a big photo nut.
---
Alright
---
Ironically, none of the Free States gear is free.......but at least there's no government interference and you can talk to the bot to hear his soothing voice for free :)
---
Depends how good it is, if its like a low level vampire handmade i'd buy it for levelling a new character
---
Yes, look at some of the other comments
---
I do this event as much as possible 
---
Tons of XP, usually several legendary drops, and a bunch of mats
---
You'll get better weapons at 50. The non-legendary western revolver will do significantly more damaged at Refined vs the Somerset's Hardened so you also get accuracy and recoil bonuses in addition to damage.
---
That said, the .44 revolver is on a level base of 5 (15, 25, 35, 45) so the awarded Somerset will be the closest level you are to those brackets. Hope that helps.
---
Edit: You will also earn an upgradable .44 via another quest that can level with you. The Somerset will outclass it vs non-robots but it will tide you over until level 50 if you enjoy sidearms. (I'm a pistol and shotgun player too.)
---
Bot Phoenix has it in his plan rotation
---
There are two bundles and that’s about it, I think there was maybe a stand-alone generator and one other item I can’t recall.  Leave it to Bethesda to lay some groundwork for interesting post-war factions and completely dump them.
---
I'm gonna be honest I don't remember much of who the Free States were aside from the fact that they existed lol
---
Since you obviously like them so much, could I ask you if you could point me towards some quests or lore locations? Cuz all I remember of them is their vendor in Harper's Ferry
---
You’re missing the point
---
I found him in Sutton once.
---
3:50? That’s literally only launch prep.. even going Danny phantom through the doors it takes me 8 minutes start to finish...
---
They did "fix" this because it used to work with multiples in your inventory. It's been so long that I don't remember wether you could just drop one in a container and pull it out again or not but the quest would fire every time you logged into a new server and you had at least one on you already.
---
This was changed into requiring you to pull a "fresh" one out of a random container. ignoring everything you carry on you.
---
Had a level 25 twoshot, vats, pump action shotgun carry my arse from there till 100+, weapon was the only reason I survived the crazy shit I was doing~
---
I used to have a CAMP above cliffwatch where i could walk out onto a plank and throw the flare and it would roll down the hill a bit and into the group of scorched. Literally have never used it again after tho
---
Sure, i only need the base armor so no paint or mods. How much for the whole set?
---
Tuesdays at 9 AM on the West Coast is restock time, always looking forward to it haha
---
Awesome I appreciate that. Yes, I’m on Xbox.
---
Mirelurk meat is also daily.  Defend the water purifier is server hop.
---
Well, there is the trade off. Infinite and automated junk collecting but you don’t always get what you want.
---
Got you: GT?
---
It could be like, you craft a "care package" at the tinkerer's bench.
---
I wouldn't. I don't have high Luck so it takes a few hits to get up to a critical, and I don't want to waste it on a ghoul I'm finishing off or low level enemy. I think it would only be worth it if the game pre-calculated that you weren't wasting damage by doing a crit, and even then I prefer saving one if I know there's something dangerous with high health nearby for an easier kill.
---
I see so a gauss mini would need over 100 or 200 since the explosive is built in?  Or am I wrong on that?
---
Lmao don’t get so triggered
---
That was actually really cool.  How do the slots work?  Even if it's just for looks it's still really cool and looks amazing.  Great job!!
---
They see them as three features I guess.
---
some gear caps at 45, like marine. you won’t find level 50 of that.
---
If the item has god rolls, a tier down (35 or 40) can be acceptable
---
For example, if I found a level 40 Unyielding, +1 endurance, Sentinles gear...i’ll hold onto it
---
Got you man, GT?
---
"  It was your character holding a lunchbox and doing a “come here” motion with their arm.  "
---
You sure you are not confusing this with the "gift" emote? I don't remember ever seeing a lunch box emote and I do play quite a lot.
---
there’s always one like this in wholesome threads smh. the girl was constantly supervised and playing with teddy bears for goodness sake. you have no right to judge their parenting.
---
I started dropping spoiled brahmin milk during fasnacht. No greater joy than watching some sprint towards my bag &amp; pick it up without looking at what’s in it first
---
What a twist!
---
Got you, GT?
---
I have two amazing quad cryolators i use for this reason. i want everyone to get a hit so i  always freeze the queen when she lands so low levels, even the melee builds, can feel involved without worrying about getting overwhelmed.
---
Just have to have a fast fire rate weapon such as the gauss minigun, with one of a handful of specific legendary effects. Either instigating, junkies, bashing damage, improved vats, or limb damage. If you have an eligible weapon with one of those prefixes, try it out in vats to see the glitchy numbers
---
It's sometimes takes a few minutes for that meat pile to show. Usually I just do something else in the area that isn't too in depth and then I go back there and the meat pile is there to loot, watch for the flies.
---
Yeah.
---
All I do is loot all the junk and gear I can carry. I scrap and store all of it except rare junk and gear that I can use or requires a higher level. I don't have much of either.
---
That's like 2 or 3 matches more than people want play it. The most creature I saw in a spawn of 3 matches was like 3. So, no thanks.
---
My first it took me 20 minutes and PS4 too lol
---
Bet someone that after 2 years of 76 they haven’t fixed the endurance on gear bug.  You could win some good shit!  Have to specify 76 as this is a FO4 bug I believe.
---
I recognised the meme lol takes me 10 if I speed run it the prep feels like it takes forever lol
---
I don't have a decon shower. I do, however, sell Rad-X and RadAway through the Super Duper Mart Pharmacy for 20 caps each, down from 50 ;) Scrub those pesky radionucleides from your body and get back to the daily grind!
---
3, threedog, 4 broadcast station with some peeps. Can't remember in NV though
---
If you place a survival tent in the right spot on the map you can cause all of the scorched to spawn in front of the generator for the event
---
K.  at work now...when I get home, will verify what I have and send you a note via PSN.
---
Hopefully they can split the difference between slaughtering nine molerats in a PvP focused mode and chewing one piece of bubblegum.
---
I like easy content but that's just pretty close to breathing air.
---
I've walled line up inside a small area no doors no windows no nothing if they can't see it they can't glitch in. Be sure to put a roof on it.
---
Seems neat, I'm more curious about how the machines are rigged up. I didn't really pay much attention to what some of the electric stuff can do, and so it didn't occur to me that you could even do such a thing.
---
That's pretty cool.
---
Honestly I feel the free states gear from the Atom shop was kind of kitsch and unrealistic for the faction with all the logos. I consider myself a free states and my character wears the hunter's longcoat with a confederate cap.
---
Though, this is all personal preference and my opinion, you do as you like. Just giving my two cents.
---
It’s honestly (not trying to sound cocky or anything) surprisingly easy to get through them once you have a high output weapon. I ran through with a 1 Star Gatling laser and made it through pretty easily, just rather time consuming but I think that’s true about most parts of this game
---
Can't think of any I have seen with an actual pond for industrial purifiers, however you can place the smaller purifiers anywhere on soil and they will produce water, just at a lower rate. Use more of them.
---
Of course, but that doesn't work very well with it being a full health build haha. Wanting to try that direction.
---
I hate that I've got to do this haha. I'm losing a good 45 minutes of game time because of this freaking bug haha
---
How dare you!
---
Donating the photos moves the bar a fair bit.
---
Raiders have mirelurk meat daily and defend the purifier server hop.
---
Settlers have more random encounters.
---
Some of the random encounter spots have very high chance for settlers and a bit of server hopping can get you that last bit of rep you need, but it's tedious.
---
I mostly explore the bunkers and Harper's Ferry, since that was there base. They were mostly a group of people that knew the government was up to no good and  fought against them.
---
I'm fairly sure most the outfits all the dead people around Harper's Ferry are wearing are in game. I think the fishing outfit is one of them.
---
&gt; Leave it to Bethesda to lay some groundwork for interesting post-war factions and completely dump them.
---
They weren't dumped at all, it is explained completely as to what happened as part of the scorched storyline.
---
100 on all but SBQ. Her explosive resistance is so high the explosive damage doesn't register as a seperate hit, at least for the purposes of this glitch in my experience. Everything else it should work like any other "magic" gun. SBQ also effects guns relying on the explosive legendary modifier to hit 200 effective rate of fire.
---
I see your point. Could be used for pvp, too. 
---
If anyone did pvp anymore.
---
I totally agree.  I put a double wide staircase into my base so people can use decontamination shower on the right and normal stairs on the left.
---
Wow. Why not give in-game reward armor like the BOS and Fire Breathers.
---
I would highly recommend it. Just started messing with a blooded commando and I am loving it. I can have super mutants on top if me while I shoot then in the nuts and not leave caution
---
You got the materials for it? If so, 1500c. 
---
If you don't have the materials, 3000c.
---
Are you on PC? My IGN is dr_red.
---
It was called the "Thanksgiving Display Case," and unfortunately only offered in November, 2019.  Hopefully they'll bring it back and introduce more open display case shelf units like it.  A simple wall-mounted shelf that holds one or two items would be nice, as would tables in various sizes.
---
Heck, I'd gladly drop some Atoms for a "generic display widget" that could be placed like floor decor items and would accept a single item for display, like the weapons displays but without the restricted inventory types and without a furniture backdrop.  I suppose that'd be confusing to newcomers, though.
---
As for using the shelves, as Kmk4420 said, it requires some building hacks.  If you google "fallout 76 how to place items on shelves," you'll find several videos on the topic. I'm afraid I can't view videos at the moment, so I can't link to specifics.
---
I didn’t believe it. But happened to me yesterday.
---
Tip for getting screws: kill assaultrons (when you can) and scrap the scrap assaultron heads until you get the plan for the assaultron helmet. Next, max out the super duper perk (in luck) and get some steel. Craft and scrap assaultron helmets, and each one you scrap will net you a scrap assaultron head that you can scrap for screws. It takes a while, but it does work.
---
I'd assume so. Probably glowing too
---
Valid point, but not everyone wants to run High dps, low health. It would just be another build that people could try out, really.
---
Yep, they're whiners.  99% of the challenges are not hard or time consuming in any way.  If you skip one or two here you can earn it back with the double EXP and double Score coming up.  I can generally bang em out in 20 minutes but leveling at 200+ will take me closer to an hour if I was relatively freshly leveled.
---
Plus they've added more daily challenges it looks like due to the whining so it's even easier now.
---
I'm glad they're prioritizing the auto complete issue... It's been a long running issue since beta and was the single reason I stopped doing them for atoms. Of course there was no incentive to fix for atoms. Either way glad this is being worked on.
---
Yeah, doesn't sound cocky, it is the end game afterfall lol and it can be but so far everything has been in the same place so it's fairly quick providing the ads (AI) don't get in the way lol
---
Did you find a way to fix it?
---
I added links to my post showing the emote. It’s a simple gesture to let people know that you’re about to open a lunchbox.
---
Yes all a lot machines work
---
Aye. I have a few nice level 35 handmades. There's really not much difference between a 35 and 45.
---
That's an extremely dumb analogy and you should be ashamed of it.
---
Bloodied is a build you chose in a game.
---
The disabled most certainly did not chose.
---
Overseers mission has been bugged for me for 8 months. Every patch I try to turn it in, only to be disappointed once again.
---
Yeah I have schematics and stuff available to those who wnat it as well
---
That's why we need some better defensive buffs like a boost in armor. 
---
Karma is the only syringer that can be used that way, and it has a big debuff
---
Id mostly agree with AA over Furious but thats not actually how it works either, it wont reset on a miss but if u hit another target itll reset.
---
Edit: so it really depends what youre going to be using it for, if its just a SBQ gun id go furious.
---
Stop using the op build and you'll be fine. I'd do it on purpose just to screw with people using that broken build. If I could i'd have it on a pressure plate switch so when they get near the vendor it turns on XD. Honestly, though, if your hp is full when u have rad damage you should be considered to be at 100% full hp, if the green bar is full no matter what size it is, your at full hp, would make the build require some actual skill to run since you cannot use rad damage anymore to lock you at low hp. I so hope they do it it'd actually balance it out nicely.
---
From my understanding, the quests that auto-complete seem to be ones that are repeats of the previous days (e.g. "Level Up" and "Complete a Daily Challenge".  Is that right?  If that is right, it seems a temporary solution could be for them to not repeat the challenges?
---
Well, if you're on PC, I'd give you a Salisbury Steak and a Blamco Mac'n'Cheese.
---
That must have been it.  I saw a tent in the road.
---
There is a 3rd PA spawn in Morgantown, and a 4th just up the road at Grafton Dam.
---
Hopefully people see this, but I'm awaiting the many posts about it affecting people nonetheless.
---
/u/Ladydevann Were you able to get anyone to look into this? I haven't heard from anyone and support just completely stopped responding to my emails after they said they were going to pass on my ticket...
---
It's been 112 hours since this all started. Almost a week now :(
---
I do leader of the pack, do up the 3 legendary drops of level 5 or 10 then drop for low levels.
---
Technically it can be done but it's not like fast and easy task. You need some special tools to make this work. First you need to create your own custom video which will contain all your desired images or screenshots. Second you need to convert your video to a .bk2 format so game can recognize it. Then put this converted video to a game folder and here you go.
---
Thank you!!! Thats exactly what I was asking. once you hit ally, you stay there. Awesome, I'll start doing that tonight :)
---
You're right,  and if it weren't for the massive dupe event right now, I would totally agree they have value
---
Set yourself to pacifist mode in the game options. Disables the ability to flag yourself for pvp if you accidentally shoot somebody. Just dont try to take somebody's workshop.
---
I heard that you could farm legendaries from them, as well. They will only spawn up to lvl 35, though, but you can get some scrip from it.
---
Poisonblood696
---
I'm at work now. Won't be on until later tonight.
---
Ah, cool. Never seen anyone use it, though.
---
On Xbox I personally play in 3rd person 90% of the time.   sometimes switch to first, mostly when sniping distant targets.
---
Oh I thought you meant there's a way to turn in those stacks of unusable documents 
---
But you're just talking about farming them
---
To mix both, you’re going to have to max strength and perception to get all the damage cards, you might end up negating some of the other cards you could use
---
I bought the gift box loot bag and use that for dropped icons (i use the paratrooper bag for a less noticeable death bag). However it does take too long to select items to go in and by then the low level player has often wandered off because they didn't know what you were doing for so long. Yes, i do use the "gift for you" emote, but still they wander off. 
---
I did try to buy some "bulk ammo packs" from the travelling vendors and keep those to drop, but they get auto scrapped whether in inventory or stash. Would be nice to keep to drop one when needed.
---
Great CAMP and video! Just beware of Raiders pulling a Casino Heist. ;)
---
To be clear  I do skip all the NW stuff, NW is just not for me and like yall said it's not fun Bush camping for 30mins
---
But I'm at lev 40 on the board and never done 1 NW challenge
---
Look mr frodo! More lambas crash.
---
&gt;And as a bloodied build
---
Lmao maybe you should stop being a generic metaslave using the most boring build in the game.
---
Why is every bloodied player such an entitled manchild
---
On pc?
---
What I mean to say is that I already have a bloodied build and was looking to try something different on this character. Bloodied is undeniably great, but sometimes it's fun to try something different.
---
Saldy, you cannot make those stacks usable
---
That'd be awesome! I just would hope it wouldn't say the same three lines though.
---
People who leave unlocked purifiers are the best of humanity period.
---
I leave my junk extractor unlocked because I have plenty of junk and often forget to empty it for hours, so there is no harm in someone grabbing a load for themselves. I did lock my ammo machine because it takes a bit longer and I always need ammo
---
Yes there was a mod to fix it in FO4. 
---
They also haven’t fixed the explosive vents PA mod. Hasn’t worked since launch.
---
Yeah that's what I was hoping to try and get
---
I'd prefer a chameleon deathclaw but I don't think there's a way to get the spawn levels just right to even attempt taming one of those :(
---
My base is by Point Pleasant and I call in strikes regularly on cultists for giggles.
---
Having some options, not saying I hate a couple of them, but they just don't fit my sense of the place, so when adding others it would be nice to choose. Not turning the radio on and off as I do now sometimes. I switch channels irl ofc, just think of this like a singleplayer game, with some company. It would be nice, for me. Anyway, meeting the host and doing some quest would be great!
---
I'd give it 50/50 odds of being fixed in patch 21, and a decent chance (10-20%) that it just basically never gets fixed (at least not this year). There are a lot of oooooooooold bugs in FO76 that they never get around to fixing or take several months or even a year+.
---
I have already respec'd out of Agility.
---
For the time being for your level a refined or hardened receiver will typically do the most damage.
---
IIRC, there is also a 50 cal receiver for the hunting rifle.
---
Put a Forceful stock on it. This will increase base durability.
---
I avoid it because some people want to do it right, some want to grind xp, and some just want to afk for a chance at a rad barrel plan. It's annoying.
---
I wish they would make events that all XP earned there is shared but all of it is forfeit if you fail it, and everyone there gets a legendary for every legendary enemy killed. Also figure out some way to remove AFK people from the event. Maybe kick them at the end before loot is disbursed for not interacting with quest objectives or not killing any enemies.
---
There is a nice spot on a cliff with a waterfall in the mire.  It’s near the crashed plane and dolly sods you gotta plant the camp in just the right spot to get the lead node and the water.  Great for a treehouse build.  Only recommend for lv 50+.  I moved from there to the lake by lucky hole and just farm lucky hole for crazy lead when I need it now.
---
&gt;impossible amount of rare items
---
I think that would kind of prove they did dupe or at least fenced stolen goods 😃
---
I'm mostly on Xbox anymore, but I wouldn't mind taking a look at it just to ponder what can be made. Naturally I'm going to look at it, learn a bit, and then make some inane rube goldberg out of it all.
---
That's hilarious. Incoming!
---
Well I've managed to get a glowing deathclaw but it's complicated. So when you load into a game with a pet present. Ie you already have a deathclaw at yo camp. If you're camp cannot be placed. Place your camp down anywhere. Your pet should spawn with you but glowing or a different variant to the og
---
Myself and everyone I play with tried it out. We didn’t know what it was for at the time. Was strange. Makes a lot of sense now! Haha.
---
Its not for you its for me! Im a rather dapper wastelander. I probably came back from a hiatus and saw a vendor and probably didnt watch a video on it. So I put one down only to realize that I was the vendor. Theres nothing in there anyway.
---
Good to know :)
---
Granknee

---
I'm sorry, it's all I've got...
---
I always have on the level 5 things for rifles or guns or whatever, so it is not that bad. But I switch between melee, shotgun, and the TSE rifle. Provides great balance!
---
With every SPECIAL at fucking 5000, and 50 different procs to dodge damage **as well as one shotting everything in the fucking game**?
---
Yes, you're on easy mode.
---
Do what you did in the video put it in a dresser or weapons bench
---
I don’t know what you’re trying to prove. If you’re a 1st subscriber then you should be a little irked about them mentioning these things. If you’re not then I guess you just like arguing. Yes now the FAQ section you quoted is vague. Wasn’t vague when 1st was announced. Like I said somebody has to dig up the original announcement but they’ve scrubbed mention of it since.
---
thanks
---
I wish they would add songs from the other Fallout games. Hearing the same songs over and over is getting a little old. Maybe a licensing issue?
---
This is a highly publicised bug. I'm confident they at least say it is fixed even if it isn't.
---
thx :D
---
‘He is now my mule’ 😂
---
Sorry for the delay! I sent your ticket over to be reviewed again. You should hear from someone soon.
---
Excited! Only my second week of playing but really keen to get some new decorations!
---
Lasers in general are super weak in durability, the bar itself may be big but always has a super short limit. I think my non explosive only ran like 100 rounds or so before breaking, my explosive would generally break after my first reload
---
it does not vanish, but if you have picked up anything between spawn point and (2nd + death point), the 1st bag is no longer marked - you have to hunt it down.
---
Awesome, can’t wait to see what there is! Thanks!
---
HAHAHAH I will be waiting with the 50cal
---
Yes...I found a vault tec clock and I have it stored on a display shelf
---
Do you even get anything at the end of those questlines? Also there is the fact they usually give you one quest a day, and you could do the entire wastelanders questline in a day if you wanted to.
---
No I believe it is week 2.
---
It has a 1 hour cooldown, and Vinny does tell you to "cool your horses, come back later". As suggested, private servers may well have been used by someone just before ot was allocated to you, there is no suggestion that a private server is cleared and reset when you take it on ... It might be, but evidence seems to suggest it isn't.
---
Yup it's a glitch, get a Tesla and tag them all and you get massive xp.
---
I thought it was just a hotfix... Is there a patch to download?
---
Yes sir
---
Now I'm hungry, time to eat🥐🥑🥒🥓🥔🥕🥖🥗🥙🥚🥝🥜🥞🦐🦑
---
I'm so tired of being loaded up passively with missles, mini nukes and 40mm grenades
---
When is it "Safe" to log back on when this happens?
---
What’s it not letting you do? Put it inside? Have you connected the power conduit to the generator too?
---
Yea I pop all the exp buffs I can then run my loop hard for about 15 20 mins. I dont really want to give out my whole loop but one big tip someone else gave me is run a loop around whitspring resort there anywhere from 3 to 7 sentry bots (2k exp per bot with the right buffs) and about 10 to 15 assultrons (300 exp ) plus the random scorched, super mutants, mole miners and ghouls.  With all the right exp buffs I complete the repeatable exp challenge almost 3 times per ws run and it takes 5 to 7mins in total
---
I get a few that do that, I just shake my head and move on now
---
Can anyone be specific on what other weapons or effects this applies to or post a link?
---
Hahaha of course Man rn I’m tryna build a roulette wheeler me and I can send u them or link them
---
Thank you again!
---
Yea but I get downvoted for calling them out on it
---
For my main char I mostly use a BE lever-action rifle ever since I got it some time ago. Apart from breaking so frequently, which is annoying, I do tend to blow myself up at times when surprise attacked even though I use Fireproof (Molerats - I hate you so much). 
---
I recently found a Blooded Fixer (yes!) and now use that for sneaky close up fights, while using the lever-action for distance stealth take downs. I don't even need Demolition Expert as it does enough damage as is. So I use rank 5 Gunsmith, which helps reduce wear.
---
I had the same reaction as you.  Haven’t played the game in a year and a half at this point, because the entire game was poorly executed.  I certainly had my fun, though, while I did play.
---
For a second I thought I learned a new word: derogation. 
---
Then my brain kicked in and I realized a typo. Inconsequential but chuckle inducing moment for me.
---
Yea I know about that strat, but I don't like how random it can be 
---
I'd rather have a friendo with a set look, but I may try that if I run out of patience haha
---
Gotcha. Yeah my main is 340 and has been a heavy gunner the whole time. Junkies for most of it. Just started messing with a bloodied commando and have been loving it. Good to finally mix it up haha
---
you can sell those for 1c each.
---
I assume so, but have not tried to play today, yet.
---
lmao it's like clockwork.
---
What I want to say is that this never happens to me on PC. I suspect it's your system or the platform you play on maybe. It seems like some of the slower machines run into problems like that. My kid has complained about this and he's on an original Xbox one.
---
I get something else that's equally annoying though, and it just stared doing it since last patch. If I quick swap from a combat shotgun to any other weapon during the shotgun reloading animation or when recovering from the sprinting animation both of my quick swap weapons stay holstered then no matter what I do until I go into my pipboy and reequip them. Really really annoying in combat.
---
Remove the automatic and test it in semi mode? I know my double barrel shotty with FFR will always fire both rounds at once, sometimes it glitches and fires 3-6 if I am tapping it.
---
So, my main character tried a bloodied lever with 25% faster reload and 90% weight reduction.  Hits are devastating and misses are head scratching still.
---
Hold on a second... the artillery actually works?! Looks like I got some testing to do later
---
Because whenever I do it, everyone is just sitting at the tunnel entrances killing enemies and I'm the only one that bothers to collect any ore.
---
What about the rewards from the legendary run?
---
   Not OP, but I routinely have that much stuff on me simply b/c my stash box is nearly full.  To that end, the dilemma is quite understandable.  
---
I too learned the hard way not to pick up stuff until I found the bag.
---
If you're lucky enough you'll be able to find a tameable deathclaw that might be a different variant. I once found a random scorched bear.
---
That is pretty much the intended behaviour, from what I've gathered. There are a few minor bugs like the TD duplicating in your inventory when you re-log while you have the quest active, but other than that the way it is working right now is, according to Bethesda, the way it is intended to work.
---
I would have to be lucky to find a item without the question telling me to :/
---
Yea, they used to be usable but Bethesda patched it out 
---
Thought you knew some way around it haha
---
Ah well back to the grind
---
Special event: owner logs off server to see if an odd or even number of people fall to their death 😂 (assuming it overhanging the cliff) everyone wear your PA or goat legs 🐐
---
How do I do this? Got a link?
---
You can skip the entire silo, everyone knows. The only wait is for the launch prep
---
https://bethesda.net/community/user/valseek?language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en
---
Unfortunately there just seems to be a number of problems affecting gameplay at its core and to be honest it needs to be addressed as in its current state it’s unacceptable
---
If it just happened in last 10 minutes, its because the dailys and weekly reset and its advised to not be logged in during this specific time every Tuesday.
---
Yeah that’s what I feel like aswell they just want me to be toxic and kill everything and rob everyone
---
Really? i've never had this problem at all, and my pc is not even that great.
---
Oh ofc lol
---
Yes and people tend to be using their new BE gatling plasma witch sends the body into orbit, please don't it's annoying
---
Gotcha. So just avoid FFR and hit over 100 rate for the gauss mini. And get one of those effects you listed. Does the barrel matter?
---
That bot is too woke for me sometimes
---
I always give it 30 min after reset to make sure. Insane we have to do this to try avoid the bug
---
The one where you get the animal parts?
---
damn, I'm on xbox one
---
Ahhaha no it’s not a complete overhang it just has a nice view from the side where it’s at
---
In the past it was believed there was a buff to the SBQ based on the number of players, many old players don't know this was disproven and are angry thinking your presence there is increasing her damage resistance.
---
Props to you standing your ground as well as kicking SBQ butt so early on!
---
Caps can't be stolen
---
The clean logos kinda got me, as well. 
---
It makes sense that they have Military Grade gear (Revolutionary Outfit) because they have access to an armor. They must've had access to a printing shop, too, I guess? 
---
It is what it is. Leave it to bethesda to give a faction Merch.
---
&gt;"Hey, while you're there, you mind getting this, that, a pack of Winnie Blues and A bottle of milk?"
---
Spot the Aussie :P
---
I'd like for them to up the score per thing so were not going to be forced to spend atoms to finish it. That was a real dick move on bethesda's part. I'd also like to see the removal of the NW dailies in adventure mode. its bullshit that we have to lose score daily due to a mode we got no interest in. I use some mods so going into NW mode is a double pain in the ass.
---
I think they meant 1H/2H not unarmed. That being said, unarmed is better if not using PA.
---
Wait in order for it to work properly you have to be in vats? That’s what I have been doing wrong then. Ha
---
Help! How do I switch from Carnivore to Herbivore? Do I really have to remove all my mutations and hope for the best? &gt;&lt;
---
No, it's not too fast. What you found is one of the reason why the HM is imho still better than the fixer .)
---
It's serverlag together with a usb-polling rate above 500ms. That causes the system to generate 2 shots where only one was intended.
---
This bug has been around since beta and is the reason that a HM can do around 3k dmg per shot/mouseclick, if the build is bloody+sneaky and the HM instigating.
---
What are you supposed to turn in?
---
That's some adorable stuff right there.
---
Dudditz seemed to stay within a short radius of my camp module, so I moved it around inside my house until he stayed indoors. I have a three story 2x3 house up against a cliff side so half of his radius wasn’t accessible to him. He would occasionally glitch through walls or stand on furniture, but when he did go outside he stayed close to the doors.
---
Yeah, this is the buggiest daily that I have come across. In the end I just canceled it in my pipboy and got the quest a few days later where it finally worked.
---
That's why you nuke someone's base who has established a few workshops. They usually don't give up on the workshops and let their base take one for the team.
---
I've had a lot more newbie players taking pot shots at me. They must not realize the majority of players have passive mode on.
---
Had this pop up the other day. Not sure how/if there is a way for the bot to accept your completion.
---
It's an honor system. The rule is don't be a dick. You wanna take 2 things and resell? Fine. All of the things? Honorless dick. Who needs caps that badly anyway.
---
What platform are you on? PC, lets group up!
---
It’s in the atomic shop today 🤣🤣
---
O and so you no Bethesda already said they realized those were to hard so now they dropped it to kill 1 AI
---
Haha that was legit my first thought, I know you’d never intentionally do that though 😉
---
Glowing meat steak +25% melee damage for a bloodied melee build. Also if your looking for luck buff charred SB liver is +7 luck.
---
It was just added for free to the Atomic Shop
---
yep my instigating lever is my fav (unless I have to shoot up a bullet sponge and then I will break out a perfect storm)
---
It has been broken like that for one of my chars for some months now, my alts can finish the quest like they are meant to. I had that for a while with Queen of the Hunt as well (not working on one or two chars), but that issue went away with a patch. Hoping for Play Time to magically fix itself some day, too.
---
fix it to 200% and run with gunsmith maxed out.  a decent skin would be nice for sure.
---
See update in post, thank you.
---
I think they think they're expected to do team stuff and just don't want to. They probably don't understand they can just do whatever they want anywhere on the map and ignore the rest of the team if they want. If they don't and they want to do team stuff it's as simple as joining, swapping to team chat, and asking the team members if they want to actually team up for some events or whatever. You can usually tell a team is actually working together if you join and they're all on team chat talking though. I've only run across maybe 1 in 20 teams where that was the case.
---
why so many?
---
Pics?
---
Solid week this week. That astroturf is an instabuy
---
Disappointed
---
Ah goddamn it - I wish I'd seen this beforehand :(. That's 7000 SCORE down the drain at Rank 32 which put me thereabouts on track.
---
Thank you 👍
---
I think i got it from one of the watoga vendors way back when
---
Ga... garage? Garage?!?
---
Finally the prefab! Also that astroturf is real nice. Solid week for camp items
---
Yes. and you'll not get the points back. They know it's an issue though.
---
Good news today it seems lol.
---
Yeah this is unfortuantely a known issue, someone posted about it here 25minutes ago telling people to log out to prevent it :/
---
The garage exists!
---
Red rocket garage is here and you're disappointed? And its only 500 atoms..what
---
No, the Gatling Gun default is a non-explosive, which means it gets benefited from Heavy Gunner perks. If you want more damage, you can also use Demolition Expert on top of that with Bloody Mess to maximise your damage.
---
Explosive Heavy Guns are as you said fat mans etc
---
Looking at the question again, I think you're correct. Lol. I agree, though. Unarmed seems to have the highest single target dps in the realm of melee.
---
no vertibird power armor for my birthday
---
why even live
---
sounds like a couple of kids who heard how bad 76 was at the start from a few youtubers who themselves didnt play it, saw it was free on gamepass, and thought it'd be an easy greiffest.
---
i ran into one the other day. after the third bullet in my back, i turned off pacifist mode and beat him to death with a mole miner gauntlet.
---
some people need to be taught a lesson.
---
Thank you for the insight! That's super interesting information.
---
Yes, the thing is a beast up close when I know the shots will all land. Just weird that the second shot is still so wildly inaccurate...
---
I hadn't even considered the polling rate. I have a Logitech G502 and it looks like the report rate is set to 1000. I'll try turning it down below 500 and see if that helps.
---
Garage? GARAGE?!?
---
Edit: GARAGE!!!!!!
---
Edit 2: https://twitter.com/HyperknightG/status/1283129514424500231
---
I'd sell my left nut for a lever gun skin but I have a feeling my nuts are going to be safe for a very long time.
---
The base damage of the weapon will be amplified by the perk card but not the added explosive damage.
---
My camp budget is already maxed out. It's pretty neat, but the only neat addition.
---
thank you! because I was getting super confused
---
Just bought it! Looks sweet!
---
Worst is when I’m desperately trying to fast travel out of a nuke zone but the drop site is covered in dots.
---
I believe the fastest barrel for the Gauss Mini is the default one. You also don't have to avoid FFR. It helps but limits you to only being able to choose primary effects that trigger magic damage (Junkies, Stalkers, Instigating, and Medics). A junkies FFR weapon can be great for magic damage if you're speced to use it. I just go against it because the Bloodied +Magic secondary effect has higher damage and is more ammo efficient. If your heart is set on the Gauss mini I'd just save all the rolls you get that have a magic effect and pick from among them which one you like best. Use it for everything but SBQ (you can use it for her but RIP your ammo because it will just work like a normal weapon). My main spec is melee so I just kill the SBQ with my Deathclaw Gauntlet. Magic heavy weapons are basically just for farming mobs ungodly fast. 132% XP boost plus glitching the line in the sand spawns is a recipe for 1.5 levels in 15 minutes at level 260, lol.
---
Sadly it is. Current temporary solution is to be completely logged off the game  during the reset period.
---
DAMMIT, I literally just redid my camp round the fact I wasn’t expecting the garage to arrive anytime soon. Oh well, back to build mode it is
---
"This new microtransaction is here and you're disappointed!!! what???"
---
It's just a fucking garage.
---
sorry, all i got is roasted mirelurk.
---
Lmaoo no I did do it on accident tho once and felt terrible tho on my other base that literally floats on top of a large point
---
there was one last week tho
---
500 atoms, and it's active for 4 weeks? No one should complain about that at all.
---
I have my camp setup just above the ammo factory and it sure does scare people when they are inside and hear it raining when im taking the factory from them
---
The military and winterized paint never came out but im not sure about the atom cats so i just added it in the list
---
I do. I have a lot of mutations. But I use Class Freak and Starched Genes.
---
Why do you want to buy your ranks now? Won't you be able to play for the next 2 months? Plenty of time to squeeze some more ranks out of it
---
Happy birthday!
---
No, I purchased the game at release and even played during the BETA. Since the release of the game on XBOX GamePass my game has been just relentlessly "Disconnected from Server". This is all on the public "Adventure" servers as I cannot afford right now the Fallout 1st membership. Most of the time I will get about an hour or two of game play before it disconnects, other times I get anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes before being disconnected. A few times it has disconnected and I try to load back into a new server and it disconnects before even fully loading into the server. I have checked over and over with my internet provider and there were no service interruptions during these times and I had been just playing
---
When is the reset period and when is it safe to log in?
---
Thank you! I was going to experiment going with a rifleman build as my next step. As /u/DismalDelay101 pointed out, it's a significant DPS loss switching to a semi-auto receiver, but I guess I need to weigh the value of the DPS loss vs. the extra bullets I'm not wasting.
---
Khicks01 - same as my reddit handle 
---
I might be on some time around 7 tonight or tomorrow all day
---
It's a great weapon, just don't expect a lot from it during a queen fight as explosives don't do a lot of damage to her. 
---
Have a second weapon at all times because that thing breaks a lot.
---
Yeah i don't mind spending money on a game i enjoy. Call me crazy
---
Whatever works for you. Maybe I'll have some input on the roulette wheeler design after reading. My sparks of genius are intermittent at best.
---
I mean, in the same vein militia groups in the us do have "uniforms" with patches and whatnot that they play dress up in so i guess why not the freestates.
---
I dont mind the clothing as much as I hate the flags. I just wanted a solid white flag with the logo not the weird shit they gave us
---
We try to warn people here ahead of time, because this is well-known issue.
---
I wish, but I feel like that’s going to come out closer to the Rebuilding Atlas event next month since it’s a BoS skin.
---
You can.
---
Can you link me to it please. I scoured the shop many times and have never noticed one.
---
I use a black flag with the logo
---
No worries mate, I got confused on that bit too when I started my build, but glad I could clear it up for you 🙂
---
I would think so but I’d save them until the season is about to expire. Tiles get more costly in terms of score as you advance on the board so you get more for your atom the further you progress on the board first using just score.
---
According to the devs, yes.
---
Daily reset was 12 mintues ago :0 It tells you at the top of the Daily/Weekly challenges when they reset.  Most people are saying to make sure you're logged off 15 minutes either side of reset.
---
I was logged off, I logged on 5 minutes past reset yet it's still all auto completed....
---
Great......
---
What hot fix?
---
What level are you? Either way, it'll be faster to just start an alt and spec right than to change after level 50. If you are on Steam and don't have anyone to mule the gun over I can help.
---
Sweet thanks dude 👍🏻
---
You’re more than welcome to! I actually don’t have any camp related stuff that gives or takes away radiation. But I also don’t fully buy that people put stuff in their camp just o fuck with other players. And even if they do it mostly makes things interesting
---
Hmmm wondering if the raider collectron is worth it
---
I like it :)
---
With 9 to pick from, there's a better chance of being able to complete the "complete 5" challenges - which I cant always do in the time I have to play during the week.
---
now
---
And you sir are a tool, perfect for the garage!
---
Chocolate?
---
I came on 5 minutes past reset....
---
Honestly. Best advice i can offer is get fallout 1st for a month and fill that scrapbox with as much junk as you can find/buy in a month. Then cancel it. You can still access a scrapbox and take out.
---
I dunno what to tell you, it sucks :(
---
I set up in the dip in seneca peaks...wonder what i could hit from there.
---
It used to be 20 minutes after daily reset (it was 1am for me). Then it was like 17 minutes then 14 minutes. Sometimes you could hand it in 4 or 5 times. I don't know if it still works though.
---

---
Another big draw back of two shot is not just the bloom, but the recoil kicks like 3x harder 
---
Definitely a heavy handed nerf
---
I have almost 5,000 atoms plus first that gives me 1,800 a month.
---
Lol can’t wait to get to rolling and have this patched right after. Incredibly helpful info. Not necessarily heart set on the mini it’s just the only gold weapon I bought so far and heard it was rather decent.
---
Not only this, Tenderizer, Action-Boy(girl) both are broken as well. And there's propably more that people don't even know yet.
---
theres one at all times in the skin section but the one for last week is gone
---
Holy shit. I really sorry man. You should definitely try to put in a ticket for that.
---
Seems so
---
It would be sexy
---
I don't mind if no one joins. I can just farm all the mobs solo and get 2 or 3 legendary run ranks per event.
---
The camera is useful when you can't find that pesky legendary mob you killed because of bushes, darkness, water, etc. Just look through the viewfinder and it will list which mobs/corpses are in sight. I would have hung on to the camera for that reason alone.
---
But anyone can build their camp how they want to. Traps, rad removal, locks on all your shit, whatever. Unless I’ve encountered greifers I have never felt anyone was maliciously out to get me
---
thats today or tomorrow i believe
---
Can anyone confirm if you can build the prefab on foundations or does it have to be built on the ground?
---
no
---
The people who leave a shovel at the cemetery for the buried with honor quest.
---
Same, I planned on buying everything today and being done with it
---
I've finally come to terms with the fact that the fridge is never going to return.
---
tru
---
Bethesda will wait a while just to look good for the press before they implement the option to buy ranks.
---
If you are on PC there are a lot of modded weapons out there that can do that easily. On console a bloodied player with the right weapon, chems, food etc. can do close to that amount of damage. 
---
To get really high damage you have to become a master of food, booze and drugs.
---
Yes 
---
its how my missus and me play
---
set one as a the primary 
---
add the primary psn account to the secondary ps4 (log into primary account on secondary ps4 - download all games from primary account to secondary ps4)
---
you get all dlcs purchased (fallout 76 is free anyways)
---
you dont get promotional items on secondary account , like pre order bonuses etc  for games
---
I had a Rad shower just below my vendor level,(from top down theres my landing pad, then you go down to the vendors, then you would have to go down again to find the decon arch) most fast travelers would not even see it until they finished with my vendor level and went downstairs, and they could bypass it by jumping off the rail., until someone pointed out that someone coming up from the event that pops occasional by my camp would be coming up from below.
---
Yeah it was on pc
---
Wished they would give us actual cars as props. The parking lot of my dinner is pretty empty.
---
When you can’t turn in a quest just move the cursor off the robot and put it back on and try again.  It may take a few times but it does work.  I had to do it like 12 times the other day before it registered.
---
since when can you make different body types everyone is anarexic
---
I'm sorry but with all the posts lately I dont log in an hour before and for an hour afterwards. We gotta work around this best way we know how until it gets patched. Sorry this happened to you.
---
I'll probably use mine for storage, but to each his own.
---
It might be easier to just trade the gat laser for a better gun that suits your build. I’m sure you’d get some good offers for it.
---
It states that it’s adding logging features to track what’s causing the auto complete of score challenges. 
---
So my guess is that’s all it did. It’s probably a rolling hot fix that requires no server down time.
---
Yeah, once rejecting, you still have to wait until the next day after reset to pick it up again.
---
I don't know this for certain, but I'd assume atom rewards from the legendary run are the same. I don't know why they're split but they're split no matter the source (lifetime challenges, old daily challenges, or buying them). For the other items (skins, workshop items, caps), other skins from the atomic shop and plans and such always carry over so I think they'll probably carry over. Same with caps, scrip etc since it's in-game rather than an out of game currency.
---
a simple switch right next to the shower is the easy solution for vendors; but they don't do =/
---
I used to use it on the mountain side in as revenge against the mole miners for potentially killing the overseer.
---
The date is on the latest community calendar they released.
---
PC to PC, Steam to Steam, yes, as long as you have the same login.
---
only thing that wont transfer is your pictures, so load screens wont be consistant. but actual progress is saved server side.
---
What, the station pump skin? That's for the shotgun. The lever guns has 3 skins, none of which were in the shop recently.
---

---
Missiles, for sure. Don’t think it takes mini nukes, tho.
---
EDIT: Today I learned to stop dropping mini nukes on the ground. Thanks, fellow 76ers.
---
Check angry turtles videos about it on youtube
---
I would not quit on seasonal rewards right away. Yeah it’s frustrating and needs to be fixed asap. But I expect bonus events for extra score, extended season or something similar as more and more people start complaining about this bug. 
---
Upvoted for visibility.
---
I am embarrassed to say level 350ish. But I have had the same basic build since level 100.
---
They've told some people in tickets they are not able to adjust score. Only option right now is to not be on during reset .
---
Nice
---
my main is an instigating with vats 25 and 33.  bloodied prime explosive for anything big trying to eat me.
---
I am a sneak, vats crit, rifleman build. I have always loved semi auto rifles and for me it is just the most satisfying gun.
---
I also have an instigating laser rifle and handmade I use, one for low lvl, the handmade for targets in large numbers.  two days ago i just got a BE handmade from a super mutey in harpers ferry, but I have not made the switch yet. I am thinking of giving that one to my commando build. right now hes rocking a B combat rifle, AAE handmade, and B 10mm submachine gun.
---
the rest are for nostalgia. furious, anti armor, executioners, two shot. i never use those ones these days but i like to hang on to them just in case. who knows, maybe someday we will get the New Vegas style ammo loadouts and I can configure a few differently like I do with the combat rifle.... Honestly though I like them so I collect them. One day I would love to find an instigating black powder or dragon so I can really feel like I am on the hunt.
---
Do you need a certain amount of them to trade in?
---
Personally I would wait at least an hour at minimum.
---
Sorry for the confusion, but we only have just one PS4. On games like FFXIV, we would have to buy the rights to the game twice per each account.
---
I'm just wondering if this one is like that as well.
---
I am logging in right meow. here goes.
---
I've had pretty much exactly the same happen, i am out 6500 SCORE. Definitely raising a ticket for this!
---
You can enjoy the game whilst also not blindly throwing money at whatever stupid shit they put in the microtransaction store lmao.
---
Why spend money on a game that never gets fixed? Why do you guys constantly ask for **more** atom shop items rather than asking for **more IN-GAME CONTENT to earn**
---
They added a new Collectron?! Guess I have an excuse to buy that Piper bundle lol
---
Bethesda only does triple xp weekends after a **really** big fvckup from their side. We only had one so far (3x xp weekends I mean, fvckups are debatable... ;-)).
---
I had my n.w. weeklies autocomplete last week.  I reported it and still haven't heard back.
---
I run 3* Friendly Fire and a Bloodied Shishkebab with swing speed, I always walk into Rumble with it out to say “hey, healer here”. 
---
Folks catch on about 20% of the time. Usually I end up having to run for ore because *nobody* else will and we lose ½ to all of our scavengers.
---
I didn’t know and same. I’m so close to rage quitting. I missed Tuesday - Saturday dailies last week, managed to get the weeklies done in the nick of time and was looking forward to catching up, but the only way I’ll manage that now is by grinding the hell out of the repeatable. Argh!
---
I’ve been waiting for the ceiling fan.
---
On my 3rd Character, visiting the Giant Teapot is also broken/bugged for some weird reason.
---
That's just the hive mind, no need to care just wear their downvotes with pride.
---
12:05pm start, I'm only about 10% into a level.
---
12:05pm joined a group, that was hard.
---
12:07pm glowing creature - a snallygaster at flooded train yard
---
12:10pm killed 10 mole miners down in ash heap
---
12:14pm killed 10 scorched at Distant Thunder event
---
12:15pm bought ammo 3x for 3 caps from someone + got the 5x challenges down.
---
12:20pm finished a daily, took both raider &amp; settler otherwise would've been quicker.
---
All that I have left is the NW kill one critter - which i can do no prob, and level up once.  And if i don't have time to play for the level up I'd just make a new character and get them to level 2, whoopdy doo.
---
**Edit**:
---
12:45pm leveled up my alt (lvl 101) who was about halfway there already.
---
The last Datamine showed a car as a stash, it is the model of the small blue car of the roads
---
Hate it, but wouldn’t play this game without it at this point. Everything stays if you end sub, just lose the tent and won’t be able to put anything more in the 1st bottomless stash but retain its contents.
---
They have to be in your inventory. You can't convert ammo that is in your stash.
---
What do you mean if your build are gone? I missed mine for a few days last week and noticed nothing in my camp
---
Mine has a switch and is placed at the entrance to my camp where you don’t even spawn at so if you hit and lose your mutations - it’s on you not me
---
Glad i'm not the only one who experiences this.
---
Were you playing at reset time?
---
Almost looks like that was the area in the load screen of fallout 4..
---
I wish they would sell red rocket sign separately from a prefab. This prefab is super tiny and not a proper RR gas station.
---
Quad crossbow with explosive mod. It's such a fun weapon.
---
Happy Birthday!
---
And forfeit the daily level-up for 500 score points until then? Bad advice.
---
Alright, thank you so much :)
---
My camp is in the same spot. Im afraid of using my artillery because of the robots...
---
I was a stealth commando with no extra effects outside of the legendary effects on the weapons.   I burn through.45 and 5.56 as a commando.  I had all of the rifle prrks and my mule had a bloodied lever action.  Tried it, and damage is awesome with way fewer rounds of ammo.  However, I was used to running around in a stealth suit with full health.  Had no worries of a scorched beast dropping poison.  Also, I could more easily tag a bunch of enemies with the commando allowing others to benefit.  Now torn between having to constantly grind ammo or adjusting point to handle 20% health.  Probably go back to commando.  Do junkies, the drunk effect or beserker help the stealth commando?  Or is there another?
---
Nice to know they know 😒
---
They must be unable or unwilling to fix it, I wonder which it is?
---
I have just lost 6750 SCORE due to them being completed as the weekly challenges changed.
---
Bethesda have been ticketed. I am appalled. 
---
Regards from the Carromkid
---
The durability drain reduction on Gunsmith is broken, and hasn't worked since this patch released.
---
yea, I've thought about it.  
---
But I'm also the point/level where if I do lose junk, its more of an inconvenience that anything else.
---
(I do make sure to stash "important" junk - ballistic fiber, ultracite, flux regularly.)
---
Seeing the way you talk about "hitting your loop hard for 20 minutes", don't you think giving people shit for finding it hard to hit that level up every day a bit .. dubious ?  
---
Kinda like a runner giving someone a hard time when they say running 5 miles is not easy, not everyone shares your attitude towards xp loops, all the more power to you that it comes easy, but that does not mean it can't be hard for others.
---
Oy but that reload time is bruuuuuutal on a double barrel hahaaa
---
I thought Addictol was in an inhaler.... 
---
hey you did say Shit in a Inhaler, and given that people use Addictol to take more drugs....
---
Idc enough time grind it, i only log on to get my script at this point and buy 3 modules a day.
---
I can not even put it down. It says furniture exit is blocked, anywhere in my camp, even on wide open field.
---
No definitely don't respec then. You will get the alt to 50 well before you can change SPECIALS and perks.
---
no i dont think so because we us MMO  online server games regularly on my  ps4 i have a third account i used years ago before moving country
---
i log into it sometimes and have access to all games on the systems hard drive.
---
unless im wrong
---
It’s not actually the “vending” tab. It should be under appliances iirc
---
Hahaha that's fantastic 👏
---
33 as of last night.
---
Lmao, thank you guys so much!!!
---
Well we got one today lol
---
I put mine in a bathroom against a wall to imitate a shower
---
Yup, I had the map open at the time and saw them all dropping in. Don't know if that has any bearing on whether or not you get stitched up by it.  I am not keen on testing the the theory.
---
Arktos Pharma almost top floor from garage.
---
why can't you?
---
This.  So this.  I wonder sometimes if everyone did this we wouldn't have all these posts.
---
Sorry, they are supposedly working on it, but you can kiss all of these strait up goodbye
---
Same problem here. Seems to help to go in/out on VATS. Very annoying.
---
They're not scamming you.  It works for most people.  What is the specific problem you're having?
---
Action boy is broken? Is that confirmed?
---
That is my dilemma
---
A bad workman blames his tools.
---
I found that Collectron station hate being put down on any other surfaces than completly flat ones!
---
Can confirm he collects booze, chems and ammo. It's one of the funnier bots too. It's threatened to cut me and says it knows where I live lol.
---
Car bed.
---
45 is still really good considering Bethesda capped levels at 50 which makes utterly zero sense. Hold onto that!! Lol
---
Gunsmith and White Knight's reduction to durability drain don't work as of patch 20
---
Inhalers sure :) but it isn't until Fallout 2 that some kid decided to put feces in them :P
---
i just saw 5500 score autocomplete when the new set of dailys/weeklys rolled in, hope they fix it soon, hope they can reimburse some of it, but i'll settle for a fix, hardly gona make it with the time i have, and this does nothing for my hopes on that secret door :p
---
It was implied pretty heavily that the kid in FO2 was *not* the creator of Jet even when that game came out. 
---
And even then, if Bethesda *did* retcon jet, they did it in FO4, not 76. So get mad at 2015 for that, not 2020.
---
Got ya there
---
Right but 250 atoms (originally 500) is just a plan I already own in game? It's not an actual vending machine that people can use? That's trash for 250 atoms
---
They appeared a few patches before NW was announced as a teaser.
---
It will return, but when it does it will be the arktos fridge.
---
It's part of the storyline from the vault in Nuclear Winter. You can also find the overseer's dead body. The bucket of bolts is the ZAX computer in the vault.
---
if your buying atoms, get it first, you get more atoms on top of a mobile micro camp, unlimited stash storage, and the ability to stash your junk almost anywhere, plus free sleep and well tuned buff.
---
also privat world for quickly jumping to a place your farming, 
---
Private world to avoid PvP at workshops
---
Private world to let you loot any spot for whatever your farming
---
Better off putting in a ticket with Bethesda. Highly more likely to get results that way, rather than here.
---
You're finally free
---
lmao I had no idea.. Is there a list for that anywhere? Because I probably have a few perks on that are broken and can't really tell the difference
---
Could've used that garage a week ago when I was starting my red rocket build... we will rebuild!!
---
It's linked to the story behind nuclear winter / vault 51
---
“Did you forget the rest of the us play this game too?” Last I checked no one was going out of their way to make sure low levels weren’t getting scammed, everyone getting the opportunity or atleast chance of hitting a legendary enemy like the Queen or the Fasnacht Megasloth, or in any other way making this game enjoyable for the “Rest of Us” so no, I’ll place my stuff however I like in my camp and I’m not gonna feel bad if you  hit it without realizing because no one else felt bad about the rest of those issues
---
There are two. The inlay skin and the starlet sniper skin.
---
It's excellent if you can feed it. Ammo is heavy as hell and expensive to craft, but if you have a BFFR or a solid magic one it can be worth it, especially once the ammo crafting legendary Perk comes out.
---
The Gauss Shotgun is much more ammo efficient and IMO potentially more broken. There is also a shotgun "magic" effect system, but I'm not familiar with that one.
---
It's known now that having the game running at the time of reset creates the bug.  Bethesda knows this.  The work-around for now is just not play at reset time.  I am surprised there are people that don't this yet.  But I feel bad for them.
---
No.  I waited 3 hours after it updated.  I went straight into adventure.  Checked challenges, and none of them were completed.  I played for a little bit doing the dailies, and decided to do the n.w. daily.  As soon as I entered v51, I checked my challenges again, and that's when it autocompleted.
---
IIRC, There are two chest like that and their clues leads you to a body down the hill from Vault 76...they were teasers for Vault 51.
---
Mine works fine. I always leave nukashine in them.
---
No, it is annoying. It also weakens my immune system to COVID-438
---
You can't do anything to fix it. The current workaround is to avoid it happening altogether, by being completely offline either side and during the reset period. Once it has affected you though, it is irreversible I am afraid :( :(
---
well that is no good.
---
There's a ceiling fan?!? SHIT!
---
I also hate when I go to view a weapon to repair it with a kit really quick only for it to seize up on the inspect page for like 30 seconds?
---
Hahaha i feel it, that thing is hard as hell to kill!!! Brave of you to use a boxing glove LOL 😆
---
The starlet sniper was in the store just yesterday I think, it may have been a week ago.
---
I have resorted to jumping over or just leaving. Not useful to have the decon shower in the path.
---
Let me start... My third build originally started as a mule. Out of boredom, I wanted to make a build I read about here on reddit called a "food build". Basically a character with no combat skills but all the quality of life perks. After while, It evolves into mutations that have more Q.O.L.  On other builds I discovered the benefits of unyielding. So I gathered a set on my "food build" and it became  easier in combat situations. On top of that, I luck out and got a god roll in bloody weapons. (Heavy weapon). So it has been the easiest character to play. But not the best (tank/Melee) or the most enjoyable (gunslinger). My hardest is the ghoul build. For that is another story...
---
No, just chug down a Herbivore serum, and it will replace Carnivore. And vice versa, if you find you do miss that raw wolf or deathclaw meat.
---
No, it's a clean version that has an actual function as a drink dispenser.
---
It functions as a punch bowl. You can assign drinks to it which other players may take for free.
---
Your experience has no relevance to the fact that people intentionally place rad showers to keep bloodied builds out of their camp. Play the game how you want to, but don’t dismiss people intentionally doing so under the guise of “they have the freedom to play how they want.”
---
I’m not saying every single camp like this is out to grief bloodied builds, I’m sure there’s few in comparison to the entire playerbase, but this thread has a lot of angry people with upvotes complaining about playstyle lol. 
---
And Beth. recently removed the ability to stack punji boards. So clearly it was an issue if they had to change something. I’ll actually laugh if they ever add a built in on/off function to the rad shower.
---
they explained the retcon in the burrows, and the retcon happened in 4 as has been mentioned.
---
Also the quick swap won’t acknowledge my hunting rifle. Skips past it every time.
---
Yeah, had him as an ally for a while. He has all sorts of grandpa wisdom, but also farts a lot. I named him Jean-Paul Fartre.
---
Nice, can't wait to get these into my hands.
---
Yeah. It hurts. 
---
I lost 5000ish last week. Totally dreading going on to check today
---
did they fix the mechanic causing it.. or the currently popular method?
---
Right now it is 12:28 est  28 mins I completed all the daily and all the weeklys( except lev 3 time 2 to go) minus the NW which is kill 1 yes 1 AI so now explain to me again how theese are time consuming
---
Nice! Thanks :) Now to find a Herbivore serum....
---
While I spend much of my days in the decontamination shower, I place it off to the side of the entrance so it's optional.
---
If you want to be a dirty hippy, that's on you, just stay out of my house.
---
also.. wood rather have left the dupe in and fix the broken perk cards...
---
It doesn't matter if you add in extra challenges if they autocomplete.
---
I have mine at the entrance to my camp (even tho it’s not where you spawn in with fast travel) but it has a switch merely because the sound will often get on my nerves if I’m just crafting or looting my collectron or what have you
---
I'm on Xbox but I might throw it on the settlements sub if it turns out pretty neat after I redo it!
---
You can no longer sell the item to the vendor while changing to another world
---
nah dude it was available on its own, you just missed out I guess
---
Yeah, I was seriously hoping for one similar to the Sanctuary Hills Red Rocket in Fallout 4. I thought they used to sell a couple variations of the RR sign though.
---
Yeah, just checked, and it's supposed to be today.
---
I don't have 1st currently. I'm waiting for it to get closer to Meat Week to get another month of it.
---
A few days ago, a friend of mine wrote a ticket, and the response was copied: we are working on the problem, sorry. And the fact that you have to spend atoms to reach rank 100, it feels like they did it on purpose.
---
Fucking preach, where's my adrenaline?
---
Didnt the burrows just say they liked to huff the fumes of Brahmin feces not actually put in Inhalers? :S
---
Unless they fixed it today, no they havent
---
The servers are full of noobs. They are half the player base on server. It’s actually great to see
---
Lmfao
---
I was thinking about rebuilding that 😜
---
Kneel before the micro-transaction god.
---
Screwed
---
I’ve seen the ticketed responses they say kick rocks.
---
Remove Legacies, they are the root of all problems, god mod, score level abusing, pvp problems, pve problems all of which are caused by energy legacies, just like you removed the mask, remove Energy Legacy weapons
---
That might be why you didn't see the Scarlet skin for the Lever Action
---
The scarlet sniper skin was discounted last week 
---
But only for FO1st members
---
😂
---
Thanks for these - look forward to them every week.
---
I agree, I was expecting Along with the new updates to the weekly's at the same time to be able to start to buy out Progress, either they've forgotten, It's bugged and hasn't worked or they've delayed that idea.
---
I'm debating on it. What are you gonna use it for? 
---
I picked up the bird wallpaper instantly, I dig that retro vibe.
---
so.. the currently popular method
---
First off i'm not mad :)  (hoped the smiley in my text above illustrated that) Love to learn, reading the wiki over it looks like it is retconned yea
---
The scout skin is what I really want anyway so it's not so bad.
---
5 threads in the last 20 minutes that asked the same question. Not bothered to look or just looking to get your post count up?
---
If you share you stash details here I’m sure people could tell you easily how to free up space
---
Most prefabs can be worked in to regular foundations. They don’t snap together but you can play with them for a bit and get them looking right
---
Yeah don't understand either, people are getting burned out by the legendary run grind. The more they wait to activate rank up with atoms the less potential money they could make
---
Sorry I meant shack
---
Yep, same as with any ally.
---
This game man. Like honestly this might be the game breaking glitch for me
---
The day isn’t over yet. 😉
---
I wish i can, i was just a lvl 12
---
Yeah, that's what I said in the title =)
---
I think so, yes. However with the auto complete bug being a thing I would find it INCREDIBLY bold and questionable to let players buy their way through a system that's broken for way too many people.
---
Same thing happened to me today at reset. Lost 7250 Score
---
I was going to create a 3rd character for the same reason (started my legendary run at lvl 164), but at that level completing the level up challenge helps you a lot with the gain XP repeatable.
---
You should still save them until the very end since levels require more SCORE as you level up more. You get more bang for your buck technically by waiting.
---
What does the new raider collection bring and what does he say? I have the scavenger and I got the fascnacht one
---
Oh, I'm sure it was a trash response. But more of a response than you'll receive here. They have already responded to highertraffic threads. From what they said there, should be a hotfix today.
---
I have no idea how to do that 😀
---
I’m just saying it was never an advertised feature. They told you exactly what you were getting with your subscription and you got exactly that.
---
What I shared was [the original announcement...](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-announce)
---
Yea I really don’t understand why people will leave a team and the create the same one. I’ll even check like an hour later and most of the time they are still by themselves. I truly think these people are delusional. There is no benefit! You don’t have to do shit with other teammates and you get all the shared cards and bonuses. Truly confuses me. Some people said herd mentality only works when you are close to each other though is this true. I feel like I still get it just by being on a team.
---
JFC! I blew milk out my nose just reading the caption. I having such a vivid imagination.
---
(Bethesda sits at desk)
---
"Hey Bethesda, do i get my SCORE?"
---
(Bethesda sneers): "You stole fizzy lifting drink!"
---
"what?"
---
(Bethesda angry): "You lose, you get nothing, good day sir!"
---
"what?..."
---
(Bethesda disconnects)
---
Thx.  They need to reply to these reports.
---
I don’t think you can have power attack 40% bonus And faster swing speed on the same roll. They’re the same slot
---
I rate 1st, use it to farm everything then sell them on the public.  Only reason I go on public is to do certain events where need a group.
---
Dang. I lost 8250 score
---
Ever since Fallout 4 it became a community lore concensus that Jet IS in fact a pre-war drug. The boy in Fallout 2 was simply lying and just reproduced a pre-war drug. Hell, even in Fallout 2 there's some lady that references Jet existing even before the "inventor" boy...
---
Ty, gonna listen to this int he background whilst I play :)
---
Or they don’t search by new, go be dumb else where no one begs you to reply or read every post
---
Says someone on reddit for 6 years and 6 karma overall, you here to shitpost negative comments there's better things to do than scrolling through new posts
---
I use a gat laser on my commando for queen fights, it’s completely doable without changing build. All you need is a couple of perks such as Stabilized and Power User to get it going. I solo’d the queen with Vampires Gat Laser on my commando character.
---
Makes sense, as if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with mesothelioma you may be entitled to financial compensation.
---
So pumped. And only 500 atoms!!! I was expecting to pay a lot more for it and/or have to buy a big expensive bundle to get it.
---
Sadly there is nothing to be done. Always try to be logged out at least 15 minutes before and after the reset
---
Good news. I built my garage up off the ground/pond on the south side of the map and would love to buy the garage.
---
Mood
---
Thanks for the explanation, so it's hybrid with bloody now?
---
He brings drugs, alcohol (and it is said, ammo and weapons). He does not sing sadly and you can not talkt to him as you can to the fasnacht one.
---
I just put him down, his first item was a radaway.
---
Again, it *may have been* retconned in 4. But unless Bethesda Comes out with a statement just flat out saying Myron was bullshitting the Chosen One, we just wont know and will have to leave up to speculation.
---
There’s not much incentive to be a dick.
---
I'm glad to hear it worked! Keep gaming gamer
---
I love this
---
This is Fallout 76. Someone will complain. It could be free and someone would still complain.
---
I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the CAMP budget to do it.
---
Given how the Fallout community gets at times, I have no idea whether this is ironic or not. I love it.
---
Is there a Bethesda email to contact them about this?
---
&gt;Myron was bullshitting the Chosen One
---
To be fair, he was stabbed to death later :D Karma and all
---
I'm almost at rank 35 and I'm starting to get that burned out feeling doing the score challenges daily, I'd like to purchase the rest and move on waiting for new content
---
I wish they know about this
---
I read various threads and got that there was an issue out there.  I just made the mistake of not following up what the issue was I guess. I usually play at that time and it hasn't affected me. I think having the map open contributes.
---
Wow definitely getting the garage just 500 atoms too
---
You can submit a ticket. But many others before have done so and have been told there is nothing to be done about it
---
It's power armor jetpack. It would've said ss jetpack skin
---
Better to do it in both places. Flood the subreddit for media coverage and flood their support
---
Maybe then they'll address it
---
Nah, i am fine so they can borrow me and fail
---
Some people just play the game for the base building, for a survival game it's got a lot more variety in base decorations than others 
---
Some people just wanna be interior decorators, that's their endgame, they don't care about those fixes you want, and are very happy with the state of the game
---
Yes! I’ve been waiting for months and months.
---
nice ad hominem. "There's better things to do than scrolling through new posts" like making the exact same thread as the others before you? Doesn't take a lot to just click on 'new'
---
&gt;You don't like Bethesda, you don't like 76,
---
the fuck are you on about?
---
I love Bethesda, and I've been playing 76 since beta.
---
That doesn't mean I buy shitty microtransactions lmaoooo wtf is wrong with you. Add shit to the actual GAME to be EARNED. Fix the fucking game and put some care and effort into it.
---
Isn't it supposed to be fixed with the hotfix?
---
Honestly I wouldn’t worry about specific build items until lv 50 you won’t have the cards to make it work anyways
---
got a link to that datamine? I haven't seen it and can't find it anywhere.
---
Bless our father Todd
---
Unfortunately, no.  Only the inside can have wallpaper.  The wall snaps to the floor with the inside facing that floor.  If you put a wall between two connected floors, one side will always be an inside and one and outside.  Many people have requested walls with two inside sides.
---
&gt;whatever stupid shit they put in the microtransaction store
---
Where did they say they buy EVERYTHING on the store. They buy what they like and deem usefull - like this garage.
---
&gt; Why spend money on a game that never gets fixed?  
---
If noone spent money on a live service game, the game would be dead. Also, the people working on new models/textures for the Atom store are not the same software engineers that would fix the ingame bugs. That's like asking why the cleaning lady in their building isn't fixing bugs as well...
---
That garage is an insta-buy.
---
You really need to chill the fuck out man. Your attitude is so garbage.
---
Since when do hotfixes work with 76?
---
You can "stack" doorways with the "outside" facing in towards each other, edit them to walls, and then wallpaper them?
---
I think that's the solution you want (we don't have double-sided walls atm).
---
Fascnacht already brings me enough alcohol and food, drugs are good but I have alot Of them already
---
Gunsmith, White Knight, and Lock and Load are all broken as of patch 20
---
Lock and Load broke on 19 though, you can sorta fix it when the bug happens by holstering your heavy gun then taking it back out and your reload will be fast again but Gunsmith/White Knight are just useless rn outside crafting
---
Yes, heavy weapon, food build. A walking Department store...
---
What makes this mess even worse, we can soon pay atoms for S.C.O.R.E. levels. Feels a bit like a ripoff
---
There was nothing on the ground at all.
---
&gt; they don't care about those fixes you want, and are very happy with the state of the game
---
If you don't care about seeing a game you like improve and advance past 2005 levels of technology then what the fuck is wrong with you
---
I did not know I needed that!
---
It's happened to me a couple of times, I found it don't happen if I close the game at least an hour before reset and don't login at least an hour after reset
---
Sure, and I don't plan to buy til later anyway, I'd just like to know the option is there so I can relax my grinding a little. If they decided that, due to people getting bugged challenges, it would be a bad look to sell ranks this season I would hate to have stopped trying lol.
---
What's the Raider collectron collect? And what are his lines, are they hilarious lol
---
If you're not in game at the time of the reset you should be good, I make sure I log on like 10 minutes at least after the reset every day and I always have my challenges
---
Lmao you guys take fanboying to another fucking level. Yes daddy  Jeff Gardiner give me more microtransactions and uselss shit! Take my money. Don't bother fixing the game I'll buy your £15 skins anyway!
---
Issue for me is that as a low level, it’s hard to get mods so I just end up using a hair trigger hunting rifle
---
Enemies scale within a certain range in the different zones. They will scale to whatever level the most recent player in the area was, within their allowable range. If you get there and everything respawns, they should be leveled for you, but if someone higher went through and didn't kill them, they will still be higher level.
---
Here is a map of the level zones:
---
 [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-zone-map-with-recommended-level-range/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-zone-map-with-recommended-level-range/)
---
Very Ironic... Im a man of both mystery and sarcasm
---
No, they only said they were adding logging to help diagnose the problem.
---
This would be a good reward for season, instead of more skins.  Something permanent and beneficial in game.
---
45% chance to ignore 100% of damage or ignore 50% of damage at all times, it is still not insignificant.
---
It's just that now Bloodied gained another bonus that "balanced" builds don't get, that is additional experience that is directly tied to S.C.O.R.E
---
That they don't work in PA without clear-text is a dick move from Bethesda.
---
Aww I like the vault tec pa suits
---
Forgot to mention that I'm lvl 165
---
😄😄
---
*uR jUsT a CaMpInG nOoB*
---
Rank 39 same
---
Yeah no idea on how to fix the issue, oh well.
---
No. You a dirty boi and need a wash
---
So fuck Bethesda for not doing anything to fix the bug and fuck bethesda for trying to do something to fix the bug?
---
Red rocket garage tbh
---
Nothing you can do except leave it in your stash forever or drop it which destroys it
---
Still possible a different way but im yet to see all the 12 year old kids doing it.
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
Triple A game huh? 🤔😂
---
I put a 20 round clip at 95% vats point blank into a ghoul and not one did damage. It’s crazy
---
What all does the raider one collect?
---
Bethesda please take my money, I'd like to move on to another game please?
---
You can present your opinion without throwing a fit like a petulant child. Keep flailing around on the ground, you'll get what you want eventually.
---
Why are you buying today vs at the end?
---
Hey, have you had any luck with it since? I'm having the same issue with the 'Paired keycard 01' in Kanahwa Nuka Plant not spawning as it should. At first I thought it was like a world item pickup cooldown since I screwed up my first time trying to open the door in Overlook Cabin with them (hastily swiped them in wrong order by accident), but everything else seems to work just fine. Don't get how this could bug out all of a sudden. Been trying to server hop a few days now without any success for that one.
---
Big Iron is not the same if im not in the mojave..
---
Glad to hear that I'm not alone lol
---
Where do you get the artillery at? I'm level 82 and I still don't have it.
---
&gt;If noone spent money on a live service game, the game would be dead
---
The game has been on the verge of death for over a year. That's why they keep bringing out new monetisation schemes.
---
&gt; Also, the people working on new models/textures for the Atom store are not the same software engineers that would fix the ingame bugs
---
Literally where did I say that?
---
Again, nice ad hominem. Try focusing on the contents of my post next time. And again, it doesn't take a lot to click on "New", knowing that the weekly reset just happened and a lot of people will be having the same question.
---
eh, someone will get em eventually if they play like that. sooner or later they'll piss off the wrong player. just work on building yourself up
---
The patch before Wastelanders re-introduced this rubber banding effect. It’s impossible to use VATS in PvP now as well. The first shot is the only hit that causes damage, no matter how many times you exit and re-enter VATS.
---
The bug happened for me before I even placed stairs. I had initially just put down two floors, walls and a roof for a shack.... but I deleted the roof and walls and the floor bugged. 
---
Restarting my PlayStation fixed the bug, I think.
---
Garage 1
---
Carriage 0
---
For real, is one of the best 😤
---
Just got to keep trying. Server hoping doesn't work for me.

[Atom Shop Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hr4a4o/july_14th_atom_shop_update_for_all_my_fallout/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
I already lost 2000 score points (build up a workshop or camp\\ kill huge creature). And I logged in the game only NOW.  How does this even work lmao.
---
Glad to know I’m not the only one noticing this. The worst is when it happens with a black powder rifle, crossbow, or some other weapon with a long reload time for a single shot.
---
Okay, yeah, that's what I've been doing. I set an alarm on my phone that goes off every day 15 minutes before midnight (that's reset time where I am).
---
I usually shop based on number of items, I’d rather go to a level 50 with 100 weapons than level 500 with 20 weapons
---
Tedious and time consuming?  The only ones that comes even close to that description was the recent one to repair shit ten times, beyond that you can complete most of the non NW challenges, and even MANY of the NW challenges, in short order.
---
My build is kinda broken rn with perks being weird, so i love being the guy to run into each mine and stock up on ores
---
Yeah, why does no-one go Builder? Best for levelling up
---
Seems completely random. Lots of people losing it when they haven't done anything around the reset etc. There's something else causing it for the most part it seems, but I don't tempt fate and am always logged off at reset regardless. I for one have never had an issue and I haven't really adhered to anything other than that. 
---
It's hard to tell if that's the majority as obviously people don't come here complaining for nothing being wrong, so it's hard to gauge how widespread the issue is.
---
Having said that, even one person being affected by an issue like this with a huge game addition and grind where everything matters, is one person too many, so...
---
yur not missing anything it was a complete wate of atoms even on sale. holds barely anything and only keeps things maybe a half hr long than not using. yur better off using salt perk.
---
Thank you! Must've missed it
---
In Fallout 2 someone was already addicted to Jet before Myron "invented" it and you can tell to Myron that you don't think he invented it.
---
You can find jet in place locked since the war in Fo3/NV.
---
And in Fo4 jet is mentionned in vault 95.
---
So yeah, I know Chris Avelonne said that Jet was invented by Myron, but it was retconned by Bethesda and it's not lore breaking anyway.
---
The way I see it, Myron created a more powerfull version of Jet (because you can't cure the addiction, unlike Jet in Fo3/NV/4), and the New Reno family helped popularize it in California. 
---
Myron is the Walter White of Fallout.
---
Good idea tbh
---
You can't even be in the main menu or it bugs out, the game needs to be completely closed
---
I genuinely can't believe I was blindly defending this game just like you back around launch.
---
I bought the garage just for putting my workbenches in cos it looks awesome
---
I’m now just confused on why you’re looking at a lv 25 gun now lmao
---
I would want to buy that guy a beer.
---
Well, same for ammo... but yet I have to wait until it finds a weapon.
---
And if it is shit, I can reprogram him to get the proletarian foods, water and stimpacks/radaways.
---
Edit:
---
The weapons and ammo is a different option.
---
Logged out during reset. Logged in two minutes after, and finished all score left available for the day/week in less than 5 minutes.
---
Yeah, why? Is there a discount or something?
---
its one of the best lights in game
---
To Chloe at Berkeley Springs
---
Yup
---
Only happens sometimes. Usually when a low level walks through
---
I was unaware I was defending it at launch, that's news to me.
---
i used to have 3 cannons and would drop shells on anything in range. fun times!
---
Oh and I know you are jocking but some people here are really butthurt about dumb things like this...
---
Red Rocket Garage!
---
Happens to me at random time.
---
I know that. I was asking what items are you suppose to turn in? Toys, flowers, meat?
---
Chems and booze, ammo and weapons, scrap and junk, fasnacht treats.
---
Same, It was a doozy, 8/9 dailies and most of my weeklies, 7500 total.
---
Nice, I’d still save as much as you can until season end. Then you’ll have more left over for next season’s run.
---
I should try that out haha
---
Did you load into the server in that area? You load into the game at level 1 so it would spawn the lowest levels. Try loading in elsewhere and going there after.
---
You're welcome, It was pretty buried.
---
Because later levels require more score to complete. Your better off seeing how far you can get and buying at the end.
---
You’re completely right he’s averaging 1 karma a year clearly a shitty person
---
Nice. I might get that one.
---
You can change your characters look at any point, including being male/female
---
The level of mobs is determined upon a player who respawns nearby  
---
If you fast traveled there on a high enough level they'll be fine  
---
But if you got on server while being there they're gonna be low level since every player is level 1 when they first get on a server for like 30 ish seconds
---
It happens if you spawn there when logging in, same with whitesprings will spawn level 9 ghouls
---
Where did I say I didn't like the game? I don't like the shitty atom store practices, the massive number of bugs and issues, and the players like you who act like it has no flaws.
---
It just happened to me. Five of my weekly challenges got completed. No point in submitting a ticket.
---
Thanks dad wasteland steak n cheese
---
Oh jeeezee thanks for letting me know, I had tried to join someone erlier and it didnt work just figured it was that specific server
---
Keep it and use it for SBQ.  I’m a rifle build.  Re-spec’d to be a heavy melee user - but I still rely on my Fixer for half the engagements.  In general, melee works well as a solo user.  Not so much in groups or events. 
---
I don’t find much of a need for heavy weapons outside of events in general.  If you have points in strength might just opt to put a few into heavy guns so you can swap.
---
I honestly think he's bugged anyways. Maybe Wanderer can move in next but I've heard she's a bit annoying
---
Seems not to be active yet. 
---
Serious question though... why do you want to pay today vs in 8 weeks? Get more score for your atoms.
---
 What does the Raider Collectron collect?
---
Yeah I guess you’re right. I’ve just been feeling a little burned out since my week 2 got autocompleted.
---
The raider collectron, finally!...someone with the guts to help
---
Pls
---
You cant anyway, I just looked to see if it was possible :-)
---
I’m praying they will add a mail system to move non-droppable items between toons on the same account. I’m not holding my breath though. I did the rep grind on two of my five toons; I won’t be doing it on the others. ;)
---
You are not furthering the initial argument by throwing fallacies at me.  I repeat, focus on the contents of the post, not on the person posting it.
---
That garage is cuuuuute!
---
I make a decent income. I am all for throwing a few bucks at a game I enjoy.
---
I feel like at this point, they dont even try to fix the game anymore. If its broke let it be broke but if it affects monetary gain then boom must fix within day. Really sucks to see bethesda become what it is today.
---
But that would take away from the RPG aspect of the game where your secondary plays the part of a mule.
---
/s I honestly hate it, too.
---
You can Google magic legendary effects and you will find the list. Mine is limb damage but you have to fire at a certain speed for it to work.
---
just clogging up the system...
---
You know the bug exists and yet you've decided... assumingly on multiple occasions since you say "yet to date"... to just ignore every single warning and just stay logged in to watch your score disappear?
---
There are levels of accountability here.  Way at the fucking top is Betehsda for not having this shit fixed yet, but a little lower is your personal responsibility to stop running face first into a wall while complaining that Bethesda hasn't removed the wall yet.
---
Well I would have been working at this point in time. But it is useful to know that people were trying to look out for others. Rather than retrospectively being smug about it.
---
Glorious. He asked for it, bathe in his tears!
---
I've never done it before! People feel so strongly about how it should go that I'm nervous to try!
---
I also had a friend tell me that somehow doing this event could cost you your equipped weapon if you don't complete it correctly, is there any truth to this?
---
I keep seeing this posted, and I honestly don’t get the eagerness to throw Atoms at the game board this early in a 10 week run. But even if people have their reasons, Beth may be holding off until they figure out why so many people are getting the challenge autocomplete bug and how to resolve lost SCORE. Imagine having lost points and then having to spend that much more in Atoms to catch up? Bad look there.
---
I believe it’s under the ‘walls’ section. Look for the atom symbol.
---
Exactly, same with Poseidon. I love the shit outta my private server.
---
Yea that’s annoying, I just would wait if I was you
---
What made you think people on this sub loved Bethesda lmao, all they wanted to do was get some cosmetics from a battle pass. What are you gaining from this. This is also coming from someone who’s just gonna buy their way to lv 100. I don’t understand what made you post this.
---
Red Rocket door is not sliding =\
---
I've heard if you recollect the parts, then spam her, then donate to 2 of Todd's 3 favorite charities it fixes it 12 percent of the time.
---
Do you actually have something else that’s useful or constructive to say, or was this it?
---
Lol where did I say it had no flaws?
---
Rate of fire has to be super high and I have limb damage. There are other effects that work too. So penta barrel on the GMG with limb damage = broken.
---
I like to hide the construction light and use that, I have 6 of them in my whole camp and it’s all lit up.
---
Yes it's four squares
---
Well, the 2 original still talking even with the silent head mode... 
---
The chest talks too.
---
Not sure about the shadowed one.
---
I'm a completionist in that regard, if I start something it must be finished there and then in its entirety. Except for Beckett's fetch quests cause f#ck that guy.
---
Thanks for the tip. This happened to me today.
---
(sigh) I'll never get a Radium Rifle skin.  No love for the Rade' Runners.  What else is new?
---
I have an outdoor camp with minimal flooring so just gonna replace the floor I have to make it look more outdoorsy
---
He basically insults you and is mean. Just like raiders. He collects chems and beer
---
Shit son. But don't sweat to much. Upcoming double XP will give you a chance to get back on track.
---
West tek is in for a arse pounding.
---
Hey simps wheres my sandwich
---
As I said to someone else, real money trading is an issue, but it's not solved by making hundreds or thousands of hours of people's effort worthless. Real money traders are also not the subject, so I don't understand why people keep bringing it up. It's a completely seperate issue that literally every game in the world that has trading has to deal with. It is in absolutely no way unique to 76.
---
The point is that duping is unarguably wrong, it is cheating, and should be harshly punished. No one should be able to have everything they want without putting the work in. Like they can now. It makes the entire game pointless.
---
It's not only weapons and armour, it's also rare apparel, therefore even if we do get 5* Legendaries (which, if possible, people will only dupe to worthlessness again) the apparel is still completely worthless. Because of duping.
---
I would never pay a nickel for an item in a game. Anyone that does or feels they have to to get a good weapon are addicted, yes. I don't. I just want my time to be worth something, unlike now.
---
People spent days or weeks or months hopping the Asylum and doing events for rare apparel, all that time is wasted now. 5* weapons won't fix that. No, I'm not one of them. I couldn't stand hopping the Asylum.
---
Why do people not care about all the real effort people put in? Is it just a case of "haha you puttedededed effort in the game, I gitsed everything I ever wanted for 3 corn"? Legitimate question.
---
As for the whole "It's just a game, calm down."
---
A) I am calm, I have provided logical, reasoned arguments as to why duping is wrong, in a clearly calm and ordered manner. All the people supporting duping are purely in it for their own greed.
---
B) If you were playing poker, and someone was pulling aces out of their sleeve, would you say it's just a game and let the person cheat? If the answer is "no", you should be against duping. If the answer is "yes there's nothing wrong with cheating", are you up for a game of poker? (Just making my point, I don't actually play poker)
---
Cheating is wrong.
---
There is no argument against that, and I don't comprehend how people think they can argue against that. There's something wrong with people who think cheating is ok. Something is broken inside of them.
---
-I included my level and time only because the other person asked, no other reason, and I am not concerned about your level and time, the length of time a person has played has literally nothing to do with whether they should cheat or not-
---
I've been playing Junkie's since launch. The most taxing withdrawals are psycho and med-x as they incur a -20 damage resist together. X-cell gives -1 to all SPECIAL, so I'd avoid that one. I run 7 addictions, including alchohol. That way, when I take psychobuff and ballistic bock (removing the withdrawals of psycho and alcohol) I can still get the +35% damage boost and keep the maximum +50% damage boost from 5 active withdrawals. I run full Vanguard ap Sentinel scout armor, heavy gun power armor junkie build.
---
You would have to have something like 25+ of weapons with the same ID to get flagged
---
I couldn't care for your "content" all you got posted is two trade posts and a bring back content post your welcome for the free upvotes people are giving you because of this argument. All I did was asked a question not get belittled by someone who scrolls through posts all day making angry/annoyed replys
---
Moral of the story: don't be a bloodied build 😎
---
Honestly though drinks should be on the house. Dude doesn't even pay rent. My fusion generator doesn't run itself! Well... It does... but that's beside the point
---
yes, thank you.  It was it’s own item not under the other garage doors.
---
Nope. Totally unique. You don’t need materials either.
---
I almost got herd mentality because with how easy it is I'm always in a group, but my buddy I always play with says it only works if your teammates are close? I don't play together on teams, I just join them for the XP. But I even join/start a team, even if I plan on server hopping because why not?
---
Spoiler Alert: Most quests in most games are ultimately fetch quests, when you boil them down.
---
garage? THE GARAGE BY GODS THE STORIES ARE TRUE
---
RIP to me who bought the Umpire apparel 4 minutes before it went on sale.
---
You've got a messed up definition of silliness.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Finally found it.  For me it was under Walls right after the contemporary stuff.
---
No problem. Happy building!
---
I'm waiting for the ceiling fan, fridge and the Thanksgiving shelf.
---
It does not stop. Season is 10 weeks total
---
You got the fabled garage tho
---
I was legit logged out all morning, didn’t even touch NW, login at 12:50 and almost everything is completed except weekly repeatable and buying two items 
---
# F
---
New Vegas too.
---
You get a 3* legendary (without giving too much away) but after all the bullsh#t it hardly seems worth it
---
Make it an hour captain. I just got burned.
---
Except there is no way to earn atoms daily or weekly now so... Meh 🤷 im not gonna be the one buying it but haha someone will.
---
No, not fully true.
---
If you bought more types of collectron, you can set up to do the other ones job. Like if you have fashnach and communism, you can set the commie one to collect fashnacht goodies, or the fashnacht one to collect water/food/chems.
---
This way, you can set the raider collectron to collect any if you have all collectron unlocked.
---
Thanks for the helpful input.
---
Was logged out and still got fucked
---
Lol I’m camping for both weekends. Great.
---
I’m the opposite wanted to make a village camp new the red rocket stuff had that garage so I waited for it to come out... a month later
---
Bethesda said fixing the score glitch has been a prioirty for them yet its been 2 weeks almost. I pray we get perks back by the end of the year
---
1 person can gather enough ores for level 1 rewards. pre legenary run, I just go in, grab all the ores and start pumping enemies without depositing the ore for the XP and legenaries.
---
at about 30s left on the clock, i deposit to clock for the level 1 reward and event completion. i don't really lose out on the XP much.
---
post legendary run does have more people doing the event, making it easier.
---
I feel ya. My 2nd is a Vats commando build with a F/25ffr/15crit Handmade. The crit meter would fill in seconds and spamming space to activate crits gets annoying. An auto activate crit would be very useful.
---
Thank you. I was worried about losing my camp if I did yesterday's daily.
---
No.
---
Had over 100 glitched lazers, a huge bunch of different types of rare outfits, and some number of 3* lvl15 legendarys :p 
---
Been handing them out like hotcakes to anyone that was wandering between wayward and flatwoods
---
Hah cool, thanks for the reply. I just bought the normal scavenger collectron  like a week ago. Not sure if i want to spend another 500
---
lol!
---
I bit the bullet. His dialogue isn’t as fun as the comrade one, but he gives a fair amount of ammo and guns. I figure between him, the raiders ammo builder, ammo converter, and owning the ammo factory workshop, you could make 1k+ rounds an hour doing pretty much nothing.
---
Yeah Bethesda was smart about this. Launch on gamepass and a week later put the game on sale just as people are hooked haha.
---
Can confirm I bought it
---
(death from above quest begins)...
---
...damn synths
---
Yep I logged in 5 min ago and got fucked. Stay out.
---
Good deal. Thank you.
---
Seriously just them alone, all they did was ask a question and you replied in annoyance how repetitive people are asking, their just as confused as most people and they probably don't want to shift through the new posts to find the "5 people" you mentioned that posted the same question. Just drop it both of you
---
Probably not til the August update.
---
Didn't take long for someone to find a reason to complain. The garage at that price is awesome. To each of their own I guess.
---
There are still lifetime challenges (new ones were added recently).
---
Nevermind it being free it could give you 1000s of atoms and they still would
---
open your map and see if high level camps or player is close to your objective of it is just relog till have non high level player arround
---
It won't snap bit you can take a little time and line it up by hand
---
Booby trapped like the trap camps?
---
Beverages like nukashine?
---
No purified water and not enough diseases?
---
Which game are you playing? 😂
---
True
---
Not yet, but you would think they could fix this faster lol a lot of people use adrenaline - sucks that it's totally not working
---
I’m not sure of any other tricks than. I’ve had issues before but it was a result of dropping, scrapping, spoilage, or cooking what I was supposed to turn in. Acquiring the items again had allowed me to complete the quest.
---
odd time it let someone in it then booted them after a few seconds. I am too lazy to put a ticket in
---
No-one does it because you need at least 3 people who know and can do required tasks:
---
1. Protect Direction 1
---
1. Protect Direction 2
---
1. Collect Ore
---
Preferably to have 2 people for collecting ore since one person can collect limited quantity per event from the look of it.
---
If any one of this tasks are not performed, Event will most probably be fail, and it is quite an ammo drain unless you're one-hit-it-all douche-bag
---
I have enough atoms and I'm very impatient
---
&gt; Who needs caps that badly anyway?
---
Idk, I would wager that the guy above you does XD
---
Yes, I was going down to the bottom of walls, didn’t think it’d be in the middle and passed it more than a couple of times, then though it was under garage doors or something.  
---
just in a group. even works in a group by yourself
---
No gat lasers r kind poo imo. As a bloodied heavy gunner, i would use a gatling laserunless it was explosive and even then not for the queen. I also feel this way about gatling plasmas tho
---
My friend has the same bug. He just lost the motivation to play this week
---
This game is getting pretty comical. If you want the game to work properly you can’t play it.
---
My profile has nothing to do with this. All I'm getting from you is ad hominems left and right. If that is how you try to argue, then I will take my leave.
---
Free lunch!?
---
Delete the legacy weapons please
---
Thats true yeah :p should still be easy enough for people to earn it plus the 1500(?) I think you get from the score board
---
I had 7 dailies and 5 weeklies complete. This is ridiculous.
---
Give it a day or two and I swear people will eventually find out that the doors of that garage do not work on wednesdays and fridays, it cannot be removed by any means except moving your camp elsewhere and somehow half your inventory vanishes right after you place it anywhere. Oh yeah, and that you can stack them on top of each other infinitely. And OF COURSE it takes 3/4 of your camp budget to build.
---
/s
---
But with Bethesda you never know... :D
---
Exactly, and that's one of the things I loved about it. Getting rare items actually took work, unlike other games where you can log in for two days when they release new content and have all the new best items.
---
You're right about the people who don't know how to play too, that's pure greed, and it's laughable that they think they're any good at the game
---
You only have to look so far as this thread lmao, I'm pretty sure you're the only person who has agreed with me that duping is a problem
---
Everyone else tries to defend it and refuses to listen to, or change their opinion due to, logical well reasoned explanations about why it's a problem
---
Cheers fella! I raised a ticket with them so that's done and dusted as far as I am concerned. Not gonna bother playing for the rest of the day though I think. I'm sure finally getting both reps maxed tomorrow will go someway to alleviate my annoyance.
---
Ionized meat was amazing when I was carnivore. After patch 20 when they fixed herbivore I switched though, too many easily cookable buffs as herbivore.
---
Ty.  Appreciate the info
---
About to level up, better take out these super mutants with a protest sign or guitar sword. Oops, I'm dead :D
---
I havent played since 5 this morning. I was logged off way before the new challenges went live. Usually I never have an issue. If it wasnt the weekly challenges this would be a little easier to handle.
---
I’ve been waiting like a year for the machete butcher knife skin to return , I think they lost it
---
buck, buck, bucket.
---
They wouldn’t destroy too much I don’t think,  my real base is under the map. O.o I can always repair.  I’d just be super sad about my Yao Guai.
---
ive had it about a year or so , its not that great tbh
---
F1st user get access to Nuka-Cola vending machine 50% discount (250 atoms). I have access to that while it's not listed in your imgur album.
---
I honestly feel like they've scrapped that whole idea altogether - which sucks and is false advertising. Are private servers even private? Like it's not tied to our own save or anything, it's just an empty public world.
---
I would love persistent workshops, but I don't see them following through any time soon.
---
I would also love bigger CAMP budget (who wouldn't) especially since they said that would be part of Fallout 1st. But how would that work exactly? When you go back in to a public Adventure mode server, would your CAMP just not populate (due to it being a higher budget than the adventure mode allows)? It wouldn't work
---
Are you 100% certain you loss the damage buff when you take a drug you're addicted to? Not trying to be rude, I've just heard it both ways. And it would make sense to me that you keep the damage boost since you're still addicted even if you're not suffering the withdrawal effects
---
I was trying to understand the scenario, because the OP had mentioned that they took it “even though they had level 3 locks” but with the changes you can claim the workshop from anywhere and when you take a workshop the locks transfer ownership. 
---
I have no ill will towards PVP, even if it’ basically dead in this game
---
Wait you don't sing fuck fuck fuck it?
---
I hope the Gold Gun skins come back. Saving my Atoms for those!
---
Oh the sound part makes sense!  I often play with no sound so I hadn't even thought of that.
---
Doesn’t matter. I got the auto complete glitch on 2/9 daily’s and 5/8 weeklys.
---
I was thinking it might also be an experiment in whether they make more money selling some of an expensive item or a lot of a cheap item.
---
Some people don't have the time to do the daily grind everyday for score. When score released, someone did the math and even if you do EVERY single daily and weekly you fall short of level 100 still. The only saving grace is the repeatable and the double score weekend coming up, orrrrr saving the hassle and buying ranks so you can just play the game when you have the time to get on.
---
Just logged on and lost out on 5500 on weekly and 1750 from my dailies. Sucks to lose out on 4-5 levels of the legendary run just because of the game auto completing challanges and not awarding the score. And even if given a ticket most responses have been that they cant restore challanges or score for players
---
It happens to me only in one place:
---
When fighting SBQ and trying to use the wheel, it lags like hell
---
Ohh shit I didn’t know this! I can just make a party and be in it myself and it’ll work?
---
I run addictions to alcohol, day-tripper, daddy-o, formula-p, and mentors because those have the least effect on my SPECIAL. Right now I also have my perk cards set to favor heavy weapons and two handed melee so I just run around with Gatling guns and mini guns and my super sledge. It’s a really fun build although maybe not the most cost-effective in terms of ammo. I also always wear power armor in combat so I hardly die. It’s a lot of fun for me and I’d recommend it to anyone looking at junkies who likes heavy weapons and power armor
---
not sure how you gathered that. guess since this is the internet you have to spell out every single detail and leave nothing for inference. 
---
so here ya go, this 'logging' should have existed day 1, and we can speculate till the end of time why it wasn't there to begin with. it also implies that their logging mechanics are subpar to begin with or were not really thought out. It also implies that the code they are looking at is likely not easily testable. fourth, they claimed to have fixed this in patch 20, further reinforcing the notion that they are not testing many of these changes. Finally, you can infer from this that the code they are looking at is not structured in such a way that the problem is obvious. 
---
I do this stuff everyday and I can count on 1 hand how many times I can't identify a root and correct each year.
---
It can get annoying but that being said I don’t find the crafting or collectron annoying so *Shrug*
---
Does switching kill the bond?
---
I got hit with the auto complete big on 2/9 daily’s and 5/8 weeklys
---
If you still have any of them change the weapon parts to reset the ID they’re going to be looking for flags best to be safe (unless you want a ban)
---
Do you smell that?
---
Why is it 4 weeks, that's too long, and why is it not free?  
---
.  
---
Just kidding.
---
Fuck
---
No that’s the best thing about it
---
Its actually a lot of reasons mostly though its the fact hackers who use 2000 bobble heads then 1 shot the queen are 99.99% of the time bloodied builds
---
add into that the 1 shotting legendary creautres and not letting anyone else get anything
---
then add into the fact most people look at bloodied build as "easy mode" and not well balanced at all 
---
then finally add into the discord servers where everyone has to listen to people scream constantly bloodied is the only viable play style and anyone who isn't is stupid and they will tell you constantly 
---
I know many good bloodied builds and they deal with this all the time to the point 17 of the 20 have just stopped being a bloodied - in their words "if you want to make friends don't be a bloodied build"
---
Ohh ok. Thanks for that
---
Thank you kindly
---
Substitute “public team” for “party” and then the answer is yes. (Not nitpicking, just not sure what you mean by “party” in this context.)
---
And that’s why bethesda can go to hell . They turned a great rpg franchise into a fucking game of house and dress up
---
Glad I am not the only one who built the first house with Wall-papers and said wait wut?!
---
&gt;*"had"*
---
probably cuz they're all pre-built structures, i would guess. tbh im surprised they let you have more than one.
---
I have a picture that proves I lost 3000 SCORE because it was the first day of the season so I had literally 0 SCORE in the meter but 3 weeklies completed lol
---
Being logged out at that time didn't matter, just got online and two 1,000 score weekly's are auto-completed, so I miss out on 2,000 score just... because.
---
If it takes you 4 days to instal... could your issues be due to your internet and/or system?
---
I just wish we had equipment slots like other games instead of just a square marks 
---
I found a life hack tho , just rename your head “main head” “main dps head” etc etc so you can atleast keep track of it
---
I use the long, purely because I like the way it looks better lol
---
Oh yes. I tested it myself on the day of public teams. And if you slap on strange in numbers and someone else joins who is mutated +4 to all
---
Normal legacy flamer has unlimited reach regardless
---
My internet is slow but it should in no way cause a blue screen crash and is more than enough to play the game. My system is fine as well.
---
Just logged in for the first time, an hour after server reset. Everything on daily except buy item from a player is auto completed. All but 2 of weekly is auto completed.
---
Thanks mang!
---
\ 
---
You dropped this.
---
So would you recommend the Short Barrel for the extra durability?
---
"...concept is awesome, the execution leaves a lot to be desired tho. "  -Almost everything in America lol
---
It’s been broke for two weeks now.
---
Yeah I agree but it breaks too often and wondering if the short barrel will be good to have for the extra durability
---
Blame the player. Why would you post this.
---
Is it an actual lunchbox or a lunchbox emote?
---
Yes but it'll make my kitchen area LOOK GOOD! What else even matters, really?
---
What makes you believe the games almost dead?I did the math a couple months ago and they are killing it for a game that consists of old ip from fo4 being run by a small inexperienced dev team and that was before it got added to the game pass .
---
Just wondering because most people don’t have this problem...
---
I think there should be cleaner vehicle props for builds. Not sparkling showroom new but wasteland dirty/restored.
---
I personally would love an APC with working rear hatch prop. Could be cool for the more militaristic builds.
---
I did hear the recollect items part but I avoid it unless I need the scrip. Just another thing in a long list that keeps this game from being it's full potential.
---
I like the care package idea - maybe just make it a craftable item given x amount of aid items or whatever. 
---
If we could put it on our quick select wheel that would be neat. Like how I can press the right arrow to use a stimpak? Press the left arrow or something to drop a goody bag.
---
Good. I don't mind a ten week grind as long as they don't pull the ball like Lucy at the end.
---
It's an emote
---
Public teams makes herd mentality so much better.
---
Thanks I thought it was me or something
---
I thought resource collectors maxed per hour....
---
I have the same problem. Right now I deleted the game and reinstalling after removing all my user data of the game.
---
I’m 6 hours away atm from it being installed.
---
Let me know if you find a fix for this. It would greatly help me and others who is looking for a fix.
---
I’ve searched everywhere and there are like 1 or 2 reddit posts of this problem.
---
One of them said reinstalling worked for him. The other unconfirmed.
---
Nothing ever happens quickly over here.
---
Do a quick search for crashes during log in. You'll find plenty of other people who have dealt with this same problem.
---
It's still not as good as you would think. Let's say, hypothetically, 10% is 35 HP. 
---
Now imagine someone fired a clip from a handmade at us. Each round does ~100 base damage. 35 rounds in the clip. That's 3500 damage. Take away 45% of that, and we're still dead. Take away 50% in PA, and we're still dead. If even *one* round hits, we're dead.
---
Ya. The serendipity in PA thing was a duck move on their part. Probably unintentional, but still.
---
I am also running some lower level guns and armor which would probably still sell as they have desirable legendary effect. 
---
I sometimes buy lower level gear in case I want to restart with the Main quest at some point with a new character.
---
As far as I know, uninstalling and reinstalling is the only fix :(
---
How do bloody builds get extra xp? I haven't played since Wastelanders launched.
---
I was in such a rush to finish the quest so I can start farming gold that  I choice raider and didn’t do the settlers quest at all.
---
I definitely regret it
---
I complain about this nearly every day brother, Todd just doesn't love the radium crew :(
---
no i had 50 copies of the same weapon and the account is still active despite heavy duping and hacking
---
How you get to +117% without lunch boxes?
---
What warning? Is there one in game? An alert that says to disconnect or you'll encounter the bug?
---
No? Just the subreddit, which isn't official in any way, shape, or form? 
---
Then you are literally not helping. I accidentally played at reset and just lost about 6000 score. That's absurd, and blaming the player is like blaming a rape victim for wearing a sexy outfit.
---
I bought this garage today but can’t find it in the menu
---
checks tommys inventory sees BE15FR Gat Plasma
---
Not even just charisma builds. Even if you can't share perks. You still get bonuses depending on the type of team you join. It's just possible to share perks if you can/want to.
---
If you have at least 1-3 charisma, put on Inspirational 1-3 and join a Building team for a good XP multiplier boost.
---
But we’re only entering the third week! Even playing casually will get you a rank or two at least between now and the last day. What’s the rush to blow more atoms than necessary?
---
The community in this game is awesome. Glad there's cool people playing this game.
---
Arbitrary restrictions on an already restricted build limit... :(
---
It's possible you still keep the damage even when you take the chem to remove the withdrawal. I figured it worked like Rad-x, temporarily inhibiting your mutations during the duration, so I just got two more addictions to offset what I possibly lose while using ballistic bock and psychobuff. The loss to SPECIAL from withdrawals is barely noticeable, except for agility. My AP pool is like 70 without running Ultra Light on my armor (at 3 anyway, addictions knock it down to 1).
---
objectively it sounds like an issue on your end with your internet provider.  
---
the game file is large, but nowhere near a 3-4 day download time unless you're running on a really slow network. National average for America is 50.2 mbp/s  
---
base game + day one patch was 96.6 GB. 
---
Using the National Average it would take roughly 4 and  a half hours to download the entire game + the day one patch.   
---
you're taking 18 times the national average.
---
Do Events as they give reward for completing plus the XP u can get from killing Mobs in them. For example the guided Meditation where loads of scorched ghouls each worth about 180xp spawn. Same for the fort defiance Event where the scorched attack in waves. Even if you dont can manage to kill them Grab a machine gun with high ammo capacity and try to Hit as many as you can two or three Times you will get full XP when someone Else kills them afterwards.
---
And basically get you int as high as possible though special, food chems Mutations unyielding armor etc as every point of int is 2% more XP. Also get in a building Group while playing with four ppl ots another +8%.
---
And play play play. I got to 95 in about two months, some Times i played like 6 hrs a day some days i didnt even play. Just stay consistent dont worry to much and in a blink you will be high level.
---
Very much agree, but with about 400 hours I only met my first edgelord yesterday. Some dude in a long black trenchcoat and a fedora would yell at everyone during the scorchbeast queen battle that they're doing 0 damage output. After the fight he'd shoot everyone and called them pussies for not shooting back. Didn't think too much about it and left him, went to Wade Airport to hack a console. APPARENTLY when you're standing on an unclaimed public workshop, even while on passive, when someone starts claiming it they can instantly shoot you. So that's what this dickwad did while I was in my pipboy, suddenly I get evaporated in 2 seconds by that same dude, calls me a low level bitch and waits for me to come back to pick up my stuff. Just left the server then and there. If you ever see a level 130+ dude named "Spite.", avoid him like the plague.
---
Sorry to bring that negativity over here, just had to get that off my chest.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't making this a priority so that people will pay for rank ups.
---
I have no doubt that other people have internet or system problems. 
---
Majority of the player base don’t have this issue, which leads me to conclude the game isn’t the problem or it would be widespread.
---
I always forget to say Thank you for posting these.  Great way to see stuff while I'm at work.  So thanks!
---
&gt;i can make my own xp with or without a team.
---
Yeah, but if you join/create a building team you get up to +4 Int, which gives you +8% xp for everything. If you run herd mentality you also get +2 to all SPECIAL stats (meaning another +4% xp), and 1 point in strange in numbers boosts all your mutations, meaning you get extra xp from food buffs if you run carnivore or herbivore. 
---
Even if you completely ignore your teammates (which 90% of people do), it's an extra 12-17% xp for doing nothing more than joining a team.
---
Ok.
---
Ya it’s a shame about that. I have lots of photos from the release of the game inside photo gallery like meat week, other events, and my friends.
---
My loading screens never gonna the same again.
---
Top it all off no score
---
And reduce the legendary module cost to 1 while they're at it!
---
considering I paid full price for the game at release and a FO1 sub, it's hard to think of that as 'free stuff', but sure people complain a lot.
---
A few days ago I had played at night around 10. Finished playing and logged off. 24 hours later I logged back in to play, and already had most of my score already completed. Im never hitting the end now.
---
Same, but I'm in pa all the time haha. I can sprint for all of 3 seconds
---
I have one...that’s why I play PS4 😉
---
Thanks man, just wondering if the event team bonus that gives 100% more event exp is more worth it than the building team, or is the building better since it’s +8% in all activities ?
---
Yes, you can play on your account, as long as the account that owns 76 is set as the primary account on the console, or you own the disk.
---
You still need PS+ to play online though.
---
It seems to mostly affect my shots at Scorchbeasts. I've had an entire 30-round magazine miss at 95%.
---
yeah I couldn't help notice that all this stuff is dropping right after Atoms become scarce and right before the BOS show up, they got me with the donut vendor and I don't even HAVE vendors
---
The amount of xp you gain from someone completing a quest is minuscule compared to the extra cp you'd get from forming a building team and getting up to +8% for every single thing you do.
---
FO1st gets worse every month, and my gift subscription still has 5 months left of falling expectations and rising disappointment.
---
The bottomless Stash Box belongs in the base game.
---
Each point of Intellect gives 2% XP bonus, have been since day 0, if you have 50 int, that's 25% Bonus XP...
---
I agree that being said, it seems really unfair to not give the scrap box to everyone.
---
Same, it was a pleasant surprise lol
---
(sad bear noises)
---
I know that struggle lmao
---
Submit a ticket to Bethesda. I don't know how or when they will fix it but it's your only option as of right now.
---
Thanks for the insight! I had a idea modern radiation showers were what you describe (more or less cleaning just surface radiation). But I figured due to how they worked in Fallout 76 clearing your character of ALL rads + mutations that something special was added in the mix that removes radiation or similar to Potassium Iodide. Also set in the future so heavily dependant on Atomic energy, they upgraded Decontamination showers to do more than a simple wash off.  (This of course comes from overlooking it as a simple gameplay feature, which is what I try to do as a critical thinker).
---
When it comes to Ghouls though, they heal using radiation in the Fallout lore, so my conclusion to them was if they're getting doused in anti radiation fluid that it would provide a opposite effect of healing.. Being harmful.
---
seeing some comments below, is it possible? That would be awesome, man. Game name same as reddit username :)
---
thanks for the comments guys! hopefully it works out :)
---
enemies are based ont eh level of the nearby players, so if you're playing in an area that has higher level player you're going to run into tough monsters. also the areas on the map were level based (not sure if the latest update changed that yet) so if you're lower level stay in the toxic valley or forest areas till you get better equipment.  Ash heap was level 20+ recommended, Savage divide and the Bog were something like 35+ recommended.
---
(workshop icons removed)
---
damn synths
---
Oh is it not possible? Add me: beakerson and I can try
---
I get it, but 99% of all quests in every fucking RPG ever made is either fetch this, go kill things and bring back X, or escort missions.
---
I work and don't get a chance to do my dailies till around 7 pm. I've never had this happen. Shit would suck ass, hope they get you guys back.
---
That is if enemy sees you, with that much Agility + some equipment it is not impossible to be always stealthed, is it not?
---
You do building team while completing the quest objectives, then switch to Charisma at the end for the turn in.  Depending on the stats, the higher CHA can also help out with getting better quest rewards in general. 
---
Depends on your needs and priorities.
---
And share a perk card!
---
Oh I didn’t realize, I thought a certain building just had a set level no matter what, thanks
---
My internet speed runs at roughly 8 mbps which is quite a bit faster then OP. I just got the same problem as OP. 
---
When signing in my game would blue screen and take me back to home.
---
I have been running this game perfectly since the release of the game until yesterday.
---
My other PS4 still runs the game perfectly fine.
---
I think its bugged :-)
---
It happened to me but I was no where close to reset. I logged in 24 hours apart since last login at 10pm. Logged in and it was already completed.
---
I forgot to sign out , on Tuesday of all days... lost out on 7K score , I submitted a ticket and the said they cannot give atoms anymore....
---
It's alright, I'll just live with it till Bethesda fixes the bug, thanks though.
---
See my problem was I couldn’t tell if it was just a new player who didn’t understand the game economy which okay fair enough any game with an in game economy and currency, it will take awhile to understand the value of things, what bothered me was the sheer sense of entitlement, dont get me wrong I fully believe in supporting lower levels, leave gear out vault 76 at your camp, just things that yeah I could sell for like 6 caps but thats nothing at higher levels, much better just dropping them for someone who can make use, but if you’re gonna act like you’re owed something that really doesn’t sit right with me
---
I honestly just want the succulents back. They were in the atomic shop since the beginning, and it’s all I ever wanted.
---
(junk bot returns with 35 lbs of bones)
---
"wtf junkbot!"
---
(robot voice): "People are junk"
---
".... wtf...."
---
(robot voice): "Synths are better"...
---
(robot kills ally)
---
I know! I would like to know the roll rate for bloodied and junkies. I didn’t get a copy of either in 60 rolls. 
---
Also, does anyone notice or think the secret service regular armor is broken at the moment? I have it buttressed with barbarian lvl 3 and ironclad maxed with damage resistance +500, energy resistance +400 radiation resistance +400 and it feels like Im getting destroyed by enemies. My ultracite armor has less resistances across the board and is more tankier. Am I missing something?
---
This is a fact for sure.
---
Pre fab limit, like lighting limit...
---
I have best luck at white powder winter sports
---
You just described the whole game
---
Just server hop a bunch. That’s how I got mine to spawn.
---
If you're not going to use this handmade, I would like to buy it from you. I have a low level toon who could use it.
---
how big is the rocket garage? can I place all the workbench plus the ammo converter and a bed there?

From Bethesda support 
---
We were able to restore atoms for daily challenges that auto completed when the rewards for the challenges were atoms. Now that the rewards are a new currency, S.C.O.R.E., we are unable to alter this currency. All that I can provide for you at this time is to submit a feedback report with the screenshots of the challenges as there could be a way to restore the lost S.C.O.R.E. in the future.
---
And? i don't see the issue here. Eye for eye and then some.
---
There are two of them. They were added to the world before NW was released. They are talking about vault 51 as a teaser.
---
I hear they fixed the dupe glitch though :-)
---
Yes. Look up Chinese Stealth Armor. I have a low agility and can stealth unarmed pretty easily.
---
thx for any help. my gf and I tried the other night but we couldn't destroy anything really.
---
I've been waiting for that free abstract wooden statue to come back, but now I know I'll miss it again since I can no longer convince myself to come back on the daily. It was free, FFS, and I've been playing since launch; it should be available in some sort of archive.
---
(looks at Fo4 buttercup Power Armor)....
---
... soon...
---
Those were a really nice camp item, especially if you combined them with the Contemptuary (I believe thats how you spell it) C.A.M.P, really made a C.A.M.P feel like a H.O.M.E lol
---
Have been lol I'll keep trying
---
supposed to be that after the two week mark we can start spending atom.
---
I remember finding whitesprings as a low level and being terrified. Got my ass handed to me.
---
I mean, I would have fun...
---
Well neither nor. For just playing around the building Team is Better if you consistently are doing Events it depends what Events you are doing Event Team is Better. Real Masterminds open a building Group, play and Do Events and just before finishing the Event they switch to Event Group for XP Bonus, after that they switch back to building.
---
Edit: Not my Post but from another topic from yesterday where a guy almost asked the same:
---
The basics of high xp gains.
---
Intelligence is the key. 1 point is = 2%. So if your max perk intell out to 15 it's 30%xp gains on EVERYTHING you do that makes xp. Craft, cook, kill, events etc
---
Rested bonus from sleeping in any bed for 40 sec. = 5% xp gains.  Note of you die this bonus is removed so remember this. 
---
Cranberry relish = 10% xp gains. Cranberry cobbler can be made for 5% xp gains. These do not stack.
---
Join the public buildings team for upto 4 points of intell.= 8% xp gains. 
---
If you can find the mutation Herd mentality and are able to perk out starch genes in Luck this will add +3 intell for 6% xp gains. 
---
Chem Daddy O gives 3-4 points intell 
---
Chem Berry Mentats gives 5 points intell. Again these cannot be stacked. 
---
If you can get some scorchbeast brains this adds 3?points intell. 
---
So it's easy to make some serious gains with these simple additions to your gameplay. 
---
 don't worry about being with your team, do your thing and use them for the boosts. 
---
Also takeover the workshops on the west side of the map. Don't build anything other than a turret or a fence and go take the next one. Wait for the hostile takeover from NPC message to pop up and go kill the low level mole rats etc and make more xp from reclaiming. 
---
Intelligence is the key. 👍
---
I'll try there too thanks
---
At the little fork in the road/railway track jsut under grafton station on the map yesterday.
---
I thought it was today too starting but haven’t been on to check if they updated it yet
---
I have very little faith in their 'fixes' someone will find a work around or the next one will go public before long
---
Yeah. They were great. Just wondering when or if they’re coming back. Knowing Bethesda, I doubt they’ll stay hidden.
---
Yeah, probably
---
Workshops are not persistent if that’s what you are asking about.
---
Nuke or Artillery?
---
I'm a usability researcher. My literal career is studying things like the demographics of who games for gaming companies, including console companies. There are likely many other statistics like this that would surprise you. Paywalls for research journals do suck... information should be free. But if you spend a few minutes searching google and/or google scholar you should be able to find plenty of academic and professional research on this topic that is not behind a paywall. It's been studied for decades at this point.
---
Part of what gives the impression of a different gender split is that women are significantly more likely to deliberately hide their gender to avoid trolling and harassment -- things like using a male character / "masculine" sounding username, communicating via text or emote rather than mic, etc.
---
As an FYI there are wandering settlers at camp sites that have vendor bot inventories.  I’ve picked up 2 long coats and a clean space suit.
---
No. Vocalness leads to action. Since the daily revision, this has been turned into a game breaking bug and every single post on this board should be demanding a fix.
---
I have not experienced this bug myself, but there are enough posts from people claiming to have been logged out during those times to think this bug can occur regardless.
---
That pothole doesn't get fixed because people like you are complacent. As long as your car doesn't get wrecked you couldn't care less what happens to others.
---
Then tell me why since yesterday my game blue screens when signing in ( currently reinstalling) while my other system I have works perfectly fine? 
---
It’s definitely the game. It’s just a file may have been corrupted.
---
Edit: nvm me just random rambling of a mad man.
---
No problem when you spawn in turn around and run towards the car should see random spawns also is there is a camp at Charleston he won’t spawn
---
The other response is to stash all your junk as a soon as you can and then go stand naked at a crowded fast travel point (Whitespring station or similar) until somebody shoots you. :)
---
Nope, just bought the thing and that happens
---
is it specifically your PS4 then? or are other multiplayer games fine and just Fallout? curious why it would work on one machine but not the other given they are in the same location and on the same network.
---
Figures, I’ve heard some suggest buying an equivalent number of atoms so when they do have the ability to buy levels you in theory won’t have missed out.  Then do a chargeback on your card lol.  I don’t know if I’d go that far, but wouldn’t be upset at anyone who did, same with xp glitch, in theory you are just making yourself “whole.”  Dubious methods though.
---
With Unyielding or without?
---
When in Rome, man.
---
And weight yes
---
Been levelling an alt the last few weeks and haven't saved for SS yet, will have a look on my main who uses it when I switch back. Was working great for me a couple weeks ago.
---
And I guess you have a 2/23 chance of getting junkies or bloodied, sounds like you've been really unlucky. 60 rolls is 120 modules which is 6000 scrip. Yikes!
---
Oh darn, you're right. Never mind.
---
I just litteratly rebuilt my camp this week. Fml bethesdas gonna make me do it again.
---
Flux may be a tad bit difficult to get but the ammo crafted you get from a few justifies it not being in the ammo converter imo. You only  need like 10 flux + perks you get a good amount.
---
More stuff that was up less then 2 months ago.

---
Lol never considered this thanks for the tip
---
My other games work perfectly fine. It’s just fallout. My other PS4 runs fallout no problem.
---
Same network and location
---
So it’s mostly May be a corrupted file which boots me and OP to home screen.
---
No, trap camps are a player creation.  I was thinking more along the lines of loony toons. Giant red button marked "do not push"  
---
There are plenty of diseases, but they don't spread from plater to player. Personally,  i think it could be a fun mechanic to be able to create a plague walker/typhoid mary type build. This is an rpg after all
---
GARY!!!
---
the gold 44 will be back on the 19th.  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4RgOXIZbtqAdvRTL7bdHzE/atomic-shop-weekly-update-july-14-21](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4RgOXIZbtqAdvRTL7bdHzE/atomic-shop-weekly-update-july-14-21)
---
That has nothing to do with the “current environment”. Humans are wired to think that more things are about us individually than they are.
---
Ex. people smoking joints on the playground next to my house have often remarked (they think quietly enough) that I’m out on my back porch watching them.
---
The truth is that I have a barely tamed nicotine addiction...
---
It happened to me and the general consensus is we're SoL.
---
I get that. This one was a little obvious though. About 6 players came in at the last couple of minutes &amp; just stood towards the end of the tunnel while the 3 of us were doing the event. They were decently leveled &amp; could have helped. Of course when they spawned in so did a lot additional mobs due to the extra players now in the event. We had been successful up to that point. We all know that the number of mobs increases with the player count at any event. Of course the 3 of us got overwhelmed at that point &amp; failed.
---
Series still has what was good about fallout imo, some of it has actually matured compared to the cringe humor of fallout 2, things grow and evolve 
---
Maybe the upcoming wasteland 3 will be more your thing
---
Alright, I’m going to switch to the short. Thank you 😊👍🏻
---
You actually can if the raider theif has the peice youre looking for. You can pass a charisma check.
---
I couldn’t tell you....
---
I just will repeat the majority of players don’t have this issue. If the file is corrupted... that is still an issue on your end... if the problem was the game... both of your systems would have trouble playing lol
---
Random bans to scare the dupers that's what I'm thinking still waiting for that infamous email
---
Haha, I never did until I saw the Condition Bar was more for the shorter barrel.
---
I didn’t say there was any.  He wasn’t using proper in game terms and didn’t seem to understand why the other guy was able to take the harvesters even with the locks.
---
If the collectron doesn't bring back stims it's because he's a flake.
---
Sometimes the games mechanics are surprisingly flexible.
---
It is impossible to be always stealthed, unless you use stealth boys,, which agility has no bearing on. I'm honestly not sure what argument you were trying to make there.
---
Naw still broken.
---
Have you really never had a moment where the "right thing to say" didn't come to mind because you were tired or distracted or whatever, and then the moment passed and it was too late? I have a terrible memory so I don't always remember the username of players who I had friendly interactions with...
---
When I was a teenager one of the most popular sections in my city's local "alternative weekly" newspaper was I Saw U. People usually used it for things like personal ads -- describing someone they thought was attractive but felt too shy to hit on -- but they also used it to attempt to return things someone had accidentally dropped or for many other purposes. They posted an ad in a weekly alternative newspaper in a major U.S. city to an audience of people which was likely much larger than the audience for this reddit sub... ;)
---
Yea I know, Im working on it. I’m just so so very upset. I was the one making my friends log off before noon out of fear of them being victim to this. I just don’t know what I did wrong but I honestly care more that I even tried to grind this out when I should have known it would happen to me. Honestly if it happens on any other day of the week I’d let it go but all but 1 of the weekly challenges too? Those really hurt
---
Yeah but why can't we buy ranks?
---
Can't get much sillier than the guy running away from a chicken.
---
Although a couple days ago, same guy was fleeing from a possum....
---
The old idea that you have to be logged in for it to affect you simply isn’t true. I’ve been at work with my pc off at reset and I’ve lost score. That just isn’t the cause of this.
---
Yeah, I have PS+ so we're all good.
---
Thank you for conforming, I had already went ahead and bought it not long after making this post so... That's a relief to hear!
---
Since we only have one console, and I don't use it as often, I try to keep that sort of thing in mind whenever I get a new game for the PS4.
---
Soooo...adrenaline hasn’t been fixed and neither has the cripple issue with the Queen?
---
Why do anything about it, it’s fixing the economy.
---
There's a soft cap on SPECIAL stats and how much of a bonus they give. I think it's ~20, or around there, but it's not possible to hit 50 using unyielding and being bloody.
---
Nah, even the concept is kind of fucked up.
---
Log out and back in?
---
What were you expecting?
---
I'm just trying to get a better picture, because there are people who are trying to portray Bloodied as jack-of-all-trades build that can do anything and excels at everything,
---
while others are saying that it's a fiddlestick =\
---
Are you repairing it to 200% ? Do you have gunsmith or science perk on so it would last longer ?
---
Restart the game possibly?
---
Lol. Even so, the artillery is disappointingly weak. If you use the buffed artillery mod on fallout 4, that's the kind of artillery we need. A blast that will obliterate everything at any given location. You wouldn't even need the 2nd or 3rd blast, just the first.
---
WHAT ABOUT THE PERKS BRUHH
---
Wow, nice. 
---
Hopefully, everyone got their B2525 Fixer while they had the chance.
---
What Do you mean nothing happened.
---
You can get your first stuff from the Atom Shop after purchase there will ne a new point called fallout first. Scrapbox emotes etc. Yeah and you can now create a Private World. To place your survival tent bring up your favorites in game wheel and press a Button that is displayed on the bottom. On PS its Triangle.
---
What Else should Happen?
---
I feel that may be a bit harsh, if you get a packed event (feed the people for example) all the high levels can monopolize the enemy spawns oneshotting everything and the event objectives can be done super quick.
---
And it it gets bitten once by a molerat it explodes.
---
Free-dumb isn’t free, it takes trillions in indoctrination to get right. 
---
I do love America though, I can’t see myself going anywhere else.
---
Floating items that are stuck without a base do need stairs connected to a foundation that is touching ground, possibly two. so do a staircase down off the floor, then connect that to a foundation block, if the foundation block is touching the ground plane then it should let you take it all down working top down. you might need to have two staircases off two different directions to two foundation blocks.
---
With
---
Don't know if it is related but I hear the thump impact of the bullet but no damage as well.
---
It's just like building a camp. Highlighting the challenge should tell you everything you need to build
---
DUBIOUS o man did someone just buy a dictionary? No body was given anybody shit. I was calling out all the people that keep whining and crying about how the challenges arnt even hard just time consuming and tedious. I actually gave a good tip out there for everyone on here for any easy exp loop to start  there run with I'm the first guy out there trying to help other people (literally out of almost everything due to in flux of game pass players on xbox) so take your shity analogy a shove it cry baby
---
You dont need to hit the button if you just use Concentrated Fire on the head.
---
How much Int do you float at?
---
Exact same thing for me to man, so far im out over 10,000 points from auto completes.  i have been not playing during the reset periods too.  i just keep submitting tickets
---
Garage seems nice. 
---
Not sure how I feel about lunchbox being in the shop... I know it’s free. But I don’t want it ever being sold.
---
This. Under 20 stuff with desirable attributes, even one-star have value for leveling alts, but don't expect to get much for them. From level 20-40, they aren't worth much. There's barely any difference between a level 40 and 50, so stuff over level 40 will sell fine. If it's really good, you can even get away with selling a level 35.
---
You should see them In the misc tab.
---
O wait sorry lol. I have read your post wrong. 
---
I thought you was saying that it was OP problem due do his internet. Which is why I sent my post.
---
I thought becketts questline wasnt too bad on my big gins character.
---
Now doing commender dagarres questline on my bloodied where a gutsy can take me out with 1 bullet, that gets the blood flowing.
---
Todd says "Sorry for your experience, here is 20 atoms and 10 caps"
---
I wish they'd just save that client side. Just an entry of CAMP objects and orientations with a check to verify it is under build limit and all saved items are flagged as buildable. That'd disincentivize hackers going through the difficult process of editing objects in (or at least make it as difficult as it currently is without persistent workshops on PC) and the claim time could give the workshop time to load these objects in. That way you'd claim the workshop and it would load your previous build in by default, but allow you to clear your saved build by going to the workbench and opening a menu that replaces the initial setup of the workshop but clears container inventories.
---
Good luck with the size of the installation 😂😂
---
Me too I was looking for a sword and was like wtf just happened
---
Delete everything an relog.
---
Yeah, i know. I was curious if anyone has a pic of what a fatty dude in the rocketsuit would look like. 600 atoms is a lot of currency just to test out what it looks like.
---
Bloody builds excel at dealing damage, but pay for that with a low health pool, and are pretty much screwed in any high rad environments. We could put on PA, but a few of our key skills like Serendipity don't proc in PA.
---
It's a build, just like any other. It has it's ups and downs. It may be the META for damage output, but there are other builds that do what *they* do better. Like a Vanguard/Sentinel build would excel at absorbing damage while firing. Vanguard/cavalier excels at absorbing damage while in melee combat. The trade off is they do less damage, but survive more often.
---
Sent you a dm
---
I hope bethesda extends this season for another couple of weeks to accommodate for that bug.
---
I just want to see the Responsers pip-boy skin and the gurney beds 🥺
---
I've only experienced this with bows and my beloved b/E gauss rifle, my though was it has something to do with the weapons charge mechanic
---
This
---
Leeerroooyyyy Jeeennkinssss!
---
I would not use it, i do miss a lot of shots and there's also times where vats even keeps shooting at dead enemies, so i'll be just wasting the critical every single second lol
---
I tend to be the same way, especially with Daguerre’s, because that was actually an interesting Fallout story.
---
they do.
---
oh wow thank you so much for this. was planning on doing herbivore for the weekend and switching to carnivore after, but i was going to just chug a radaway and cross my fingers! I've been buying all of my mutation serums again in preparation lol
---
Yep.
---
Also going into NW first also will trigger this bug.
---
Don't buy ranks until the very end of the season, get as much as you can done before that
---
The atom cost is always 150, but the amount of score required increases with each level
---
So buying higher levels is a better value
---
I’m not sure. The ticket was opened and had the same ticket number the entire time. I created one and got no where after 2 months. I created a new one and every 4-5 days replied to it and I got a response. I’m not really sure what to believe but that’s my experience. 
---
IMO- Also, replying to a ticket moves you to the back sounds like lies being told by Bethesda staff who doesn’t want a community holding the developer accountable for their mistakes. I imagine thousands of tickets are being submitted daily and the annoyance of people being persistent probably is annoying but guess what, your game, I bought it, please address my issue. 
---
**Edit
---
I don’t believe it’s Bethesda as a company but more likely a small group of people who actually address the tickets spreading that nonsense.
---
There's plenty of high tier loot to grind and trade for. Just nothing to test it on....Lol!!
---
With that being said you will get a lot of enjoyment out of FO76.  It's just old timers like me that ran out of stuff to do.  At 1200+ hours in I've gotten my money's worth from it. Just waiting for new stuff atm.
---
Good luck!! 👍👍
---
Any comment to fixing the Bungalo that's on sale? Walls still have no clipping.
---
Solid game mechanic, right there. Housework mode, does the fun never end?
---
And i thought i had a problem. lol
---
Thanks for information, searched and [found this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ah5g3z/max_possible_xp_boost/#:~:text=Intelligence%20has%20a%20hard%20cap%20of%2025.&amp;text=Charisma%20gives%20%2B5%25%20XP%20per,for%20a%20total%20of%2038.). I also derped hard and multiplied incorrectly, 2% per int would have been 100% for 50 int, per post mentioned above unyielding apparently provides total of 31.08% bonus experience
---
Ha!  It's like "Missed Connections" on Craigslist.  I know it well.  I live in NYC, so it's actually quite entertaining.  My main complaint with these posts (if you can call it a complaint - i'm just whining, really) is that, in my opinion, people make these posts solely to get adulation themselves on the forum.  Most of the time, they could easily thank the person in game.  Instead, they'd rather fish for upvotes on reddit.  What's weird is that it's only in this game do people do this.  I'm played a ton of multiplayer games over the years, from MMORPGs to service games like this one, Destiny, etc.  But only in FO76 do people continually go out of their way on Reddit to thank people in-game.  It's a fo76 meme by this point.  Anyway, I have no idea why I even care enough to say anything when people do this.  It's the internet.  People can post whatever they want.  :)
---
Push intelligence up to 46, tasty squirrel stew + group with carnivore and strange in numbers. Oh, I think it'd actually be +132% with inspirational. That's easy to maintain as the food items last for 30m and 1h respectively and are easy to refill (takes 5m to kill 3 squirrels with a fixed spawn and a couple of Scorchbeasts for their brains which will have you set for a couple of hours if you run good with salt).
---
It's also known that challenges autocomplete when you're not logged in and it's known that challenges don't autocomplete when you are logged in. This whole theory is built on very runny quicksand, maybe it's more account related or depends if mercury is in the 3rd house or just fucking dice rolling, who knows?
---
You dont do it till you do it, is the saying of some one who does it
---
Should I do wastelanders questline after I reach lvl 20 or wait until I reach higher lvl? I saw that you can craft your first Chinese suit at lvl 25 but it seems quite expensive with that ballistic fiber.
---
Cool, glad we were able to come to a resolution. I remember this post. I was just too lazy to look for it lol.
---
I love the astroturf. Bought it last time it was on sale.
---
I didn’t get it and logged in only 5 mins after
---
It's an emote.
---
Adding it as a daily would severely impact the ability to grind these. Pretty much every building with file cabinets will have one of them, the key is you can only do one at a time. I personally just check every file cabinet I see and when I get one, I hop over to drop it off as soon as I can. There are tons of good rewards, but they have a really low chance of dropping, so you want to be able to do this event more than once a day.
---
Why not make this an every day thing?
---
Lost 2 weekly myself.  :/  Was playing another game when the daily rollover happened, didn't log on till over an hour later.
---
Happened to me as well , submitted a ticket but no luck, I just keep getting the “please submit a feed back report” run around.
---
Most legacy lasers break very fast. Welcome to owning your first legacy.
---
My progress is looking exactly the same after the reset. :(
---
Does it not end after 10 weeks?
---
Yes, yes it does (except if they extend it by a week or two because of the auto-complete issues)
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
Also, daily and weekly challenges.  Specific time intervals.
---
No you got the deathglow
---
good grief what a clusterfuck.
---
He will still spawn if there is a camp there.
---
I try and join my friends public teams if I can as long as,I dont get the this team is already full b7g.
---
I remember your post and it made me hungry for a subway 😀
---
I was given a bunch of money at work that I could only collect as vouchers, so I got a PSN Gift Card and am spending it entirely on Atoms as frankly, I have nothing else to spend it on. Was looking forward to dumping a bunch of them on score to get the hanging tree. That’s about the last thing I want from the event!
---
sneak and run. sneak and run.
---
Seems like a lot of people were not logged in and still had auto completes.
---
You forgot the part where they blame us for not understanding what they ment with their ambiguous wording
---
I prefer Monongah tbh. Often get Radscorpions but they're easy, not as many waves &amp; enemies are less likely to get stuck somewhere. Plus, Uranium for Nuckear Waste. And Acid. It's all round a decent site to take.
---
Me too.
---
Well maybe he was used to lvl 17-22 ghouls there and you fucked up his spawns. :)
---
Wait till you add your unyielding ss armour count to it 🤔
---
Yeah, feels like it's a bug I've experienced for quite some time.  It just works, etc.
---
I just ran into the newbs in the pantry. I showed them your post, and they said they didn't even notice you.  They were running to their next quest because fast travel wasn't working for them.
---
While the rep grind would have been helpful, getting treasury notes every server hop is not unwelcome. ;)
---
Thanks for information, yeah I noticed that people avoid areas with high radiation.
---
From your point though on this topic on game mechanics:
---
Radiation reducing maximum hit points - do you believe it is working as intended with formulas that use max health without accounting it reduced by radiation, or that formulas should be using max health accounting for radiation induced max health reduction?
---
Got me a 2 shot 3 star.  Can't remember the two other perks but maxed out all three rifleman and concentrated fire.  Can't use vats in events cause I one shot everything.  Live and die by that rifle.
---
I suppose "I hate other players" is a reason, although the sense of it is probably debatable.
---
Yes and the figures are very clear. Females dominate the mobile space. But when it comes to a dedicated console, it's male. That's just the way it is. That can change. But it's not bad how it is currently. But there's no denying the fact, that the majority of console players, are male. 
---
That may sway the numbers somewhat, but not enough to significantly change the demographic. And that "hide their gender to avoid trolling age harassment" that exact reason, is why I posted my original comment to begin with.
---
This has been happening to me all morning, did you ever figure out how to sign in?
---
13635 Atoms. Geez.
---
Thanks for rmbing me &lt;3
---
ok Twig
---
Lot of comments and threads on VATs and yup same for me.  Been a problem seems to be bigger now
---
They could be fishing for compliments but they could also genuinely be pleasantly surprised by their interactions with other players. I definitely was when I first started playing fo76. In other games my experience as a person who sounds obviously female was not reliably positive, to put it mildly. I was actively unenthusiastic about the concept of other players running around in my fallout game. I anticipated awful interactions and avoided other players for quite some time. My opinion on that topic changed pretty drastically when I started interacting with them.
---
Keep an eye out for dead raider thieves in the wild and or a weird looking item on the ground when you don't have the quest already. They likely will patch this since it's a glitch that benefits players, but enjoy it while you can.
---
I like this idea....
---
I'm glad you posted this. I never gave the lever action a lot of thought and I've been using a handmade rifle for a very long time. But today I hit up some vendors and managed to get an AA vats Le for like 3000 caps. I'm having a lot of fun one shotting those stupid charred ghouls at the Whitespring.
---
I also wannabe able to fast travel :/
---
Can you give a compelling reason why timegates in an online game are bad?  Many games have them, why would this one be any different?
---
This shop is going to rinse my atoms. Lots of good stuff this week!
---
Not to sound mean or anything, but you’re wrong.
---
Only thing I could think of is the opposite, a Radiation giving shower. Which of course will cause immediate sickness depending on how much radiation its giving you per second. Think of it as standing inside of a destabilize Nuclear Power Plant's fuel rod room without any protective gear but worst as you're being drenched in radioactive fluid.. You would get severe burns and skin irritation then extreme nausea sickness.
---
Exactly this. I get that people want to Lori Laughlin this thing for bragging rights, but Bethesda opening up the pay to win option without resolving the autocomplete bug and addressing lost SCORE is just wrong.
---
I'm with you.  Once I did all the quests, I had a big "uh.... what other games can I play" moment. I still log in daily to do the daily quests for the legendary run, but even that can be a drag.  Just take a break and come back when some new stuff is released.  Farming gold and reputation is too annoying in this game.
---
As soon as you explain why they are good
---
No problem! Comes with the garage door and normal door. Both pretty cool too
---
I'd rather be able to use them myself.  I keep them for headshots at long distance.
---
Yeah that has been happening a lot, for a long time.
---
Knock on wood I haven’t, but I also leave about 5am and get home from work at 6pm, so I miss all the reset times and am not on, so maybe that is why.  I don’t know
---
heh, that would suck, bethesda gives us a garage, but makes it 101% of the camp budget...
---
(evil bethesda giggles)
---
I have a strict code of honor of not attacking anyone below level 50-80 except I know they are twink chars or smurfs of some high-level Player.
---
How is this a trade post?
---
It's an emote not an actual lunchbox you use.
---
Yeah, few days ago. No coat sadly.
---
You're right, but it looks like someone is duping those downvotes.
---
Foundation might have more dailies if the raider thieves didn't keep stealing their water cooled bone saws.
---
Yeah, like all but one time I did the event I was the only one getting ore.  I don't think people even know what they should be doing.
---
What :( I save...
---
You saw the existing posts and still posted a new one. Brave.
---
A while ago I cancelled my TV service &amp; now sub to Netflix, Hulu, CBS, Shudder and Amazon Prime and I'm still not paying even close to what I was with my single TV service that I rarely watched. I got Fallout First on a credit card &amp; it added very little to my monthly outgoings. My hubby tried it out for a month &amp; I instantly saw the benefits so I bought the year. Never regretted it 👍
---
it'll say like 0/5 floor/wall decorations, or 0/5 turrets. Just gotta build 5 decorations and 5 turrets to complete.
---
I know the hotfix is investigating, but it really makes you tired of having to even think about it. 
---
Daguerre put it best... just... why.
---
Did i unknowingly shit on your ancestor's grave ?, or are you just this way ?  
---
First off i was trying desperately to hit my level before it reset, secondly i have never had ANYTHING autocomplete before, thirdly i have been logged in before during roll-over and simply watched the challenge list repopulate no problem.  
---
Lastly, i have read statements either way, nothing to indicate that being logged out is a surefire way of avoiding this thing, if it really was THAT simple it would be fixed by now.  
---
Also  
---
Calm the fuck down.
---
The queen not being able to be crippled and adrenaline need to be the next fixes. But who am I kidding? They fix one thing and it leads to 20 other bugged issues. I guess that's the price you pay for a game you like.
---
Looks like the dupe has been fixed. 
---
Stand by for the next dupe that will probably pop up in about an hour or so that is probably even easier to do!
---
Barely 10k players on PC
---
Take a workshop, open build and lay some floor tiles and walls, then add stairs, etc and follow what it says.  If you need crops pick prior so you have corn, etc.
---
Its been tested so many times and INT does in fact affect XP gain...
---
So easy to test and see, dunno how you have managed to not see it?!
---
Very tried and tested fact that it does effect xp.
---
I just keep getting the quest like every 20 mins or so
---
Def gonna be more attentive
---
Yeah I'm a courier - what legendaries do you have, exactly? Any gatling F/FFR/90 perhaps?
---
I’m with you on that, once the dupe happened I had no desire to play. I’ve been end game for the last year and mostly played to trade, no sense in trading when people who just started are running around with B2525 handmades and fixers. I’ll try to get back into it when the new content drops.
---
Lol, I am looking at other games at the moment...sux that Red Dead online reviews are sooo bad...any suggestions?
---
My email from Bethesda in reply to my ticket submission with picture. 
---
“Greetings!
---
Thank you for contacting the Bethesda Customer Support Team. (Employee) here! We have been doing our best to respond to everyone in an efficient and effective manner. We appreciate your patience during this time.
---
I am sorry to hear that some challenges were completed, missing out on some S.C.O.R.E.
---
Due to tool limitations, the Bethesda Customer Support is not able to adjust points, however we are passing feedback to the dev team daily, so we will make sure this gets to them.
---
If you are experiencing an issue where you are not getting your S.C.O.R.E. points, please submit a Feedback report here under "Quests". Make sure to include screenshot(s) or video of the S.C.O.R.E. and Challenge that you are reporting.
---
Please note that feedback is provided to the development team, but you will not receive a response.
---
Thank you for your continued interest and support!”
---
Nah I only saw people debating when to spend their atoms and not answer the question at hand.
---
Same 8500 SCORE lost. RIP.
---
it does
---
If you find the missing property on the ground, you just go to him and immediately turn in the daily, and keep the item. I've had a power pack for a month!
---
That’s not how it works. You’re making the argument that the design is bad and that they should change it.  The onus is on you to support. Your argument first.
---
I like to honor the text.
---
I do not think the option to buy ranks starts until two weeks after the launch of this. So soon. They did it like that so people couldn't just buy/finish the whole thing immediately.
---
Yea i know, i bought it, then nothing happened. Luckily my friend finally told me i had to install and play the game. 
---
If you currently own Fallout 1st, the Nuka Cola Vending Machine is discounted on the special sales tab.
---
Is it really bragging rights though?
---
Oh look another impatient person who wasted money
---
I'll only spend atoms on the 2nd to last day if i dont get level 100, imho you'll get more score for your atoms the later you wait
---
Wasteland justice knows no player level.  I generally ignore PVP but I can't pass up the opportunity to clear someone's wanted status.  Sorry, not sorry.
---
I would pay atoms for additional songs, but the problem with that is that every radio is supposed to be playing the same song at once so everyone would have had to have unlocked those songs.
---
Its not a technique, its a specific roll from a select list of legendary mods, most of which are found on the weapons themselves. (see AngryTurtle's videos on the subject). Note however that *any* armor piece with +15% bashing damage will give *any* shotgun a "magic" damage boost.
---
The thing with magic shotties is that this is a byproduct of the heavy gunner 200+ rof bug. For a shotty to land a magic hit, you must be close enough to the target and have enough weapon accuracy for all of your pellets to strike it. This emulates the 200+ rof effect and causes an enormous damage boost on the hit. My stealth shotgunner was oneshotting L72 legendary dealthclaws with a **L15** pump action instigating two star shotty that had one magic effect on it. (+33% vats hit chance).
---
Tougher "boss" enemies like the L95 ancient behemoth take only three or four shots. Better shotguns can double or even single tap it from stealth.
---
When you start talking about bloodied/unyielding builds and magic effects, the damage gets truly insane.
---
The catch is, for the effect to occur, the shots MUST be fired from within vats , and as mentioned, ALL your pellets need to hit the target.
---
Power armor, like the ultracite, has hidden damage reduction at 7 percent per piece (42% total) in addition to its resistance. After a certain point that I believe is somewhere around 300, additional resistance does not really matter as much as reduction does due to diminishing returns.  So after a point, reductions are more important.
---
The hidden reduction also applies to rad resist but its 15 percent per piece (90%) total so power armor will always be superior for rads to normal armor.  This same bonus is on radsuits and chinese stealth suits (I think) too.
---
Not true please delete this.
---
It already was 2 weeks.
---
If this ever happened I would become a junk god with at least 10k screws.
---
And this is just with the low risk of losing everything! Or the high risk of losing something, if you prefer doing it in batches...
---
That's actually a super good idea regarding persistent workshops. That sounds like it could definitely work - so now we just wait on Bethesda to implement...lol
---
covid a hoax too o.p?
---
The Scorched Bitch Queen never ever lands anymore. it is really annoying. especially when she starts to act like she has ADD and attacks a glowing cave cricket on the other side of the nuke area. and then when she does come back, she lands for a second and then literally flys away again
---
Adrenalin aswell!
---
You can't meet Mr. Neeewww Vegas.

I needed this score, because the same thing happened last week.

Umm I'm doing it right now. No exp change. Teammate gaining same exp, has more int
---
Where are you getting your #s from ?
---
Dealers choice really. The sooner you get it done, the sooner you can start collecting gold and grinding rep.  Search the boards for farm locations, theres a neat interactive map where you can find locations for everything including balistic fiber. I just dont have the link available right now. Once you know where it is you can farm it out fairly quickly.
---
Yeah, it's so frustrating.  7 of the nine daily challenges for today 14/07/20 have auto-completed and 4 of the seven weekly challenges including the level up one. I've missed out on 6000 score not including 1250 score, I lost a few days ago.
---
Must have been a different set of newbs.  These two gladly took the supplies I left them, and heart emote'd right back at me.  I may have incinerated one of them, but I stuck around long enough to let them know it wasn't personal.
---
Shielded is the best?
---
My quest is glitched, the turret piece will appear in my inventory once the daily begins. I literally just have to fast travel to Ward and be done with it lol.
---
Thank you!
---
Doubt it . They think chores are fun and cater to 12yr olds
---
Well I did in my opening paragraph,  now it's your turn, just bc all online games do it doesnt make it right, theonly reason why they do it is to force you to play their game on daily bases
---
The QUEEN AND PERK FIX pls
---
If you're too low level come back later. There's no hurry. Level up and get better gear.
---
Ah damn. The one that was accidentally available 2 months ago?
---
Well that’s good to know! It certainly would be useful.
---
Hoping for some Enclave items in the future!
---
I think the *intent* was that as you took damage, your damage would go up. Then we, being the resourceful gamers we are, discovered that it worked for radiation damage as well.
---
To be fair it worked the same way in Fallout 4 too.
---
Huh how
---
I see that. Thanks.
---
Or you can choose weapons and ammo. I've been getting combat rifles, .45, 10mm and shotgun shells
---
Well we know customer service reps ctrl C and ctrl V work so thats good news. They need to be given a real solution to provide to customers instead of "we sowwee, here read what you already saw"
---
Kill anything, check the xp, take berry mentats, kill another of the same, check the xp. It's really that fucking simple to confirm.
---
Always log in to the base game before checking the atom shop or doing nw after a reset
---
Nice to see so many people falling over themselves to say thank you for fixing game breaking bugs and exploits with zero down time.
---
After messing with so many of those gauss shotguns and finally getting a magic bloodied, I personally feel like just any magic is just as good as just a bloodied.
---
Jesus... spend some of those ATOMS man!
---
Also, the garage is here finally!!!
---
We’re reaching a point where we are blaming players for Bethesda’s incompetence
---
Whether he knows it or not there's no shame in bombing his place. I'm sure this will cost some handful of materials to repair. Even if he's a Fallout 1st.
---
It says it collects ammo? Is it good or is it just as bad as the communist one?
---
I got turned into an ash pile by someone while doing the weekly build up a workshop challenge and had to force quit the game because it was impossible to respawn. It acted similarly to the dying at the end of an event and having an unresponsive press to respawn prompt bug.
---
I hope that was just a one off bug and not their fix in action.
---
There's alot of arguments in this criticism I'll give time to but not this. Noone should just be gifted everything in the season pass. If you can't get on enough to get the rewards, you shouldn't expect to be able to get them. This works the same in literally any battle pass in any game that has had the system that's ever been made.
---
I could see this being very abused, with how fast I can fill up a critical meter on weapons that can do 600-1200 damage.
---
Sneak, covert, heavy gun with fill Crit meter faster, hold trigger.
---
I would try it.
---
Done nothing changed.
---
Idk man but Jesus Christ can Bethesda just let me give them money
---
The A stands for Asshole.
---
So your saying tomorrow?
---
I’m currently planning a build to accomplish this by getting a guass mini gun w/ explosive bullets legendary stats and explosive expert perks
---
Were these players or npcs?  Either way, comedy gold.
---
I love parking lot dinners.
---
80+ gauss miniguns at this point.  Thems heavy guns.  I've gotten junkies, which is my preference, but only as a one star.
---
Sadly, despite not being bloody, I did get a B FFR FR gauss minigun, but they're non tradable sooooooo... 
---
RIP
---
My current best roll was an AA Bashing 90 so I guess that works?  Its subject to the damage stacking glitch so unless they patched that since the last time i used it it's actually pretty good until i get my roll.
---
It's Tuesday. Updates like that usually would go live on Thursdays.
---
This game is a mess, so honestly who knows. But this will make them money so you can be sure it will be released asap.
---
Yes, someone I agree with.
---
Ohhh! I did not know you could do this! Thanks
---
Wait so perks that buff explosions buff allso explosive bullets?
---
I have B E shotgun, usually one hits mole miners. So i sneak next to them breathing in their neck and hit VATS... shows i have 95% hit chance...lol “NO YOU NOT...LMFAO” says Bethesda... so i miss two 95% shots and then one shot in manual aim... WTF...!? Seriously...?
---
it doesn't matter, I joined the server 1 hour 22 minutes after the reset and I lost 7 dailies today and 4 of the weeklies to auto-completing .
---
Dude really?
---
What if you're not able to complete it through in game glitches just like the SCORE auto completing, dont you think you should have  an opportunity  to make up for it?
---
Still not enough! I did my 8 challenges (no NW) in about 39min.
---
...it begins....
---
That’s not an argument that you made, you stated an opinion. 
---
Yes, games have time restricted content to encourage players to log on to maintain a player base and player interaction.  It’s an intentional design choice because that’s an important metric to them.
---
You are not entitled to every reward in an online game, it’s the nature of online games. If you don’t like that structure, you shouldn’t play online games.
---
"We hated issuing you refunds in the previous currency while letting you keep the refunded items, so we blindly coded a new currency that just works."
---
Lies.
---
Thanks! Makes sense now. I was sitting there like 🤨
---
That is exactly what i just did. Went into to adventure and then get notified that the challenges were completed and didn’t get the score.
---
not sure we should show gratitude for things that should have never happened. No one is thanking BP for cleaning up the gulf oil spill.
---
Yep, I'll generally strip to my skivvies and bust out the finger gun dance until someone offs me.
---
Yeah, I do believe that was the intend behind this kind of perks and bonuses even for Fallout 4, need to remember that from Fallout 4 we got everything, including bugs, so it *may be* one of them as well. (which I believe, and is reason why I don't like how it works at the moment... (not hate, but dislike))
---
Wait, there are reputation dailies? I recently returned to F76 and noticed that I had two reputation bars, but never got around to actually finding out what I can do with them. But after reading your post I'm not sure if I should start lol... ;)
---
Which is also something they should fix. But at least they could fix the lagging on the 'quick' wheel, because it's near gamebreaking.
---
A ghillie skin for thr Handmade wouldve been neat
---
Tbh i wish the indoctrination cost that. Instead they just cut educstion funding and have tv do it.

I only have two unyielding. Left and right leg. I took my W there and tried grinding out the shotgun. Probably would have had better luck with the armor
---
That's the argument I would give time to. Bethesda should definitely find a way to reimburse that. That wasn't your original statement though.
---
Damn. I just got robbed of 2k from the weekly. Sorry dude
---
I'm guessing they are giving people who have saved up atoms time to blow them on new atom shop items like the garage before they allow score rank purchases. Double dipping into impulse purchases.
---
Them extending the timeline due to issues with auto completion, or offering some sort of compensation is still not the same thing as completely Removing the deadline of September. 
---
They can do one without having to remove the other.
---
People like OP will always blame the oppressed for their oppression.
---
That little feature is why we can run around in excavator armor with around 250 250 330 and still be mostly okay against most enemies in the game.
---
Though for bosses like SBQ and ISS it's better to put on tankier gear.
---
Do you work in the industry? Has Xbox ever hired you to present data about the demographics of their userbase?

&gt;You are not entitled to every reward in an online game, it’s the nature of online games. If you don’t like that structure, you shouldn’t play online games.
---
This is the part that obliterates OP’s argument. Their opinion is based upon the presumption of entitlement. And that’s a false premise to begin with. 
---
The only functional (meaning more than just aesthetic) CAMP item can be obtained with just a few hours of play. 
---
Everything else is a ‘shiny’. No one is *entitled* to those.
---
The only ones I have seen people complaining about have specifically been the NW challenges.
---
That is quite possibly the largest understatement you could possibly make.
---
Technically it not pay 2 win because all the rewards are  cosmetics.. 
---
You can buy ranks at 150 per atoms but that itself isn’t pay2win
---
I love how so many here is so convinced that Decon showers are placed there just to spite their bloodied builds. 
---
I'm sure a lot of people just, have it there for their own bloody convenience. 
---
I wanna get the rads off* me and i like it in a prime location. 
---
Truly don't understand why the outrage and the remarkably ironic calls of outrage against entitlement.
---
Haha, GARY
---
Light them on fire, or the Atom option will be pushed.  
---
Simple monetisation, it's beyond disgusting they claimed this bug was fixed, when clearly it was not in any manner even remotely fixed!.  To give such rubbish promises to the players, then offer a monetisation scheme that oh so conveniently "solves" the problem is beyond my understanding of acceptable.
---
So, it actually looks like grass?
---
Pretty sure durability is based of of hits so when you're shooting enemies you're hitting them with 5 beams at once and the an additional 5 times from there explosions, couple this with laser rifles having pretty low durability they break crazy fast
---
Sorry to hear that.
---
I had the same problem with challenges prior to the season pass thing and someone told me that he solved it by always exiting the game entirely when switching between adventure mode and nuclear winter.
---
I have been doing so and haven’t had the same problem ever since.
---
Still, really hope Bethesda actually fixes this (supposedly they had already done so, but evidently that is not the case).
---
Yet you said yourself you’re in the minority of players able to complete this season early, meaning within the set 10 week interval.
---
So you didn’t correct the OP; you knew what he was referring to.
---
Also, the daily and weekly challenges can be considered time gates: they only provide a reward during the specific time intervals.
---
As it is, I’m personally content knowing I likely won’t ever finish a season, just as I typically miss most of the holiday and special events.  That’s life.
---
Thanks!! I had to run a bunch of floors halfway across the camp to get a foundation placed but other than that it worked flawlessly haha. I just never connected the new stairs to a foundation.
---
I think it's a valid build, and now that it's been in the game for this long there's no point in changing/removing it. They would lose a very core part of their fanbase.
---
Ah, man! That sounds ridiculously juvenile. I'm so sorry that you had to go through all of that. Good on you for just leaving though. I'd have done the same.
---
I don't get why people have to be such fuckin assholes for no reason. It's a damn game, after all.
---
BTW, happy cake day!!
---
Some times challenges auto complete and give you no score
---
You said "this will also benefit", but your original point was that it shouldn't be time gated so that anyone can get to level 100 whether they play every day or not. This I disagree with. Once again if you can't play regularly enough to put a dent in the score you shouldn't expect to get the rewards. That's the point, it's to reward people who consistently play the game.
---
i noticed it didn't look like i was sweating grease in the rain
---
So season one should last until every player has completed it?  How about new players who start in 9 weeks time?  There has to be an end and leveling up so far hasn’t been that difficult. And we have dbl xp weekend coming up
---
Doesn't starched genes stop anything from happening there anyway ?
---
25k exp every 5-8min?!? How

Especially when it takes place in a mode that a large portion of the community tries to avoid if they can.
---
.......what?
---
Wanna bet it’s part of a faction set when the BoS DLC arrives?
---
If you were allowed to buy out the board today, it would have to be for bragging rights or just pure impatience, wouldn’t it? What else could be driving someone to dump 10000 atoms (or whatever it would be), claim all the rewards, and then having to ride out the season by watching a bunch of meaningless daily and weekly challenges float by and complaining on Reddit there’s nothing to do in the game and no way to earn all those atoms back? Absolutely it’s better to wait and rank up even playing casually, and then decide if you want to spend atoms to finish out. We’re only in week 3.
---
becareful... synths rumors are starting
---
They don't care they just say "sorry but we can't give score"
---
It does but just popping a rad away or running through an arch will do it too
---
That’s xcom baby! Sorry wrong reddit.
---
Wat?
---
It just works
---
I was wondering this also.
---
Agree, problem is that they might try to balance the game around it's upsides, and it's impossible due to the how high it goes when combined.
---
I'm certainly not complaining!
---
They'd have to look good for the press first.
---
Depends on your taste and how you use it, green is my favorite color so...
---
not really lol
---
It doesn't go *that* high. There's still a melee exploit that allows you to do ridiculous damage. I had a friend who used to pride himself on seeing how high he could get it. They could fix/remove that exploit, and everyone would be okay with it.
---
how is his ammo gathering? I still have him set to scrap for screws and his dialog is super annoying.
---
3rd time trying to okay it ..cant get into it at all ..just seems mundane and boring ..i think after fall out 3 its just become a collect and drop missions ..fallout 4 had some good moments ..but ..it quickly becomes laborious
---
They were experimented on by the us government not some random mutation from the great war.
---
Anyone who's mutated and doesn't have starched genes is either insane or doesn't exist if they're trying to preserve those anyway.
---
As a paying player, I am voting with my money.
---
No problem, happy farming. Its definitely good to have an alt where you dont have to spend ammo to get the stuff to make more ammo.
---
It’s the argument that many people seem to have that, if they spent money on buying the game, everything within it somehow belongs to them
---
Other then, when you buy a game, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions and the design of the game.  Sure, some single player games have cheat codes you can get by with, or you can mod the game to fit your desire, but that’s not necessarily the standard for the game.
---
Hemlock Holes... I have to do it like 5 times before it finally stops popping up.
---
It’s okay. I do one event and come back, generally have 25-75 rounds of various types. Weapons are rarer, but are usually junk
---
Overall, I think the commie bots food gathering is the most useful feature, especially if you go for herbivore.

Until he looses his score also. Then he’ll be just as upset with Bethesda’s none response.

In regards to your PvP question, there's only four ways you can be dragged into PvP: you contest a workshop, you claim a workshop and when someone contests it you fight back, you have a wanted status, or you attack another player.
---
You have some atoms my man
---
its a lil off color 
---
i had goals of making a lil soccer pitch with it long ago
---
I believe you still have the addition as far as the script that checks is concerned.  Though I use psychobuff myself as well, so I avoided psycho and buffout, though more for avoiding the strength loss.

---
Rule 10, also the responders out for is much more rare then the western. Even with the recent dupe I think you'd be hard pressed to make that trade.
---
Got an m2525 and f2525 fixer and I love them
---
I’m 2050hrs in and wish I was in your shoes. I did put the game down for about 5 months, but have been hooked again since Feb. with no end in sight. I found the quests pretty easy and got to “the endgame” quickly. What’s kept me going is the camp building. With so many new camp items always coming out, I don’t see an end in sight. I love building new camps and trying new building methods. Once you learn so many tips and tricks, it’s up to you to apply them in a unique way to stand out in the building community. And that world is always evolving. So if you like the base game and just want to play more 76, give learning as much as you can about building a shot. But if you’re ready to move on, no ones blaming ya!
---
Woah, is that the same model that's used when your character uses a kitchen stove?
---
I don't believe so. Should just be a visual bug.
---
It’s kind of annoying considering I only really used them as fast travel points lol
---
Yea [it call demolition expert](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Demolition_Expert)
---
Visual glitch only. Doesnt use caps once you own it.
---
I have never lost anything using this method

If you turn pacifist mode on via settings you will never be the person to initiate PvP, even if you accidentally shoot or hit another player it will not allow them to harm you :)
---
any bed you sleep in gives the boost. Also the stone fire pit gives the same boost
---
Any stash box you access has only your stuff in it. No matter where it is. 
---
When you put the module down it has a circular radius. You can get close but not too close =0 So you could build across from each other at a lake or something
---
Turn on pacifist mode in settings or people can murder you and steal your junk. If you take a workshop though those are pvp zones basically whether you have pacifist on or not
---
Quests don't share. which sucks. So some quests you'll have to do twice.
---
quest items for each of you
---
when you log into a server your camp will be there UNLESS someone else is in that area and then you get a warning. You can stay but wont have your camp and when you log out and join another server your camp will be back.. unless someone else is there.
---
Don't worry about perks. Just pick what you like. After 50 you can pick a specific perk or move a point every level up. You can start making a build then
---
What's BP got to do with FO? Nothing. If people weren't so toxic and maybe take time to see the good stuff then maybe there would be fewer trying to break it at every opportunity.
---
It’s so weird because I never play NW. I think it was me logging on around twelve I heard that causes it too.
---
the real question is... will the garage door actually work w/ the garage, or will another "garage door" appear next week in the shop
---
It was free for me yesterday
---
I am using Herbivore, but should be able to come pretty close.
---
It said guns and ammo....
---
Patch 21
---
Really? Guess I was just lucky enough to not encounter anything like that in my hundreds of hours of playing them over the years (but I certainly believe they exist.) It's only exceptionally bad in this game because there's a PvP game type. Definitely warrants some fixing.
---
Couse. I have many knowledges. We khajit have knowhow if you have caps ;) whoops. Wrong game
---
If your like myself and have been hoarding atoms that fallout first subscriptions reward you with each month and would rather have a life than grind challenges each and every single day than why wouldn't you spend them to rank up? People say time is money right.
---
Stopped reading at simp. gg
---
Yeah, this is pretty strange.
---
My huge question on artillery may be unanswerable by players.  But here it is.  If i have explosives maxed, does that and HOME DEFENSE make my arty better?  Fo76 arty is fairly ineffectual compared to fo4.  Forgive my probable error here as i am camping where s.c.o.r.e. Cant be scored...  methinks it was a swamp creTure near cedar swamp, i dropped arty on it daily and did like 10% damage.  Eventually i changed my arty to growing tiles on the roof and grew blackberries for herbivore, instead.....can you perk arty or does it always just suck?   
---
Dude, (damnedcanadianguy)i woulda nuked that camp, as well!!!   Wish i could upvote you more than once
---
Same with me. But some folks just like beating down a lowbie who can’t fight back. I don’t see the appeal, personally. But hey, to each their own :)
---
Also this. But just know that pacifist mode doesn't prevent your workshop from being contested and someone killing you if you're inside it. You would think this would be obvious but judging by how much I get yelled at about it, I guess not. Lol
---
so no ammo collection then?
---
Vacuum tubes
---
In my experience there's almost nothing worth doing in workshops you can't do more time efficiently elsewhere. Your net resources in/out will always be higher doing dedicated farms. I can't think of a material I don't already have 10s of thousands of except certain fluxes I don't care to specifically farm so it wouldn't really effect the balance of the resource grind. If the workshops still get attacked at the same frequency it wouldn't even make it the low maintenance option. I just think it'd be a resource sink that's actually fun and gratifying.
---
Aw dank a raider collectron. I hope the voicelines are good; as much as I love the Santa one it gets old.
---
&gt;	 1. I heard there is this sleeping bonus, do I get the bonus if I logout and sleep at my wifes C.A.M.P or can it only be mine?
---
You can sleep in either camp
---
&gt;	2.	Can I share a C.A.M.P with my wife? I noticed I can build in it, but can I actually claim it as mine too, like get access to the stored items, and store stuff myself?
---
I’m not sure I fully understand what you are trying to say here but you can sleep any anyone’s camp and when you access their stash box it shows your items. 
---
&gt;	3.	I noticed I can't place my C.A.M.P near hers, is there a rule like how far away you put yours?
---
There is an invisible barrier. I’m not sure exactly how far it is. But you should be close enough to “see” each other. You just cannot connect camps. 
---
&gt;	4.	We are lvl 5 and 6 and it said pvp is now available, does that mean anyone can kill us? Is there a way to just keep doing PVE? We don't mind PVP, but i'd rather do PVE for awhile until we lvl up.
---
Put pacifist mode on. People cannot kill you unless you shoot back. Pacifist will mean you cannot even shoot back, hence no accidental PvP. The only exception is workshops. These are dedicated PvP areas. 
---
&gt;	5.	Do quests carry over for friends? Like if I start a quest does she also get it?
---
You each have your own quests but can help each other out. 
---
&gt;	6.	How about quest items? Are they shared?
---
No. They are individual. If you have a quest and need to pick something up, you must both pick it up to advance. 
---
&gt;	7.	Are the servers always different? Like when I make C.A.M.P in one server if I joined one of my friends would it come with me? Every time I log in am I going to play with the same people?
---
Servers are always different. Your camp disappears when you log off. When you log back in, it will try and place it where you last were. 
---
&gt;	8.	I noticed the perk packs are different then the traditional fallout games. Is it worth saving your levels so you can use them on better perk cards, instead of wasting them on the perks you get early on?
---
Saving levels is not productive. Cards in packs are random. You can get them at any level. At each level up you are able to select whichever cards are available at your level, without needing a perk pack. However, you cannot save up levels to get better cards. If you are level 30, for example, and a new card unlocks at level 35. You will need to select your cards for levels 30-34 before that level 35 card is available to select.

Sleep in any bed for 30 seconds to get an XP boost.  Play an instrument for 30 seconds to increase AP regen for a time.  You lose these bonuses if you die.  
---
Your camp won’t spawn in if it’s too close to someone else that’s already on the server.  Cause, rules.  
---
Each server is random.  You can join a server your ‘friends’ are on, otherwise it’s random.  You’ll play with different people every day.  
---
Quests are unique to each player.  You do not share them with friends or team mates.  However, friends can help you complete your quest.
---
In the menu there is option to turn PvP OFF.  Default is ON.
---
You can build in a friends camp, using your own resources.  But you cannot access their resources (stash.)  This does not apply to public teams.
---
All NPCs are new with Wastelanders.  We had no NPCs when the game came out.  We just figured it out by scrap notes left behind by the people that used to live here.  The map feels much more alive now.  Most of welcome the change.
---
Welcome to 76 Wastelanders.  Hope you and your wife find it as rewarding as I have.  And don’t be afraid to meet people.  As you start to network you’ll find it easier to acquire good legendary gear...friends have a way of taking care of each other.
---
Burn the witch! Using magic to see days into the future!
---
Didn't that get broken with wastelanders? Or did the fasnacht/critter update fix that?
---
At the end of the day people spend their money/atoms how they like
---
I personally dont see the point this early, as the later ranks will be "worth more" than the lower ranks
---
And i wouldnt call an hour per day grindy
---
Cranberry relish is equal to squirrel stew and Brain Bombs are almost as good as broiled scorchbeast brain. All else equal you'd be set back 4% behind carnivore.
---
Same boat, real day ruiner. I filed a ticket but I don’t just want a bunch of atom points added to my account. I’m really pissed. I want this shit not to happen anymore to anyone. It’s really disappointing to grind these challenges daily, being cautious to not be playing at noon(cause that’s normal for games) and then to loose out on a all these points despite the fact. I was really excited to get started on them today too
---
Hi again ramm how you doin, prayin on any young kids in the waste lately?
---
I have zero faith in anything they tell us nowadays. They’ll com up with come new bs excuse for why they couldn’t add it just yet. 
---
Additionally; why can’t I purchase rank ups yet on the Seasons board? Their stupid site says I can on the 14th of July. Well it’s July 14th @ 11am and it’s still locked

It was a fallout 1st exclusive sale

---
If you buy the Wastelanders Deluxe Edition, the extra DLC (camp/cosmetic items) is only a available to the account that made the purchase. You can share the game (without the extra DLC), and your PS+, with other users of the same PS4 system, if that PS4 is activated as the primary PS4 on your account.
---
Source: In my house we have 4 different people that play the game across 3 different systems. We own the game, and have PS+, on two PSN accounts, which each have a separate PS4 activated as a primary. Anyone can play on those two PS4 systems, and either of the two accounts that own the game can play on the 3rd PS4 (which isn't activated as a primary system).
---
This is getting out of hand! They need to start compensate these poor people
---
This was brave and original. Thank you.
---
I just double checked! He can find Xmas gifts, chems and alcohol or weapons and ammo
---
Duping doesn't effect the average player? I bet the poor fuckers like melee builds I've seen at events, unable to do anything while duped explosive gatling plasmas spray everything, would beg to differ.
---
Ahhh that explains it
---
I don’t think I laughed this good in a while
---
It’s in the PTS (deep pockets for arms)
---
The wasteland 3 devs? You sure?
---
Out of curiosity, did you play NW and log off before that?
---
I'm pretty sure you can ask for a refund of the difference if that happens, but you can expect support to take 1-2 weeks to respond to your ticket
---
NO
---
You can give any collectron the settings to gather from any other collectron you own.
---
If you but the raider, commie, or default then you can give any one of those three the options from each other, if you don't buy one then none of them can be given the settings of that one.
---
So if you missed out on the commie then none of your collectrons can collect food
---
So? It’s not in the main game is it?
---
Yes, guns and ammo, chems/alcohol, Fasnacht treats, junk, scrap. 
---
Do not use set it to collect weapons, unless you want lots of pool cues.
---
Aye, very useful either way, thanks! 👍
---
Thank you, will edit
---
You probably have dodgy as a perk lol
---
You might have a disease. It can cause some kinda bleeding that drains ap
---
Are you new? The perk broke just 2 weeks ago. They usually fix after 2-3 months.
---
I played yesterday and the "visual" bug was more than that, at least for me. After claiming workshops, there was no credit of ownership on the map for me, and I had to pay to fast travel to those locations, even when owned.
---
Logging out and logging back in cleared up the bug.
---
Oh nice, lucile's lullaby as a standalone item. Now I don't feel bad for missing that mobster bundle earlier. First item I think I'll buy in a really long time
---
You may have the perk card that negates some damage at a cost to ap
---
Ok but those guns already exist in the prexisiting game? Like wouldnt u rather have a full range of functions for the game itself?
---
Take a look at the [timeline](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.jpg) they released with the [July 2 ITV](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates).  According to that, it is supposed to start on July 14 (today).
---
Bought the plans from another player so im not quite sure where you find out in the wild but I think buying it is your best bet
---
Could i interest you in a block of concrete?
---
Honestly I’m gonna have to agree with you. Although I’m not exactly for duping since it can be problem. Its almost as if the developers or more focused with fixing exploits as their top priority when something that is much MORE game breaking being the challenges autocompleted. This is the first time I’ve been affected and I’ve lost 2k score but others have lost even more than me. You would think that something that directly affects a single player would most likely be a top priority to handle but that isn’t the case in this situation or even some past situations.
---
No way how already
---
I wanted to make a junkies faster fire rate faster reliad plasma caster. 100 rolls, the cloest thing is a junkies +10% aim 2 star legendary. It is still a few more weeks before I can rid of the junks... and try it again...
---
Ah, I thought you were specifically talking about the "weightless" effect.
---
Happy Birthday!!!
---
My vendor is behind my house. It's alright XD
---
Hopefully more people hear about this on Reddit and stop logging in so soon after the switchover.
---
Yeah that's one of the areas that the pacifist mode unfortunately doesnt cover, however to avoid all pvp you could pay monthly for fallout 1st and get your own private server so just you and any of your friends can play alone in a world :)
---
Actually, I’m fairly comfortable. :)
---
I thought people might make the assumption that this is something I do, but it isn’t.
---
No salt towards u btw cause you actually adding to this discussion. I understand wym but big boys killing shit and op guns are already prexisting in the game. Its part of the game life whereas not having usable perks should not be part of game life
---
Do you know the similarity between an opinion and a butt hole? Everyone has one and they always stink.
---
You have no idea how many microscopes I’ve had to scrounge around for...and still don’t have a bloodied plasma caster.
---
Ha! Forgot I picked that perk because adrenaline ain't working - cheers buddy 😊
---
Ima just hope this aint sarcasm and say thanks lmao
---
Now now, let’s not go that far
---
Hopefully this is the week everyone realizes this bug exists. And not just because of the repetitive posts.
---
Yes, I have also heard about the theory that being logged in around reset time may also cause it. I’m usually not playing at that time, so can’t confirm/deny that is the case, though I do can at least confirm that it is not the only cause.
---
If you want to play it extra safe, exit the game completely after every session and avoid being logged in around reset time... though it’s worth noting that apparently someone caught an extra weekly challenge added last week, one hour prior to reset:
---
https://youtu.be/I3TE1xvv_c8
---
Check at 10:21.
---
Anyway, I would suggest not skipping NW altogether, since some challenges can be done extremely quickly. Yesterday’s was to simply set your CAMP once, which meant starting the match opening the menu, selecting set CAMP and placing it, instantly awarding the SCORE points. You could leave the match right after that.
---
Bethesda made those hours worthless, not the dupers. Let's be clear
---
&gt; I thought people might make the assumption that this is something I do, so I am going to say I don't. Hah, yeah! That'll show them to call me out like that!
---
FTFY.
---
Careful what you wish for, they're going to bring back the challenge for taking a picture of your level 172 friend wearing a red asylum outfit while striking the vomiting pose while standing on the tip of the antenna at the satellite array, with at least two super mutants actively aggroed to both of you, between the hours of 2:15pm and 4:29pm eastern time, with at least 5 different kinds of alcohol fermenting in your inventory at the time
---
Artillery good for neighbor disputes and blood feuds
---
Do you keep the armor and cosmetics after the memberships?
---
Lemme just whip out the quad mirv for a sec.
---
Oh fairenough so forget the market ever going back to normal
---
That’s my bad, sorry!
---
It doesn't, this is a small sample size and confirmation bias.
---
Did you get a screenshot of it?
---
Indeed you do
---
I’m really hoping for 10 free skips at some point. Haven’t had to deal with the auto complete bug until today, logged in after 1 and most of my dailies and weekly were auto completed. Shame.
---
No idea why they even bother fixing it at this point. They rather find a way to catch dupers and insta-ban them
---
...we’re two weeks in and you just want it right away for free? Like the sub wouldn’t then be flooded with posts like “Thanks a lot bethesda, now we have nothing new to look forward to for 8 weeks!”
---
No I don’t even do NW for the challenges I just let those go
---
lol
---
Please tell me there is also deep pockets for legs in PTS too? Otherwise why fix half the problem.
---
But...it’s going to be. It’s in a group of things that’s being tested right now. Hence why it’s in the *test* server.
---
With my plasma-caster build I build up a crit in 2-3hits, so I'd definitely use it for that build as I keep forgetting to even use them anyway.
---
no player hate. i've just played alone for so long. i do not desire or need others to enjoy the game. this whole omg i need xp is for what after lvl 50 your stats don't change anymore and your just xping to do what? the sake of xping? so finding the perfect maximum xp gemic? trying to stockpile bublegum?rusing to preget levels and cards for the new legendery perk system?  getting in a builder party, eating food and drink, holding the baby tiger to the east as the sun rises i get a extra 2%for no real reason otehr then to go from level 200+ to 201 faster.. the game is about surviving not being a XP hoe. just play the game its not a race to capped level since the highest guy ive seen is over 6k. you working a virtual job for no real pay out.
---
I dunno, those clean cars in watoga underground are super cool. And the model already exists!
---
I mean, yeah. Auto complete is routinely screwing us out of points and some of us don’t have time to grind to make up the difference.
---
That's awesome. It's amazing how much a little wave makes my day, especially with CV keeping us in so much. I remember when I was about a lvl 4 and someone came to my camp and dropped a pile of stims, a sniper rifle and most of the musical instruments plans. I set about making camps with a Pebbles band in each one. I try and leave as many plans as I can at stations now, just because I remember that joy of finding my first more fun plans.
---
Someone clearly woke up on the wrong side of the bed 😂😂😂
---
Apparently it's pretty decent. Other comments say it's between 50-200/hour, depending on the ammo type.
---
No problem, I went through the exact same confusion yesterday so I thought that may be it lmao
---
Don't. Just don't.
---
The garage is the first prefab that interest me. It would be cool that instead of the train car for the Slocum Joe's bundle it was a train car diner prefab
---
I noticed the option to add ranks but it's greyed out
---
Not in the quantity that there is now. They were a rare site, now they're suddenly everywhere. No argument about having the other things fixed but duping is a serious issue.
---
Right. When me and my two friends farm nuked white springs on a PRIVATE we alternate between crashing. Never the same person in a row. Happens all the time
---
Im not saying duping isnt a problem but rather I personally dont think its game breaking. Like thats a qol life fix. perks and fast travel as well as respawns are the foundations of how this functions and leaving those. I appreciate your opinion and addition to the discussion
---
I just read that. Was spot on to be fair
---
Ya, shotgun cripple FTW. 
---
I run this solo on the private servers all the time. When I try it on a public server, some dork comes in and kills my crippled ghouls and messes it all up.
---
So even though it's a pretty ridiculous scenario to be in, it really is damned if they do and damned if they don't for bethesda. My biggest question is why they only added the logging 2 weeks after this issue was first brought up, it seems like logging would be within a few days and the SOLUTION would come after 2 weeks
---
Yeah that was always there
---
I'm fucking done with this game Bethesda knows about this and wants you to fail at playing their game they want you to be so red in the face, thats the experience you can expect from fallout 76 and probably every Bethesda game going forward.
---
On the last point yeah, make sure to use all of your level ups as soon as you get them.  You may need to pick some cards here and there you don't really want or won't need down the road but it's the only way you will unlock the better perks that come later.  Once you hit level 50 you can bank points if you choose to.
---
Occasionally see posts on here wondering why they are for example level 40 and don't have access to X perk that is supposed to be available now.  You aren't really level 40 until you have spent those 40 points.
---
What promises are unfulfilled?
---
Cool. You've missed the point of the post entirely.
---
So NW is still giving Halloween, Christmas and Survivor rewards then?
---
At my current base i just spawn in the water lmao
---
 im over level 200. i dont casre about 17% xp boost. who am i trying to impress? who am i racing against whos trying to beat me ? what were is this going ? after level 50 you just xping to get more packs and perks. already done it bro. my persk are set, my gear is set i'm just walkign the wasteland farming tickets . which isnt effected by a xp bonus
---
How much is Shadow Prime?
---
Theres been a lot of commotion in whinesville about old men on the internet trying to talk to young kids in the waste! For some reason that instantly made me think of you rams!
---
And if it gets a distant look from a ghoul, all server contracts rad worms.
---
Not legs, just arms.
---
What even is normal? The “economy” has always been out of whack
---
I think it's more useful when you set it collect alcohol and chems personally. Pretty decent selection of usable items.
---
They could alternatively, just extend it out two weeks, or compensate people by giving everyone the points missed out for two weeks (if they were really generous)
---
How widespread is the issue even? Yes I see there are issues, but is it affecting 5% of the player base, 10%?  Not that anyone here probably has the actual statistic.
---
Lmaooo just trollin yuh I was howling waiting on your response lolololol thanks for pitching in. Made my day
---
It’s just because damn trolls or trap Camps that we can’t have something nice like this.
---
Me too, but sometimes under my porch and I have to fast travel again to get out.  Second time it moves me to a safe spot though
---
Did you log off from NW or adventure?
---
Wait, it's possible to give the photographs to Davenport?
---
I just started over the weekend im at work now but send a dm and ill shoot my GT so you can add me
---
I haven't really bothered with it for obvious reasons, but if this is the dupe I'm thinking of, it was already possible as soon as wastelanders launched because they undid an anti-duping change from before. I'm wondering why it took so long to be brought to their attention
---
They’re adding in additional challenges all week long and probably moving forward. There will be a double xp event. Just keep playing for now
---
You could always go pvp and just claw through the wall :-)
---
I completely stopped caring about reputations for Wastelanders. It’s a time sink I’m not interested in and frankly it gets extremely boring very quick.
---
As of last night it was 😬
---
What was it about?
---
None of that makes logical sense.
---
Are you really complaining about getting removed from someone's event group when they are trying to run events and you aren't? The main point in event teams is the event completion. A lot of events can be finished in under a minute or two; It's a trap, Manhunt, Sound of Thunder, A Real Blast, Project Beanstalk, the flatwoods agriculture event, Horde Events, Over run workshop defense events.
---
Also complaining about being melee only in events is laughable, put down the crayons and use your brain. Maybe you should carry a gun around with you that is easy to tag stuff in events with, like a tesla rifle (legendary effects and perks don't matter, you aren't using it for damage) and get off your melee only high horse.
---
Maybe, and bear with me this might sound crazy...maybe implement a way to track and delete items that are duped hundreds of times? That would be more helpful than sticking a bandaid on a severed head
---
Since they supposedly added some sort of “tracking element” today I’d think that now would actually be a great time to submit those tickets for lost score.
---
Fair enough but all everyone want is legacy and if you don’t have one legacy or presents it’s kinda hard to get in the legacy ladder lol
---
I feel maybe a couple free skips for the weekly atomic shop free item would help.
---
And quest locations still fucked on load in :-)
---
Good tip. I run Forceful on a lot of my automatics just for the durability. It almost doubles it.
---
Two good ones and a damaged one.
---
Feel better?
---
I reported it.  I put on my report "look, I know your front page says that some are auto-completing at 3/5.  But this is different for two reasons: First, this challenge only goes up to 3, and second, I have only done 1."
---
Their reply was a cut and paste of the page *that I just told them wasnt the case*.
---
will always be out of whack wit guns existing new players have 0 chance to get.
---
Fairest thing to do is remove them completely
---
When someone is being a fat d,i always keep a couple orbital strike smoke grenades.i just stand there let them keep hitting me and just drop one at their feet..lol.then i watch them get smoked.
---
Yo, thank you for the heads up. That's 5 whole points I've been wasting!
---
TBH, they can do anything at this point. Also, i thought someone datamined the fact that there's a repeatable "event" challenge coming up so i thought they will switch
---
Na, you're fine. OP and the dude in the story had taken each other's workshop, so they both had PvP enabled between them. If you have passive mode on you're fine to shoot at them.
---
Pacifist mode is a must if you are like me and habitually spray bullets everywhere during events. 
---
What can I say? My aim with automatic weapons is a little poor.
---
Not to mention that the raider that has the item has a chance to be legendary, small but it happens sometimes
---
You imply like you have?
---
Some people have the income and not the time, as people have the time but not the income too. Some people are also impatient, and want some of the rewards now. Either way they said it would release today and it hasn't, with no post as to why.
---
I didn’t log until an hour after reset and still lost most of my dailies and weekly. Wasn’t even on the startup screen, was playing doom during reset time.
---
Lets say I am only playing game 1 min everyday so what they need to do something for me too ? Everything in legendery run is optional you can still play your game without  skins or atoms also If you want you can keep earning score even daily and weekly's are done with gaining 10 k xp challenge nobody said EVERYONE WILL GET REWARDS
---
I do this all the time and leave raw fertilizer on their bed.
---
I don't care that it's there, but the feature really just feels like the ultimate clown to me. You have 8 more weeks to play the game to earn a bunch of skins for free, but you can choose to pay in order to not have to play the game. Even though you paid for the game to be able to play it
---
Most believe building is wasted on Bloodied builds as their Int is so high anyways.
---
I have also lost a total of 11k score. It sucks.. submit a ticket, they can’t do anything about it, but hopefully if enough people do it they might give some free atoms as a compensation
---
Now im curios too please try to find and share it
---
There are enough Aussies and Kiwis playing 76 that Bethesda gives us shoutouts in Facebook advertising, so it's to be expected, you know? :D
---
To play devil's advocate, some people are just lone wolves. They don't care a ton about being a part of a group even if it means xp and caps. If you've been playing a long time xp and caps at this point is kinda moot.
---
I'm usually on most evenings. Gt: Newsman77.
---
Better is to make orbital strike grenades.you can throw them anywhere you want.its fkng glorious.annihilates everything.
---
28 without buffs.
---
hey but they are giving you a bonus of ~3000 available SCORE this week, that fixes everything!
---
this is seriously fucked up.
---
also, can everyone stop with the smug "sHoUlDnT hAvE bEeN pLaYiNg dUrInG tHe cHaNgE." this is not the only way it happens, and regardless, people shouldn't be met with this shit attitude just because they didn't know a workaround for Bethesda's fuck up. give people advice, but drop the shitty holier-than-thou and know-it-all attitudes.
---
Hi! We're still working on both the Adrenaline issue and being unable to cripple SBQ, but we're currently planning to have fixes for them in Update 21.

It makes meat piles glow. I picked the pinkish one and they're easily visible even in the bog after a queen fight. These mods won't get you banned either, in case that was your next question.
---
Fkn awesome👏
---
&gt;Do not use set it to collect weapons, unless you want lots of pool cues.
---
Guys Night is on!
---
Pretty much a must have, with no drawbacks.
---
Put in a support ticket. They're apparently very good about refunding Atoms.
---
That happens a lot when i travel to other people's camps!
---
I lost the bet about it taking them a year to fix prime combat rifles using ultracite .44 ammo. It took them just short of a year to fix that one. But yeah, generally it's about as safe of an assumption as saying that water will continue to be wet in the next week
---
it's just so discouraging though. it's hard to keep grinding when you don't know if you'll even cut it by the end because of the issues. I even get anxious when i log on now because i don't know if my challenges will be there for me.
---
Good question...also why FFR over explosive?
---
Man i wish i ate enuf to have a triple chin bit ironic tho to call another person a nerd while being in the same subreddit as him dont you think or does the double standard only apply to others cause mommy told you, you were special :)
---
My point was saying there isnt really enough camp budget. And you kind of prove me right. Sorry mate but I wouldnt call buch of shacks cluttered around really a villiage. I like the first Chucktown tho. You managed to fit it to the terrain really well and it looks like real compound.
---
Im glad someone has warm Feelings towards These ugly Bastards. I cant stand the uhhh ohh ahsiendisoebwoqnsucicn Sounds when they die. I dont like them. Especially when you encounter a Group of them and 4 miniguns Start to shoot your Face at the same time.
---
You kinda can. You just gotta store and replace.
---
Ugh. Ok, let me break it down for you. If I leave a bowl of sweets on my porch for Halloween, and put a sign next to them saying ‘please only take one!’ do I then get angry at the person who takes them all, and shower their house with eggs, or do I say to myself ‘I guess I should’ve seen that coming. Maybe I should stick to the one to ones.’? 
---
If you provide the opportunity to be selfish, someone will inevitably take it. Understanding this mindset doesn’t make me into such a person anymore than a detective thinking like a criminal means they are one.
---
wait also why u scrolling this far down bruh wtf
---
Lol. PA is trash.
---
+karma 👍
---
Might just be the best gun they have on hand or the amount of different skins it has compared to the fixer.
---
Or maybe just personal preference.
---
Did u log out log back in? They might not have appeared on your account yet.
---
What the hell? I am just going to assume you are kidding here as that is ridiculous if they are seriously not doing the legs too.
---
I had this issue too. There was only so much main story added so I defaulted you this, only to get fetch quest after fetch quest, usually in the same neighborhood as a prior one, or kill x robot again because maybe it’ll help ( spoiler alert: it doesn’t ).
---
Eventually lost interest seeing how little that progress bar was moving with each one and haven’t completed it to this day.
---
Ive learned nothing works, its all rng and servers
---
One of my C.A.M.P.s had doubled walls; a regular one with windows and the garage door wall. I would simply flip a switch to kill power and shut all of the garage doors if I wanted to keep people out.
---
I only bought the standard version, was the Wastelanders dlc a free update? I didn't see it in the PlayStore and wasn't sure how invested I was going to get into the game... So I didn't end up buying the deluxe version of 76 that comes with Wastelanders.
---
Thank you for confirming by the way, man that sounds so cool! Do all of you guys normally play together?

Expl is 20% DPS but some enemies have strong resistance to explosive damage.
---
Not really , people are doing the exact same thing with the scrip machine instead 🤣🤣🤣
---
I noticed it is still greyed out for me. Idk why. I can see that they brought out new stuff in the atomic shop but yeah we still cant have the option to rank up with atoms yet. Maybe Bethesda forgot lol.
---
Ive done about 5 tadpole quests and everytime i try looking at the possum quests my brain slowly overloads but they seem to give cool rewards well worth the grind
---
Hi there! I've been playing Fallout 76 for about 7 months now, so I hope that my knowledge can be beneficial to you in the long run. 
---
1. The sleeping bonus is eventually just a bonus that you can get whenever you sleep for x amount of time in a bed (its not too long, probs around like 20-30 seconds). You can sleep in any bed to get this bonus, don't matter if its in your camp or some other place like Flatwoods
---
2. Unfortunately you cant claim another persons CAMP as your own, or share it. If your in a team with them, then you can build in their CAMP, same as with Workshops. Workshops are a different story tho, because any other player can come along and take it from you.
---
3. There's a rule that you cant have your CAMP radius (the green circle that appears while building in a camp) overlapping with another persons camp radius, same going for most locations
---
4. PVP in the game is kinda weird (but also kinda nice too), for both sides must attack one another before taking any damage. Say if some lvl 63 came up to you and started shooting you with a sub-machine gun, you wouldn't take any damage so long as you don't attack them back. Once you do attack back, however, its fair game (kill or be killed). Also if you were to become wanted, you would be open to attack against everyone in the server (this only happens if you go about stealing from others bases, or destroying them, yet another uncommon thing)
---
5. Although quests don't carry over, if your both in the same area of the quest and/or pick up the quest item, you would be able to do the quest at the same time. 
---
6. Quest items depend upon your level of Charisma. When completing a quest as a team, you have a better chance of getting more or better items (always had a low charisma for characters so I cant be exact...), but most quests give the same rewards every time so if you do them together you should be good items wise.
---
7. Every server is slightly different, but the main locations and quests are the same throughout. Also for your camp, when you place it down in one server and sign off, when you jump onto another server it will be in the exact spot in which you originally placed it. Basically you place it in one server and fallows you through servers
---
8. This is the part that makes me little annoyed with the games set up, yet also is kinda...nice. Basically, when you reach level 2, you are given a choice of perk cards in which you can choose to add to your character. But if you decide to wait until level 6 to get Thirst Quencher maxed out (a good perk in my opinion) with your stockpiled perk points, you wont be able to do so. You instead will be stuck with the cards from the level 2 selection, and as you pick your cards they will slowly be unlocked as you leveled up. Eventually, you shouldn't stockpile perk points to get the good cards, because your going to have to spend them on the lower level cards regardless to get to the higher level stuff.
---
As for the NPCs by the vault door, they were introduced in the Wastelander's update, before there was no one but a body containing a note, some pre-war money, and a machete
---
I hope that this helps you and your wife out with the game! If you have any other questions feel free to ask, there's a lot of people here who've been playing this game for years now and would probably be able to help you out as you progress through the game.
---
Have fun exploring Appalachia! :D
---
We're still actively working on a fix for the Adrenaline Perk, and we're currently aiming to include it in Update 21.
---
Are you seriously asking why people use a much more readily available weapon over one that you need a rare plan for plus lottery winning levels of luck to get a good one from the Purveyor?
---
The Queen shrugs off explosive damage so its pointless on her, it also make your weapon degrade 2x as fast
---
Unfortunately a lot of those “fresh meats” in that sweet crockpot are probably tasty human bits
---
It's my favourite gun. It has that perfect post-apocalyptic feel to it that works great with my raider queen character. Been trying to find an explosive one for months even on the black market but no one's willing to give them up, apparently.
---
I hear the handmade is a lot easier to keep on target outside of vats
---
FFR is +25% more damage without needing perk cards, and explosive breaks guns faster.
---

I do hope you managed to get the 200mm lens from him first, though. Other than that, I salute you, good sir. I still have plenty of bullion items to go.
---
Hey read my other post lmao idm getting downvoted or banned from subreddit as long as things get fixed
---
Jet was around before the Great War
---
I find this oversight hilarious. 
---
Dang it people I mean the oversight of Jet not being in the game when it totally could be. The collectron even wants some lol.
---
Handmade has less recoil, for those of us who like to aim. the fixer is pretty clunky outside of vats imo.
---
no i got it. the whole post is "i want xp but i cant get maximum xp unless your in my party. so support me and my needs." and i said. i dont care about his needs.
---
Yup same thing for me and one has the +33 to vats.  I try boosting my perception up and it seems to help but not always
---
There was a rustic icebox available in the contemporary camp bundle. Been using that in my bar.
---
I think I found you
---
Where is the rolling door located (can’t find under doors)
---
But then you lose settler rep, and to my knowledge, it’s the only way you can lose rep after completing the main quests.
---
Ssshhhhhh...  dont spoil my fun.  I like to break in and leave a few empty beer bottles cream and a raw rubber on people's beds 😳
---
I'm so happy someone else finally mentions this
---
Looks like he was trying to be nice(-ish) about it at least, by guarding your loot until you return.  Sadly, there isn't an emote for "Hey, would you like me to remove your Wanted status by killing you?"  Sorry you got ambushed, anyway.  Be sure and avoid picking locks at peoples' camps.  Usually those say "Steal From XXX" (for locked resources) and/or a red text prompt to warn you (if it's a door), but it's kind of hit or miss.
---
I wish they'd remove the option for the supply drops to be locked.  That's the result of using a "US government supply requisition" holotape in a radio tower.  (You get instructions and a quest when you find one of those tapes.)  Those are locked for everyone but the person that summoned it.  
---
But sometimes the drops also just appear as random events, unlocked.  So sometimes they're locked, sometimes they're not.  It's confusing.  And given that low level new characters are pretty much the only ones that bother with that quest (the supplies aren't worth much at higher levels), there's really no point in complicating things.
---
That makes sense
---
Also in ur opinion which is more gamebreaking? Duping or no perks, fast travel or respawn?
---
No XD
---
Daguerre is bugged for me. I got the flight recorder, but then I try to take it back to her, she just repeatedly tells me her back hurts and won't f***ing snap out of it. I cant even minigun her in frustration.
---
We should not talk about that feature.
---
Hi all, 
---
We apologize, but we’re delaying Legendary Run rank-up Atom purchases for the moment. Stay tuned for more information in the coming days.
---
as a new player i wouldn't mind a big q&amp;a stickyed at the top, it would make a lot of sense right now too with the introduction to gamepass and a large amount of people coming or coming back to play.
---
It was "retconned" in Fallout 3 or 4, and tbh Fallout 2 was inconsistent on its origins too.
---
I can make more bullets at a time with a handmade than a fixer. I use both, but yeah I like the feel of the handmade for my day to day runs and if I need the extra sneak, a Fixer works. Handmade are also pretty easy to come by (minus the recent dupe) compared to a Fixer too. I seem to have almost no recoil with my handmade  and my Fixers have just enough kickback that the handmade wins over for me.
---
(I like the pewpewpew of a handmade better too.)
---
Also what about the other perks as there were a handful of them like serendipity, lonecwandere, action boy, fireproof etc?
---
^ This. Recoil is noticeably better outside VATS. If you have a bloody variant of both, the dmg diff is negligible when you 1-shot pretty much everything
---
Nah been playing since beta just being very optimistic is all lol.
---
Any chance you guys plan to fix team PvP too?
---
yeah the explosive ones are pretty fun but you take more rads from the explosions too! With recent occurrences you might find an explosive one for a decent price at least.
---
Definitely start as soon as you can. It takes a long time to grind, especially for the settlers (hint - Ward accepts the photos).
---
As this is all digital, I'm surprised that every created item in the game that persists as player inventory doesn't have a Unique identifier number, then just check for huge unreasonable groups of consecutive numbers for popular dupes attached to player accounts and nuke them.
---
Yeah, it's apparently the only daily I've never completed once. If I could just get those damn atoms, I'll never do this quest again. It's been sitting at "Go talk to Chloe" for about a week now, and every time I try, it doesn't respond.
---
Might have been mine. It was deleted (or I can’t find it anywhere) and had 500+ upvotes and over 200 comments on it
---
Finally an upvoted post about PvP, love to see it

 &gt;We apologize, but we’re delaying Legendary Run rank-up Atom purchases for the moment. Stay tuned for more information in the coming days.
---
Hi, 
---
We apologize, but we're holding off on rank up purchases for now and should have more info for you in the coming days!
---
Handmade looks cooler.
---
When will we get it? Problably never
---
As a stealth low-health commando, I use primarily my junkies explosive handmade, but I do sometimes use my executioners fixer. The reason is simply that I have better legendary modifiers on the handmade meaning that the Fixer I have cannot match my handmade's damage output. It is much easier to get a legendary handmade than a Fixer (assuming you don't run in duper circles, which I don't).
---
guys you got it wrong hes using acronyms he wants a Junkies Explosive Tesla  , dude heard bout the duping
---
i have class now I can play later
---
More importantly does it make you want to tear your ears off like the faschnacht one?
---
Ya try reloading app
---
my buddy lost a total of 6750? i think. hes pissed
---
Third person.
---
Be aware there are certain eccentricities you need to get used to in third person, especially for melee.
---
The camera is higher and to the right from where it would be in first person, which is expected, but the thing is that the game still aims melee attacks using the first person perspective, meaning you will always be aiming low and to the left of where your actual attacks are going, meaning attacking small enemies requires you to aim way higher and to the right than you would be expecting, essentially aim with the neck of your character on screen rather than with the actual crosshair. You will however have a much easier time hitting opponents legs, as aiming at their center of mass will generally hit there right leg. 
---
Guns get all kinds of weird, because in first person the bullets come out of your face and always go where you are aiming them, in third person they come out of wherever the gun barrel is visually, meaning low slung weapons will shoot the ground when trying to peak over ledges, and then try to zigzag/curve up to mean the crosshair, and especially at close range with weapons far from the crosshair will spray out in random directions and make hitting small enemies extraordinarily hard.
---
Third person makes radroaches harder to kill than they have any right to be

 &gt; Hi, 
---
 &gt;We apologize, but we're holding off on rank up purchases for now and should have more info for you in the coming days!
---
One could hope. I'm almost willing to trade my vampire fixer... Almost.
---
Yes.don't buy the others
---
I can never get them to hang on the outside of my door. They seem to stick to the edge of a floor piece on the inside, of that makes sense. Like, I can have them floating and not in a doorway. But I’ve never been able to get them on the outside of my doorway.
---
Yes, but technically they snap to windows.  So, you'd have to snap them to a wall with windows first then replace that wall with a doorway.
---
it's also known that this isn't the only thing that causes this to happen.
---
FINALLY
---
I don’t know, but do we know much it’s going to be?
---
He was collecting ammo and weapons for me. Weapons he collected was a pistol and board, ammo was a few .44 .308 and .50 but i wasnt on long enough to see what else he collected.
---
Put a window up then curtain then replace the window with a door
---
Oh thanks for the reply and no problem I understand
---
Well done.
---
150 atoms per SCORE level/rank
---
Yes, it is possible. I walked through a player camp the other day who had this exact setup. It took a few attempts to get through each door but it can be done!
---
Something something Myron just found the recipe to a chem that had been all but forgotten in California by Fallout 2 and then passed it off as his own invention. Or something like that. Being fair that \*is\* something Myron would pull. It's now a pre-war drug, as of Fallout 4, so was retconned before 76. 
---
It's also worth noting that Myron's Jet is significantly more addictive and powerful than pre-war Jet. It's an instant (I think) and permanent addiction in Fallout 2. You have to seek out a 'cure' even.
---
Can I have more information on whether or not Bethesda intends to give the PvP players, team PvP options?
---
I dont think so it was very fresh with no post or anything,  I read it and it was gone
---
I am not kidding.
---
Randomness would make the game a little more fun!
---
Pretty sure it was announced as July 15th. Which is tomorrow.
---
Very solid answer Cable. Than you.
---
The dupers made it worthless by choosing to go against the terms of service and abuse a glitch. The fact that the glitch exists does not make it fine to exploit. It is cheating.
---
Yes, Bethesda shares the blame. But if people weren't greedy and reported this stuff instead of abusing it, they could have the time to fix it before it becomes an issue like this.
---
That's it. Fixer kicks like a mule,handmade is a laser.
---
Also skins. I'll never buy or scrip the handmade by mistake.
---
I managed a hotel at night and the hospitality industry pretty much melted down so I been unemployed since March. Lucky me I saved my checks because I wanted to quit and do another job.
---
Discord Rapidpalsy#4880 There’s a couple of us.
---
Ammo is another reason. 5.56 is more common. The price is generally the same though.
---
If you could send in a bug report ticket like I did, so Bethesda probably knows this isn't just a isolated issue,
---
we still would because it isn't the only way it happens.
---
Doesn’t it tell you when you click on the map?
---
You can't because bethaesda fucked that up to they can't manage shit sorry for the language im pissed
---
The Enclave were a thing before the War and included people like the President.
---
Zetan is atom shop the colossus is from the colossal problem event. You can also get a giant sheepsquatch plushie in the battlepass.
---
Zetan was an atom shop purchase.  Wendigo not sure, I’m assuming it’s a drop off the the colossus himself.  
---
Most of them are atom shop items
---
Wondering if you realize you have to build it.
---
Ah OK thanks
---
what platform are you on?
---
These grinds aren't fun for most players to be honest
---
Ok I’m sure I’ll be on later
---
I would definitely wait and save the atoms for the later levels!
---
As someone quite cynically though quite possibly correctly postulated on another thread about this earlier, it's probably a case of "double dipping" for atoms with the new items in the store today, so people can make impulse buys and then want to buy ranks later too.
---
If I had to guess I'd say it will probably arrive this weekend now instead, but who knows.
---
I don't think so...it just says "Legendary Bundle" I think. Unless I did it wrong...
---
Thanks Beefy. Everyone I know said the 14th but maybe they had to delay adding a button to skip the grind. Sure is hard adding a button!
---
Ahhh yeah mine was from yesterday.
---
PS4, so hacks and dupes are a bit harder to come by for me haha
---
You don't
---
It's not available right now 
---
They are looking into, guess its bugged currently
---
Its cause they dont wanna come off as more cheap than they already are. With the point system being broken, releasing a buy option would be extremely bad for pr and their pr to begin with is trash
---
Check back later. There will be 100's of posts about it.
---
Glad I wasted $150 on something that they can't even acknowledge.
---
And why did he come to the same subreddit to complain, if he doesn't check it for reminder? People posting remind like 1h prio. I never had that shut personally, just not playing during reset time and that's all. Cmon,  asking for downvotes. People either adapt to circumstances before bethesda fix their shit (lol never) or continue to complain, staying online during reset time
---
A-greed!!
---
Were you on during the reset or close? What was the last thing you did and the first thing did?  It has not hit me yet but I am just waiting...
---
The daily is “Complete a Daily Quest” are you saying you’ve done 6 quests and it’s not completing or are you talking about the Daily Challenges?
---
Don’t know if it helps any but mine just popped after Cop a Squatter.
---
Your harsh language is justified. I too am angry that I cannot give Todd my money &gt;:(
---
Why would you think asking it more in a sort period of time would get you the answer you're looking for?
---
You spent $150 on atoms??
---
Other players are the only real challenge in endgame right now. Basic tips - Max your HP, choose damage mitigation cards (serendipity/dodgy) over damage resistance and always output as much damage as you can with whatever weapon type you choose cuz some 110s hit harder than others. ❤
---
What do you mean can't buy rewards?
---
Its the whitespring golf course grass texture
---
They haven't enabled the ability to rank up via atoms yet
---
Actually, it's that power armor has flat 7% damage reduction on all of it's pieces, meaning with a full set you take 42% less damage from everything. Gutsies ignore armor, but not flat% damage reduction.
---
PA also has 15% (x6 = 90%)  radiation mitigation.
---
The invisible enchantments on pa are what makes it's visible stats redundant.
---
I can afford it, it's just a waste of time. A timer would work, like the ones on daily and weekly challenges. Was that not clear, or was it too hard to read? RIF!
---
You’re gonna be clean when you touch my stuff, like it or not 😠
---
oh im going to burn through that.  Ill use all my lunch boxes and boosts that day and just hit every event i can.
---
No need to get testy. I just assumed most players wanted to maximize their xp in order to maximize their odds of getting all the way through the score board. If you don't care about that then feel free to ignore what I've said.
---
Wrong sub
---
Yeah to be ripped off by Bethesda as usual. By the time they enable the feature, everyone will have them naturally in game grind. Thanks Bethesda. =D Now time to learn how to charge back.
---
I agree with everything said here except the part about just taking whatever perk you like. You will not be able to have a fully fleshed out build by level 50, but the earlier you decide on what type of build you want, the better because it will cost many levels later to fix mistakes made early on. You do not have to pick perk cards from the SPECIAL category you upgrade. Put your points where you want them and explore the cards available.
---
As for PVP, you have to agree to engage to start it, but it is very easy to accidentally shoot someone in a public event and have them turn around and blast you. You will only lose whatever junk you are carrying, not weapons and armor. Pacifist prevents this from happening and is highly recommended if you do not wish to PVP. Workshops are PVP areas and even with pacifist on, if you claim a workshop, someone can come and take it by force. This is not very likely at the workshops in low level areas, but it can happen, so if you claim a workshop, don't hang around it unless you are prepared to defend it.
---
I was making the same mistake last week.
---
Absolutely. We can make do with containers right now, but there’s no way to transfer the untraceable stuff which sucks.
---
I   
---
mean  
---
I  
---
cannot  
---
buy  
---
rewards  
---
?
---
Yeah, we play together all the time. It's pretty awesome!
---
The Wastelanders Deluxe version is (was?) a bundled version that came with the game and the Settlers &amp; Raiders content bundles. They sell each of those content bundles on the PSN store for like twenty bucks each. I got the deluxe version of the game on sale for like thirty-five, a couple of months ago.
---
That's 2 months of not buying anything 
---
Not that preposterous
---
Doesn't seem like it. Seems to be another massive scam by Bethesda. Oh well. Charge-back it is!
---
Have you not ranked up at all? Surely you didn’t need all $150 in atoms or?
---
I've never seen it for sale anywhere.  On very rare occasions I've seen player vendors sell the materials.
---
I'm sure it can. I use mine as a shower curtain, and I didn't even have a wall for it to snap to.
---
It's under walls.
---
Use a speaker
---
See I'd have to disagree. Little enclaves like this seem far more likely to spring up in a wasteland than much of what I see when I'm out and about.
---
That said, instanced camps are coming eventually which should alleviate the budget issues for most people.
---
Wish I could do the same haha. I work weekends and when I get off work it's straight to hanging out with the kid haha. I'll be lucky to smash my dailys out. I miss being able to grind lol
---
How is this the wrong sub for that question?
---
I don't even know where to put it, nor do I have the budget but yah insta-buy
---
Console? pc?
---
If you look up "fallout 76 wallpaper both sides" you can find a video on a very easy method of getting wallpaper on both sides of a wall, just so you know.
---
The answer I'm looking for doesn't exist. Bethesda just milked the entire whale playerbase and lied to us. I'd like to not waste $150 to skip the rewards faster than anyone else. Only to be told last minute, No, hehe, we've delayed them.   
---
Okay. Tell us that a fucking week ago. Scam artists. Get the money then Legendary Run away.
---
(Junkies build now turbo charged)
---
Can we have PvP daily challenges? 
---
Or maybe a community manager that acknowledges their endgame has zero challenge and that PvP is a big part of the game for many daily players? 
---
Anything at all besides more nerfs? Like, it would be nice if my team could help when I get jumped 1v4. Instead those four just won't hit my team and that's pretty ridiculous, tbh.
---
I've seen higher level players call them in and wait for newer players to pick them so they can kill them easily. When I'm near flatwoods and see the red smoke I'll have a look around and can find them cloaked on the roof of one of the buildings. They usually leave when I keep shooting at them while blowing their cover.
---
Lol people bomb my ass all the time because my base is set up right next to a lead collector near white springs
---
With what, 9 weeks left in the season too?  Money to burn I guess
---
I tried to melt her with my fixer ffr 25% vats discount but so far I can hit like 500 to 600 damage a shot if done right. It still takes time though.
---
Give
---
it
---
time
---
They said July 14th but they haven’t started it yet.
---
I played this morning but not near reset I think.
---
Another week without the leaked Enclave stuff. One day...
---
That was such an abusive relationship. I promised to help, screwed him over, and did it again the next day. He was always so eager anyway.
---
I don't know what it is lately I have come across some right dick gamer moves. Tonight me lvl 70 something at the Fort Defiance. I am standing in the door. The wendigo is breathing its nasty ass wheeze. I hear a thump, elevator ting and silence. This lvl 100 plus storms past me express to the 'loot room' takes the loot and fks the right off. Tonight was the first time I had actually been in there when it was unlooted. Second thing tonight a lvl 400 screams past me, pegs the behemoth to register as a kill when I kill it and takes off. All so they can slack kill as part of the weekly challenge. I honestly don't know what it is and why it is so damn hard to use some manners.
---
Thank you I will take a look, I found one option but it required putting two walls down eating up more building quota. perahps there is a better way.
---
Found a video seems to be an some kind of stacking thing. I will have to check that out :)
---
Yes, I would like to use the speakers attached to my sound system for the TV. Good call.
---
I would love to buy some if anyone sells it.   
---
That makes it a trade post and trade posts are not allowed.
---
It was the point. If it can be listed for that, why not? You mean to tell me it's MY fault that Bethesda changed their mind on something they have been advertising for how long now? Last minute? AFTER everyone purchased the atoms to do it?
---
Yeah. I wonder who's the piece of shit in this situation. Definitely not those that are gonna be mass charging back in the next day.  
---
Fraudulent 76
---
That tends to be how they drop, you get one you get em all. Unfortunately they were all dupe able so arnt as valued as they once were. But still great pieces to have!
---
Your credit issuer is too generous if they allow you a chargeback for this, HerzoginChloe.  You paid for the atoms, which you received.
---
Ps4? Dm me, I may have your answers.
---
shhhh thats a glitch but one of the good ones. It is essentially as close to winning the lottery as possible  in the game. Congrats bro :). Dont get scammed outta them and dont scrap, you can literally use those items to get anything in the game.
---
I've heard, haven't had it happen for me yet, that when you do get that rare drop it's always everything like that.
---
Best place to ask is in the other fallout sub where trades happen. Someone will likely browse there who specializes or something. I've literally only ever seen one person selling flux organically in like 500 hours (I bought the lot) for 199 each.
---
Just take my atoms!
---
Player vendors or the trading subs
---
And they say funny stuff.
---
Damn, in not getting the deluxe version for an extra $20... I think that means that I'll end up paying $40 later down the line instead, just have access to both the settler and raider bundles. Since, I did see those for sale separately in the store.
---
Thank you all, im guessing its gonna be a interesting thing to try. Just getting tired of rads
---
Yeah I'm thinking it might be a licensing issue. But they could add songs from previous fallout games.
---
Shell shock is horrendous if you're a vats build. I somehow always manage to get it when I've no disease cures.
---
Rule #10 on the sub, no trading posts.
---
Valseek commented on my post apparently they’re holding off on buyable ranks for a few days
---
Yeah, but it would be convenient to have a timer, or at least make fast travel free to Crater and Foundation. 
---
I need to see the big out.
---
Interesting! Thank you for the info.
---
Rule 10 is quite clear on the topic...
---
they explicitly stated that you can't buy items with atom until two weeks after the season goes live. The legendary run went live on June 30th. so at the very earliest you'd be able to purchase items today (at some point depending on when it is enabled).
---
This is definitely something I got used to in games like *Grand Theft Auto* which are sorely lacking here. Especially if you're playing with friends on a team and you're trying to find where they are on the map. It would save so much time being able to jump to where they are from a legend, rather than scrolling around trying to spot them.
---
Not even the TV speakers?
---
That's super easy if you have a separate sound system
---
I think i found some broken stuff. Toxic waste from west tek doesn't work. Used several times to manage my rads and it just doesn't give any rads
---
yea, yeah, well, its the internet if you dont use extreme examples that demonstrate the obvious, its hard for some people to read between the lines. ill pick something less extreme next time.
---
that damn secret door got us all horny for atoms
---
There is another way to dupe, it involves the scrip machine or something like that lol
---
Every time you wear one of them, someone else’s daily challenges will autocomplete. Balance must be maintained.
---
We're still working on the fix for Adrenaline, but currently aiming to release it in Update 21!
---
Why did you spend the money on a service that wasn't available yet lol
---
Like yea Bethesda is at fault but have a shred of fiscal responsibility dude
---
clown
---
shoes
---
Thanks. Message sent.
---
Oh yeah that's a very old bug
---
Why would you do that when there's still 8 weeks left to rank up for free? If you're just trying to be first you're already way late to the game. People have been exploiting bobbleheads and clearing the board since like day 2.
---
while i love this idea, problem is they'd have no way of making the packages weight change with the items in it, so it would be rife with exploits
---
Thanks, I wish more people would jump on the wagon but Im hoping they'll come when they run out of other stuff to complain about :)

---
I didn’t even turn the game on until 12:30
---
You’re not wrong about that
---
Those bastards!
---
Ay in between your insults you admit Bethesda is in the wrong. That's all that matters. :)
---
What you were doing was the right way, but the launcher needs the free space. And the launcher is the only way to get future updates. So you have to either copy fo76 on another driver and have the launcher reinstall there, or go through the complete download and install on your SSD.
---
Make sure to log each character out in clear/open locations. It helps to have each character in the same location before you start moving things. I had one instance where I logged back in glitched into a wall, then was disconnected. When I finally got back into my private world, the stuff I left was gone. One other time I got a server error and lost things. Luckily nothing I couldn't get back again, but still quite a panicked feeling. I just transferred a god roll BE handmade to my commando character and it was the most intense/anxious moment hoping it would be there when I logged back in. It was.
---
Could be tied to NW winter. I havent played it in the last week or so and never lost score.
---
I'm curious to see if anyone else who hasn't touched NW has lost score.
---
Damn dude my brain auto corrected it into challange lol, thanks for the tip. It was a daily quest :D
---
Not trading. Just inquiring.
---
Ps4
---
Can it still be used with switches? Because I like my overcomplicated entrances :(
---
that is one workaround for this one way that it happens. it is not the only way that it happens.
---
My last Score yesterday was the NW deploy camp...I did log back into Adventure before shutting down though.
---
I will let you know if I lost any once I get home from work.
---
On a side note yesterday was the first time I did not complete everything...that dang gain a level in adventure EVERY day is a pain. Even when creating a new character.
---
I don't mind crossplay between the consoles but i definitely wouldn't want it with PC due to m&amp;k, increased fps and hackers/modders etc.
---
Dang that's some revolutionary news. Yes I know people exploit. It's the point in getting it first, legitimately. Why would you be questioning me, and not Bethesda for ripping, me, off?
---
This revenge is pure awesome (I love your FO4 /Skyrim V mods too).
---
Certified bagel seems pretty legit.
---
i am level 17, i don't have any real clear goals aside from leveling to do the story stuff, be cool to have an in game friend to do public events and vault raids
---
on pc its very easy to just rest your thumb on the spacebar while in vats. i personally would probably never use an “auto crit” item.
---
Sadly yeah. I was surprised to come back after a 2 month break and see that the fast travel bug is still here.
---
Mine got stupidly autocompleted while I was at my CAMP before I could actually do it myself, because I was on a public team and someone else completed theirs. I'd like to be able to play it, even if it's someone else's run, since I missed out.
---
I once found a suitcase in a dumpster full of legendary weapons
---
I think you buy it from the atom shop.
---
If you have Speed Demon u get 0 benefit from the movespeed
---
Using unyielding armor with over 30 agi not much benefit from stealth + if not using vats fixer has insane recoil
---
Did you earn any SCORE in Adventure when you went back in? Even the Repeatable will work.
---
I believe they said on the 15th which isn’t today. And no one is saying anything is anyone’s fault. I was simply asking if you have been going through doing challenges you to this point? Bethesda never said “If you want to buy the whole season you’re going to have to pay $150!”  They just said they’re letting people bypass a rank for 150 atoms. Not really expecting people to bypass the whole thing. And I doubt anyone else has pre purchased $150 worth of atoms, you’re probably alone on that if you even did it. If it was just to prove a point... ok... cool story.
---
I'm not insulting you at all dude, just worried about my fellow man
---
It can’t be as it says find the plans to unlock this it’s in the same row as the fancy bed the 3rd one
---
My frames still turn to dog shit at harpers ferry. :(
---
I still do Retirement Plan when it comes up, because I think it's hilarious when you examine the corpse and it says "Former Raider." 
---
Yeah...you're a former raider alright.
---
Found one on a vendor for 6k on Xbox last week. First one I had ever seen on a vendor.
---
Wanna know how you can tell OP is on PC?  People can use game chat.
---
Awesome story.
---
Wow thank you
---
Dark matter power armor and jetpack, planetarium, jangles stein, captain cosmos gameboard and 500 atoms
---
Right? They wanna marinate that stuff for At least 48 hours
---
Level 190 here. I'd be happy to help, donate. Or build for you!!
---
Account : Sergeant-Cabbage
---
I'll be available in 2 hours after work.
---
I've played the whole game solo, but getting thru the silo with all the assultrons solo is a bit tough lol
---
Was it an npc or player vendor?
---
Well you're wrong Henry. You can believe the 15th all you want but they indeed said the 14th. So, keep trying but it ain't gonna fly buddy. 
---
They gave us the option to spend it. Why are you so bent over from the fact that I did it? Are you mad you can't afford to do that? Why make a paragraph rant about the fact that I bought fucking Atoms?
---
Some folks are going to be unhappy to hear me say this, but I will anyway: We know that VATS currently has multiple issues, and we're looking into them. 
---
The issues affecting VATS are complicated to address and they're taking some time to get fixed. I know that's not ideal, but it's where we're currently at with these bugs. Please know that we are investigating, and if hear an update on the status I will let you know.
---
Thanks, didn't know that, did it will turn normal?
---
Some have already completed it legitimately.
---
well it still affects people even if they logged out so
---
Whitespring Mall. Dont let the Vault Tec pattern fool you the Plan is called Simple Modern Bed.
---
Not sure the , sorry, it's just most of the branded items are only from the shop, like the unstoppable bed.

You will not find any sort of legendary dragon as a drop. They are legacy
---
Is Action Boy/Girl still busted?
---
gotta love it
---
I didn't even notice it saying they were silent, but now I'm disappointed, silent turrets sound cool
---
Then again I got the red ones already and I don't even use em since they're more like enemy generators moreso than defences
---
Oh so that’s what that plan is I already had that and never learned it Thanks !!
---
Sounds peaceful
---
Yes, they originally said the 14th.
---
Do you still have the atoms?
---
Of course you do.
---
You’ll still have them when the legendary run levels become available for sale.
---
No need to get pissy with me. It's not like the money is gone, you're just going to have to wait a bit to spend it. You're getting downvoted because you act like they stole the money from you. Get a fuckin grip, you'll have the "honor" of being one of the first to rock the new PA and shit soon enough.
---
I was sneaking around some and heard one say 'I really like this song' lol. I've heard them talking about floaters too. Personal fav was one was say that he was bored and another started telling him to shut up and stop moaning. I also didn't realise until adopting a stealthy apporoach that they do stuff like sit around. It seems weird to see them being kinda normal.
---
Ok so I’ve finished the vault I didn’t realise one quest lead on to the next but I went with it broke just about everything won a whole load of stuff I don’t want but the thing that caught my eye was the secret service armour is that worth having?
---
Be really careful there, you got what you paid for. No matter what YOU intended to use the atoms for.
---
So you doing a charge back can net you a suit for wire-fraud, across contry-lines, which would make this a federal thing and that beast means jail time.
---
But then again, you are not the first to charge back w/o Beth actually pressing charges, but you'll also not be the first to get their services permanently denied...
---
been getting this bug for a while, really annoying. very clear connections are being made, the sound is made, the damage is displayed, but the health doesn't move. melee build.
---
Are you just wanting a set or are you wanting the actual plans? Because if you just want a set, assuming I have the materials, I can build you one when I get home.
---
2000?
---
Those are baby numbers 
---
I'm up around 15-16,000 now
---
it’s the standard “we pushed the developers to release a game too quickly and it didn’t do well”.  It likely has a skeleton crew right now on the game who probably are working some shitty hours as it is, and the only way to keep their jobs is to maintain certain money metrics of income.
---
No company would move money from other projects to revitalize a failed project unless they thought they’d get a good return on investment.  At this point I wouldn’t even blame the devs. They probably know they are releasing with bugs, but don’t have the budget to pay for for additional resources to fix them.
---
No. It was around midnight I had just got done doing some work on my computer so I jumped on a for a little bit to knock everything out since I had not got a chance to yesterday.  I did all the Dailies in Adventure except level up and my complete dailies was a 4/5.  So I jumped in to NW to do the deploy a camp. It completed the deploy a camp and the 5/5 of challenge no issues no lost score.  Then I went back to Adventure to see if Radiation Rumble was going on as that gives a shit ton of exp. It was not so I  logged off and shut my system down.
---
That's what I figured. The one and only time I lost challenges was when I did the NW challenge last, then shut the game off when I finished it.
---
If thats the case why was it removed, also what makes a weapon legacy
---
Is it effective?
---
Yep, it does! Enjoy the extra rewards until Update 21!
---
The no build zone around your camp has about a 100m radius. For reference.
---
I lost some on the first reset and hadn't played NW at all.  I was logged in during the reset and had 4 of my dailies completed.  I log out every day now about an hour prior and haven't had an issue since.  I don't believe I've ever been in the spot where NW was the last thing I did, though.
---
I use this to grow crops on, I use the settler dirt plot floors, the after planting, change it with store/replace!
---
Yea experiencing that , and ain't that the damn truth
---
Do you get to select the ammo type?
---
Encryptid has been mad weird for me too. Ran a few of them with the same group and the tankieness of it was vastly differnt both times. Same guns same build first one took 4 lvl 300+ bloodied builds over 10 minutes whereas the second one didnt even take 30 seconds, same factors to my knowledge. But to what u sayin, thise eyebots are the bain of any bloodied build. Like 50 of them and it only takes one non serendipity explosion to die reee
---
Starting to think HerzoginChoe shouldnt be allowed near a credit card.
---
dudes probably invested in many nigerian prince schemes.
---
Just curious, I play on PS4 so I don’t know how exactly Xbox does it.  
---
When you log out on Xbox, is there still stuff running in the background?  Does logging out basically equate to “sleep mode” where it might still be logged into the game even though the console is “off”?
---
What build?
---
No, but it seems to give a decent variety of popular ammo.
---
Whew, glad I held off on buying. I very nearly bought a 4000 Atom bundle, and glad I didn't, because that implies they have changed the plans due to people losing Score. I did wonder if they might and that's why I held off. 
---
I was going to buy the bundle, see how far I got in double-xp, and then buy my way to the end and use the remaining Atoms as savings for next Season. I wonder if they are going to just offer double/triple rewards and not bother selling them this time.
---
Also, can a mod please clarify why posts asking about this are being deleted?
---
Just read in another post that theres no fix till patch 21
---
\*surprised pikachu\* I'll cut you, that's my favourite
---
I guess the rest can go into the ammo converter!
---
They did not say why, but I believe because the explosive effect did full damage per pellet as it use to on energy weapons. When the purveyor was introduced they were taken out of the normal loot pool and where only obtainable from the 3* chest at the end of dead in the water. With the introduction of wastelanders and the removal of the raids they became truly legacy
---
A legacy weapon is one that no longer drops in game
---
Not at all.
---
I solo the event all the time - did 5 just earlier today.
---
It's about your equipment (TS Armor, Vampire high ROF weapon &amp; food buffs for Endurance &amp; resistance)
---
You just need to get the right group of people together, if you don't have someone who can do it themselves.
---
hopefully its because they realize how completely fucked it would be to start charging for levels when people have been getting fucked out of thousands of SCORE in both dailies and weeklies with the auto complete bug. an extra 2 dailies for a week isn't going to cut it with all of these losses.
---
Then I pray the release on game pass helps the concurrent player lists and maybe they invest a bit more. Everyone I play with(dozens of regs) would pay real world money for good reasonably priced items in the Atom shop. No reason every weapon in this game doesn't have at least 5 skins to buy per weapon. Weapon skins 500, apparel 700 and power armor skins 1000. Sales weekly.
---
Are the greenhouse domes back in the game yet?
---
Ahhh, so does that mean anyone selling them either grinded for them before they became legacy or duped them?
---
As ive been after one of this for ages
---
I completed Sofia's questline a day after starting the first part of her story. I didn't do anything else until I finished it. Kind of did the same thing with Beckett. I liked both questlines and would love it if the other allies got their own stories like they did.
---
Ah, okay that makes sense. I'll have to get a larger drive. Thanks!
---
All feel free to add KnoxVegasVol, I play most evenings est.
---
Working into a stealth commando, but I'm not picky about any mods on it if I can get it; I've got the prime auto receiver learned already, so I can make it work as long as it's got a good primary effect too.
---
God you are a total dick. Have you not read the forums. I was in bed asleep. The computer was off. It was an hour before reset so I was in the clear. Nope lost most of my daily challenges for that day due to this bug. Have you actually read others commenting about this? Cause it doesn't seem to matter if you are logged in or not.
---
Huh. Garage, indeed.
---
Right?  Or just something campi or goofy
---
I'd also like a fart gun/ grenade of some sort
---
A craftable item that would deal minimal dmg/rad to human npc enimies, but would trigger the vomit emote and render them incapacitated for maybe 5 seconds.  How fun would it be to see a whole camp of blood eagles vomiting uncontrollably 
---
Maybe add a "putrid" mod to the gamma gun that goves it said effect. The aesthetics of the weapon already fit what i imagine.
---
I'll try that. Thanks.
---
That message usualy pops up when there is a second floor but no ladder attached to it. I would guess that the blueprint does miss some Parts of your Camp as their Budget is limited and way smaller than the normal Budget. Happened to me some Times too, now i just rebuild from scratch everytime i move.
---
Maybe some other dude has Better thoughts on this.
---
No reason. The guy who set up the purveyor forgot to put dragon, cult blade and ripper on the list. Next guy who fixed the legendary drops copy/pasted that list.
---
Gg they don't care
---
LoL because you’ve got your feathers ruffled and it’s comical. I don’t care that you bought $150 in atoms. That’s hilarious actually. I can most definitely afford it, but it can be earned in game, so I’d rather just play the game and earn them that way. But honestly, to each their own. But saying you’ve paid that just to make a complaint post.... multiple complaint posts... that’s dumb. But you do you chloe
---
An interesting but obviously abusable addition for this is to write custom notes for the Insult bot
---
I am the first one to start shit talking about these issues, check my history but bro direct your ire toward Bethesda austin/corp not these dudes. They are working with very tightly controlled information and are literally not allowed to respond so being an annoying cunt toward them or being rude doesn't help anyone.
---
people are still losing thousands of SCORE. two more dailies for a week (3500 SCORE) doesn't fix that. what are you guys going to do to compensate those affected? it isn't right that people are going to have to grind harder than others due to problems with the game.
---
Also, what about Smiley? I haven't been to the wayward since last Sunday. Went yesterday and was unable to get gold. Why are you guys ignoring this?
---
I got the game a few weeks ago.  I’m cruising through levels but I do have some questions.  I think I’m level 28 or 29 now.   What weapon should I be using.  I’ve honestly used a shotgun only to this point.  What level do I need to worry about power armor or armor in general. I just wear what I find.
---
I think the gauss rifle is the same level as what I got when I handed the Bobby pins to the scavenger.
---
Feel your pain, stay safe. I hope my employer, (University) opens for the fall semester.
---
Also, try going into vats first and then charge the weapon that can help as well
---
How are you even that far?
---
Yes, but you’ll have to buy them progressively, starting with the protective I think
---
Edit: Looks like I’m wrong about that, you can buy it outright apparently.  Apologies for misinformation, other shielded linings are that way and I forgot.
---
You guys don’t have to keep downvoting me, it was a simple mistake which I acknowledged, apologized for, and edited.  🙄
---
Yep, I reported it too. Any frame mod other than standard/prime overrides the sights and sets them back to default.
---
I wanted to buy ranks
---
I think you're about to get 500+ steel. Also that you take nice pictures.
---
Yes. Likely is called Secret Service Underarmor Shielded Lining.
---
Yep! The rates are pretty bad, but with how much ammo you can get nowadays it's workable, especially if you don't need more than a couple types. Just wish you could convert for Ultracite rounds, even if the numbers are single digit for balance.
---
Not being able to rush ahead after only two weeks into a ten week event is the most on-brand FO76 players could possibly be.
---
I agree with that, but I'll be a little pissed if I've spent the last few weeks grinding like a mad man to get to Rank 47 and then they just auto-complete the Season/give everyone all the rewards with intent to start fresh with Season 2. I can't really think of anything else they could do to make it up to those people though as they probably have no way of tracking it, or the staff to, on an individual basis.
---
Damn that totally sucks. I wasn't even on when it turned over the other day and I lost all but 500 score on my dailies. I did get the standard ticket response of 'we are aware of the problem' bs. I don't mind the grind. I hate being dicked over
---
No you dont. You can straight up buy the Shielded. You dont even have to buy the lower levels.
---
Ah, I see.
---
No, you don't - you can just buy the shielded alone. (I did)
---
No, you can just buy the Shielded straight away.
---
Oh I'm sitting pretty money wise. I have like a few years worth of expenses saved besides dividend checks and other investments.
---
What’s the range in the Artillery? I toyed With building it but I’m up the cliffs North East of Whitesprings
---
Maybe with a seperate points system, ultracite ammo for ultracite ammo!
---
I'd also like to know. Unsure if I should swap out the train carriage for the garage.
---
Yeah it's essentially like sleep mode, but I have made it a habit of properly closing the game down out of fear it would cause an issue. But regardless, whenever it's the tuesday weekly reset it happens, every other day is fine.
---
Have run I to him/her several times and consistently gives me a Gauss rifle if I hand the 20 Bobby pins.
---
On the other hand, the dude asking for 3 kinds of alcohol simply dies upon consuming the third one, so not really worth it.
---
Im not a mod, but youve only got to scroll down and see the amount of duplicate posts being made
---
Its the same question over and over and over again
---
They just addressed it in another post. Not going to be fixed until update 21
---
week 3 just started of a 10 week event. im already almost to 40. i'll make it. saving all my first member atoms for the last 10 levels. so im almost 1/2 done
---
I don't think so. You can use/interact with it to open/close it without any power attached. Flipping a switch attached to the connector just turns on/off the lights inside, the red rocket sign and the rocket launching animation.
---
Technically true for some but the container max fills up quicker than that. Like the industrial water purifier I think creates 1 purified water every minute but it maxes out after 5 so you have to empty it much quicker than every hour to keep it producing.
---
Agreed. No matter what Bethesda does people will still be mad.
---
It looks like faded, cheap patio turf you'd find in Florida.  I love it.
---
Not at all. Disregarding the babble in your last comment, you haven't actually pointed out any flaw in my argument, because I don't think you even understand the point.
---
First of all just because you keep saying "Im not referencing Bethesdas reasons or opinions" doesn't mean that you can just ignore them for the purpose of the argument. You as a player may value all of your time and effort equally but Bethesda does not. So from the perspective of the player you may be disproportionately rewarded for your time/effort but from Bethesdas perspective they are rewarding the players that exhibit the behavior they are looking for (i.e. rewarding daily log-ins more than binge playing.) 
---
You're really conflating the idea that all time and effort is or should be valued equally, when it is by no means the case. Even if Bethesda wasn't going out of their way to reinforce this fact, it would still be true. Let's stop talking about SCORE for a moment and just focus on exp. Take two players, equal level, gear and skill. Now have one of them farming Fissure Sites and Deathclaws  and server hopping for 7 hours and have the other person stay on one server grinding events in the Forest/Toxic Valley for the same time period. Both players played for the same time, but the player running events probably had to put more effort into actually completing objectives and finding things to do between events where as the player farming SBs and Deathclaws probably made waaay more exp and had to do very little except kill enemies and fast travel. The point is when and how you spend your time matters just as much if not more than the quantity of time you spend playing.
---
I almost pulled the trigger on them, but remembered that I also had the Red Turrets....no need to double up.
---
I'm set up just north of foundation, by the series of lakes where a behemoth spawns, and I use the artillery cannon everytime I kill the behemoth as it can actually do some decent damage
---
ok capn i see you. Please and thank you, I understand your situation, Valseek. I however did not pose those question rhetorically, I would very much like those answered if you are in the know.
---
Thank you for providing some solid information and trying to empathize.
---
I bought a two shot the dragon last Week for 999 caps. It Sounded very good especially for that price but even fully rifle perked i just did like 200-300 damage per shot on things witch is compared to the ages ( im serious you can take a cig break in between reloads) it needs to take to reload one Single shot nothing. Scrapped it the other day.
---
Conclusion: Weapon Sounds cool but is absolute shit in real game in my eyes.
---
Ah ok, I wasn’t sure if that could be what is triggering it during the reset.  Just trying to help troubleshoot (not that we as the players should have to be doing that)
---
I would use it. I take over the workshop with the food processing and I live off Salisbury steak. Much like in real life.
---
Thanks, will edit
---
I have a decent team, it just seems I am dying every single second
---
Kinda your own fault for not collecting from the harvesters for 3 fucking hours. Maybe this will teach you be more attentive. Nice job running away like a little bitch.
---
Thanks man, I didn’t realize it was stand alone like that
---
I do have a second floor with stairs up to it. If there any way to like scrap the blueprint and store everything in it?
---
I want to spend my unemployment check on ATOMS but you won't let me
---
I was playing last night and I noticed that my damage got buffed after taking psycho even though I have that addiction so I think it doesn't matter, you still get the buff on top of all of your addictions. Im only running with 5 addictions.
---
I treat them like locked doors... there is always a way through!
---
Yeah if you are on the blueprints menu in building Menu there should be an Option to do exactly what you asked. Scrap and store.
---
You need FireProof x3 to survive the Eye-Bombs.
---
I could see that working if it's done well. U-cite rounds always craft more so it'd be harder to get the ratio right, but not having to figure out where to find enough cobalt flux to make that one ammo type and instead just grinding out a butt ton of violet or crimson would be a godsend (or technically Toddsend?).
---
Do you have Fallout 1st?
---
Happened to me a month ago. Hanging onto it all. Made an offer on the Market to trade it all for a bloodied fixer but didn't get a bubble. Congrats!
---
Alright thanks.
---
Take out the aquaboy/girl perk card from endurance. When that's equipped you take zero rads from consuming it.
---
I want it more as a item to have rather then to use, as im fully aware they likely nerfed the hell out of it before making it unavailable
---
I would think a good stealth ranged build would do wonders for it though
---
Add the 3 rifleman perks at max
---
Tank killer
---
Then covert operative
---
Sneak
---
And that one that makes enemies loose sight of you if you crouch
---
Should have some good numbers right?
---
About half the diameter of a nuke, it would nice if theh got a range buff, that or they added a workshop or site where you could claim it and then be able to call artillery down anywhere in that region
---
Absolutely pathetic
---
[Latest Solo Run - Vampire Gauss Minigun](https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs)
---
Take a look.
---
Its broken up into parts, hover over the challenge to see it. Like you've gotta make 20 lights or generators, 5 stairs or doors, and like 3 more tasks i can't remember.
---
Basically this. Steam and Game Pass will mean some new blood, and Wastelanders helped too, but thanks to the launch and press this game received it will never be the success that the highers up expected and demand. It's just not in the cards at this point.
---
Fallout 4 sold 14 \*million\* copies. Fortnight has  250 million players.
---
Steam has Fallout 76 with 11,047 In-Game to Fallout 4's 18,984 In-Game. Sure, that doesn't factor in all the people on BethNet, but it's telling in its own way. As are the constant new and different attempts to earn money from the game, rather than just sticking to one or two and dedicating to them. In my opinion it's clear that someone high up is impatient with 76 and considers it either a liability/damaging to the brand or just not financially successful enough.
---
With my vampiric flamer, I can pick up 3 pylons (and I use a few stimpacks)... 
---
So the key is the self healing.
---
Also, bloodied builds are junk there.
---
im not complaining or anything, i really don't know. i see a ton of posts on here about bush wookies and aquaman playstyles, is this the norm in this mode? are cheaters prevalent? id like to give the mode a go at some point when i get further into my playtime (lvl 17)
---
You didn’t look inside the actual list did you. You have to build specific things not just 5 random camp items. 
---
It’s like 20 power connectors/lights 5 floor decorations, 5 stairs or doors etc each constitute one of the 5 challenges. 
---
I’m not at my pc to give a full proper list but still.
---
If you wanna protect your workshops, build a building around the claim station and put turrets facing the area
---
the sadist bug combo I ve ever seen is a  "killed by invisible enemy" during SBQ or at nuked area + respawn bug. Hands down.
---
Sweet, thanks.
---
It's one nw challenge a day, and the rest of the challenges are for adventure mode. You don't need to play nw to get enough score.
---
Knowing that it's actively worked on and you know what is causing it helps relieve the stress of this bug.
---
I so wish the door was powered though
---
So you buy the ranks but was unable to claim the rewards?
---
It didn't seem to matter much for other situations, such as the ammo converter. I couldn't find a thread about anything else for days (hyperbole, but still).
---
I can hold all conduits with some preparation no problem but there's no way I can fight the imposter at the same time
---
You can't buy the ranks bethesda fucked up again
---
Yes. They’re available until update 21
---
How long has the SBQ guy taken on this? Are you sure he isn't just sleeping during video calls?
---
tbh, i think they should just take tickets at face value. there will be abuse, but so what? I understand how you feel about your grind, but just because you worked hard doesn't mean the people that didn't get the opportunity should be shafted or have to work harder. you're still getting the rewards you worked for and it doesn't make them any lesser. either that, or give everyone that submits a ticket additional opportunities equivalent to the contested amount.
---
dont get me wrong. i dont think everything should just be given to everyone, but we have to be compensated. in no way is it fair that people have to grind an additional 400,000+xp for each time that Bethesda fucked them just because it'll make some people feel iffy.
---
Missed out on 6750 score altogether, my worst week too. The devs go on about 'how much we love the community' and all that sappy shit but they obviously just don't care. Watch them crack little jokes about bugs at the next event, they can be smug cos all they want is the $$$.
---
Reading this is making me consider reinstalling the game.
---
Post removed?
---
I want one for my office - a plushie of that would be awesome!
---
honestly, you dumping so much money in to the game so far has just been encouraging their bad behavior.  they have little incentive to change their ways if it still gets them a profit.
---
Hey Hey! Thanks!
---
I put mine in my UFO playground.
---
Not a problem for me, I could pay 15000 atoms for all ranks because I AM RICH.
---
I think we should be able to craft our own legendaries, but have to be a certain level to do it. Like once you hit 50 you can craft a one star weapon with whatever effect you desire, 100 a two star, and 200 a three star. Of course you could still find any of these drops in the wild, but it would be much better and enjoyable to grind out levels knowing you’d get exactly what you want then to keep dealing with RNG and hoping you get the .001 whatever percent chance of the item you want.
---
cringe
---
I was thinking about this a bit the other night. I like your suggestion, it's a good way to "collect" the parts you want in order to create the ideal weapon for your build. That being said, I think I would be content with something even more simple as scrapping legendary items and receiving 1 Scrip per star that the item has.
---
My camp was near the wayward and everytime i logged into the game i gave them some reopening fireworks, a bad day for their bramin
---
I have several looking out from inside the UFO in my base.  Compared to the size of similar camp items I find them to be pretty solid.
---
Yup this right here. Those things are amazing the only thing that is not is the cost of fiber optics... 10 per?!
---
I set mine up on the cliff just a little up the road from the freak show right by the devil's backbone, very fun to occasionally bombarded some muties to the north or the occasional mirelurk queen at the freak show
---
Even the fusion core reactor would be full. I usually take it once a week. My pa and gatling laser eat them up.
---
That doesn't work anymore. You can claim/contest a workshop from anywhere inside the workshop zone.
---
Wanna share? :P lmao :)
---
True, I could grind out 3 of those repeatable score challenges, but it doesn't make up for missing the weekly like last week which required 3 NW challenges to complete.  It would take 10 grinding of those to make up for that as well, so it's either do NW challenges, or you must do 19 Experience score increase challenges.  I think it's reasonable to ask for an alternate...
---
Did you not see where I was specifically talking about the NW ones? I said I haven't found any of the Adventure mode dailies to be a problem.
---
Also, how are you going to throw the 1 kill NW challenge in my face when this whole conversation went down before we knew what the dailies would be today? I mean, look at how this went. Person snarks about "participation trophies" because they're relaxing the tedious NW challenges a bit, and I say that it's good that we don't have to work as hard in a game mode many don't enjoy. So what exactly am I supposed to explain to you in regards to the daily NW being, no surprise, easier than it was before because they said they would go easier with those?
---
I have no beef with you.
---
Well, it is much larger compared to the other plushies.  I do love it still.  Going to be sitting on my couch in front of the TV
---
The wendigo colossus plus is a drop from the upcoming a colossal problem event
---
Doing what and how?
---
To be honest I have only played with a couple workshops and I have noticed that most of them seem pretty pointless without this feature being added
---
Ha I’ve heard them talking about floaters too!  One SM was saying to another how it “just followed me home!”  So cute in a bizarre way.  The super mutants have way more dialogue than anyone living in that settler town.
---
adding "and / or" would be nice....let us do one thing or another, maybe both, to satisfy the requirements.
---
Been looking forward to mine. Just got it 2 mins ago
---
Omg I am so jealous. I'm dying for the bos jumpsuit. Watch me go play one violent night right now
---
So you wrote out a paragraph to attempt to troll me? Yeah I paid $150 to make complaint posts. Not to buy... The rewards... Nah... Just so I could complain.
---
Like, what the fuck are you on?
---
1st for regular game, 3rd for nuclear winter.
---
In most cases I would assume something similar had happened.  In this case it looks like OP was thinking they just needed to build 5 things in general and didn't see that there is a list of different specific things that need to be built .
---
Woah this is the lightest update yet.
---
Raider Collectron finally free after a full 12 months
---
Is there a link to the statement by Valseek?
---
Yknow what, mask off, this fucking subreddit is a goddamn hivemind that can't handle a different opinion.  Idek why I still bother posting to it.  The only posts I've made on here that people agreed with were regurgitated swill from others and the most basic ass requests or opinions.  Back to just glancing at this subreddit from time to time and keeping my mouth shut.
---
Haha yeah innit thanks tho man
---
Yeah I was asking myself that too. I still didnt get a crash just after an event ,yet. Im on PS4 though, so thats probably the reason maybe ?
---
Doubtful. Players are already legitimately rank 70-80 - If they don't release the option soon there'll be no point. Might as well just spend the Atoms on Repair Kits. :D
---
There's a mod on Nexus Mods.
---
finally a use for the random number generator other than randomly having a siren go off at workshops
---
We apologize, but we're delaying Rank Up purchases for Atoms for the moment. We'll have more info on this in the coming days!
---
any recs on content creators? i seem to only find ones that bash the game, making me wonder why the even bother attempting to play it. very similar to destiny content creators
---
Duping weapons and armour , and I don't know,  I'm too busy grinding for score lol , doesn't interest me
---
And it turns out, the background singers are going "we found out" instead of "weep be deep" like I thought
---
NPC.  Random encounter - I've seen it most frequently walking Southish across the RR Bridge to Charleston RR station.
---
Also has dialog if you can talk to the character.
---
jesus, salty-
---
Unfortunately I'm on ps4, home of no mods
---
Many, many threads on this, it isn’t available yet.
---
Delayed a couple days apparently.
---
They delayed it because they’re still working on fixing the auto-complete bug. It was addressed today. It would be distasteful to give you the option to purchase ranks when the bug prevents you from earning it normally.
---
Longer and even more boring.
---
Yeah I’ll do that for the high capacity, the 2 armor backpacks and the trade back of the JE instigating, lmk, gt otannehill
---
I can help if you are still around. My PSN is tracerbullet53

 &gt;We apologize, but we're delaying Rank Up purchases for Atoms for the moment. We'll have more info on this in the coming days!
---
Would I had bought atoms if I knew it'd be delayed until practically no point in purchasing them? 
---
Of course I didn't.
---
🙄 i was gonna buy out today.
---
What the hell? How did my post violate any community rules??
---
So we never get to spend it
---
Eh...
---
Not only did he destroy the other guys camp, he also ran away to avoid repercussions. He brags like he was some kind of chad but really he was a coward.
---
Not to state the obvious but you can click on it to play no radios like I do and thus I hear none of them.  I am also on PS4
---
You got that right lol
---
They never get anything right
---
Did, cancelled few months back. Since getting back into 76 the past few weeks it's hard work not having the tent, private world and scrap box, was considering resubbing... was... Lol
---
They don't give a fuck about PC. Buy an XBOX
---
I think Ghram has it. If not, check Whitesprings vendors.
---
The current word is 2-3 days delay.  What’s the problem there?
---
Was it you that previously mentioned a desire to be one of the first to legitimately receive all of the rewards?
---
I can concur this personally... it does look good in a kitchen but useless. Salt perk and grocer's mod works great for me
---
I write paragraphs all the time cause I have a lot to rant about. I feel you’re the one trolling all of us! LoL. Like you haven’t played 76 or something. You know when shit is planned to release, don’t really expect it to happen. It’s 76! That’s the nature of the beast. I just want you to take a breather friend, it’ll all be okay in a few days/weeks. Til then, just play the game normally so you don’t need to actually spend all those atoms.
---
I’m pretty new to Reddit and I don’t know how to do all that but check my other post it’s on there
---
 How did my post violate any community rules??
---
&gt;I don't think you even understand the point.
---
Sadly the feeling is mutual. Oh well. Have fun. I shan't be wasting further time.
---
Hey look bethesda fucked up again who is surprised
---
Yeah the lever action is timed to hide all the clunkiness of the gunplay system. It's perfect.
---
No
---
You should be happy
---
I dunno, have you heard about Norway yet?
---
Just about, if you use the bigger ones. I have a line of curtains overlooking the lake in my camp, some you can squeeze through some you cant.
---
Do you mean turning off the station? Sometimes that doesn't even work, it just starts off where she left off when I stopped listening
---
For some reason they drop all at once, instead of rolling for one at a time, has happened to me in the past. Congratulations
---
Was he at least the same level as you? Or were you being a dick to a low level guy? Happened to me before when I started playing. I had no idea how shit worked and wanted to claim the power plant and some level 100+ dick killed me just for shits and giggles.
---
theres a submenu.
---
When you highlight the build up a camp item, a submenu will pop up. 
---
It will tell you what 5 things (an quantity thereof)  you have to build.
---
Are you in third person when you interact with her? Sometimes I have to switch to first person for her to pay attention to me.
---
Don't waste your atoms til the end when levels are most expensive
---
Yeah bro when you see my spinning nightlight you'll know what an alpha dog, Chad I am IRL.
---
Juicehead seems to be one of the more level-headed ones i see. he has opinions like anyone, but also just looks at facts and when he reports on speculation he insists it be taken with a grain of salt. basically, he seems to like the game but admits it has problems.
---
for just game lore, i recommend Oxhorn. he has a whole series of videos on 76's questlines even pre-wastelanders that shows that 76 DOES have a story, and a pretty damn goid one.
---
It's longer in the sense that there are more of them. Bit half of them are kill a named hostile NPC so it kinda balances out.
---
~~Antisocial cucks~~ Solo players hate this
---
I too have supported this game, more so than any other I've ever played. Bought 1st for a year right out of the gate, and still purchased atom packs on occasion if I ran low &amp; there was something I wanted. All the while thinking that my contributions &amp; those of other players would give Bethesda the incentive to fix the game...well that was obviously a huge mistake on my part. I'm just waiting for my 1st subscription to expire in October at this point. I've already taken the steps so it doesn't renew on Xbox. 
---
Pete Hines in an interview a few weeks ago as much as admired that Bethesda knew they released an unfinished game..."developers hate to miss holidays". They made a conscious decision the release the game as is to try &amp; get a jump on holiday sales.
---
I'm not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt any longer, nor any more of my money for this or any future releases. My experience here has shown me that Bethesda can't be trusted &amp; that they have no quality control whatsoever. They seem to have forgotten the most basic things...games are supposed to be fun (not a overloading grind that's like a 2nd job), that core mechanics (fast travel, vats. leaving power armour &amp; more) are supposed to WORK as intended...additional content doesn't mean shit if you putting that content out to run with the main game routines in rides on are broken &amp; non functional (would you build a house on a broken foundation?).
---
Quests that can be completed because they are glitches, challenges that auto complete &amp; rewards missed because they are glitches...the list just goes on...
---
People I've met in game are what kept me playing, but they are also getting fed up &amp; dropping out. 
---
Bethesda hypes up new content (Wastelanders) then within a week shuts down player vending...what kind of impression do you think that makes on new players?
---
They introduce seasons...guess what new players are seeing there as well.
---
And the Bethesda response is always..."sorry can't help you".
---
Hell they couldn't even make the part of the game work where you paid real money to progress through the season...lol.
---
Bethesda had no idea how to fix this mess &amp; is completely unwilling to dedicate the resources needed to fix it or to hire devs that can.
---
Lesson learned.
---
That’s not my problem here
---
This is the best solution I’ve seen so far
---
Yeah I guess so, but some of the challenges are really easy to get. :)
---
Nah it's as though I'm acting as if Bethesda lied to everyone for over 2 weeks straight, then changed their minds last minute without telling anyone.  
---
Am I wrong in this statement?
---
I hope it stays broken if it breaks your BOS heart
---
Man its always the same with that game but over time i found it to be rather enjoying than frustrating.
---
I swear yesterday my Karma Hit me so hard i could only laugh again.
---
There Was a guy who probably accidently picked a lock in a Camp, so He got wanted and Marked on the map. I thought Why Not hunt him down, followed him He ran all the way from wendigo cave to foundation i guess He checked the map and knew He was being followed.
---
As i finally met him We just stood Face to Face i could Not Do it i just thought poor guy. I heart emoted him and was about to leave, He heart emoted back. Suddenly out of nowhere a level 250ish guy came up killed that poor Bastard with like 2 shots and disappeared again. I Was like oh okay Well it wasnt me. As i aproach his junk bag i can See He had like 400 fluxes with him. In the first Moment i thought i cant do it but then the greed won. I Took the fluxes just before He could reach his bag and He was visibly MAD at me i can fully under stand that. But sorry bro Why u even carry so much with you and its the wasteland so Well.
---
He invited me to a Deal i pressed cancel after i saw He did Not want to buy them back.
---
IN THAT MOMENT my game Suddenly started to lag as hell making it impossible to play and it would Not stop doing so for Minutes. Okay i restarted the ps4, logged in... Black screen only the crosshair visible and music playing. Waited like 5 Minutes nothing happened. Restarted ps4 again on login screen it says Bethesta Account has no permission. I Was like wtf are you fucking serious. I was so Sure this guy sent me a kind of Virus or some Thing for my Bad behavior. Couldnt log in til today midday. I Thank god it works now, probably was just some Bethesta issue but i will never Rob any guys junk bag again i swear.
---
And if that dude somehow should read this: the guy in the teddy bear suit is infinitely sorry okay. Dont do any Black magic to me.
---
I'm a level 36 right now and he was a level 32 so not a very big difference
---
I have three entrances to my camp. One has a decondoorway, the other is just a door, the other is a gate. Pick your poison.
---
Same thing happened to me today as well. Lost out on about 7000.
---
I explained in another post that the only ones I had a problem with WERE the NW ones. I've had no issues getting the Adventure mode challenges done in short order.
---
If the enemy remains still or teleports around in my experience the main cause would be server desync.
---
Log off and log back in.
---
Sometimes I have to server hop a couple of times.
---
If it's because of VATS ,then it's that weird bug. Log off and log in anyway. Should fix the problem. 
---
On PS4 it happens very rarely. The desync though, oh man this was getting really out of hand couple of weeks ago.
---
A named legendary gun and a unique NPC linked traveling vendor.
---
What servers did you played before and after reset? Just regular public world or maybe friend's private world?
---
Is there going to be some compensation for the points lost?  More bonus events at least, or an extra amount of days to finish the season?  Some people have lost a lot of levels worth of challenges.    
---
It seems kinda shitty to just let it keep going knowing people are getting screwed over in a limited time daily log in scenario, otherwise.
---
Just wait you impatient fuck
---
I picked it up but I can’t find the garage door in the build menus. Do you know where it’s located?
---
If you’ve got the contemporary building stuff you could prob make a convenience store/train stop along the train tracks. Godspeed tho, on your quest
---
Would pay 4 flux for photos.
---
Would the auto crit in this situation be only in vats or just apply a crit while using your weapon
---
I see. In that case I can understand. I just don’t like high level players picking on low levels. (I’m currently level 22 or something).
---
Nope. Get robbed
---
When you compare Bethesda's business practices to Nigerian scam artists and think that's an insult to me, Lol.
---
awesome! thank you much. its my first fallout game and ive been really enjoying myself so far so it wouldn't make a ton of sense to watch another kevduehatefo76 video lol
---
..."at times"? 
---
It's almost always frustrating. I mean, I like it, but I also dread every time I start a rebuild. (Which I do way, WAY too often for my own health.)
---
Keep your ears open when wandering around. Listen for the inane drivel of a Settler mumbling about fixing stuff up. Sometimes you can get a little Foundation rep by talking to them.
---
Sorry when something is promised on a specific date it better be delivered on that date
---
i did not see the submenu, my bad
---
Appreciate it.
---
Since you’re familiar with where it is on the build menu, can you answer me this? Do any other items share that spot on the build menu if you hit left or right? If so, what items?
---
Thanks for the response!
---
Were you last playing NW and/or did you check atomic shop or legendary run before logging in?
---
thank you, i didnt see the submenu
---
whine harder
---
Here's an idea. How about Bethesda stops going back on what they say last minute? How about you give your advice to those that are unwilling to make an official statement, HOURS after the patch is live? 
---
Hmm? How is it on my fault for trusting Bethesda? 
---
Hmm?
---
They just want to shoot ghouls and pretend they're helping
---
Hope so man, times tough.
---
Shoot me a friend request on Xbox.
---
I dont know who "the bads" you speak of in your post, but it is people who disagree with you then guilty as charged.  NW is a part of the game and even as much as I find it unfathomable some prefer it to adventure.  These people need to be represented as well and it also encourages people to try out NW.  I would have never played it except for the halloween challenges and now I'm a lvl 49 because it doesn't suck that bad and is a nice change of pace.  If you can get an alternate to NW I would like one for camp building challenges. I dislike messing with my camp even if they are terribly easy like the NW challenges.  Hopefully I have made my point without being one of the "bads" you speak of. Be safe internet amigo!
---
if this is your first fallout game then i definitely recommend binging Oxhorn's videos so you learn more about the series. i particularly recommend his Fallout 1 and 2 lore series, since many modern Fallout fans dont bother playing them (unfourtunately. they're great games, just different)
---
Easy to do my friend. Now you can crack on with it! Good luck.
---
The part where that's "word of mouth" and not an official statement. 
---
It's almost as if people being dishonest is no problem but people calling out dishonesty ARE the problem?
---
I mean im not they literally mess everything up.
---
Yea I am scared to move my house because well.. I like it.. I don't want to rebuild it.. Problem is it's in a very popular area so sometimes I have to join 4-6 times before I can play because of someone elses base.
---
I dont play much im just buying out man.
---
I have been logged in on the reset time most days not had a problem.
---
I am gonna guess that it is related to the power. It takes 3 power to turn on. I haven't tested it yet. I'm actually going on to a higher level character to mess w it rn
---
I’m fairly new to the game so unsure what happens if you do that to someone’s camp. Does that mean that it’s gone for good and he would need to rebuild everything?
---
I got the same group doing Uranium Fever, that was a great day!
---
Ive bought every single atomic item.
---
thanks!
---
Will be copping then! I don't want to hear any more Fasnacht songs
---
I have a camp near foundation.an old monorail tower with a junk pile ans 2 raiders camped out there.with my collectron bot and the extractor i get tons of resources.i mean i have hundreds of everything.the hardest to get is the flux for them.for me anyway.
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is great
---
right on will do, i watched mittens and epicnates history of and would love to watch Oxhorns further explanations since those videos weren't terribly involved
---
Thanks so much! Don't worry we're eager to meet people, we're just trying to figure everything out first!
---
The more items in your inventory, the longer the hang
---
Well, given the problems identified with auto-completing challenges &amp; not awarding score, it's probably the right thing to do.
---
Adrenaline too? Fuck.
---
The garage is not a government lie
---
I agree with you, thus why I said a little pissed (for my own effort in relation to someone who is Rank 2) if they just auto-completed the Season, rather than a lot pissed. And at Bethesda, not the players, they are faultless.
---
It would have to be Atoms given out I suppose, as I doubt they can hand out Score or just grant xp. When it comes down to it our characters are glorified save files.
---
This is why I have a on/off switch into my house so you have a choice if you want to use it or not
---
That means double XP weekend is going to be a boon for trying to these! 😃
---
Go to kevduit.com you can also go to his YouTube channel of the same name
---
I am a bit worried, the prices so far of atom items is too 'good guy bethesda'. I expected a rise after the seasons. In general they have been quite fair with their prices, unlike ESO. ESO also has loot crates so that puts them on a super special scumbag pedestal. Anyway, amazing stuff, first the slocum vendor, now raider bot, rocket garage... couldn't be happier.   
---
u/valseek transfer our admiration to the team &lt;3
---
Welcome bud! Good luck on score!
---
You can see a lot of build options on fallout builds.com
---
Thanks so much for the detailed response! So far the game is fantastic, we're super into it.
---
Does anybody here know the meaning of loyalty?
---
So you're mad that he had better gear? 🤔
---
Just got it myself.
---
Thank you, but will specifics be there or will I have to play around?
---
There's only so much work and bug fixing the skeleton team on 76 can do.  All their good people are working on Starfield, TES6, and other IP.
---
Thanks for the pvp explanation!
---
Let me know if it’s any use!
---
Oh I agree, we’d all love for them to not go back on the original plans or not push back content, I just think it’s probably for reasons they don’t share with us. One of the community managers has commented on this just very recently in another post. They’re pushing it back, but we figured that by now. And there’s no fault to be thrown around, you wanted to complete the season, you just threw money at the screen before it was even an option. You wouldn’t do this in the real world though so I just don’t understand doing it with bethesda of all entities. Like, would you listen to a car salesman hype up a car they don’t have on the lot yet and just give him the full price in cash before even seeing it on the lot? Probably not. It’s just foolish, but like I said, you do your thing, no one cares either way is all I’m saying
---
I wish they’d just stop wasting our tax dollars trying to convince us they’re the best, in general, regardless of whether it’s on TV or it’s recruiters harassing and taking advantage of young and impressionable kids at high school.
---
Flamer and shishkebab
---
Common bug that has never been patched
---
Yeah America is better.
---
What's wrong with the perks you mentioned? Serendipity and fireproof are working for me.
---
If PvP relies on a specific set of weapons / armor &amp; isn't at all balanced in a way where is can be enjoyed by the masses, it isn't PvP - it's crap.
---
I need this..... Yesterday I was trying to give a newbie a bunch of good starter stuff ammo/weapons/plans/food/water etc etc. but it takes time to get all that shit out of yer bags, and I could tell the player was getting nervous and kept backing off eventually running away, so I picked up all the loot again and starting chasing him emoting for them to come to me, but they were having none of it..... I swear I chased them half way across the map lmao
---
Aside from the fact that time-gates are [toxic systems designed to](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/07/11/stopping-the-spread-of-gamings-most-offensive-mechanic-the-time-gate/#59fbdaa634de) artifically slow down the player unless they are willing to pay cash money which is literally what the legendary run is, your argument assumes things:
---
- The experience is not significantly degraded by bugs.
---
- That the prices are fair and the time investment is not obviously weighted against the player.
---
They have them all made, just not available to us serfs
---
The fusion flea?
---
I play in 1st, and I tried in 3rd, armed, holstered, even gave her a floater grenade but she wasn't happy.
---
Huh,I'm actually playing exactly like this. I dont continue doing shit that feels annoying at that time. I let it settle for a while and return to it another day. I have a lot of sidequests to do still.
---
FYI - you can google info on how to control your spawn point to some extent. You can't necessarily pinpoint someone, but you can definitely put them in a direction proximate to your CAMP. 
---
If I recall, the rule of thumb is that you tend to spawn northeast of your actual CAMP device. There may be some element of rotation involved (i.e. - the way it's facing matters), but my own tests have never proven this conclusively. 
---
I can confirm, however, that you can move your CAMP device after you've placed it down to establish your build radius, and that doing so doesn't reset your CAMP or build radius, but *does* change the spawn point. So if you build near a cliff (like I did),make sure your CAMP device is far away from the cliff, and oriented so that the NE side of it drops people on land.
---
I'd happily kill my mule for a popcorn ceiling.
---
How have they nerfed pistols?
---
Deal.
---
There's no difference between the first run and your 1000th run. You didn't miss out on shit
---
I powered it up and it lights up and has some nice effects but I think you have to attach the garage separately and I can’t find it in the build menu.
---
I couldn't even get my artillery to work.   Ended up scrapping it.
---
God you sound like a massive asshole
---
lol you right
---
One can be placed anywhere
---
Haha, sorry it didnt work. Maybe a pumpkin grenade? 🤣
---
I’ve been joing public teams and do the group events, but I find myself leaving team usually after daily is achieved only because not a single soul has said one word on any public team I’ve joined.  
---
Its like playing alone lol.  I have my usual crew I roll with, but it would be nice to actually meet newer different players.
---
Ah, maybe someone in my team was sharing it, thx for the tip 😉
---
Would also love to hear
---
I think if something feels like this especially in a huge game world like FO76 ,perhaps try doing something else for a while and return to it the next day.
---
That's how I play games...it must not become a chore (granted sometimes it is unavoidable).
---
You *have to have a specific set* for "PvP" i thought everyone knew this? 
---
PvP is just consistent of quantum's, stealth boys, and Teslas 😂
---
The dude kept coming back for more and expected a different result
---
Honestly I'm fine with it, but I also only have a partial bloody build. That and damage and/or rads come pretty easily so I'm not super worried about a shower running all the rads off.
---
Does it let you choose what ammo you want to collect?
---
After you log in or respawn (and fast travel, maybe) there is a period in which you won't take any rad damage. 
---
Especially if you login inside an event this period can be significantly bigger. 
---
Ps: Just for clarity the item in question is "toxic goo".
---
That's true - but just a symptom of a game mechanic that doesn't work for the vast majority of the players.
---
9 out 10 times it's a cluster fuck.  Most people only want to defend rather than collect ore
---
I Am Become Death is just launching a nuke. You can do that anytime without the quest active.
---
Parking lot
---
Wish Molotov cocktails worked but unfortunately not.
---
Here's the official statement:
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/419343/rank-up-purchases-postponed-july-14-2020
---
If you buy a gift card for a supermarket because they advertised a sale on blueberries, and those blueberries are late arriving because the store screwed up, is the supermarket really being dishonest?
---
Why did you buy atoms before ensuring the legendary run level sale was a go?
---
Yes, it’s a ridiculous analogy, but it suits your “issue”.
---
By workshop do you mean C.A.M.P? Or no?
---
There's also the pioneer scout one to.
---
...and I went away and did other stuff, logged off/on, waited for the new week to start (on a Tuesday!)...
---
Doesn't hinder my gameplay as I'm long past quest lines thank goodness but its nice to do some of the old, often ignored quests occasionally
---
don't give Bethesda any ideas!  1 scrip per star is a much lower rate of return that we currently get
---
But it notifies the shop owner.   If he ran off when OP shot at him, it stands to reason he didn't want to alert OP that he was in the workshop.
---
It's just better to keep pacifist mode on and don't claim workshops especially with a lot of people and their dupe weapons people don't stand a chance
---
Strategy.  Encrypted is an event I still struggle with at times.  But I’m working on it.  The game provides many mechanics to help defeat the imposter.  I just need to learn to use those to my advantage.  
---
Some players like to farm the robots for steal or XP or whatever.  So far,I just see them as a distraction from the main event.  My current strategy involves ignoring them.  I’m using cooked scorch beast meat (for its HP) to tank the pylons.   Now for a weapon.  My Minigun is proving problematic.  Spin up and down time sucks.
---
My hero.
---
theres no business malpractice here dude
---
you bought atoms for a function not yet available!
---
wait a day and stop being so dramatic about it.
---
the fact you'd spend 150 dollars  8 weeks before an season ended and call yourself a "whale" proudly ,  which is inherently a negative term used for con artists when looking for someone to scam is saddening.
---
I am in love with my Rade rifle. It's fully modded, too, so I feel very accomplished carrying it knowing how much of a pain the mods are to unlock.
---
So many innocent mole miners killed... all for nothing
---
If you follow the road  north west from Morgantown Station there's a concrete extractor in the middle of the road next to some reasonably flat land.
---
Edit: not extractor but you get what I mean.
---
the road next to pleasant valley train station. it's long and wide.
---
Aw man that must be awful. Luckily I'm a heavy gunner so the only thing I have to worry about is ammo
---
Are they ever going to re-rerelease the Red Rockey Bundle with the jumpsuit and garage door that was put up and taken down like 20 minutes later? I need to complete my Red Rocket themed C.A.M.P. I figured they would release it with the prefab garage but doesn't seem to be the case.
---
I do keep pacifist on &amp; only take workshops for the SCORE. Though people leave me alone - I guess being a level 526 scares them off.
---
I think it's closer to 50% or so, I know that you could risk taking a hit or two for the early game battles in the den since they're brutally unfair for low level characters. But yeah the addiction is one of the worst in the game and it can't be cured without a unique jet cure, while other addictions go away after a few in-game days. Jet addiction being "normal" in fallout 3 and onwards is most likely just an oversight, but whether it's intentional or not it does provide a better case for the retcon
---
where’s the purchasing ranks for the challenge pasa
---
Ok so just ignore this?
---
“Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence. We’ve also received a lot of questions about playing Fallout 76 with mods and this, too, is something we’re excited to add to private worlds in the future.”
---
Right. Possible future stuff. Not what we currently get. Got it. You’ve made that clear. Why mention it at all then?  Especially with no follow up since launching 1st. What has evolved?  Nothing?  Maybe give us an update?  Transparency?  Shit flat out say to me we’re waiting for your sub to renew to launch these things.
---
Ikr, I was going to buy today as well.
---
On a completely unrelated note, most people don't read Reddit before posting.
---
suck it up and kill the single creature, jesus christ
---
I have one across the street from the train station next to the top of the world. There is a junk resource there as well. Unfortunately it is a pretty popular spot. Good luck.
---
I set up a small roadside camp for awhile at the crossroads a little south of Morgantown. Or alternatively there's a highway not too far east from Whitesprings that could be a pretty good location.
---
last weeks challenges were mind numbingly simple, to not do them was nothing more than laziness
---
What you've described doesn't seem like a dick move at all - especially since there aren't a lot of chat options. Did you express your intentions over the voice chat? Did the leader of the group respond? Unfortunately, without text chat, you can't even know whether the other person even knows you're communicating with them.
---
Without text chat, there's no guaranteed way for the leader to express what they want from the team, and there's no guaranteed way for you to express that you're going to skip specific events but you aren't "leaching" the caps and other perks.
---
If you're in an event group, and you're not participating in all events, I totally see why you would get kicked. I personally wouldn't kick you for this, but honestly I also always either join or start a Building group anyway.
---
Kicking you isn't being pissy (again, with limited chat options). Getting in your face, trying to block your way, dropping explosive bait at your base, shouting on the mike - all of those could be considered aggressive or "dick" actions. But kicking you out of a event group because you didn't participate in an event? Seems totally acceptable to me.
---
Well they didnt mention the huge dupe wave so it must be legit.
---
I mean I still disagree with you just because I feel like NW is a waste of my playtime.  I feel like it's something I'll not ever enjoy for a myriad of reasons.  I was saying mostly I was afraid of opening up myself for comments like "git gud" or "you just don't like it because you suck!"  (Which okay I do admit I do suck!)  
---
Honestly if I could complete the NW challenges by sitting in an empty room for 30 mins with nothing to do, I'd rather do that.
---
We’re you on a public team or solo?
---
There's a jet recipe in the dev room. It doesn't actually work, and you can tell it was removed early on because its name is formatted differently from other recipes, but it was at least considered at some point. Since no fucks are being given about cheated items, I've been curious if some of those will resurface at some point as collector's items
---
Public team
---
He’d need to repair everything
---
Just got mine too, currently rank 39 almost 40. It’s still pretty cute as I think it’s one of the best rewards. I put one on top of my stash box and another on top of Sofia’s station which both look nice
---
Whats the carry weight capacity of the T-65? I have stayed in the excavator this whole time just for carry weight advantages.
---
Didn't think the reddit community would get the reference but you've done well XD
---
The named Allies are trash 
---
Sitting unbuilt in the workshop menu forever...just why?
---
IIRC, it's in the same category as all the other plush animals in Floor Decor.
---
Just seems to be really bad today :-)
---
Not all pvp is like that, you just found someone more prepared that pvp's more often than you. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone starts somewhere.
---
I tried, but someone shot me!
---
I let mine run around for about 10 minutes. Set him to collect weapons and ammo. So far he collected a short pipe rifle and 11 .38 rounds.
---
Some of his quips are pretty funny. He's a junkie.
---
This Reddit sub is hilarious.  Last week there were posts about how great Julie is, inspiring and pleasant.  This week she's trash.  Poor Bethesda - like herding cats...
---
;)
---
I've found them full at 30 min too.
---
Can you choose what ammo you want him to collect?
---
Not anymore, not too hard to find them now that they've been duped to hell for the 8th time. I doubt you could trade those outfits for some of the rarer plans or other items not duped in this wave tbh
---
Wrong analogy. The blueberries aren't arriving late because the store screwed up. The store told the company that owns the blueberries to hold off for a few days. Then the store failed to mention that to any customer walking inside of the store. Knowing if they tell them that they won't shop.
---
There are level 50 Scorchbeasts. 
---
This is a plausible and relatable story.
---
The scale is relative.  It's about as tall as a bed and looks fairly large when placed among other props like that.
---
Lol everyone got their own opinions
---
Juicehead, jug, miztracey
---
Someone always nukes pime just as you go to farm cure mats too. Stunning luck I tell ya.
---
Sometimes I join a group and the leader is a knob head and I leave and start my own group people join eventully.
---
What’s the deal about Norway?
---
I feel that placing 10 buddy vault guys is a waste of my limited playtime.  The one today is kill one creature.  Drop in by the south side of the powerplant shoot a bloatfly and log off.  If your on ps4 mabye we can do the ones you need help with together.  Most challenges can be done in 20 minutes.
---
Very handy indeed! I'm still using Shielded Casual though, +3 INT is yummy.
---
pvp is so watered down now if you don't like it just dont participate not that hard
---
angryturtle is the best one i've seen.
---
Hell yeah, I hope you’re right! I’ve got a 2x max budget camp and can’t place anything new. But I’ve got tons of extra plushies just to switch them to other ones later.
---
 hahhaahha
---
Bloody builds are the biggest crybabies? Guess I should whine and complain every time I one shot a 3* legendary and save myself a ton of ammo!
---
how do you file a ticket
---
I had the same issue
---
Remind anyone to sound nice after being lied too after they spend the money.
---
Is that a joke post? I feel as though you're trolling right now. 
---
Am I supposed to be cheery? 
---
OMG YAY GUYS BETHESDA LIED TO US YAY I'M SO HAPPY !!!!!!

InnovSurvivalist and RifleGaming are our favourite. AngryTurtle is very good for informative content
---
They're deleting it in Patch 21.
---
It will be a Atom Shop perk that costs 50 Atoms to activate and will last 30 minutes. Don't buy two even though they let you!
---
YES YES YES
---
\^\^\^  This
---
In the real world if a company lied to hundreds of people to get them to spend money on something that doesn't exist the day it comes, a lawsuit would pursue. Stop trying to pass the blame. Bethesda are at fault for advertising it. Bethesda are at fault for those that threw money at the screen.
---
Might be worth rejecting the mission entirely, then trying again later.
---
I have to concentrate on one thing at a time otherwise I forget why I'm doing said thing. Makes for boring gameplay but that's made even worse by Beckett not getting his shit together
---
Yeah and most of them since the dawn of time have been related to button mashing whilst hopping servers
---
nothing new here
---
I thought it was today too, as this is day 1 of week three.
---
Ay only 5 hours after the update. I'll accept that I guess. This is Bethesda after all. :)
---
Even if they didn't  do anything else, a basic mail system would be useful...mail items to friends and even to yourself to move them around. 
---
They seem to be going more and more down the ESO style, they have a great mail system, would be nice to have it as well.
---
It's just a meme bro
---
Queen was suck ngl
---
That's exactly how I found out! My teammate shared it just as I was in the middle of topping off rads, all of a sudden no rads at all. I've switched to a gamma gun more recently I got a reduced weight one so it comes in at less than a pound in weight, handy for when I need it.
---
I honestly didn’t even check when I bought mine so I wasted the gold on the lower tier lining mods!  😂😂😂 I guess I just assumed I’d need them.  Focus blindness 🤯
---
They only "fix" the widely known dupes, there are always more waiting for their turn in the spotlight.
---
I would also agree with that.  Some of the challenges, while I appreciate the free score aren't really something that you'd normally do, and are kinda useless.  Like "Build 10 walls, floors, etc."  I already made my base out how I want it, now you're just asking me to do mindless building...
---
I know for a fact the communist one can
---
Why downvote me? Team PvP options for PvP players doesn't have to affect you if you don't choose that option. Jesus.
---
Next time you see me online, check out my camp, I finally fancied up my rectangle
---
They said you could purchase it on the 14th. My bad you don't see them as being liars for, lying.
---
I think so,and if you buy the communist collectron  it can collect stims but it does take 500 atomic points
---
Oh shit nah . I thought you were talking about the bos update , yeah ima check that out definitely. Was really looking forward to cyberpunk but I guess ima have to wait to get that for next gen
---
Then sue them
---
We're reaching the point where for the last year people have been losing their daily challenges to this bug and ever since this season started there's been multiple threads a day either complaining about the bug or warning people about the bug and yet STILL somehow the same people are losing their challenges because they for whatever reason refuse to just log out for ten minutes.
---
This isn't some brand new bug sneaking up on people, unless yu're a brand new player or have never visited this sub before it's near impossible to not know it exists and yet people are still triggering it for themselves and then raging about it.
---
How DID your post get removed? That's BS, there's nothing wrong with your post at all.
---
So you spend the atoms you purchased for ranking up on cosmetics instead. When they do enable it, you'll buy even more atoms
---
Nice. I started a new character right when Fastnacht Day event was going on and settled my camp right next to Helvetia and would use my artillery on the super mutant spawns every single time. It was hilarious. I've also bombed nearby camps before, but usually just to the side so they'd scramble around having no idea what's going on lol.
---
At least they're not too expensive really! You'll make the Gold back in no time!
---
it's on bethesdas website but i literally just google 'file fallout 76 ticket' and it's the first result
---
I love spawning into West Tek and all the super mutants are standing around in their underwear and you can’t kill a single one of them.
---
Bloodied?
---
jesus christ
---
You got my vote this is what we need make the grind just bearable.
---
This isn’t the same as a time gate in a mobile game that you can’t finish a task until a set amount of time is passed.  
---
This isn’t a time gate, it’s a limited time event, which is very different. You can, if you wanted, sit down one day and grind out the entire event in 81 hours as one person did.  
---
Most people seem to be on track with finishing it on time, bugs not withstanding, so is it really stacked against the players if most people are going to be able to complete it without having to spend atoms?
---
"Then sue them" - Which Bethesda employee are you? Nobody would defend that sort of practice unless directly influenced. I mean, with a response like that, Henry, can you blame the entire gaming industry for thinking the Fallout 76 is a fucking joke?
---
Well that definitely doesn’t represent everyone . If you just add up what they made of physical copies at release then you will see it was a success and now with fo1st , they’re raking in the cash
---
Even Beckett's questline alone took me twice as long as the main one. Granted I didn't do any of the Settler missions because F#ck Paige. Rude bitch gave me nothing but sass when I was trying to help. So immediately sided with the Raiders and ever since have been telling the hunters to go f#ck up Foundation whenever I help Rocksy
---
Kevduit
---
Nice to meet ya, my names Todd. 
---
It’s like you’re looking for confirmation, then when given the most direct course of action based on your own words, you feel like I’m defending bethesda? You HAVE to be trolling.
---
Took back my downdoot. I know it's a meme. But hear me out.
---
I ran the pride flag aaaaaalll month and got asked maybe 6 times if i was gay. Spoiler: not. Interestingly enough though I realized how i was being perceived and interacted with was variant upon the flag tag. So.
---
Now that I've been made 1st hand aware of the culture in the game, i want to curb it.
---
I dont care if they are a flat-footed transexual pacifist with a spot on their lung..... If they are a team player they're an ace in my book. 
---
Dont mean to preach, would love your assist in making Appalachia the best in FO worlds!
---
Yes. Okay for collecting stuff but definitely the funniest to have at your camp.
---
I usually server hop till I see a few guys 100 plus or a server where a nukes been dropped.
---
My problem is my camp is right between the wayward and everytime my camp cant get placed I go see what stopping it and it's always the same sleeping bag crane sign stashbox
---
Yeah, I've only got, like, 9 mods unlocked, and all of them are either low-tier stocks or high tier scopes, neither of which are good for commandos. The mod rarity is my only gripe about the gun aside from the fact its main feature is useless on 95% of enemies even after Wastelanders dropped.
---
Except they’ll still offer the blueberries in a few days and at the same price.
---
Also, the store in this case is Bethesda.
---
Not by a chance. The actively searching for new methods because some people willing to pay real money for that kind of information.
---
I'll buy them
---
It’s all in your perks all damage out put all damage resistance nothing for or weight reduction don’t quit on pvp work to better your self
---
It's called a meta
---
Go outside maybe.
---
open a window at least 
---
get some air
---
Do the other companions have something equivalent to Daguerre's weapon case retrieval missions? Ive been keeping her around just for the more or less free legendary every couple days.
---
That is a potential aim, but it won't work on me, I have extremely focused interest in cosmetics. An undersized Red Rocket prefab and a Collectron for a faction I actively hunt as a Mistress of Mystery themed character are misses for me I'm afraid.
---
Thank you, I just filed one. It said you could attach multiple files but it only let me attach one. I put in the weeklys since theyre more important. fingers crossed but im not going to hole my breath im probably sol as is everyone else.
---
Ooh, what a good idea. All about int now.
---
I'm thinking Porkins from Star Wars.
---
Excellent way to explain it.
---
It blends with the texture of the putting green perfectly, in fact.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d4hvzg/pint_sized_slasher_knife_issue/
---
Lmao ok. Lunchboxes coming to the atom store soon then.
---
It even says it on the community calendar. On July 14th Rank Up purchasable with atoms for season 1. I mean ofcourse if it was out i wouldnt spend my atoms yet. But i figured i wouldve at least had the option to right now.
---
Wow never knew that, but I also never slept in papa bears bed either!
---
Its a simple request.  As such, its an upvote and a polite, simple request.   I am a HEAVY weapon build.  I LOVE the shower at the door!!  Thank you for that shower!!  Occasionally i switch to gunslinger build and i love the shower.   Starched genes to preserve your mutations and class freak to enhance them.   Thanks for the shower!   Lotsa peeps slinging insults about generic groups and character assassination and a lot of generalizations.   Thanks for the shower!   
---
Its your camp.  Do what u bloody well choose.
---
But surely i digress...   the initial request is simply that.....   thanks for playing!  My shower will be to the side.  No compelling reason for me to make you go thru a shower.   
---
Okay. Sometimes i am a dick and lock the ground-level door. That leaves access to only those that can JUMP or JET....   but thats only one crappy days of working at home....
---
Nope. One of the devs commented in another post. No fix for Adrenaline or SBQ crippling until update 21. Also you will still get Christmas and Halloween rewards in NW until update 21 as well
---
I've gotten a good selection of Ballistic ammo, and some basic weapons for scrapping. Don't think it'll break the ammo market though as its still too slow even if paired with the ammo maker and converter...but some will claim it will anyway.
---
Thank you man I appreciate the tips!
---
First haul:
---
.50 - 4
---
.308 - 5
---
.45 - 48
---

*while he's threatening to burn downy camp.
---
On nice one bud, I'm about to go online. Just waiting on my chippy.
---
It can be tricky to get your alt back onto that same server tho.
---
Mine is near the munitions factory and whenever I’m bored or someone has a defend the factory up I’ll just go throw a flare for my artillery and just watch the explosions happen it’s fun to do especially when you see one dead and then the body just goes flying again
---
&gt;" The revenge was glorious and I have no regrets."
---
No *regerts* and proud of it. That's how you do it.
---
followed by "by the by here's 30 gold bars"
---
I stopped playing about 3 weeks ago.  I logged in to do my daily chores and they hadn't reset.  And I just haven't bothered to log back in.
---
Where exactly is that location at on Update 6?
---
I have that exact setup in my camp.
---
Its a bit tricky to place them and sometimes i have to go sideways throught the door but it looks cool
---
Nope it's random. Since writing that I got a pool cue and 23 5mm ammo.
---
The only 4 options you have with him are Scrap, Junk, Chems &amp; Alcohol or Ammo &amp; Weapons.
---
Many things in life I fear I am destined to never understand. Bethesda math is one of them.
---
You're safe at your camp. There are locations throughout Appalachia that have the ability to take over for yourself and use to obtain resources.
---
When you find one you'll have to clear the area of enemies and then pay about 20-30 caps to own the area.
---
Some of these are very useful, such as the Ammo Factory in the Northeast portion of the map.
---
If you're still near Flatwoods, I recommend taking the Sunshine Meadow's Farm Workshop as it's nearby, towards the river on the west. Once you own it, you can use it to produce nonperishable food items. Good way to experience your first workshop and how they function.
---
Considered, yes.  Perhaps someone aborted it early because they were aware of the discrepancy in the timeline.  Or maybe the whole time-slowing aspect was just implausible in a real-time game, much like what happened with VATS.
---
Also +3 CHA is not to be sniffed at when selling to Vendors! I still carry the USSS one, can always slap it on if the extra DR is needed!
---
I've never seen that before, sucks that they add cool stuff with a small window to get and then it's gone for maybe forever.
---
Sorry to hear that :(
---
FR sent 😁
---
Nah, I go Vanguard, so my primary effects are a lot more available. Particularly interested in Anti-Armor or Two Shot, since I'm not a fan of Junkies despite my use of chems.
---
On ps4 get spotify and use the fallout playlist. Much more comprehensive than what fo76 has.
---
I have my camp up by the crater and use my artillery to take out super mutants, mirelurks, and scorched that spawn nearby
---
&gt; it's just an empty public world.
---
Did you actually think you would get a server in a rack dedicated to you like all the time? Naturally its just a pool of instances set aside and refreshed whenever someone leaves before it gets dropped back in the available pool.
---
Love that spot. There’s water too.
---
Same. I need 18 more ranks for the stars and planets wallpaper and I'll be good without using atoms for the rest. I'm online right now and still not working so they either forgot, its bugged, or its not coming active until 8pm est.
---
Haven't had it rain yet, but yeah I have that same issue regularly, would be great if that was part of the fix.
---
You on an AMD card? Think Bethesda had said they'd recognised a problem with them.
---
And your experience has more relevance than mine? Whether or not people put traps or decontamination showers in their camp is their business. If you feel it’s malicious towards your build then tough shit. There is no ‘guise’ and anyone can play the game any freakin way they want to. No one is obligated to cater to your needs.
---
This game is just too slow with updates. 
---
The atom store screaming eagle skin still hasn't been fixed after a week. Adrenaline perk is still broken. Scorchbeast Queen is still bugged.
---
People who are rich tend to be people that avoid being ripped off.  At least the ones that stay rich.
---
It’s just green usually. Use the cycling lights to make your vendors glow different colors. Attach a cycling light to the ceiling, attach a wire from it to your vendor, change the color of the light to the one you want, then move the light inside the locker on the left side.
---
Secondary question: how long do you have to sleep to get the well-rested bonus?
---
I'd be all for this one.
---
And its perfect for a Legendary perk.
---
Oh yeah, I’m sitting at max now waiting on something I want 😂
---
I've only done it once because of the NPC stealing your weapon bug and I had just managed to pick up a TSE 50.cal that I REALLY like so didn't want to chance it, and when I did do it, I virtually had to solo it as the 5 other players there were dropping like flies, it was not a fun first experience for me.......Also what do I do with another 4 treasury notes I have 546 atm and 7k bullion.....and not much I want to spend it on.....
---
Oh yeah I totally get what you mean ,they could have made it much better but... that's how I mitigate it :)
---
I’ve not had any luck either. I’ve not tried in a little while though, but when I was trying I had no luck. I’ll try again and let you know. Maybe we need let it cool down longer before going back to the location. IDK.
---
This is America
---
really easy path to just 'having' any valid camp item without having to build it at all! Not exactly game breaking for OTHER people but still easy hack.
---
I’m will be available to play too.
---
Lvl 25 now. 
---
Can play in like 19 hours time. If u are still up.
---
Hey! Did you manage to work it out? Wondering myself! Thanks.
---
- powerful auto receiver
---
- aligned long barrel
---
- forceful stock 
---
- quick mag 
---
- suppressor
---
- reflex sight
---
I think the fix for the ammo converter sliding mechanism is coming in the next patch I’m pretty sure it got mentioned
---
Nice. Im finishing my T-65 set tonight. Woop! Got all the weapons except the Gauntlet. Working my way through the armor one piece at a time, it's the rolling that's delaying things there.
---
Yeah just regular stim
---
It's high time Bethesda rewards players for not being a mutated degenerate.
---
I believe it's 30 seconds. You'll hear a little notification noise from the Pip-Boy, if I'm not mistaken. I usually hear it anyway.
---
Saying "do your job" is all well and good but have you ever tried herding cats it aint easy.
---
Is this a Karen of Appalachia :^3
---
I think they might have buffed the Wendigo boss, it took me forever to kill it recently and I do about 2-400 a shot that suckers tough now
---
Wait, just to get things straight, you left the extractors untouched for 3 hours, or you had been gathering from them for 3 hours?  
---
If the former is the case, the extractors only fill up to a certain point, lead 15, oil 5, acid 10 etc. etc. and they fill relatively quickly, so leaving them for several is not ideal.
---
If the latter is the case, ignore the above lol
---
Yeah I took a long break from 76 last summer , came back fall of 2019 and it still hasn’t returned . They may think what they do is a genius marketing scheme but I’d bet the #s would prove otherwise
---
I no point did I say any of that. I’m simply saying people intentionally do this, it isn’t just “someones playstyle.”
---
Reading is hard though.
---
I mean, lots of land, beautiful coastlines, one of the best prison systems in the world, pretty much entirely free higher education, ranked number four for overall quality of life (America is ranked 13th), economically stable, one of the safest countries in the world, it's a pretty damn great place. Plus, only about five million people all in all,  a very small fraction of what Americas population is
---
That garage will go perfectly with my red rocket/slocum joe diner.
---
You’ve been actively working on fixing the game since launch and still not there
---
My headcanon for why Davenport keeps asking for pictures of the same things over and over is because... well... he never actually receives them, lol.
---
Omg. I am going to do this 😆😆
---
My fav weapon in the game, but it'd be better if I didn't miss 95% chance first-time shots a lot.
---
Oh, thank you for this. I will try it!
---
I mean, the resources to max out a workshop aren't hard to do in game. It'd take less time to farm the resources and build to the build limit than to go digging into your save files and hashing something together to build the same items "for free."
---
I hear ya, logged on an hour ago and all of my dailies and all but 1 of my weeklies have autocompleted.
---
Were they hitting really hard as well?  Two lv 5 ghouls should take like 10min to kill a lv 200.  Just jump on a house or something.
---
Anyways yeah bugs abound in the game, but usually the unkillable mobs don't attack.  Rarely I found some that go invincavle for a bit but I run and re-engage and then they usually go down.
---
you can display quest items?...
---
I just drink the local cesspool water while I’m relieving myself in it. Get dysentery and parasites a lot though. Big whoop...fuel for the fire.
---
Yeah, workshops are really underpowered. They don't offer any benefit but they are fun to build up and I'd enjoy personalizing all of them.
---
Cool, I’m, CrumbBum3857, (different user name on reddit). I’d love some feedback; your camp is one of my all time faves.
---
You can check out mine. It’s newer, I cover a little bit of everything 76 related. Fisty McRib.
---
She still lands normally, she just can't be forced to land and stay there from being crippled.  The issue there is that to get her to land normally people have to stop standing on top of shit so her pathing works right.
---
I don't see why it can't be done, as an additional option. Games like ARK Survival let you play in a single player offline instance.
---
But I also realize that a game like ARK and this game are very different. So I can understand that, yes, FO76 needs to be online, private server or not
---
ITT: I got fucking wrecked by a prepubescent
---
First time PVP with no gear and you say it's shit? Get good SIMP
---
Edit: Thanks mate! glad someone understands
---
Not sure I understand your logic, but I do think the multiple posts are annoying.
---
I didn't personally worry too much about armor until level 40 or so, but picking up all you find and scrapping as much as possible for a slight chance to learn new mods. Other than that, the main quest will provide you plenty of armor for some time. Only later would I worry about legendary armor. That said, it's never too early to decide what you want to do with your build - whether you want to focus on power armor or regular armor, and what kind of weapon you like the most etc. Shotgun builds can be pretty powerful if you sink your perks into that kind of thing, I've seen a lot of people combine it with melee, but don't think that's necessary. 
---
Mostly, you should focus on figuring out what you like and go from there, that will really help you find a build. If you're not sure, you can always do a more general build and tweak it later. Some of the strongest/most overpowered builds are so-called bloodied, closely followed by junkie's, but anything will get you through in the end, especially if you're having fun with what you've got. 
---
If you want more specific advice around perks/specials and your build, pm me or just look around this subreddit or google fallout builds and you will find lots of great advice :)
---
don't forget gold bullion machine outside.
---
Yeah i saw that and included it as it was a good idea for it.
---
Xmas gifts? Really?!
---
oh damn, i have a 2* BE i was going to offer you but that'll be no good. I might have a 2* AAE somewhere on my mule but i'm not sure
---
At least yer honest
---
Yep! That's sad... I'm Fallout fanboy, however the "monwy-squeeze" mechanic that 76 is starting to have, is a little bit disappointing... But, it is what it is....
---
i think the logic was " why would they bother fixing issues if people just hurl money at them regardless"
---
you still have it or did something happened to it?
---
The people who are asking why they can’t buy ranks are likely the kinds of whales that didn’t want to do the dailies anyways, so for them, autocompletion doesn’t matter since they just wanted everything now anyways.
---
Aw you're too kind, and ain't that good! HaHa. I'll come and have a look yeah, would love to! You any plans for tonight? Could maybe do a Event ls Team or something later? Got some junk farming to do first unfortunately.
---
Herd mentality, strange in numbers, empath and inspirational.
---
Possibly someone on your team was sharing a perk card that increased reload speeds...but that is just a guess.
---
I'm aware but I got caught up in my quests and events that I just didn't touch them for a while.
---
The maker pretty much filled the gap between ammo I pick up and ammo I use.  I haven't had to make ammo for a long time now other than the daily challenge.
---
Starting??
---
Not as hard as thinking you’re the center of the Fallout 76 universe though I suppose. The bloodied builds are the butthurt wieners of  Appalachia.
---
I'm more of a static photographer.
---
It was aquaboy/girl perk someone shared 😋
---
I like the idea of scraping legendary
---
But I think a gem system would have been better then the current system with endgame gear.. allow us to take the effect off legendary drops and craft new ones
---
Herd mentality is sort of glitched in where it will ONLY show up if you are in a group. so effectively there is no negative side effect of that mutation right now.
---
this aged well
---
I’m online now but kind of AFK, getting ready for knee surgery on Thursday so trying to prep my house for crutch life, but will def be in and out!
---
I would think, even if you plan on buying levels, you would wait it out until the last week - make sure you only buy what you need.
---
Personally, I have no intention on buying levels - waste of real world money and now-harder-to-earn-in-game atoms.
---
It wasn't that evident before 😅
---
Why do you hate the bramin?
---
Whales, Simps.. what's the difference?
---
Now that Beth money is going to Belle Delphine
---
that's a good point.
---
I figured that's where you were going with it hahaha if you do have an AAE that'd be incredible! I'd love to meet up later tonight if you can find it.
---
*ur not supposed to have fun how am I supposed to make money when I can't sell my weapons for $300 on gameflip*
---
(ノ｀Д´)ノ彡┻━┻
---
the garage doors are in the walls section
---
It’s a meat product.  Do you have the herbivore mutation?
---
Check your mutations. Herbivore might be the issue
---
100%
---
Now I can get back to playing the game and spending more time on camp builds without feeling like I’m a failure if I can’t grind for two hours each day. Every day.
---
Someone with the guts to help!
---
No. Ai is too basic to understand charging weapons
---
I was looking for that reply.
---
Not disappointed. :D
---
I've always had it. They worked fine prior to patch 20.
---
raiders accept photos as well.
---
Not implying, already directly stated it &amp; am now re-emphasizing with more specific details. My field is human-computer interaction. I specialize in social interactions including gaming. So please spend a few minutes googling before you decide that your personal experience is identical to objective data about a large group of people... the world can be a surprising place upon closer inspection. ;)
---
HI WHALE! 🐋🐳🐋🐳
---
Cool, will give you a shout later then bud!
---
Moments like these remind me that there are good gamers out there and not everyone is toxic.  Thank you!
---
Only the shishkebab. The flamer is broken, unless that got fixed recently
---
Its easy with my Troubleshooters explosive Fixer with Vats Commando build
---
I did. thank you.
---
I guess, but they gave the bonus before. Maybe an undisclosed "fix" in patch 20.
---
I've been trying this at my camp, no go. I build a door, wall, light, wall decoration, nothing. I still have the 5 to get!
---
Hmm strange. Can you file a support ticket for me and send me the ticket number?  [http://help.bethesda.net/](http://help.bethesda.net/)
---
I’m surprised she doesn’t end her life story borrowing Bono’s line: “Am I bugging ya? I don’t mean to bug ya.”
---
I felt the same way.  Haven’t seen Davenport since.  I want to kill Ward but that MF gives me 8 script per daily so I haven’t, yet.
---
I see you are running a low Perception build
---
Sounds good man!
---
Is it an actual money squeeze?  Nothing is pay to win or even pay to play with this stuff.  It's mostly flashy cosmetics.  I've played 4 months now and haven't spent a dime since original purchase.  But then again, I don't have the FOMO gene.....
---
I once found a pitchfork with a flame mod on it, but I never bothered to check to see if it worked with this perk before scrapping it.
---
Now I'm interested in knowing if anyone else has tried it.
---
Every one of those posts I've read so far has stated as a disclaimer that they do not want to buy it (yet or at all) but are asking because bethesda said it would be done today. It's perfectly reasonable to ask why something that was scheduled for today is not out today
---
That’s cool - seemed like they were trying to teach you rather than hurt you.
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 You got me! 🤣🤣🤣
---
The 9 was a typo, since on my phone’s keyboard it’s right next to the zero. I blame my fat fingers for the typo... but I’m not sure who to blame for your stupidity.
---
I had NO idea you could place stuff in your C.A.M.P that you picked up exploring! I was collecting the bears and scrapped them all without realizing! My bf just said to 'scrap all junk' bears aren't junk!
---
&gt;Also Bethesda didn't make Doom/Doom Eternal.
---
A worrying amount of people believe Zenimax = BGS.
---
you know crits used to be random, right? you just shot a bunch and bam crits.
---
yep no worries, feel free to shoot me a pm if you have any trades :)
---
Right now, it isn't.. But with this new SCORE mode, that's the shape it's getting...
---
Good point , what would Super mutants do with caps anyway?
---
They are presumably hostile towards all factions so do they just trade amongst themselves?
---
No not yet they are coming with patch 22 in september
---
My understanding is that they fixed it.  Herbivore and Carnivore were supposed to double the effects of their corresponding products, including the buffs, but the alternate was supposed to be 0
---
So now, if you eat something like Cranberry Relish while using Herbivore you get 2x the bonus.
---
BUY ATOMS 🐳 BECOME A WHALE 🐋
---
Amen to that!!! 👍🏻👍🏻
---
I saw a post previously on here saying they are pushing that bit back
---
&gt; It'd take less time 
---
not even close.
---
What makes a tesla, specifically, good against other players? Sorry, I'm new to all this.
---
My only experience with pvp is being 1-shotted by some asshole before I server hop to get away from them.
---
I find her to be a nice addition to the radio.She’s not on the Three dog or Mr.New Vegas level,but she fits into the Appalachian setting quite well so I don’t mind.
---
They said they were delaying it for a bit
---
&gt;people take advantage of the pvp system
---
By using it?
---
Okay cool thanks
---
I still have it, and I’ve had it since the roxy was still a thing. Auto completes by just going to foundation. Not sure if you can still pick it up, but there’s one outside the fort where you turn in technica data.
---
I have both...i always have my 3*Furious ffr handmade and AA explosive fixer on me.  My third weapon is my 3* TS railway that put shit down quick.  Im a Stealth Vats Commando... shit is sick!
---
Lmfao I know exactly what you mean. It’s why I never beat it.
---
OK.... I have an RP comic book shop I have all magazines on display all teddy bears /plushies , and a few other bits and that maxes out my camp budget, it's a two floor 3x3x1 not very big at all compared to some camps I come across, the magazines alone take up like 20 % of budget, I also only have 3 missile turrets which also take far too much budget, yet I have 10k atoms that I've stopped spending as I can't use whatever I buy with them in my camp.
---
I was curious about this also when are the ammo converter updates coming in
---
Gotta burn Beth everytime they tell the CMs the wrong dates
---
Someone help me out here, when's update 21 planned for please?
---
If you don't mind living in the Ash Heap, there's a huge area of flat ground (with no grass) right near the Overseer's old house in Welch.
---
How do you change what you want your Collectrons to find?
---
I don't know. I didn't receive a PM from a moderator either.
---
Yeah I was wondering why I wasn't given the option to pay yet, like yeah I'm obviously not gonna pay rn but the option would be nice for people with busy schedules.
---
These are my main concerns too, endgame for me is just queen killings so these being addressed would be awesome
---
I've picked the lock on several supply drops, a couple as recent as this past weekend, and I've never gotten a bounty for it. Now I can't help but wonder whether the bounty is a bug or a feature. I get mixed signals from this game.
---
Great term to use for the players that support the game the most.
---
By the looks of it probably season 2 lmao
---
On the terminal attached to the station
---
people should be waiting until the last week or whatever to see how far they can get
---
Unless the realllllllly need that chicken coop
---
You can try to use the camera to search for the body.
---
🤣🤣🤣 why does this seem so true lmao
---
If I stand at my window with the curtains and push forward I start to slide upwards then fall through the window to the floor outside.....
---
It really does suck when that happens. I tried to loot a wolf yesterday and his corpse just cartwheeled into the wind.
---
SIMP furry death claw
---
I've had it happen. When joining with the second character you get "timed out connecting to server" then when you finally do connect everything is gone.
---
The only safe way to do it solo is to buy a second key, run the exe a second time and sell your other account stuff. Then rejoin with another character and but it back from your second account.
---
A good solution for all of the lost SCORE Points due to autocompletion would be atoms to purchase the missed levels. I missed 7500 points today , (screenshot &lt;1 hour into it with more missing challenges than active). An equivalent in points would be nice since the SCORE can't be added and the challenges can't be reactivated.
---
Yes.  This is not a compelling gameplay mechanic IMO.
---
because i hate these constant moo sounds next to my camp.   
---
I had my camp on the same position before wastelanders but since wastelanders arrived my artillery fulfills it's purpose. I call it a moo-silencer.
---
Knew I should hold on to my atoms for something!
---
Find yourself a cheap Troubleshooters or Vampire weapon and go to town. 
---
Also Troubleshooters armor and super stims
---
Was he “wanted?” Is that how it worked? Could you damage the camp?
---
Well said. Yet there are people on here today spamming reee let me pay $100 to c complete the journey Bethesda OMG it's a broken promise I wanted to pay!. Like what the actual F, I smh in disbelief at the state of gamers whom supposedly have logical human minds after reading such things.
---
Only saw him once across from pumpkin jack's house. I had no alcohol at the time so good to know what happens. Bobby pin guy I have bumped into about 6 times and he always makes me regret giving him the pins. That's the first time I've had anything good.
---
Doesn't help when it ragdolls beneath the map
---
BrUh YoU SiMp lol 😂 I’m a whale also
---
Try mashing the interact button, that fixed her for me
---
They gave us the ammo converter instead...🤭
---
I’m also confused?
---
Single shot
---
Please support our cause!
---
onlyfans.com/Todd-Howard
---
Quote me where what I said equates to “I’m the center of the Fallout 76 Universe.”
---
I think that is just south of the forest junkyard workshop. Good spot for firecap and snap tails.
---
Yep I’m donating to that right now daddy Todd needs it
---
Update 21 is currently planned for August 4.
---
Well I put a better a better receiver on it
---
Ima need that chicken coop for my gramps tho. He ain't getting younger.
---
I’m having to marvel at the irony of it all. This sub used to light up like the Fourth of July at any hint of Bethesda trying to introduce Pay2Win mechanics and micro transactions. And now it’s lighting up because people aren’t yet able to use the micro transaction to buy ranks, the very definition of Pay2Win.
---
Pardon my ignorance, but what does the term 'whales' mean in this context?  I haven't heard it before?
---
Yep. I’ve experienced it a few times now. Not only do I complete the challenge, the blue pop up doesn’t actually pop up, and it shows it’s competed. And I have have been keeping track of my SCORE, so I’m not getting “stealth” gains either.
---
Picked up the garage the raider collectron and the vending machine finally had a use to spend some atoms
---
If I'm throwing money away it might as well be on some feet pics
---
There are both daily and weekly objectives that require you to level up in order to earn S.C.O.R.E. points for advancing in The Legendary Run, and leveling up can be a slog without boosts to experience earned. Every little bit helps. I know you're going for the badass angle, but this just reeks of fragility.
---
If you stand in front of someone when they are very clearly trying to kill a mob and not fight you it’s uncool. Engaging in fair fights is fine. They are really cool
---
Rwar oh! My arm!?
---
Blergul ah! How you hurt!?
---
Survival needs to return.
---
I just switched from Junkie to Bloodied.  I had a great time with Junkie but like you I needed a change.
---
I was melee junkie build with additions to: Alcohol, daddy-o, daytripper, mentats and psycho.  I took the hit on psycho (loss of str and dmg resist) because I pop a psycho before a fight and I have so so many in my stash.  Alcohol is great to get addicted to (uh...in game) because there are different buffs for each type but the withdrawal effects are the same.  I used whiskey for the +2 Str.
---
You are going to have a lot of fun with Junkie.  You trade damage potential for tankiness.  Or that is my experience at least.
---
I ran 1 hand junkie melee with power armor and kept a Junkie recon rifle for distance plinking.
---
Enjoy it!  I had a lot of fun with it.
---
It was probably a stimpack diffuser based on your description, and yeah only some things can be put in there. Most atomic shop things can't unfortunately unless its a skin because I've got tons of cool masks id love tidisplay but they're from atom shop.
---
That makes sense, thanks. Was good while it lasted.
---
I will give this an attempt at soon as I have access to FO76 again in 1 month and a half
---
Tesla rifle will arc to targets 
---
Shoot at the ground the Tesla will arc to your enemy 
---
Now add an automatic barrel its kinda op or even better have an *"rare"* explosive legacy variant even more op
---
Thanks for the update! Appreciate your service! *Patriotic Salute*
---
I was wondering the same, it got delayed after all.
---
I can second that motion. I very much enjoy survival for the open PVP and difficulty. Helps separate new players who want to avoid PVP from those who love to PVP.
---
I’m not ignoring anything. It’s not an advertised benefit. 
---
If you don’t think the sub is worth it with current benefits, don’t renew. It’s as simple as that. Why spend money on something you don’t think is worth your money. If they add benefits you want, buy it then. 
---
It’s not complicated.
---
Never drop! Put the stuff into a world container such as a suitcase and it works 99.99% of the time.
---
You almost killed me. Soda and sinuses don't mix.
---
They took whatever junk she was carrying.  Always fast travel back to base to dump any junk or any train station in a pinch.  It does give you a warning message about pvp when claiming workshops.
---
I still have it.
---
Bethesda can't ever do anything right. First we can't buy it out at launch... What game maker doesn't want money, then you screw it up when you say we can buy it out.... More info in the coming days...... Seriously what kind of response is that. Bethesda can't get an update right to save its life.........you always screw up every update to Fallout 76. I have a bout had it with your complete incompetence. You must use the A and B team devs on better games and fallout 76 gets the C Team.......really what else can you screw up
---
Yup. **always** log into adventure mode *before* going into the shop following an update/reset
---
&gt; Naturally I told her about claiming workshops and how some have better payouts than others
---
but you didnt mention the most important part...
---
Oh man I dont want to get people banned 😅 I just want my girl to be able to enjoy this game without being harassed.
---
It is nice to see justice carried out though in your case.
---
I tried with the flamer in Project Paradise last night, and it does nothing to heal the animals.
---
Shinny red buttons, good for. For. Good?
---
Then it's still broken lol. For sure the shishkebab works
---
Flamer doesn't work, least not at Fasnacht and not at Project Paradise last night.
---
I agree! Maybe Bethesda forgot and maybe they will bring it out tomorrow.
---
As for the score issues getting fixed, I have no idea
---
But don't buy ranks until the very end of the season, get as much as you can done before that
---
The atom cost is always 150, but the amount of score required increases with each rank
---
So buying higher ranks is a better value :)
---
If saying that helps you sleep at night then great. For someone who claims to be a specialist, you don't seem to know much, if anything. Linking to Wikipedia, thinking a few mins of googling will give someone all the facts. Calling facts you don't like "opinion". I have all the facts. I've told you the real facts and not been disingenuous like you. Didn't think you were a sensitive snowflake 🤔
---
Action girl works for me.
---
The delay is quite clearly done in recognition that it would be in severely poor taste given multitudes of users are being cheated out of score due to the auto completation bug.
---
To then say "oh but you can buy ranks with Atom" is not the sort of statement they wish to make.  I for one am happy they have done this, you can buy out the ranks once they have patched out the auto completion bug, and sorted some form of compensation to the players most likely in some form of extension on double score, or extra challenges.  It is only a matter of time before you can buy your way to 100.
---
If you placed a deposit on a new vehicle and it was a few days late arriving, what would your response be?
---
*They lied to us!  The vehicles are never coming!*
---
Sometimes I get massive lag when butchers bounty activates good.
---
I have 10'000 atoms that I didn't bought and I want that captain cosmos power armor so and I won't log on daily cause of a grind.
---
Indeed. And this was a good lesson in that. However since she hadn't explored very far and didnt have many options as far as fast traveling back to continue exploring, I suggested claiming the workshop for repairs and a free fast travel point. She was ambushed while in the repair station so there was not much she could have done, not that she could have really fought them anyway.
---
No Butcher Pete, no Rocket 69 (both are on Spotify)... What uncultured heathen made this playlist?!
---
The only point of workshops is griefing suckers.  I don’t grief myself, but the payoff to PvP exposure for taking workshops is terrible.  I only take them when I have an exit strategy and I have a reason other than gathering resources.
---
It's just a leftover from the Event that has no use and IIRC has weight so it's best to.just drop it. You can also keep extra Meat Cannisters you picked up during the Feeding the People  public Event but they weight 1 lbs each do people drop them right away after the Event is over.
---
I just started playing the other day and maybe 5 minutes into exploring I got mauled to death by some dogs. Blew through all the stimpaks they gave me too. I honestly just restarted. Not a good start.
---
It’s a common term, used often in mobile games, to describe the spending habits of a player.  
---
So, for example, if a new unit was released in a game, they are the kind of person to drop thousands of dollars on the loot box to get the unit maxed out. some players might spend a bit of money, others just try to get by with the free currency they earn. 
---
So in the case of FO76, I’m sure many people might consider spending the cash when we are at the end of the event to get any last levels they missed, but only someone who basically doesn’t care would spend the money now when we still have 8 weeks to go
---
Fair enough :) just wanted to provide the information, some people have wondered about buying them but not considered the increasing score cost
---
This glitch also happens if you're using a workbench at someone's CAMP and they leave and yeah the only fix is to log out.
---
Lvl 200 in Power armor getting killed by a lvl 5 scorched? Nooooooob git gud rekt kid xdxdxdxd (sarcasm)
---
It even will tell you this leaves you open to PvP. I'm all for players not being jerks, and this was a dick move, but it's also part of the game and the only way people PvP aside from NW now.
---
The post telling him to report them is laughable.
---
Just SW of westek is a tourist info stop with a bathroom. South of the forest junkyard workshop is a road that crosses a river, flat land on either side. The main road into watoga has a cave underneath and flat space all the road top.
---
Are you a bloodied build too?
---
People who spend a lot of money
---
😂 that's a good point, but to be fair I didnt think the PVP, if anyone attempted it, would be a full squad of max levels against one level 25
---
indeed
---
Or is he?
---
No you're right, its even worse than a mobile game because this is a triple a fallout game from a developer who should know and in practice be better. The purpose of the legendary run is to be a constant in the background content drip feed and you are fooling yourself if you think it wont be cyclical. 
---
Even then, you are incorrect. Every major system in the game is designed to squeeze time and reward pellets over consistent daily time input. You can grind out 81 hours if you like, but that is an unreasonable solution to a problem everyone across the spectrum experiences who have jobs/families/other priorities besides gaming. 
---
- Scrip caps (daily)
---
- Reputation (daily)
---
- Bullion (weekly from smiley)
---
- Treasure notes (daily)
---
- SCORE is rewarded in majority by specific tasks (Daily and weekly)
---
- Various tokens that you input grind and get a token like the mr fuzzy costume. 
---
- Soon to be released legendary perk and respec system perk coins.
---
You guys let people into your homes? I put a vending machine outside next to an outhouse and a single water pump. I am very charitable, but I'm not letting nasty adventurers into my kitchen.
---
Ah Butcher Pete is one I'm not overly keen on! 😁 So no complaints here 😅
---
I used to get legendary shiskebabs all the time and I always scripped them out, but now that they've buffed the flame effect, I haven't seen a legendary one drop since!
---
It is definitely a heavy split in favor of nice players over mean players.
---
[Yes, I am](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3c147fe&amp;w=sf2pd2pk2pl2pp2eu0c72ir2ib3a72an2am2ar2ao0a11lu2l71lt2lv2la2&amp;m=51c249f8&amp;am=18-18-18-1823-182638&amp;wp=w5&amp;wm=1428).
---
level doesnt matter..
---
Ah thank you for explaining.  I also just looked it up online.  Never knew this was a thing.
---
Oh heavens, you have to wait a few extra days for the promised land!  What is this world coming to?
---
Yeah that might take a while
---
Yeah, she's bugged. It happened to me for months, I couldn't complete the quest. (I had gotten distracted from turning it in by something-- probably Project Paradise or SBQ. Never turned it in, and it wouldn't work when I went back.) I finally was able to do it after they added the Reject Quest option.
---
Reject the quest in the Pip-Boy Data menu, and then wait a day, and do it again.
---
No i never said that. I want it to stay lowkey.
---
Out of curiosity what platform are you playing on? And what's your Internet Speed? Since I have never experienced this issue myself I'm starting to wonder if it's a platform specific issue or it has to do more with the quality of a player's internet connection (since this is an Online game) that triggers this issue.
---
As much as I'm enjoying the good stuff, the cynic in me thinks that it's a way of clearing out our atoms before they implement the purchase of legendary run levels. That way we have to buy them instead of using our horded ones.
---
I usually only claim them for ammo or steel to make ammo, but since she had travelled so far from her base and doesnt have many caps for fast traveling back I suggested repairing her equipment before moving on, which is about the only use she could get out of MT Blair at this point anyway.
---
What? Lol
---
Ohhhhh wow you actually did save me I was thinking about buying them just for that reason of being possibly silent thanks for debunking it
---
Or toss frags!
---
Did you know there’s no way to tell when a person got the reward?
---
Nope not yet
---
Like i dont want people to know about the game being good again because that will attract toxic people. Like only tell the non toxic people or something idk.
---
Oh yeah you get mobbed in seconds
---
It may just be me, but I dont usually attack people below lvl 50 in workshops unless they start the battle. Not much reward for destroying some newbs imo.
---
I think some people want to buy their way to rank 100 because they feel that they’ll be able to brag to their friends.  People pay money for other people to get Xbox achievements under their account and that has no effect.
---
It's almost like he purposely omitted it.
---
Speaking of which, another bonesaw needs your rescue. I’ll add it to your overflowing quest log.
---
SAME
---
Egghead boosts intelligence which helps with XP and thus with S.C.O.R.E. with class freak, it is only -1 STR and END but you can drink a tea to bring it back up. 
---
I drop rifleman when I am farming meat or flora so that is fine. You can the most out of the first star of each rifleman so if you wanted, you could have a 1* master and a 3* and switch it out that way, which is what I do.
---
Yeah it's north east of your camp device..
---
Usually within 10ish yards of it. The radius of the camp build circle is how far away.
---
I'm not too sure on distance, idk how to measure in the game.
---
Gotta loot fast and fun away
---
There are many games that have implemented those types of activities in the past, Everquest, World of Warcraft. 
---
Even modern games like Dead by Daylight slow down progression of their battle pass by not putting out the full archives out (and they also have a paid battle pass and the option to buy levels of the pass.
---
That’s the system that was designed because it’s a multiplayer, online game.  If you don’t like it, don’t play It.
---
You’ll lose 1k rep with whoever you don’t choose (or both if you take all the gold for yourself). Personally, I would recommend the raiders due to a special plasma rifle you can find during the raid.
---
And for building, I saw a video around a month ago about a cave you can build in that has an acid deposit that you can tap from, if I find it again, I’ll link it here for you
---
Nobody said it was complicated, if anything you r complicated the definition of advertising. It’s right there in writing.  I enjoy the current benefits. Don’t low key advertise features with no intention of following through that’s all. And that’s what they did.
---
You set her up to get killed, that's not cool man, not at all.
---
I don't care about the auto completion bug, I don't have that issue and even if I did I would have still bought it out. I don't care that other players have their feelings hurt if someone buys it out... Bethesda continues to screw up this game every single time they update it. They made a dumb choice, it's not my problem if you can't afford to buy it out or don't want to spend the money on it.
---
Make sure you do all quests for both sides before you choose. Nothing changes really but just remember to take all of it at the end.
---
Unfortunately there’s no really good caves for building in, as much as I would 100% build in a cave too.
---
No extra weight fortunately, but cant put it in a display case so it does seem pointless. I'll throw it in the stash to stay forever, at least now when my guy wants to pull out a weapon he has to dig through piles of mutagenic waste and sticks buahaha
---
How old are you kid? Lol
---
It a fallout game , it one of the biggest gaming franchise... don’t confuse this for an early access game or even an indie game 
---
And because it a triple A franchise the whole point of this game is to make money.. they going to push it down people throat til it popular
---
Sometimes you gotta learn lessons the hard way 😂 but obviously that wasnt my intention
---
What exactly does the raider collection collect? I’m debating if I should get it when I log on
---
????????????
---
It hurts HerzoginChloe because she wants to be the first to have all of the legendary run rewards.
---
I may have had a stroke reading this.
---
Fireproof only works on one of my characters, for some strange reason.
---
Ita usually the same ones who cant/wont pay Bill's or have enough money to buy their kids food or clothes
---
I'm kinda surprised you didn't warn her - if I was her, I'd be pissed at you, not the players who killed her.
---
You don't get mad at the alligators, you get mad at the guy who told you to go walk through the swamp.
---
*such English*
---
Yup. Just got ☝️ on my main :D oh well.. it was fun while it lasted. Kinda completed everything in the game anyway haha
---
play with fire and you get the horns
---
I use BE 15 cr and yes I will probably never use it once I find a fixer with good rolls
---
Looking for an answer also.  I have a pretty nice garage set up already with RR doors.  Thought about just using this new pre-fab one but don't want to lose a ton of budget.
---
Not as good as you would think.  I have that exact setup and used to carry it as a first shot / sneak attack weapon.  It just hangs on my wall under my mounted Radstag now.
---
XP/SCORE is what I'm primarily after these days, so I think I'll add Egg Head. 
---
And good advice on the Rifleman. Primarily was wondering whether to drop Tank Killer or a Rifleman in those circumstances. You're advocating for the latter.
---
Lmao the fasnacht collectron is loud af I’m glad I didn’t get it too
---
I do but I run with explosive ones.  They always break at bad times.  Usually fix them but sometimes events keep popping and queen fights etc..
---
Have only broken 3 of the 5 at one time so far
---
I mean, she can read, so she was warned to some extent 🤷‍♂️ although I dont think she cares too much either way
---
Just drop your portable camp
---
I envy you amazing CAMP builders...I am in awe at what you can achieve...it seems like you guys have unlimited CAMP budgets and ability to display anything/anywhere!
---
I built my CAMP, was a major pain, can't display all my treasures due to CAMP budget, and after finally finishing, a friend came along and asked, "Hey, there is an Aluminum deposit right next to your base, why didn't you put a resource extractor there?"  Well, I didn't see it...and no way in heck I am tearing this thing down and moving few feet to get that deposit in my CAMP build area...argh!...every day, I pass by that deposit and kick myself!
---
There's definitely limitations. 
---
Try a toxic goo?
---
Sure, maybe that argument would fly if this wasn't a live service game with a steady stream of free updates with zero of the added content locked behind a paywall. They need continued monetary support, so unless you want to start paying for every bit of added "dlc" microtransactions and their subscription are how it's going to be done. You also aren't being forced to pay to enjoy the game to it's fullest. You aren't being forced to pay anything additional at all. If you can't enjoy the game to it's fullest without all the optional cosmetics then I'm sorry, but that's all on you. Maybe go play single player games because it doesn't sound like the model most online games have are for you
---
play with the bull* you get the horns 
---
Plus if I did get hit I'm happy I gave out so many weapons to game pass players
---
Yeah not all junk/items can be displayed in the cases. The biggest offender for me was JANGLES! He's too big to fit in the display case lol I spent so long searching the wasteland finding him, and was disappointed he could not be displayed.
---
Yes, there have many many people posting about this today. Kinda surprised you didn't see any of the posts.
---
What about in interiors though? Especially The Whitesprings Workbench area.
---
How uncivilised of you.
---
I use orbital strikes.
---
Yes. I for some reason feel that coming. You remember how they gave us that atomic shop set because faschnaut was delayed...
---
I haven't launch the nuke yet but I felt like I've experienced everything
---
About time I guess, they do take their sweet time.
---
I've been married for over 20 years....yeah, I suspect she cares.
---
A whole weekend to have fun with legacy's
---
How do you know they have no intention of following through? There was no timeline on those items. As I said, they still have recently reaffirmed talks about mod support coming (later this year I assume). 
---
Their PR and communications function are pretty terrible. I just think it’s a stretch to say they have no intention of offering new features.
---
Advertising has a clear definition. This isn’t it.
---
Bought this but can’t find the door to it in the build menu ? Of door is built in how do you shut it.
---
Nope 😜
---
Oh man.... Is this gonna come up again in a few years when we are in an otherwise harmless argument?
---
Yeah. Also if your build allows for it, beery mentats boosts your intelligence. Also Brain Fungus soup and Cranberry Relish. I am level 330 and with all that, I can level up 1x a day still.
---
Well said!
---
Out of the frying pan, into the bull
---
I’ve played since day one and it didn’t use to be a problem.  But now there is a certain percentage of players who only want to hunt vulnerable players.
---
I’d have no problem if people were fighting over something useful, but junk is way too easy to gather in other ways.  If workshops gave off gold bullion, then I wouldn’t judge people for fighting over them.
---
While legal in the game, killing a really low level character for their junk is petty.  It’s probably the only thing that makes their two inch dicks get hard.
---
Don't be shocked if it does.....;-)
---
Ammo converter update should be update 21, in 3 weeks.
---
Play with the horns and your going to get burned
---
"finallyyyyyyy". I can hear it now.
---
Daw not the handmade rifle.  
---
BUT ITS GOLD BABY WOOO.
---
I haven't experienced this yet I'm at rank 35-37 idk
---
That's is completely dependent on your play style and weapons. 
---
Stealth sniper? Rifleman
---
Run and gun? Commando
---
I went with raiders but the settlers have much better characters. The raiders are straight copy and pasted out of borderlands lol
---
Awww Gary
---
not on right now to check but is it not kill certain giant monsters?
---
There is a video on how to trade the non tradable gear but never tried it myself and dont no if it still works
---
Thanks for the update
---
I'd better get her some flowers then...
---
Can you get Raydodendrons at Lowe's?
---
What do you mean it didn’t grant score? What 3 giant enemies did you kill?
---
Out of the bull, into the frying pan.
---
I chose raiders for the fun factor. Settlers always get snippy when you make jokes. Their holier-than-thou attitude is a real mood killer. 
---
When you build a base, look at fo76map.com and find a resource to build on. It will be a constant source of a certain component for you which is great. I’m on a lead deposit in the Mire on a cliff. It’s nice.
---
Yeah, the Fasnacht one was a mistake.
---
Would be a hell of a lot more convenient than White Springs.
---
i know what the sayings are
---
I'm gunna presume this is on a console coz I never come across nab cakes on PC ?
---
Yes, on bethesda launcher F76 is working correctly
---
Riflemayne
---
Oh it’s been a blast, dropping low level gear to myself has made the beginning a little smoother than my main account. I still use my main for the repeatable xp challenge but it’s been so much fun re exploring the wasteland again and trying a completely different build, transitioning from a tank heavy gunner to a stealth unarmed/commando makes it feel like a completely different game.
---
if your not sniping run commando, assuming you have the materials to back up the extra bullet usage.  if your a broke bitch in mats run rifleman until you can afford to run commando
---
When I was a low-level scrub (5-15 give or take) I was doing a power plant workshop defend. Doing ok till some lvl 200+ jackass runs up and was either mutated or modding. He was jumping like 50 ft in the air and shooting me from long range with some 1 shot fire and rads gun
---
Hmm I was originally thinking one of the plans of your choosing plus my JE lever. If that’s not enough I’d understand.
---
Depends on your desired play style, as others have said do all the quests first.
---
I choose Settlers for the Chinese Stealth Suit, this has kind of been game changing for nuke zones (I'm not a PA user) and other high rad areas, inc water, like a hazmat suit with added damage resist. You'll be paying about 2500 ish bullion I think for both suit and helmet if you don't finish settler's quest line, although the helmet is purely cosmetic and I never use it.
---
Sorry I'm not going to accept your bullshit premise that all time and effort has equal value and should be rewarded equally. Have fun living in your fairytale land. Wish I could too, but I'm stuck here in reality.
---
Their dialogue with you is hilarious. I have so much fun stealth hitting them with my gun and listening to them. “Here human, human, human. I’ve got a treat for you”. I’m like of course. Ammo, caps etc. here take a .45 to the leg.
---
This is excellent. I missed 6 days worth of dailies from a trip into nowhere helping mom move from nowheretown to nowhereville, so now I can get caught up!
---
(Obviously fixing this for players who lost thousands of points is more important, so I hope the hotfix is proper here.)
---
You’ve been banned
---
Complaining about a company putting profits first? Sounds awfully communist.....
---
&gt; Unless this is some kind of engine limitation, I don't get it. 
---
You just explained it yourself.
---
The more complicated an asset is the more resources it takes to render it in game.  Even for it's size the bungalow is a relatively simple object compared to the rest of those.
---
There's two ways Bethesda can restrict just how difficult to render your camp is. The first is to take intensive objects and give them outsized budget costs so you can only cram so many in before running out of space.  This is how the game used to work and why even just placing lights used to eat chunks of budget.  Instead of doing that they moved over to putting a cap on how many each of certain item groups you can place.
---
And yet you're so keen to reward this behavior from them with purchases.
---
my internet is 30 mega and I play on PS4.
---
first of all, good
---
second of all, brace for all the "i was banned for no reason!" posts
---
So similar to feed the people?
---
I had this the other day. 'Very well rested - +50% xp' definitely. I thought it was because I'd rested regularly or something but now I think maybe it was in a lunchbox after all.
---
Just be aware that the "lag" you see every time you log into a server or access your stash box is proportion to the amount of stuff/unique items stored in your Stash Box. People have seen increase performance when they dropped stuff out of their Stash Box such as Junk, Misc items, Holo Tapes, Notes etc. because it's simply less stuff the server has to keep track of for you.
---
Hit the bull with a frying pan, fall into Todd.
---
What gets me is when damage displays and the damn thing no sells 3 to 4 thousand damage when it's only supposed to have 2,700 hp.
---
Couldn't have happened to a nicer group of people....
---
I bet they’re delaying it so they can figure out who cheated tbh
---
Yep that's what I got from them as well,  shows a message about known automcompleting issues. Says that they cannot award/edit score. At the bottom of the tickets says it will automatically be closed in 4 days if no further response received. They can't/wont do anything about it basically.
---
Yup like take the *"L"* like an man 😂
---
I'm not sure if my main was hit but my burner account got the email
---
It’s a fallout 1st thing bruh. Gotta pay for it. Worth it if this is one of your main games
---
If another team member has the empath mutation you get 25% damage reduction. If you have the empath mutation and are on a team, then there is no downside since you count as a team member. If you also use Class Freak, then you get a damage reduction bonus from your own mutation. Thus, the empath mutation combined with Class Freak is a good replacement for Lone Wanderer, at least as far as damage reduction is concerned.
---
Do you have speed demon mutation and were on a public team? Someone could have been sharing the "Strange in numbers" perk which increases positive effects of mutations by 25%
---
I haven't tested personally, but I've heard that perk is a bit messed up as it will boost the effect beyond 25% the more people you have on your team. So a full team plus that perk could be the cause lol
---
I do. I'm just asking for more locations for it to be:
---
Good point
---
Shhhh I’m gonna get in one way or another
---
I am nice (ノ｀Д´)ノ彡┻━┻
---
 many low levels running around with glitched lasers and death claw mask
---
He's joking about how pointless atoms are
---
Yeah! That's my camp! Glad you liked it!
---
They'll get it figured out in about 8-9 weeks but something else will prove problematic so it'll get delayed again, at this point they need the people from eso or any other online game, their immeasurable incompetence is astounding at this point like we'd have a better chance of a room full of chimps and typewriters writing the complete works of Shakespeare before bethesda figures out how to pull their well emplaced heads from their asses
---
I noticed tonight my health was constantly lowering, is it because I was a conduit? 
---
I hid in the shack after being conduit for all 3 and my health just kept going down. I even closed the door so no robots could get in but it kept lowering till I died
---
It was a toxic goo
---
To quote Syndrome, "When everyone is super, no one will be."
---
Can confirm, they will even refund you the difference if you go to FO1st and buy stuff thinking you have the discount on
---
Is this a floor or is it for outside buildings?
---
I'm going to review your build and try to parse your suggestions. You made a lot of great ones, so thanks for that.
---
According to Global Market Insights, Inventory Management Software Market size was estimated at over USD 2 billion in 2017, growing at a CAGR of over 6% from 2018 to 2024. So the use of [IoT in inventory management](https://www.hakunamatatatech.com/our-resources/blog/inventory-management-for-enterprises/) could be the next big thing for enterprises and the trend is all set to continue. 
---
Out of the pan, into the bull fry
---
would piss me off seeing locked boxes everywhere
---
Ohhh haha nah that’s not gonna happen.
---
No more $300 legacy's that's all I have to say
---
We’re always on Jet, hence the lag.
---
Yup, and then regale Reddit with tales of boredom and having no end game content while waiting for the season to end.
---
You can do the stealth suit quest and still side with raiders.
---
When i started playing i skilled for sniper All rifle perks. Then i found that Boring and I Fell in love with heavy weapons. Then i found that also Boring, and I skilled for commando. Then i....
---
In the end it didnt matter as i realized skillpoints come and come and come and you will have everything skilled by time and even have many unspent points due to dont know what to skill.
---
Lately i found a Instigating +40%bashing damage combat shotgun, modded it automatic with Reflex sight and now every skill and build has become obsolete as its "magic" and I can oneshot 11 scorched ghouls in a row with vats.
---
Yeah kind of
---
Um no it happens all the time on my ps 4 and one seccond later i can come back on
---
Commando if u want more damage
---
If you're not on a team and have class freak maxed, I believe it doesn't show up because class freak makes it so that Herd Mentality has no negatives (game rounds negative special points to 0).
---
If you join or create a public team, you'll see it under effects again
---
Do you have any of the other collectrons? Because scrap/junk may be from the scrap collectron
---
Feel sorry for the poor saps who pay real money for game items, life's too short tbh.
---
I agree that buying score isn’t the way, but they did announce that it would be today. I wish they would make good on their announcements.
---
If they put more scrap benches then you won’t have to buy their scrap kits.
---
But with way better rewards
---
Aye that's good to know thanks! I only have one of each of the prior mentioned items but will slim down on holos/notes to avoid future problems.
---
Come to think of it, stash limits are set to save bethesdas servers...  people mass hoarding these items arent doing anybody a favor, especially with the huge market for said items paired with the new dupe glitch.
---
*Ghee wonder why the game is running slow for everybody*
---
There's two issues I've noticed.  The first is the just plain immortal bugged enemies, these ones are 100% bugged and won't even move and for stuff like super mutants they'll even be naked.  The second are the selectively immortal, these ones will for whatever reason have a body part that does not register damage no matter how many times you shoot but if you switch your vats to another part they'll take damage there. i.e. head shot, head shot, head shot, nothing, scroll down, body shot, dead.
---
In addition since the score needed goes up, surely people would choose to skip the most expensive ones if they were planning to do so?
---
Launching nukes is OK, silos are not that difficult, they just have a reputation.
---
pisses me off that i can have a t posing captured frog in my display case but jangles can’t hang.
---
Can you explain what magic means I keep hearing it and I’ve never heard of it before recently
---
Couldn't agree any less, sucks to suck for the people it's happening to but why delay something that's gonna get them more money
---
I did that on my alt but haven't yet tried it! I'm curious how well it works.
---
LOL so true, that t-posing frog doesn't even fit in the case
---
because people dont like nw and just play it for score now, complain by bethesda for forcing people into nw for skins and challenges for adventure mode and making people sad that really want to play nw but get confronted by adventure players.
---
This is most likely I think
---
This is a terrible idea. If you take a workshop, it sets you up for PvP. It even says so right on the screen. Stop being a little baby.
---
A money making machine? So people with private worlds will just crank it out. 
---
Omg! I’m a huge fan of your stuff on Fallout 4! You made such incredible stuff! :D
---
yes
---
You might just have to take a couple of steps and try again, usually works for me.
---
Any build is viable as long as you have the right perks and weapons
---
There should be a legendary bench at the purveyors. Craftable weapon and armor piece should use modules to make them legendary. One module for each star. So it costs 150 scrip to selectively craft legendaries as opposed to rng 100 scrip from purveyor.
---
The end game is pretty much grind to build the ultimate gear. So I propose being able to lock and re-roll legendary effect at cost. I proposed you lock an effect for 100 scrip and you re-roll the other effects with additonal modules. And all subject to RNG. This would also apply to add ing stars to legendary items, by using additional modules.
---
Yes it was on XB1
---
I think they'll release separate paints for t65. Probably will have a hot rod lookin one. I'm pretty sure a few t65 paints have been datamined a while back
---
Yea one kid joined the sbq event and went AFK
---
Not today friend
---
I'm sorry but 14000 atom points? Holy hell I'm impressed whether you earned them or paid for them.
---
unarmed is the strongest build in the game atm
---
Yep.... Just had this happen. Logged in and my daily/weekly challenges were either already completed or had some of the progress started on them. I clearly hadn't received the S.C.O.R.E points from them though because I was on the same gameboard spot that I was prior to starting the game up this afternoon. No one else has access to my console or my account so no one was on playing. I'm out of over 6,000 points for my gameboard, which takes away all of my motivation. It was already a grind but now it feels impossible. I filed a "feedback" ticket with Bethesda as per the directions on their website for S.C.O.R.E issues, but I have zero faith or confidence in any sort of resolution when their big disclaimer is that they "WILL NOT" adjust or grant S.C.O.R.E points.   
---
Sigh. As someone who has been playing this game since BETA, I'm really starting to burn out with the continual issues. I've dropped a lot of money and time into this game, and I'm getting really tired of getting almost nothing back from them other than more microtransactions disguised as content. The continual bugs and issues are inexcusable at this point... Especially when it relates to content that is on a time limit and requires a good amount of effort to progress. I shouldn't have to drop more money into this game to progress on the gameboard, and I refuse to do so. If Bethesda thinks that they're going to get more people to spend actual money to progress on the gameboard because of their little bug problem, I really hope people stand up for themselves and do not spend money/atoms to progress.
---
Just logged in nothing autocompleted
---
50 per hour would be a pretty inefficient way to make money in that context. Way better ways to farm.
---
Yeah 2 hours for 100 caps, they'll be making a mint for sure.
---
congrats!
---
Flamer does work but you have to bash
---
It's just not feasible. Even if you carefully planned it and split into multiple blueprints, you'll still have items such as wires or lighting which will give you the floating error.
---
It's just broken and best forgotten unless you build a small camp with that all in mind.
---
EDIT: wait what do you mean your camp had to be moved? Because another player had a camp there? Just switch servers....?
---
No, it's called Simple Modern Bed, I got mine from the furniture vendor bot at Whitespring.
---
You never duped once ?
---
Or how about an event! Could go vaguely western with it... Fresh pressing of caps, but oh no those raiders have come to rob us!
---
yep, it's happened to me a few times.
---
Yes I can confirm that has been fixed. I run both Barbarian and Evasion and have Herd Mentality plus Class Freak rank 3. I still have my bonuses from barbarian and evasion
---
They better add big iron
---
It’s in the room with the final quest for the Brother hood in Fort Defiance. Can’t remember if it’s on a side table to the left of the entry door or the one with the terminal on it.
---
Yeah, had me stuck in a corner and couldn't move, no matter how much ammo i pumped into them they would get down to just a sliver and never die....oh well, what can ya do :-)...
---
Melee builds work great. You will need a ranged weapon as a backup for ceiling mounted turrets and flying enemies. You can easily get a Heavy Gun for that stuff as Heavy Guns also fall under Strength perks.
---
Then bulk and sell em. Instant morbid fortune. Speed is subjective.
---
You're implying you're the wrong people?
---
Not at all I just had duped items on my account my friends gave me and I’m banned but they’re not they got like 500k bullets and mr fuzzy tokens and crazy amounts of legacies but they’re all good
---
♥
---
Probably a bug dude, I run free range several times a day and I've never run into invincible wolves, only wolves getting stuck inside hitboxes so you cant shoot them.
---
I lost 7500 so I’m right there with you...
---
:-)
---
My bloody fss +1 strength bear arm feels this.
---
I have no perks in unarmed and it still nearly hits for 1K damage straight up.
---
Login failed. This account is not authorized. [4:8:2000]  means you’ve been banned this is just a connection error/beth error
---
PC User: Work fast. I had three of my eight weekly challenges auto-complete on logon today without credit of course. This is my first encounter with this bug. :(
---
* Build up a Workshop or CAMP
---
* Kill a Creature
---
* Kill a Huge Creature
---
Persistent workshop is planned to be a feature of fallout first. 
---
So yeah. If they have a cap machine running all the time it will be.
---
And it wouldn’t help a noobie. It would just put a target on their heads. There’s quite a few players who love using workshops to PvP others
---
Yeah, it's not actually a good thing. It's not a happy little glitch, it's a big ugly one that gives no joy.
---
Hmmm, i think I'll build some radiation traps at my camp, linked to pressure plates with a custom sign reading "free rads"
---
Also, as i havent tried it, can you load toxic water into the punch bowl?
---
The way to creating your dream weapon in Skyrim was the best part of the game
---
Oh boy, I’m in trouble lol.
---
imagine, u dont need to stay there and can still farm your caps.
---
Has anyone else figured out the big door? I dont seem to have it in my inventory..
---
Edit: nvm Im an idiot. Its under walls, midway down. Its a standalone, you dont have to scroll sideways to see it.
---
You can make stuff with them but I’ve never used them. Just sell them to the vendor
---
"Mmmmm hmmmm hmmmmm. I just love songs, don't yooouuuu?"
---
The bone zone... Only heard tales
---
I got a message off my team mate (we where in the final 3) he said "hold off on killing this last guy, we get more XP for lasting longer in game than we do for killing eachother" so I think the mentality now is to just hide as long as you can. Until they update XP for kills it won't be PvP it will Player Vs Timer
---
or the ss jet pack. oh so you can fly? well i can now to
---
Tired of this game being glitchy as shit and then they punish wrong people for their own glitches
---
normal blood packs are used to make stimpaks
---
glowing blood sells well to npc vendors
---
oh yeah, explosive is hard on the gun. I don’t like it anymore mostly for that reason.
---
Eh people that get banned tend to lie about why.
---
Blood bags are used to make stimpacks if you have the recipe and i think glowing blood can make rad away but I can't remember
---
Not those, no. 
---
And I’m still waiting for the mute one.
---
Use blood packs to make stim paks, glowing blood is used for something but I forget. You can sell the glowing blood for a pretty penny at the vendors.
---
So, gave it a try with virtually no perks directed towards it. Didn't exactly melt the queen but with no mods it did a fair bit of damage. Not giving up my lever for it, but with some time at the weapon bench and moving some perks around I feel this gun can do some damage to the queen. Durability seems really high which is nice in a queen fight.
---
But it would have the same limits as all the other generators and harvesters in the game.  If you have to go visit once an hour or it won’t make any more, it’s not at all overpowered. Making food or rare resources at a workshop would be higher margins
---
This is why I don’t look at dupers negatively they literally devalued the irl cash value of these otherwise pointless weapons
---
Congrats! That must’ve been exciting for you. I never get lucky with the Madam Purveyor and have to result to trading with other players.
---
Did you use the xp / score glitch?
---
I'm sure I'd know this if I could bloody find one! :'(
---
Perhaps you should re-read my post because I quite clearly stated it.
---
Sorry you cannot whale today for Bethesda, the day will come though.  
---
There are more factors than just creating a new monetisation revenue for the company, such as PR, Bethesda and Fallout 76 getting more negative press regarding monetisation could cause drama internally they simply do not need.  
---
You and the small amount of money you will spend on their company in the grand scheme matter as much as a dry fart on a Sunday afternoon in stopping an oncoming hurricane to their business.  However every gaming YouTuber giving them shit on YT to several hundred thousand viewers? that costs substantially more, hence the poor taste of rolling out this feature has been addressed and delayed till the fix is live.
---
Well it was in the same spot as one of my friends, and he's been playing linger than me
---
I didn’t know there was one
---
Or "We found the problem, but every fucking fix that we've tried did nothing"
---
Only difficult thing was completing one before the server crashed.
---
Great! I’ll take a look there. Thanks!! 🤜🤛
---
Alright thanks for the help.
---
Honestly that breaks my heart a bit. I was hoping to build a home and who knows I LOVE the Idea of a RP nerd store (what my friends call D&amp;D and Magic cards shops) Have all the board games and stuff on display as well.. 
---
I would love to see your store at some point.
---
Fallout redditors be like: DIFFERING OPINIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED
---
"You can get a good luck at a bull by sticking your head up a butcher's ass... No wait..." \~ Tommy Boy
---
Seems crazy that you'd get the hammer for buying a single item. But if so email them, I don't think there is any other option.
---
Ok so you choose to move it so that you two could play in the same server? Just wanted to make sure you knew that you don't have to move camp just because another player is there.
---
Just build a new one. Find a good location and build it to suit. You're not going to be able to place your old one now that you torn it down.
---
I got the radiation emitter from grahm for my bloodied build, hook it up to a switch power connector and it works much faster than the rad barrel.
---
Glowing blood is used for glowing blood packs which offers rad resistance and DOES stack with rad-x or rad-x diluted. I use them during queen fights or laps at whitesprings when I dont have radshield.
---
How can you farm them without staying there if you need to take the caps out of the machine? Every single extractor or item producing object has a very small limit on how much they can hold. If a cap press held 20 caps at a time no one is ever going to get rich from it without being at their computer for days on end.
---
Its for the combat rifle not the combat shotgun I think.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dp1z50/how_to_get_the_halloween_nuclear_winter_rewards
---
Ah ok, i thought you were purposely leaving them lol, it happens
---
Would that affect my mutations?
---
Is there a way to get the pieces back? I'd be 100% fine just rebuilding it if I can get the materials back
---
I've been having a similar issue. I'll have low level mobs have a sliver of health left after hitting them with what I know should one shot them. No rubberbanding or regen, just straight up refusal to die in one hit.
---
I can one shot most standard mobs with my bloodied build, but occasionally a single digit leveled ghoul or schorced will take a second shot. Hardly game breaking, just thought I'd throw it into the discussion.
---
yeah thats true, but u dont need to sell it in your vendor if u get caps. but i think thats a bad idea anyway for a workshop.
---
This is the most adorable thing I’ve ever heard about in the post-nuclear wasteland.
---
Rad-x DILUTED and glowing blood packs do NOT affect mutations. Neither does radshield.
---
My turrets always shoot themselves. I had to stop using them.
---
When it gives you that message that your camp can’t be placed, and you decide to stay on that world, don’t place your camp down elsewhere. It’ll still be there in the next session you load into so you don’t need to move
---
"Collecting fun is what I doooo. I find party supplies for yoooouuu"
---
FO1 pays for the game to run, because no one buys atoms.  Bottomless stash will never be base game.
---
I got them the same way. Dupped or not they are valuable AF and probably you'll keep them because they are cool
---
Since you count as your own team member, you get the benefits from herd mentality even if you are the only one on your team.
---
Buy "more comprehensive" do you mean it has songs from other fallout games?
---
I’m on Xbox and my speed is about 150Mbps so I’m not too worried about the speed.  I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a console-related issue.
---
That is a late game option, yes, but even so I like to have a ranged weapon for backup.
---
because it takes a while to farm? or do u take even 1 item each time the extractor produces it?
---
Ok thanks
---
Yes, scrap the blue prints and each individual item will go into your stored tab. You can either use those pieces to rebuild or scrap them for parts.
---
I'd reuse as much as you can, since you'll loose some  by scrapping. Remember will walls, floors, even if one style stored, it can be swapped after placing.  For example if you have metal walls stored, and want to build wood, it'd be better to place the metal and the swap to wood.
---
I don’t spend a lot of time on reddit so I’m kinda not surprised I didn’t see any of the posts. Sorry to have bothered you I guess.
---
Yeah, that’s wrong as hell. I definitely benefited like ALOT from this whole thing. I hope that doesn’t deserve a ban, if it does they are going to be banning people in mass.
---
Hopefully the TSE25 handmade I got wasn’t a dupe.
---
No, it’s 3 by 2.
---
Wanted to see the hype behind the E gat plas it's meh the M2525 fixer was nice tho
---
Neither does comparing an oil spill to a glitchy videogame lmao
---
Pretty salty about something that doesnt really affect you at all.
---
I think what is happening is Bethesda is mass temp banning pretty much everyone and checking accounts for duped weapons. I’ve had the same thing happen and I didn’t dupe, either. Could also be someone reported you just to be an ass. You should get your account back in a couple of days.
---
Holy thunder fuck. I've got probably close to every note and holotape. I have a lot of cleaning to do.
---
Lost 3000 SCORE points from the new weekly goals today as well. I wasn't logged in when they turned over, specifically waited a couple of hours past the timer to be safe. First time I've encountered this bug.
---
I honestly feel like there gonna be like 2 people per server now tops literally every server I went to had every vendor being used
---
This sounds great but my unspecified amount of B2525 Fixers remains on Xbox. jk pls no ban.
---
Epitome of a whale, guy dropped 150k into the transfomers mobile game.

Get a nuke ready to launch and then start encryptid. Launch the nuke when its going, no pylons needed. Gotta have two players though.
---
Has multiple duped weapons: "why did I get banned im innocent!"
---
1st person 99% of the time, I cringe when I see someone in 3rd person while in combat
---
Wish i had kept playing around the time before it got removed
---
Played the game since beta, stopped around the time they started mass banning people left and right
---
Came back when the burrows came out, then stopped for a couple months, returned for the raid, couldnt get a solid group together that wouldnt rage quit out
---
Only came back half a year after pioneer scouts then the latter end of wastelanders
---
If you ever were to sell it, what would you want for it, long shot i know but a collector will always be a collector
---
Theres a youtuber called angryturtles he made a video explaining and demonstrating it you should go watch that
---
Let's hope so, I'd be glad to get my account back but this is a lot of score and days of fallout 1st that I just miss out on...
---
I did some trading recently on the market I hope I’m okay, think I will be
---
If you don’t use them, toss them. Regular blood packs I use to make stimpacks
---
Glad to hear this because I was freaking out. I've been murdered 7 times today un Uranium Fever with my 199 level
---
Ah...Gary...!
---
Aside from your argument being both a cop out and enabling of clearly predatory online gaming practices, you are also very wrong. 
---
I play a lot of MMOs including Guild Wars 2 and Runescape and both of those are significantly more successful and popular and although they do include micro-transactions and time-gating, they are in far more palpable ways. Additionally, none of the games you or I mentioned have anywhere near the serious game breaking bugs we do with 76. Can you imagine what would happen if Wow classic had a serious game breaking bug like this and it wasnt immediately hotfixed? It could not happen. 
---
Also why should I stop playing? I am die-hard fallout fan who has spent not insignificant amounts of money independent of my subscription in the atom store and I am entitled to express my opinion and probably have more hours in the game than you do.
---
Why else would loot bags be accessible to others. Why are workshops pvp zones. Oh it’s made that way on purpose. QQ go back to fo4
---
On the contrary, IMO, NW challenges should involve actually playing nuclear winter. Things like 'Win a Match' or 'Kill Three Players', not stuff that encourages filling up slots for something unrelated to the mode and then logging out.
---
And I say this as someone who is no good at pvp and dislikes the mode. Mainly because then I'd have a reason to pass on the challenges lol, I hate having to wait 5 minutes in the Vault just to place a CAMP a few times or puch a creature to death.
---
So, you *knowingly accepted* duped items?  Like your friends told you they were duped items and then you accepted them?
---
Not really. This is what I bought into on release, had two pistol builds and now a bow build. I do not recommend them. Melee however is godly.
---
Buying the full-priced game at launch paid for the game. Bootlickers will never be based.
---
I was thinking the same thing, but I was going to start using atoms for levels today anyway. However, that I didn’t go live like it was supposed to. Surprise.
---
Three of my weekly auto-completions today are targets I've done in the past yes:
---
* Build up a Workshop or CAMP (5/5)
---
* Kill a Creature (30/30)
---
* Kill a Huge Creature (3/3)
---
Because it would be an utter waste of time to try amassing lots of caps in such a painfully slow way when you can get vastly more selling the loot from 1 radiation rumble. Or literally clearing out any other location.
---
Is there a system in Bethesda for banning? if you dupe will you get a few month ban, or is your account banned indefinitely. I don’t get it can’t find anything.
---
Why even go inside white springs
---
I've had Zach at the Dross Toss similarly bugged for the best part of the year I've owned the game. I was only able to get him to behave normally after rejecting the Quest in the Pip-Boy menu, which is a feature they imolemented broken with Wastelanders and fixed in Patch 19. Try doing the same, and tomorrow Chloe will hopefully act like normal.
---
I'm a newcomer. If I buy the raider collection, then it automatically collects ammo for me or how is that working?
---
Nope, still getting 25%. You haven't used rad-x or something?
---
The ghillie suit seems to have had some effort put into it, the ghillie armor looks like a bad fake christmas tree. The color is the tip of the iceberg for why they're bad.
---
Really?  He sent me to be jumped and mugged by raiders day after day....
---
Technical your account is suspended and from what I hear they take a long ass time to decide whenever you're banned, account wipe, or given the account back if you got an account wipe you still have your at shop items
---
They told me after wards I didn’t think anything of it
---
Well let me check the worth of the guns on fed76. I usually buy/sell high capacity plan at 7500 caps, and armored one at 6k. Let me see if that’s fair on the pricing site
---
lol @ you
---
Don't blame me if you get 'chopped'. 🤪
---
Every time some chitshow goes wild, all I ever see is people saying 'banned' this and 'ban' that all over the place on reddit, twitter and youtube.  
---
Yet every time when people post the actual messaged from Bethesda, as a picture or in a youtube video, they always say "*suspended*".
---
I can't help but think of Princess Bride:  
---
“You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.” -Inigo Montoya
---
Ok sounds good. Thanks for your time.
---
As long as it wasn’t out of a train station vendor you should be fine person to person trading wasn’t triggering any bans I believe
---
They are not outfits or items by themselves, they’re “paint “ when you go in to mod your items
---
Yeah I’m thinking about dumping the perk just because of how much AP I lose
---
Did you claim them on the game board?
---
you've completed it already???
---
There is the ghille suit that is an outfit which you were able to earn from nuclear winter at one point and then there is the ghille armor mods which are earned though the legendary run and can only be applied to pre-existing armor pieces you have
---
The suit was a limited time NW reward. The armor you unlocked are skins for your existing armor, applicable at any armor workbench.
---
Hopefully someone who knows will respawn to your question.
---
Yeah so it has yours worth minimum 19500 caps and mine 33600. So if I added two plans but not 3 it’d be worth it in my opinion. So I’ll trade it for 2 backpacks with the rifle and not all 3 packs, if that’s good for you. Otherwise if you’d rather hold off I understand.
---
It’s because you think people are building their camps to intentionally fuck with players who run a bloodied build. Nobody cares about your build but you. You stated that within a reply to someone else’s comment. That people are jealous of the most OP build in the game so they put decontamination showers at their camps entrance. No one is jealous of your build when everyone can build a character that way if they so choose. Because they don’t choose to and you do does not mean that they have to show you any courtesy at their camp whether they have vendors or not.
---
These events are not easy sometimes because people just dont have a clue...At lvl 320 and I am a DPS dealer, I can cover the far hallway by myself, freeing others to gather ore or cover the other side. I am amazed how many times I have had to tell others via the mic to do something else...They just dont get it and will continue to stand in front of me and run around doing nothing useful to the event....
---
Wait. They may let you back on. Soon, or later. IF you didn't really dupe, you have some bad luck. There have been so many dupes that no one got banned for. IF you didn't really dupe, hopefully Beth will figure it out.
---
Ghille weapon skin is only for the hunting rifle.
---
When you say account wipe. Do Bethesda clear everything from all your characters. Or is it selective
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🐐🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I'd also like to know please.
---
I did not get banned today..
---
Yep got it, but when I try to mod my weapons or secret service armor I dont even see the the skin to apply it????
---
Only 20? That sounds like a sh*t ton to me. Although I haven't played in the past two weeks to see this he'll unfold.
---
It was a bright orange/yellow liquid in a flask. I've only ever seen the one!
---
Spoiler: https://reddit.app.link/pFY7F0lL77 on this Egsing-Ricky posted: https://i.imgur.com/33naSSa.png 😅
---
Everything you are lvl 1 with nothing expect your atom shop items
---
I'm on PS4
---
How...much have you spent all this time 😳
---
Yeah I sure did, every one of them....
---
I was I just sat there with my hands in the air thinking about time, I got an assassins handmade before this so I had that feeling something big was coming. And boom I got that all I have to do now is find a suppressor mod for it and I'm even more happier.
---
Cowboy! Pull out that pistol and hAve some real fun!
---
Go for an unarmed build you wont regret it. My Powerfist decimates anything and melts the SBQ.
---
Yep got it but when I try to do that those paint schemes dont even show up????
---
Yes, well I am on the last reward of section one....
---
But to take advantage of a player who is alone, preoccupied in a workstation, and less than 1/10th of you level? Then to intentionally follow them and taunt them? Seems like a jerk thing to do to me, but I guess the difference between us is that I dont need to bully others to feel good about myself 🤷‍♂️
---
I hope , I don't really dupe, I did it 1 year ago and I've payed my error, now I want onli to play legit this game, maxed all the rep with two faction with much hour of playing
---
I’m curious about that myself, been playing this game since beta
---
Inside Crater Core on the Pool table alot of bones. 
---
In the back alley of Whitesprings, lots of bones by dumpsters.
---
join match, complete the score for the day then either jump to my death, jump in the fire, dance till i die, or tab out to afk NW XP.
---
The way my friend Reddit, it seems like you got the debuffs when they weren't around
---
Yes understand but I cant see the paint schemes to apply them to any of my items, armor, guns or helm....
---
Lol, getting this mad over pvp. Go role play a vendor where you spend three hours afk at your camp. You should have enough skill for that...maybe.
---
Oh that's a good idea, thanks!
---
where?
---
on ps4? on steam? on xbox? in the subreddit?
---
Truth. Never going to use that perk again. Not only did it make look like a thicko, the AP drain is nuts!
---
I use cranberry relish all the time and I didn't know about this. Does Herbivore double it to 20%?
---
So to start low levels I just punch stuff or use other weapons till I get perks?
---
Okay, I can work with that. 2 backpack plans and my 2* JE for your 3* JE.
---
Do you have a preference on which backpacks you want?
---
Funny me either......
---
I'll take a JE fixer. Thanks guys.
---
I’m only 2 weeks into playing but looking for people to play with on PC too! Add shoooops
---
This bundle is back in the shop. Just in case you  didn't get the chance to.
---
Only works if you bash. Boo!
---
like brazil and stuff
---
That’s how today’s ban is working.
---
I use both lmao.
---
Really? He doesn't fit in the rectangle display with the wooden backing?
---
Are you sure they’re available for the SS armor?  Maybe check a different piece... can craft a lvl 1 if you don’t have something laying around
---
Did you claim them?
---
Nuka quantum dupe, for a friend, I was stupid to follow him
---
I think its bugged. Its meant to be done through the terminal, but I noticed yesterday (before the raider collectron released) that it was bugged and not showing any options to change the loot type.  I'd double check for you but I can't even spawn into a world at the moment because the game is so stupid it tells me my base can't be placed and puts me back in the same world again.
---
Hold this upvote.
---
I would have dropped that like a molten diamond. Not worth it at all.
---
The freak show has a lot of bones too
---
Nope. Just tried it. Toxic water wasn't an option to place in punchbowl.
---
I like her but her monologues drive me nuts. I want more songs
---
&gt;Not sure there're skins for the handmade or shotgun
---
Good idea!
---
It’s been I think 8 months and I still can’t scrap the greenhouse dome or move it or do anything with it.
---
Yeah, it’s honestly a really good choice to go for the collectrons based on what you want to get from them. 
---
I started a character and didn’t get mine until about level 100 and felt like I had wasted so much potential with extra stuff. It’s not crazy, but I usually visit my camp once an hour and I’ll see ballistic fiber scraps, fiber optics, concrete, screws, real good stuff when it comes to scrap and it’s just a bonus so it helps building and such. Between this and getting the raider ammo machine I’ll be coming back to my camp and seeing 100+ free bullets and some good supplies.
---
+1 agreed
---
I can confirm silent doesn’t work on the normal or patriot skins, but I’ve heard from a reliable friend that the silent DOES work on the shadow prime
---
Wait! You admit duping last year and got punished and now you've been caught with duped weapons - with all respect to you please learn and don't mess with duping or those who dupe. Just ain't worth it my friend.
---
Thanks for the info. Sorry you had to be the sacrifice.
---
&gt;	I’m not saying every single camp like this is out to grief bloodied builds, I’m sure there’s few in comparison to the entire playerbase, but this thread has a lot of angry people with upvotes complaining about playstyle lol.
---
This is what I actually said which completely contradicts what you just said. 
---
Somehow the point of what I originally said went completely over your head, and now you’re just parroting the same shit as everyone else even though it has nothing to do with me. 
---
Do yourself a favor and actually read what someone is saying instead of needlessly arguing with them.
---
Hybrid
---
And once they fix it they'll break 5 other perks in the process.
---
How is that analogy flying over your head? How's it flying over that other guy's head? It's pretty simple to understand and if you're splitting hairs on just how accurate it is to compare a company's oil spill and bug fixes in fo76, you're being pedantic af. 
---
Here, I'll spell it out for you two since you apparently flunked that section on your SATs: In the same way that you wouldn't be so quick to praise BP for cleaning up an oil spill they should have never allowed to happen in the first place, people shouldn't be so quick to give Bethesda Austin an excited pat on the back for fixing (partially) bugs and poor design choices that should have never been pushed out to consumers in the first place. Duh. Do I need to explain what I mean by "pat on the back" now too?
---
My idol.
---
My only long standing complaint is paying real money for the greenhouse dome and it being unscrapable and immovable without completely replacing my entire camp elsewhere. I can’t do anything with it but have it sit there and take up budget. That is infuriating.
---
It’s only for power armor sadly, they haven’t released any SS jet pack skins yet
---
Ok thats not just me, i thought something was off with this perk now.
---
They've screwed this game so much what's another bad piece of publicity... They continue to screw up and don't seem to mind it that much and if they haven't fixed the no bug after two weeks doubt it's even on the horizon so just like I said.... Couldn't care less, they continue to let down their player base
---
I just don't buy anything from their vendor if they have a setup like that, especially if it's obviously a high level player. They should know better.
---
Maybe don't get banned mate
---
Damm, im pc atm, havent set my xbox one up at all
---
Ghillie suit is a nuclear winter reward. 
---
The ghillie armor skins are applied to armor at an armor workbench. They are for specific armor types (leather, metal, scout, robot, not sure if there are others)
---
The rifle skin is only for the hunting rifle.
---
Why didn't you cancel the subscription? Or was it too quick after you were banned?
---
The earliest unarmed weapon is a death tambo at level 15. 
---
You unlock Iron Fist perk at level 5. With that maxed out you can definitely use that death tambo. 
---
Martial Artist is unlocked at 16, which will help with swing speed.
---
So you can use any weapon you want until you reach 15 but by then I'd be on the lookout for that death tambo.
---
I have the fasnacht collectron along with the regular and the communist one. Out of the three I placed the fasnacht one and I sing along with him. Well, I sing along with him when I'm not already singing along with the red rocket vendors.
---
Have the same glossy textures issue i4790k 16gb RAM and RX 5700. Sent ticked to Bethesda and waiting for the response.
---
Click to Respond? Do you mean Respawn?
---
Just slot in aqua boy/girl( if you have it), no rads in water( or that left over FEV)
---
Sorry. In the game on Xbox 1
---
Sorry their using ur score points to feed fat greedy Todd 😋
---
I think you meant to put this post on the market bud.

Submit a ticket, chances are it won't be fixer for a while.
---
Ditto. I can relate to everything positive that you talked about with regards to NW. it is super fun and took me away from Adventure mode. Problem is, Bethesda studios messed it up with latest 1.3.2.10 and it killed it for me - crashes every time I play with black screen. What do I do - buy new GPU and hope for the best? 🤨 
---
P.S. Points 1 and 5 do happen on PC version as well, not only xbox.
---
Unfortunately, there is no statute of limitations on this. Bethesda doesn’t have to ban you within a certain time frame. 
---
Best of luck. And if nothing else, this can serve as a reminder to those that haven’t yet duped to think twice about it.
---
Now the red rocket vendors are cool. I think their song is cute and it’s not all that loud.
---
That's disappointing,  so much for my "disease roulette " punchbowl idea..
---
I’m only two weeks into playing but it’s nice to see high level players want to help out! I found someone’s CAMP today and they were selling stimpaks for only 10 caps each so I stocked up like mad!! It was like Christmas lol
---
Not sure why we show gratitude. My account was suspended today for no reason after I filed a  ticket about the auto complete bug.
---
yep!
---
Each one is a separate square. There is one for wood armor and one for metal armor. You can't get the one for SS until the high 80 rank.
---
It wouldn't be so bad if their dialogue wasn't so endlessly repetitive. Ive had Beckett harping in my ear since WL dropped because I can't be arsed doing his tedious fetch quests.
---
It says which one it applies to on the Legendary run, click on each one and read the description and/or title.
---
Edit: if you're at the end of section one then all you've unlocked ghillie wise is paint for the wood and metal armour sets, and weapon skin for the hunting rifle.
---
I neeed it. I made a home out of the saucer with a lot of careful placing
---
How can you be mad ? You did something wrong and got punished? Lol
---
You have to kill 3 different giant monsters (for example: 1 Deathclaw, 1 Grafton Monster, and 1 Mirelurk Queen). If you look closer, it specifies this.
---
That must have been some real quick like charge since you didn't have time to cancel your subscription after getting banned. They must have timed it just right.
---
That's fair
---
They will be more now. With all the duped items and duper’s gone. Inflation is going to be huge
---
Bows are currently impossible for me to use on the PC at present when targeting with VATS. This is even true when targeting the torso at point blank range. You can watch the arrow practically curve to the right and miss the target cleanly every single time. The only time it sometimes works is when you double target lock (lock on, lock off, lock on) before releasing. This turns a slow firing weapon into an even slower firing weapon. Sigh...
---
No, but might have been a small bug, relogged and it fixed. EDIT: Curious, how do you get it to 25?
---

---
I seen this build. But it takes no endurance.  How do you survive ? Or do you have a better one?
---
Last year I was following a bad friends who tell me to try this I was new for the online games, and Beth ban me for 1 year, I have payed my error, I repeat, but this time don't do anything at all, I spent real money on this game bcs I like it, and I was kinda stupid if I spend money and do anything who can get me banned
---
My bad
---
Just make it so it only shows stuff you can craft, then just search through for decorations. If not misc
---
That's understandable
---
Lol they made you their mule. You got what you deserved.
---
On the same topic, if we can't find a low level player to drop things for, my bf and I will go to the Overseer's camp and load her stash box with extra goodies.
---
Some of my friends burner accounts haven't been hit and they've been duping the whole weekend and still have their stash of 100 e gat plas on them
---
Bones are the skeleton's money.
---
Yeah I’m not sure of the carry weight for for herbivore. It’s so common with carnivore.
---
Can't get in the bunker. You can buy them there. Some ppl don't know that. I have told ppl before and they just needed me to go in there and buy them. From what I remember I had to server hop like a day to find 4 legs. Me and wife. But someone told me you could just buy them now np. I'm not sure if this is true, or you still gotta server hop. I'm on ps4 or I could help ya. Hope this info helps
---
Plz this
---
Fuck it, i'm gonna buy it and post a pic here.
---
Don't abuse any exploits? It's your fault.
---
But isn’t there AI that uses charging laser rifles
---
Nothing you can do but wait and see. I would put a hold on FO1st payments as those are automatic and Bethesda isn’t going to do you a favor and put it on hold themselves. Second, your paying for fallout first and atoms doesn’t mean anything if they think you broke the TOS.
---
Strange in numbers.
---
I have both a Junkie (high health) and Bloodied (low health) unarmed characters. I'm at work right now but can send you my builds in about an hour if that's okay.
---
I do use a few points in endurance for a high health build.
---
Yep i repeat, for last year I've payed my errors, Beth take 1 year to readmission me online
---
That and they wont explode wiping out your camp
---
Now I'm hoping that the Season during christmas has a version of the ghillie armors with red and green lights and bulbs hanging from it with a star on the helmet.
---
I just had to restart the game
---
They're most likely using Strange in Numbers which would boost Herbuvore's bonus to the Cranberry Relish bonus.
---
Very. Even better, it behaves as a grenade would and when the strike takes out hordes of scorched you get the xp
---
Isn't the overseer's stash box instanced?
---
You can do it with the throwing weps from sheepsquach. Unlimited steal, something, and spines
---
You know, I think they banned the right person here.
---
Her monologues are on the longer end,true.We need more songs,hearing the same ones all the time is starting to bug me so new songs would be more than welcome.But I think the frequency of her intermissions is OK as is.
---
Fuck i did not know this. Thanks for sharing.
---
How exactly? Do you craft them and then scrap them?
---
They stated two weeks after launch multiple times across announcements and ITV articles
---
Done.  No s.c.o.r.e points granted
---
I’d prefer a few less, and more songs. More songs. I’m so tired of all the steel guitar and stuff. I just want stuff like fallout 4 or 3 or even the grandest one
---
New Vegas
---
Okay. Why does it matter if the offense was one day ago or one year ago?  It was a violation of the ToS either way. 
---
Submit a ticket requesting reconsideration of the ban.
---
What are you expecting anyone here to do for you?
---
Oh my sweet, innocent child
---
Happened to me and I just payed to the closest location and it fixed it but I suggest just closing out and going back because for the rest of the game I was lagging
---
Wait, I always hid as long as I could. -bush wookie
---
Yep my friend got banned
---
Did you mean to post this in your dupe/exploit reddit?
---
The ghillie paint for Secret Service armor isn't unlocked until you get to rank 82 of the S.C.O.R.E. gameboard.
---
Seems like they may be safe. Everyone I spoke with got the email at the same time
---
I killed a deathclaw. Grafton. And a scorch.
---
Didn't grant me my 1000 points. Same for girlfriend.
---
I ran into a supermutant travelling trader  selling one yesterday.  I think he was on the road by Top of the World.
---
Good luck I hope they let you back in cuz if they don’t I’m probably next 😬
---
Literally within an hour of eachother.
---
Hell yea,make my spurs go jingle jangle jingle or show me some Happy times.
---
Not mad bro trust me my end game was collecting weapons so time to find a new game
---
Ahh ha! Thank you that explains the armor,,, what about my weapons? I dont see the paint skins showing now....
---
I love this, yes and yes
---
Don’t worry file a ticket and they suspend your account like mine
---
This would be like the vault boy atomic shop cutouts they tried to add at all the train stations a while back, a constant in-game reminder that they want you to spend more real world money.
---
Mystery solved.
---
And your perks match that and are not for automatic fire?
---
Are magic weapons unintentionally powerful?
---
That’s why, the paint isn’t for everything, just specific items. Read the descriptions
---
Is there a list of things you can be banned for. As a newby I worry I might do something innocently that constitutes a ban.
---
Ahh the hunting rifle okay I was trying to apply to my handmade and shotgun. Thank you! I did read the descriptions but must have missed that
---
I’m not a duper
---
Didn’t realize trading people for weapons is a bannable offense. Nor did I realize their server instability is my fault. It is not my reponsibility to ascertain the exact source of every weapon that is to be traded.
---
The account in question, literally no dupes. I do have other accounts, and they are not squeaky clean.
---
This one was however
---
Ewww
---
Hate is a pretty strong word, buddy
---
Happens sometimes but I've been running them now for a few weeks and pretty stable. I was late to the party.
---
Didn’t realize trading people for weapons is a bannable offense. It is not my reponsibility to ascertain the exact source of every weapon that is to be traded.
---
If someone wants the trade, and we both have the items and we trade, what did I do wrong there?
---
You messed with the law and the law won.
---
Original placement of the Camp module kinda dictates which direction you're facing, after placing it, whichever way you were facing, when it was deployed, will roughly be the direction you spawn in facing. Moving the module around will just change the spot you spawn in slightly.
---
I've a feeling people don't care where/how others spawn into their camp or just don't know where others spawn in, which is why you spawn inside foundations or inside locked doors. Moving the Camp module will sometimes fix that or premeditavily plopping it down 1-3 times (paying caps each time to move/rotate it) before building, can help dictate spawn direction and placement better for others.
---
What I do when I find a new spot is go 3rd person, zoom out the camera as much as possible, see where my borders are. I'll then move the camp module in the "preview" mode before setting it down, to which direction I want to spawn in. I'll fast travel to and from a couple times and if I don't like it, I'll move my CAMP module again(keeping in the same spot, just turning around a little), based on how I spawned in last time. I'll do this 2-4 times until I've got it exactly how I want it or close enough to.
---
 Rotating the CAMP module will change the direction of which way you spawn in, even if your character is facing the way you want to spawn in, so if youy're facing west but you  turn your camp module 90 degrees, you'll probably spawn in facing North or South instead. So, to keep it simple, I don't turn the camp module at all, I just turn my character, based on where I want to face and then I worry about where I spawn in, as I'm building.
---
IRL that's Summerville lake, it's man made they flooded the town of Gad to build the lake. Just a cool little IRL cross over
---
Ahh. That sucks my guy, hope your cash back.
---
Tru!
---
LOL, seriously?
---
Yep I've already do it, I asked here , thinking anyone has similar situation
---
I dont mind the dialogue as it brings some life to my CAMP. Its the returning to the same location 3 times consecutively for different fetch quests. I never should have rescued Beckett. Sh#t name for a sh#t c#nt
---
Report for what reason exactly?
---
Good luck man, I'm sure you'll get it eventually! It takes time but it's definetly worth it. I've got both a BFFR25 Handmade and a BFFR25 Fixer, both are insane but the Fixer is definitely worth the extra effort. I can't jump into the game to check the exact numbers now but I do believe the damage difference between a Bloodied Fixer and a Bloodied Handmade grows to be significant when low health.
---
True I did, now I have my suit and Allied with both factions.
---
A guy reported me because I wanted a Red Asylum 
---
So now im temporarily Suspended 
---
RIP Fo76
---
I got banned for trading with someone who apparently had been duplicating weapons. he had the weapon and I had the outfit and we traded. I guess I’d recommend not trading???
---
Lolol
---
I thought grinding XP for you while at work was the point of a kid.
---
I’ve heard rumors of it, nothing concrete or anything about it. I hope they don’t personally. Then we’ll have tons of stuff that you literally don’t need in the game.
---
Bethesda literally change the laws of physics to suit the bottom line.
---
I just dumped about 300 gold ore that was clogging up my stash lol.
---
I’d rather they didn’t.
---
I HATE power armor users. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
---
&gt; I play a lot of MMOs including Guild Wars 2 and Runescape and both of those are significantly more successful and popular and although they do include micro-transactions and time-gating, they are in far more palpable ways. 
---
This is an opinion, I’m sure there are people out there who don’t particularly care for the way that GW2 does their limited events.  I am fine with the Fallout 76 limited event, I will get to the end with no problem before the end of the season with no money needed to be invested. 
---
&gt; Additionally, none of the games you or I mentioned have anywhere near the serious game breaking bugs we do with 76. Can you imagine what would happen if Wow classic had a serious game breaking bug like this and it wasnt immediately hotfixed? It could not happen.
---
irrelevant to the topic at hand - SCORE.  That is the only thing that should be discussed in this topic.  Now should they do something to compensate the people who lost out on Score due to bugs? yes.  But none of the bullion, Scrip, Cap, reputation matters to the discussion at hand.  SCORE.
---
the fact is, that the SCORE system is completable, even with Bugs, without spending any cash on it.  It just requires effort and daily playing. If you don’t want to play daily, then you don’t get the end rewards and you are not entitled to them.  I would say the same thing about any of the events that Everquest 2 or World of Warcraft did.  I’m not going to go on the Everquest 2 forums and complain that I didn’t get to enjoy the progression server before a new expansion was released just because I didn’t want to play the game.  
---
&gt; Also why should I stop playing? I am die-hard fallout fan who has spent not insignificant amounts of money independent of my subscription in the atom store and I am entitled to express my opinion and probably have more hours in the game than you do.
---
You are entitled to your opinion, but that doesn’t mean in the end you’d be entitled to the rewards if you didn’t want to put the time in during the period they have set, as the OP is pushing for.  This is not like any other fallout game released in the past, and expecting it to be as such is just flat out stupid. 
---
And let’s not get into a dick measuring contest or only true Scotsman arguments like it means anything.  The game was an experiment that failed.  It had bugs in beta and released with those bugs.  They pushed the game out faster than it should have been and left it with a bare bones team after the horrible reception to it came through.  The team is likely trying to do everything they can at this point to keep their project staying a float so they don’t lose their jobs in the middle of an economic downturn caused by COVID.  You yourself admit to spending money on the game, the only way to get them to fix the game is to withhold that money, but given the state of the game, you shouldn’t be surprised when they just pull the plug instead.
---
The high capacity and 1 armored
---
They are delicious tho
---
Hopefully this time the kiddies will get the message and stop duping things like crazy. Just because you CAN do something doesn’t mean you SHOULD.
---
Slavery was legal... didn’t make it right
---
Dose the main door work?
---
I think I've realised what the problem is, it seems you can't change the mode of collectrons at workshops, just tried my camp and it worked.
---
Sounds good, I messaged you on Xbox
---
People would just farm and dupe gold.
---
Would be cool if you could use your allies as vendors. Even if only to sell consumables.
---
I think it's funny that they sent out the ban emails right before their customer care shut down for the day
---
I was pretty disappointed in the ally quests.  
---
there are a couple cool ones. but the majority of it was just really tedious fetch questions to nothing places and grab one items.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if this rolling ban wave hits everyone. They’re checking accounts for large numbers of duped items, and shutting them down temporarily is the easiest way to do that. It’s an inconvenience for sure, but in the long run it’s going to put a huge dent in the player base. People who have gotten caught up in the ban wave that didn’t dupe, like you, will leave in droves. This might be the end of Fallout76.
---
K thanks I’ll check
---
Bethesda actually fixing a root cause of a problem? HAHAHAHA
---
Nice one buddy :)
---
Mods in the official forums mentioned that they are working on the fix and it plans to ship with Update 21.
---
It's my favorite main! Just after Faschnaut when the vendors reopened I was able to swoop on someone selling an instigating explosive. Sure, it could be 3 stars, but I named it my Bamboozler and it bamboozles anything I sneakily point it at.
---
Now I know where Smiley keeps on getting his gold bullion.
---
Are they still banning people? Or is that it?
---
So you bought duped weapons, knowing they were duped, and you complain you were bad?
---
Ha fucking ha.
---
Serves you right.
---
I'm pretty sure they're just removing the penalty for being thirsty or hungry so that you can still get bonuses from well fed and hydrated
---
You know I actually doubted my officers when they said someone had killed someone with an artillery.
---
They could simply remove the interaction from all items related to the hunger and thirst system, would save on server resources probably.
---
That's not right. How can you be accountable for someone else's dubious activities. I love trading stuff but your comment makes me very wary.
---
I've gotten immediate responses twice regarding refunds.
---
I personally think it should be difficult, but possible, to craft our own stuff.  Something like the current challenge system; there could be a "challenge" for each legendary prefix, major and minor modifier, something like "Scrap 20 Nocturnal weapons," and the reward is a nocturnal legendary mod that could be applied to a non-legendary weapon.  (Obviously the 20 number is just pulled out of my ass and could be whatever).  Then a major and a minor would be obtained the same way but could be applied to 1 star and 2 star weapons, respectively.
---
But there was never a time in the game when it was outright said gold bullion and scrap were different entirely.
---
You're all good man.  A lot of the weeklies that say x/y have additional requirements like the kill big creatures one that's up right now.
---
wait is there another banwave coming? About time
---
There’s no in game messaging so it’s just in the Xbox message window. 
---
Xbox key &gt;&gt; up arrow to row of icons &gt;&gt; scroll right to parties and chats icons &gt;&gt; message requests
---
Maybe you get reported, some friends of mine didn't dupe but they often play with duppers and also get banned :(
---
I hope this can be resolved
---
They’re probably in message requests or chats, press the Xbox button and it’s the second or third page to the right I think
---
The pure unadulterated lack of irony in the last 5 posts I’ve just seen in ten minutes, where people are feigning bewilderment about being banned, but then openly admit to trading in stuff they openly admit to knowing was duped Is insane. 
---
Is this really what levels of entitlement we’ve reached? And I don’t wanna hear any of this horseshit from anyone saying “hurr durr everyone is doing it, they’ll have to ban the entire playerbase”
---
Tough titty. No one forced you. You likely were well aware it was happening like most were. It wasn’t a secret dupes were rife. There are rules that mostly were brazenly broken by you and people like you. I also have no doubt most minor infractions are being suspended and will be unbanned soon, but still. 
---
You agree to a whole bunch of terms etc when you play most games, especially online. It’s the bit no one ever reads but it still applies. 
---
I haven’t been banned because I didn’t do anything, like a lot of people didn’t. I’m also sure there’s a lot of smug bastards who did a lot wrong and somehow dodged it. 
---
But you roll them bones thems the breaks and the risk you take. 
---
I have no sympathy. People that get away with it aren’t in a rush to turn themselves in, in a fit of altruism so complaining when you did and got caught but using the Shaggy defence is mind boggling.
---
Almost all my friends got it. Dozens of people and some of them didn't dupe.
---
Imagine comparing slavery to a video game glitch
---
Yeah make them earn their keep by manning a stall for you to sell your own stuff. Not Beckett's overpriced booze that I find so easily in dumpsters or on pre war corpses. The only price you pay then is your human decency
---
I mean if the dominate everything
---
Then they are clearly doing all the work 
---
Soo they earned it right?
---
They’re delaying it for now, likely as a result of the ongoing auto completion bugs and changes being made to the amount of dailies available. Honestly, the right move. They shouldn’t ask for money until the system is 100% working properly. 
---
Aside from that, even if they enable it next week, wait until closer to the end to use Atoms. Even if you’re not grinding the challenges, you’ll still rank up between now and then. Those later ranks are worth a lot more than the early ones, but still only cost 150 atoms.
---
I read about a guy on FB that it took eight months for him to get off his ban. His biggest gripe was that he missed out on a lot of events and their rewards.
---
Hey some of us power armour users are wearing full unyielding inside that tin can. It's a kink.
---
Yup :) Makes me all warm inside to read these posts :D
---
I think many people are basically lazy and just want Fallout 76 to be a pew pew shoot-em-up game, just with a post apocalyptic background, none of the survival aspect to bother with.
---
Pretty much no longer a Fallout game if this happens.
---
Something else would be to utilize the syringer to weaponize the in game diseases.  I'd love to be able to infect some super mutant overlords with rattlehands.
---
You’re right, advertising does have a clear definition:
---
“to announce or praise (a product, service, etc.) in some public medium of communication in order to induce people to buy or use it”
---
https://www.dictionary.com/browse/advertise?s=t
---
Exactly what they did by even mentioning those possible future features.
---
Maybe they'll let us turn in gold scrap for treasury notes, or as a daily quest. But they're not gonna let us skip the timegate *that* easily.
---
Apparently even having any of these duped weapons is ground for a ban. Didnt touch any of this stuff at all ive been hearing about, my buddy finally made me cave in and handed me a some legacys the other night. Hopped on the game this afternoon to a account not authorized message and an email saying its under investigation. I paid for a year of fallout first so if they think they can just disable my account without a reason and still take my money they got another thing coming.
---
It is.  But like the robot one, you kill as instructed and yet no points were given despite marked as complete
---
It's like buying stolen stuff from someone. You can't know for sure if it's stolen or not but you can get in trouble if it actually is.
---
You realize most of the "high end items" circulating ingame are the fruits of previous dupes? I would just about everyone that trades on the subreddit or trades on Facebook has been in possession of one or more duped items.
---
Not yet, but the Backwoods Bungalow came back this week
---
If you come across a explosive legacy in a player vendor would you buy it?
---
Do legendary fixers even drop? Or is it purveyor exclusive? I have the plan but I have never seen a legendary fixer drop before. About level 155 now.
---
No... if anything I assume they would turn it off and if people wanted to use food and drink for buffs they could. Extra “min/maxing”, but then they’d need to refund all of the levels spent on the perk cards.
---
It's more like panic reaction from Bethesda to check accounts in time
---
Are you new around here? /s
---
Sorry but that's an old bug from when it was first released. To my knowledge you still can't place the armour workbench in there even with the rug glitch.
---
Yeah, fuck that. Im in builder to get more exp on westtek burrows, capital etc. You changing that to be selfish will get me out of your group and stadting a newone instantly
---
.....why would we need a VPN to login to the game?
---
The market and economy is already pretty dead after this wave but hopefully I’ll be able to sell some items at my camp again. 🙏
---
I was wandering around, thinking wtf has everyone gone?
---
Well it would mean nerfing every gun in the game because they're duping any guns they have and its working. They'll just get bans.
---
Still going on lmao wave 4/6 now prob
---
Mmmmmmmmm yes, more tears about it.  MOAR TEARZZZ
---
Probably like 2500$
---
I got a TSE one and named it Devastator!
---
Are you going to feel that way if your account gets caught up in this? I know for a fact there are people getting banned that didn’t dupe and didn’t have any duped items. I agree that if you take the risk then you deserve the consequences, but it’s unfair to lump everyone that’s gotten the ban into the same group. This could potentially hurt the player base, and that’s the last thing the game needs. I understand that this is the easiest way for Bethesda to handle the situation, but I’m not sure it’s the best way.
---
You could have at least sold it to a robot.
---
 Agree! Thats my set up^^
---
Drugs and alcohol
---
Edit, weapons and ammo too
---
As I posted on another thread, I found it funny they issued the bans right before customer service shut down for the day.
---
The wave is mass suspending accounts with suspicious activity, and they will be manually reviewing them to determine if there was any cheating. This was all explained in the email they sent you that is also circulating around here and all relevant discords atm
---
Bethesda after life😂
---
Funny to see CM's say team is still working on adrenaline and SBQ fix when both those issues have existed for many months, adrenaline is pretty much a launch issue as well and was previously fixed and now broken.
---
Dude wtf lol
---
But you get an opportunity to return the stolen goods. Not instantly thrown into jail.
---
After you unlock it on the legendary run (5th reward) it should be listed under "resources" in the CAMP build menu, if I'm not mistaken.
---
There are people playing this game who think of $300 the way you think of $3...
---
Well, kinda sounds like it is your problem, since you’re the one being impatient.
---
I tried it and no, it doesn't seem like it. I'd love to be proven wrong on this tho
---
That's because the people that has standards, normal people, most of them stopped playing the game already. Most of those who are left are either new players who haven't noticed this game's biggest flaws or veterans who will buy anything bethesda wants them to buy. Reddit has never been a place where you read unbiased opinions, ever.
---
Not with their current limits.
---
God mode will get you banned.
---
That’s all I’ve been waiting to do lol. Thought that was a semi original idea. Guess not!
---
I didn’t check the email thanks for notifying me. I hope it doesn’t last too long.
---
People have been calling for a bloodied nerf for over a year now, it's probably not coming at this point. If it didn't come with wastelanders, I doubt it will come any time soon
---
Yeap!
---
I believe this option only works if you have the Santatron from Christmas. And the gifts are toys and stuff. Quite good for screws from the.. yellow horse toy
---
Looks like a ton of people got banned, some innocent, some probably not. I feel for you, as I'm in the same boat. I think they are banning anyone who has certain weapons in their stash or inventory.
---
Not that I even need one, but I kept searching for one of these B2525 fixers that people were "just handing out at train stations".  Didn't have any luck with that.
---
Then you never saw a real bloodied melee player rushing through the events and one hitting every enemie
---
You might want to check your post history before feigning innocence..
---
Edit: OP edited post. Initially claimed to have been banned for trading with someone who duped. Now openly admits they were duping.
---
Seriously odd. So glad to have shitty weapons now.
---
You want the survival aspect to be as realistic as possible while we are also shooting laser weapons at megasloths and nuclear bat-dragons?
---
ETA: lol, downvote me because you know it's true😄😄
---
Yeh i remember that announcement your right / i had the problem for a long while and fixed it as i explained ,.. maybe im just bugthesdead
---
Personally I think they've hurt themselves a lot with this game so monetizing it more probably wouldn't hurt anything more than it already has, also the only thing that works in this game reliably is the monetization
---
As a CS:GO player, I'm very used to the "i got banned but didn't do anything wtf" posts every time a ban wave hits. Always get a good laugh out of it though, some of the stories are quite elaborately crafted
---
See, I can tell when something is haunted and that is hella haunted.
---
Yea because workshop pvp is so much fun? You are building a thing and someone bunny hops in presses V, and kills you before you can even respond. 
---
Sad thing is a small ten second countdown, telling both parties, pvp will start in ten seconds would sort of fix it and make it more fair?
---
Wouldn’t you need to take that up with Microsoft if you’re on Xbox? PlayStation charged me for 1st, not Bethesda.
---
unless you are using non-legendary gear, you probably have a duped item.
---
Yeah I picked up a turret circuit board somewhere but this is a bit more than that. Initially I could still only turn his quest in once a day like normal. This week or so something has further glitched out because yesterday alone I could turn it in 3 or 4 times over the course of the day. Id log in and get the alert for the quest
---
Do you mean grahm, was it the legendary legacy varient or a black power rifle with the legendary effects?
---
What is the subject line of the ban email and the sender name? Asking for a friend that needs to urgently go check his email before deciding how to spend his leisure time tonight.
---
I want Festus shooting lasers from his eyes.
---
They are getting rid of the penalties.  I think the mechanic is neat, but aggravating at times, especially when you have no disease cures, get the dreaded parasites or dysentery, and are in a drawn out queen battle.  I appreciate the survival element, but won’t miss it.
---
Yeah or look at all the accounts that “magically” had like 10 or more legacies appear in their inventory during the time this exploit was made public. It’s no coincidence everyone is running around with the exact same insane godrolls within the past 3 days..
---
You can build quite uniquely because of the clipping issue, my vendors fit much better when half of them go through the wall
---
What if they didn't know the weapons were duped, though? A smart duper would sell at market value (instead of lower, which gives them away), and the buyer would have no idea unless they knew each other personally.
---
I strongly suspect they're just taking every "hack/exploit" report seriously at the moment and swinging the banhammer wildly, expecting innocent people will come back if they get unbanned in a few days.
---
Be thankful, as it appears to be getting people banned just for having one
---
Following post as ive got the same issue
---
yeah, that's probably why the games are getting progressively more "streamlined".  
---
seems weird to me that people would jump into a game about post apocalyptic survival and then complain about what little survival mechanics are in it.  
---
if you want Pew pew run and gun play any of the thousands of shooters out there, stop trying to change existing games.
---
Stop gatekeeping. Nothing you said went over my head.
---
I never “feigned innocence” the title of my post is Ban me? Fine. I traded a bunch of shit this weekend. However, I did not participate in the exploit itself on this account. Again, it is not my responsibility to ascertain where the traded items are sourced. 
---
My getting banned has nothing to do with them continuing to charge me for a service they’ve banned me from.
---
You are not my judge jury and executioner. Move along.
---
That’s not how a service works lol. You don’t pay a subscription now for a feature not included but may be down the road.  That doesn’t make any sense. 
---
I’m a lawyer. I specialize in estate planning. Let’s say I tell you I hope to get into IP law in the future. Am I advertising those services if you pay me a retainer? No because I don’t currently offer those services lol.
---
Unless they said “these are included with your subscription” it wasn’t an advertisement lol
---
I've gotten them from events so I don't see why they wouldn't drop normally.
---
The gold handmade was literally just there. In a bundle, but still
---
Hate the game, not the player.
---
You can't know for sure, but if there is a very public dupe wave going on and everybody is selling the same god tiers for 1/10th of their price from a week ago, you may have to use a bit of common sense on that one
---
Lmao I’d dupe just to get this experience!!
---
Talk to the bartender first. I tried it and it worked, ymmv.
---
I get what you're saying but come on man there were some people who weren't a part of duping and got banned. I just want to play the game again...
---
Yeah, they should've smelted it into scrap, and then sold the scrap to a vendor bot. It sells for a decent amount.
---
Gold scrap can be sold directly, it doesn't need to be bulked. So you don't need to worry about it affecting your reserves of plastic.
---
Dude you are fucked in the head. That analogy not only does not apply to this situation, it's fucked up. 
---
What platform are you on? I need to avoid you at, like, all costs.
---
Not unwelcome no but I wish we could turn in more than 20 a day. I already have a decent sized backlog to turn in
---
Join new server, speak to the duchess first, then buy it
---
I just want less daily limits, but I’m not holding my breath for that.
---
To be fair things were comical the last couple of days.
---
Even found a lad who had a 3 story building with an outside wall basically wallpapered with every sort of op weapon up for trade... 😂
---
They are more focused on banning people atm. Its a good day
---
Even if it isn’t the persons fault for become god mode?
---
 "For no reason"
---
"became god mode during pvp battles" 
---
..in plural mind you.\* slow clap \*
---
Is the team aware that all multi-shot weapons (shotguns, beam split energy weapons and even two-shot) are bugged to do less damage out of VATS and more damage within it?
---
I have 15 strength and go with Barbarian, Blocker, Iron Fist, Incisor, and Martial Artist all at level 3, and I use a deathclaw gauntlet that does the trick pretty well. I'm no expert but this seems to work for me!
---
Right i get you, the way you worded it kinda sounded like you were pointing out he did use excessive force in his retaliation. As in bombing the camp *just for that* would have been "unjustified".
---
The robot one awarded at 3/5 FYI
---
Yeah, but what other service will both kick you off and continue to charge you? Seems like they should be responsible for not being predacious, not the consumer
---
Okay I was wondering like, I saved up these atoms and the "rank up" button is still grayed out. I'm assuming they'll have it up and running here soon, that's money for them
---
😂 I thought my server was laggy
---
Well then if trading for duped items was the case I would’ve been banned around the first 5 months of the game along with a majority of others when there were even bigger duped exploits. I remember being given at the time a duped weapon which to my knowledge didn’t know was duped until told afterwards being a TSE Handmade. If Bethesda cracked down on people who traded for duped weapons/armor then I would be long gone from this game but since I wasn’t I didn’t see any harm in trading for weapons that i know were duped. I didn’t know that trading is somehow an offense to the rules since it’s literally an in-game function
---
Because there was a technical or logistical error of some kind.
---
Yeah you can probably assume any features or content will arrive seven months later than they say.
---
&gt;This account has been temporarily suspended pending investigation. 
---
It doesn't mean forever. It just means you got flagged for something.
---
Yeah it wont let you change at workshops. Must just be coincidence that my terminal didn't work yesterday.  
---
\*EDIT\* Just checked, mine is still bugged at my base, I probably just need to store it and place it down again.
---
Delayed. There’s been official announcement.no reason given, but likely to do with the score bug, and it not looking good offering purchases for it when a lot have been screwed by a huge bug. 
---
Also, considering what appears to be happening as we speak, I’d be very surprised if the current ban wave wasn’t a factor also, and they’re focusing on sorting that instead.
---
It’s a coding thing. It doesn’t care about intent.
---
Oh man, I didn't know a double explosive flamer even existed. Guess they're being passed around like candy now though
---
Maybe just wait until tomorrow, it says after 2 weeks so maybe they mean 15 days?
---
well played, Sir !
---
Literally a ghost town
---
Lost 4000 just by logging most of weekly done :(
---
It’s scary, hasn’t happened to me yet but the fact that it could when I’m already behind?
---
Some people dont wanna finish it. I dont, I just want my firefly lanterns so I can quit getting on every day, atleast make sure I get those and then I can go back to... doing nothing... hmm..
---
My buddy did and he doesn’t dupe at all . Submitted a ticket to Beth awaiting on a email .
---
You could upload pics to imgur then post the link here
---
Do a charge back on your card. Don't come here spouting shit about getting banned for trading with someone. You were banned for duping. 
---
&gt;&gt;I was banned for trading with someone who apparently had duped weapons
---
That's you feigning innocence
---
&gt;H: 20+ bss str items, 30+ b2525 items, 50+ quality legacies to pick from
---
That's why you got banned.
---
Everyone doesn’t need the literal best weapon in the game..I hope they find a way to delete this recent wave at least because everyone suddenly felt entitled to the rarest and best version of a weapon just because they saw videos or others with it. There are plenty of other godroll weapons that will carry you, you don’t need the most insane version in EVERYONES inventory especially due to an exploit that should result in a ban.
---
They stated pre-Wastelanders release that they were pushing that back for review, IIRC.
---
"It's not my fault I duped items".
---
Mate, seriously... 😂
---
You got exactly what you deserved. I only hope the ban is permanent for you and rest of the people who duped in the past few days. The less there are people like you in the game, the better it gets.
---
So trading is against the law? Cause if thats the case I would’ve been banned within the first 5 months of the game for trading for duped stuff.
---
The wording came out wrong or the way you read it. I accidentally became god mode by someone.
---
This makes no sense
---
Bethesda don't understand bullion. The legendary run gives amounts of 25, Nobody turns in 1 note a day. Most people end up with more notes than they will ever turn in just completing a set of armor. They do however give 150 atoms, which whilst low is still a reasonable amount as that about equals 2 high tier challenges.
---
Top lad, I imagine it gets a bit frustrating answering the same questions day in day out on here and on the forums, keep on keepin on
---
I read that as a fetus shooting lasers from its eyes at first, I'd definitely spend atoms on that.
---
They are opinions. Nothing more
---
Hey guys Is there anywhere I can find people who are going to drop nukes or to let them know im going to drop one?
---
Weird same ones on ps4 too
---
Don't cheat, don't get banned.
---
No, Microsoft doesn’t know you’ve been banned. If you wanted to unsubscribe normally, you’d contact Microsoft, not Bethesda. Microsoft is the agent of payment and until you tell them you don’t want it anymore they’ll continue to charge you. If this all happened today it would be pretty difficult for Bethesda to notify them in time to stop you from being charged.
---
You lost me at “it’s not my fault I duped items, it’s Bethesda’s fault”. Honestly you didn’t really have me to begin with. What you did very clearly violates their Terms and conditions. 
---
Also, while it’s just a game and you aren’t “hurting” anyone, it definitely makes a mockery of a lot of the grinding and trading some of us did. To be honest I spent more than a month working up the trade ladder to land a tattered field jacket. They’re going for like 10k caps now. That sucks man, makes all that time I spent feel wasted. I’m glad you and your friends have cool guns now, I’m sure some of the guns I’ve traded for recently are copies. I just don’t think this a completely innocent move.
---
&gt;from friends and groups I'm part of alot of mules and mains are being hit  
---
Have you guys tried not duping?
---
You will. Just not yet. 
---
As I just said elsewhere I wouldn’t be surprised if this current ban wave was partly the reason for the delay, and they’re focusing on sorting that. 
---
Also other reasons, like it probably looking pretty shitty to offer that service when there’s a major bug regarding the event and earning of points.
---
It doesn't matter if you've been duping. If you are in possession of a duped item you will be getting banned
---
Not banning cheaters hurts the player base as well. What the game needs is bans, bug fixes, and a balance pass. 
---
Hopefully this is the first step.
---
Well that explains the arguing back and forth lol. Agree to disagree man. All good.
---
Sounds good. Thanks for the help.
---
Good riddance. You deserve it.
---
I wish they focused more on hacking in NW. Duping is not good, I get it, but affordable prices on good items are not going to ruin your ingame experience as being shot through the wall in NW.
---
&gt;H: Bulk leader bobbles
---
Define "bulk".
---
Yeah it give you back as much as you put in. So if you use the random bonus crafts it's infinite. Might work with the break down perk too since it's a wep
---
We still got no fix for adrenalin and that shit real old so im worried
---
If you spent real money on the items you 100% deserve the ban. RMT or real money trading is a bannable offence in lots of online games, including fallout 76 ik guessing
---
Shit, I had someone drop me 25 presents, I hope thats not grounds
---
right, ty
---
LOL.  Cheaters never prosper. Hope its permanent.
---
Imagine being so narrow in your mindset that you need everything to be a proportional comparison. It’s called perspective on right and wrong and pointing out the technicalities people rested their arguments on... not the actual thing itself.
---
Steam account?
---
First you need to learn the plan then you will be able to craft the armour at an armour workbench
---
I used to have this autocomplete thing going on too. I used to play nw b4 the adventure mode and when I went on am, I had a few quests fulfilled. wtf?? It was irritating at first, thought it was a glitch and hoped it would eventually correct itself. After a couple of weeks, I just started playing adventure mode first, then nw when I felt like playing. Never had the 'problem' since. I am not sure how other players get their things autocompleted, but it has been over 6 months now and did not know this was still a thing.
---
legendary modules? 
---
have you learned the plans?
---
That is particularly shitty considering it’s a well known and major bug, but still. Who knows man.
---
They’re currently going scorched earth on duper’s and recipients so 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I guarantee that it will be the first thing they will be fixing since it affects their money flow.
---
You knowingly traded for a duped item twice and then tried to hide them. It just takes them time to catch up.
---
Temporary pushed back a few days at least according to Bethesda.
---
So what you're saying is everyone that has a legacy gun will be getting banned lol
---
I don’t think we violated anything at all, this isn’t actually cheating, every player just hopped on it that Bethesda included an unintended glitch in the game which allowed people to get their dream items. I’m surprised they allow hackers to freely wander but once everyone did this dupe glitch they decided that it was more important to investigate accounts rather than fix the game lol
---
Ok thats true
---
Eh I read/learn the plans like any other and they aren't showing up.
---
Ah okay cause I got a bunch of atom to spend.
---
Basically. That's how bethesda seems to be handling it. I think anyone not caught duping but has duped items will have their account investigated then decides
---
Those with loads of rare weapons, those with very high SCORE and those who have used god mode, all/many suspended
---
That is just 100% not true.
---
u just had too many items of same type, for example christmas presents/boobleheads/ or dupped rare guns more than one
---
I mean ai think the people aelling should be banned but you shouldnt be banned for buying
---
Here's the thing: I don't trust any of you enough to join a 'team' with you. Even if this community is typically a lot less toxic than most gaming communities, I've had too many bad experiences with people to really trust other gamers. 
---
Especially since I play on PC. With the number of hacks and bugs that have been exploited in the past, I don't want to let my guard down *that one time* and join a group, only to have all my inventory emptied and my gear stolen.
---
No shit it's against the tos. I highly doubt that's why I'm banned tho.
---
Festus would make a great vendor.
---
That's what I've heard anyways. I'm just relaying a message.
---
Those abs (flab’s?) will haunt my dreams.
---
I was talking about legacies
---
I would say any "god tier" weapon or armor that has been traded within the last year has a very high chance of being a dupe. Most players that have been playing a while more than likely have a duped weapon/armor, whether they are aware of it or not. Bethesda needs to come out with unique ID's for items so they can actually track when something is duped and stop it before it floods the market. Don't like seeing people getting a temp ban just for buying items, as you don't know if they actually know if it's duped or not. And you can't ban a player for buying anything that they may know is duped because at the end of the day they used the game properly while buying/trading with another player. It's a terribly broken system that Bethesda needs to address.
---
LOL !  no, i don't think that was my intention but I've looked at this every few days trying to figure out what i meant.  maybe Karen was calling you ???  IDK.  please don't kill me (in Fo76)
---
I wonder if someone got their Fixer with the same effects by legitimate means through either vending (before the dupe wave) or the purveyor how would Bethesda know, code possibly?
---
Damnmmmmnnnnn. You Thicker than a Snickers bro. Lemme smash?
---
Yeah only power armor users are capable of such things. It's not possible to do that with a bloodied explosive handmade with a full set of unyielding armor.  (Yes that was sarcasm).
---
I know legendary armor cultists  and stealth builds hate power armor and love talking shit about it..  Well tough shit.  Some of us love the feeling of being a walking tank with a big gun.  Get over it.
---
&gt;it just works
---
I'd like to think that would be most accounts then especially those who trade on the trade-sub
---
Isn't it incredible how the guy with the best weapon somehow hasn't figured that out by now?
---
Lol, you do realize that the only reason why everyone even has good items now is because of players like me who have duped right? I don’t see the harm in what players did considering that it doesn’t actually affect trading whatsoever, it just allows every player to get their dream items. You probably have duped items in your inventory right now, just because you were able to buy something from caps doesn’t take you out of the question that you also were a part of the dupe train.
---
I’ve got chinese stealth which I like, the excavator PA which I don’t use much apart from lugging stuff about and another set of T51 which I never use but just keep. The SS vendor wanted like 350 Gb for one piece and I have no idea how to get more Gb right now or how you would unlock pieces so I thought I’d wait. I’ve been collecting scorchbeast wings for the Ultracite I just really don’t like wearing PA.
---
If I do get banned for the reason of it being god mode is there any way I can maybe get un banned?!
---
You must be new to Bethesda games.  Just because they say something in writing, doesn't mean that they will do it.
---
Im glad for the garage finally and I am pleasantly surprised they only want 500 atoms for it. 
---
Does anyone know if they have fixed the "walkthrough" glass on that camper thing since the bundle is back in the shop?
---
did you not buy mod plans? If you're not sure go see regs and see what plans are known
---
That's not how things work fam. You got caught cheating. That's the risk you take when you cheat. Get over it.
---
I have two characters. My bloodied sniper pumps out challenges and xp, and my PA heavy gunner for when I want to have fun or do stuff with friends.
---
/u/GladeusExMachina beat me to it - I was going to offer a dog meat steak and some spoiled brahmin milk on PS4.
---
&gt;I Just Twerks
---
Go Read the TOS and see if you still think that. You agree to not take advantage of bugs/glitches, which would including duping etc.   
---
You have only yourself to blame.
---
You sure you bought armor plans and not mods, right? 🤔
---
I'm from steam, and I don't have this problem
---
Which one? Can you get email notification for discounts?
---
Where are people selling/trading these duped weapons? I actively trade on the trade sub and haven’t seen any dupers or duped weapons
---
Even if they gave us 100% you know you'd miss.
---
Shielded casual underarmor plan. Only rewarded for queen of the hunt quest.  Rare. Many folks know it though.  What platform
---
It was rabbiting on about used toilet paper today ha ha
---
Nope actually they are the one publisher I play most of their games. This just first time I've personally experienced anything that a setback
---
They would have suspended first, then will investigate...
---
If there is no Ingame message why is the send message function there
---
Depends on what you need though not all may be available in the store right now. 
---
* Scrap Collectron 
---
* Communist Collectron (Propaganda flyers, some aid items, occasional gun I believe)
---
* Fasnacht Collectron (food aid, drinks, best thing here I’ve heard is the Royal Jelly) 
---
* Raider Collectron (ammo, chems, guns)
---
So while not all may be in the store right now, once you buy 1 you can buy another and you’ll have both resource options regardless of which you have set up. So you can own all of them but set out the basic scrap one to collect Fasnacht stuff for you.
---
Yeah, I wish cheaters get perma banned, if you were talking about everyone that duped, then I’m sorry, they’ll have to ban nearly every player because guess what, nearly everyone that isn’t a new player will have duped items in their inventory, including yourself.
---
"I never robbed the bank, I merely drove the getaway car."
---
Ok I’m online now. Sorry was working still lol
---
I get the bethesda gear ones
---
lol.. packs of 10k gifts..
---
packS.. multiple..
---
tens of thousands of gifts..
---
why am I banned?
---
derp...
---
You and your friends deserve a bans. You are not welcome, go away morons
---
I Have it, It uses roughly the same as the seedy shed or traincar. around 200hundred units(a sign or a lightbulb uses 20-40 units. I use the Intraw mod on pc to get a better idea on how to use my budget. you cant build more than three of any of them at once as they count as the same object in the build count limit.
---
Yeah, they’ll also have to blame nearly every other player who buys stuff out of vendors or picks up items from other players.
---
Interesting, I had heard that it was to do with copies purchased there.
---
At least now I know I’m not doing this for nothing
---
that's right and that's why
---
No my email is an email I created at the time I made my Xbox account like 10 years ago. its an outlook email (they used to give you an option to create an email instead of provide one) that I'm not even sure I can access.
---
But the person I was pvping with *caused* me to have god mode by killing me with a legacy.
---
Np. I sent you an invite. I’ll be at vault 76
---
&gt;  I think everyone by now probably has a B 25 25 fixer
---
this is not true
---
If your on Xbox, I’d be willing to trade it
---
They are. I finally got the Elder paint a couple weeks ago. They are a very low drop rate though.
---
Just be aware that they drop in order once the previous one is learned. If you obtain one out of order from a player and learn it then none of the ones that come before it will drop
---
Gotta burn the devs for not reading the ITV articles
---
IMO I dont think you got banned for 10Ks of gifts. What most likely happened is that the person you bought it from duped/glitched/etc, and they checked friendlist/people who got items from this person, so the hammer swiped you as well.
---
how “noble” of you to dupe items for the masses.. get over yourself cheater.
---
and no i don’t have duped items so i won’t get banned either
---
Well I’d recommend you stay away. :/ 
---
Edit: not sure what the downvoted are for pretty sure the one I had is why I got banned
---
Join me, I'll make it for you.
---
I rolled a new character when I got a B25 UGL and haven't looked back.  Either change your build, or create a new character and transfer the gun over.  One shotting things one at a time might be fun, but the sustained firehose of damage that gun will throw out with a properly spec'd character is awe-inspiring.  I can face-tank the queen or wendigo colossus and not break a sweat.  Hordes of glowing ones?  Melt.  Prime that bad boy and double all your fusion cores into Ultracite cores, Power User + Batteries included, and spit green death at anything foolish enough to get in your crosshairs.
---
No ones getting banned for having a single copy of a weapon, no need to fear monger my dude. Dupings been an ongoing problem since the game came out, and the response is now predictable.
---
Those that have 30 of each on the other hand...
---
Never had this happen to me also didnt know this was how vendors worked, read this post; «oh didnt know that» plays game with 29600 caps, boom someone buys all my shotgun ammo (2k or so) and I only got 400 caps, lol 
---
Should have taken the precautions
---
Feels like I'm playing XCOM again with so many 95% missed VATS
---
Agreed. So funny all these people toting on about not having duped items. Get real. You got duped shit! And I’ll be laughing my ass off when they get banned and come on here crying lol
---
Bethesda didn't charge you, Microsoft did. Cancel the subscription, or contact your card issuer.
---
Like the garage (love it's price), definetly going to buy it.  
---
No poodle skirt again, tho... it's never coming back, and when it will, I'll be out of atoms for sure.
---
I'm a new player, I don't have any god roll weapons and the best weapons I have came from purveyor rolls and boss drops, try again. Actually you know what? Don't. You duped. You are a cheater. I hope you stay banned. There is no argument you can make that will make me think any different.
---
Elder dropped for me yesterday guys but it's been months since the previous paint dropped for me
---
I got it, as someone said under, highlight the option and it tells you what you need to build. It's a few things this time for the weekly!
---
buy Saturday night or sunday the whole day. other days of the week do not work for me
---
Yeah, and over half the players, probably even more, have used this dupe glitch. And I’m pretty sure over 90% of the active players are in possession of duped items whether it be weapons/armour or stackables.
---
I’m not trying to man, I’ve never had more than one copy of anything yet here I am.
---
Where are people selling/trading these duped weapons? I like to legit trade on the sub, am I dealing with dupers and duped items?
---
Get ready to be playing alone lol
---
I'm since launch and never got even a duped present. Deserved ban imo
---
Crafting secret service armor requires a "legendary module" which you can buy from murmgrh at the rusty pick.
---
I know I’m currently suspended. I’m saying *if*.
---
Some great tips here. Thanks you. I swapped Barbarian for Blocker and started looking at the other things you mentioned.
---
Does Long Shot work with Vats or only outside of it?
---
Have you been playing nw recently on PC? People have been saying hacking doesn't occur at all almost.
---
I wish it were! I’m still stuck with my 2* mutant’s FF ;-;
---
Stop calling it a limited event. Find me any source that indicates it is a temporary one time event. You are making that shit up. They refer to in their own documentation as a seasonal release content cycle. Their web page for it is called "seasons". Plural. It is named Season 1 because there will be a series as in season 2, 3, 4 etc. 
---
&gt; irrelevant to the topic at hand - SCORE
---
It is irrelevant because it hurts your point deeply. The entire game is designed to be slow. They have said it in interviews (looking for the source now) that they designed it to be a slow burn that you cannot beat or complete quickly and it takes time. This is a core design decision. So its extremely relevant because every mechanic they add will take that into account like with the legendary perk system and ammo converter. 
---
&gt; I will get to the end with no problem before the end of the season with no money needed to be invested.
---
Good for you? I have over 800 hours in fallout76 before the season came out. I have been playing the past two weeks daily again for 2-3 hours a session and launching 2-3 queen nukes per session in addition to doing settler dailies and I am level 13 in the season pass. I refuse to do more of the same boring ass challenges that have always existed (gather wood, create cement) What is even worse is that the official pre launch FAQ for the season mistakenly said event XP contributed to SCORE which was false implying they gaffed even harder than normal, or it originally was set up that way which means it was again modified after the marketing materials were made to be artificially slow. If it did include event XP, I probably would not be complaining as most of the content in this game is repeatable events and I do them all regularly. 
---
If you will not acknowledge the score system is both excessively grindy, and also buggy to the point of being not worth pursuing then I am no longer interested in this discussion as you are in fantasy land. Go to new at any time in the past 2 weeks in this forum since patch day or the official fallout 76 general discussion forum and you will see consistent and constant complaints from users on all platforms raging about it. Can you overcome it especially with dxp active, sure. Does that make it any less grindy or broken? No. In addition the rewards themselves are currently buggy as fuck like the leather ghillie suit. 
---
&gt; the fact is, that the SCORE system is completable, even with Bugs, without spending any cash on it.
---
No shit. It has to be otherwise they are just selling you more content with the atom store v2. The problem is the time investment is out of whack and ITS BY DESIGN because most sane people wont spend 81 hours doing 1 thing in a game toward a consistent goal, they will play for 30 mins a day like they already do and go "Oh shit I am only 1k atoms away from the sweet glow in the dark wallpaper" and they will pull out their credit card and spend 10 bucks on it. That is the purpose of the system and it does its job well. 
---
&gt; but given the state of the game, you shouldn’t be surprised when they just pull the plug instead.
---
I doubt very seriously this will happen given the resounding success of Fallout 1st and the atom shop. That is why the toxic buggy shit keeps flowing and why two years later we are complaining about the same shit because just like with 3 and 4 and skyrim, they do what they want and the money keeps flowing. 
---
&gt; And let’s not get into a dick measuring contest
---
How many hows do you have in the game? It is not a trump card but it is very relevant to me understanding your perspective.
---
just because you can ...  it’s bethesda’s game design, let’s just be happy the stopped certain areas being nuked
---
&gt; Lol, you do realize that the only reason why everyone even has good items now is because of players like me who have duped right?
---
LOL, you're implying I have good items.
---
I don't.
---
Well thanks for the info. Probly shouldn’t be too surprised, the approach Bethesda uses isn’t exactly surgical. Then again if it was you’d have gotten banned all the same. So good luck on your gaming travels.
---
That I can understand and potentially get on board with. To be honest this thread was just about the 6th I’d opened and they were all ridiculous and excusing behaviour whilst in the next breath openly admitting to it. Only so much of that you can take without wondering if the world has gone mad. 
---
A lot of people will get unbanned. From a player perspective it’s probably not the best way to go about it, but I don’t know the logistics and effort on their side. Considering Beth get a lot of heat about being all about the mighty dollar, one can only assume they know something we don’t and it must be the lesser of two evils to them. 
---
I’m sure they don’t REALLY care about one dude buying a weapon unknowingly. But it never ends there, does it and it tends to be much more then that in the wider community. 
---
I still have no sympathy for this latest one. Bringing up old ones doesn’t really matter when this banwave is obviously a reaction to THIS dupe round. The info was everywhere and common sense would tell you if you suddenly get offered weapons you couldn’t buy for your firstborn, suddenly show up everywhere, it’s probably linked to the dupe or at least suspicious.
---
What kind of stuff were you duping and what did you do with all the duped goods?
---
This is not how it works.
---
Just like nobody in jail is a criminal, just ask them :-)
---
I'm the opposite, I quite like the amount of heavy lifting they do in the likes of Line In The Sand or Radiation Rumble. I still contribute as best I can, but I'm very aware that the events would be much more likely to fail without these guys there. And if I miss the odd legendary then that's a shame, but I'm making my peace with the fact I'm not always going to get a hit on a legendary enemy in public events.
---
(If anyone's wondering why I'm not getting in power armour and doing said heavy lifting too: I intend to get various PA/heavy weapon perks to allow me to swap them in &amp; do that, but I haven't got all the cards for my "main" build yet so it'll have to wait for now.)
---
Depends on how they're investigating the bans, we have no idea what kind of player info they track. But thats beside the point, you were banned and you just admitted to duping, what exactly are you trying to argue here? You only did it because you thought everyone was going to go ham on the duping and therefore there would be too many people to ban?
---
Known secret service jetpack armor.
---
Known secret service buttressed armor torso
---
I have 2 modules and plenty of vault steel.
---
Building the plasma caster and pimping it out wasnt this confusing
---
No way, I didn’t know that. You may have just sold me on this/all future Collectrons.
---
;-;
---
Apparently quite a fair bunch
---
"Charging" on a laser rifle is an automatic function. It requires no consideration by the user.
---
"I got caught cheating but it isn't my fault. It's their fault! They held my wife at gunpoint and forced me to dupe items!"
---
Yeah I took the car, but it was their fault for leaving it in the street... seems stupid I'm getting punished just because I took advantage of hotwiring
---
Sorry, but game will be better...
---
I'm genuinely uncertain why you would have trouble believing that there are people in this sub with engineering degrees whose data originates from years of experience working in the industry -- in this case, conducting user experience research for gaming companies and console manufacturers. 
---
But since your trust for people in this sub is apparently fairly low, PM me with your linkedin or career portfolio and I'll happily reply with mine. =]
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ say that to my account that no longer exists
---
No, I’m implying why most people have good items now. Some players are even happy that everyone has the opportunity to get good items so they can actually be effective in some events.
---
I thought you just have to wait. You can’t send a ticket.
---
And if you did you still have to wait.
---
I just bought some 3* gear less than 20 minutes ago..
---
Yeah I have seen tons of posts (sorting by new) people asking why they were banned. Bethesda back at it again Lol
---
90%? What are you smoking?
---
Totally agree Preston Garvey all over again...caps spent travelling just to get a diluted stimpack and a level 5 piece of crap armour
---
If you’re on PC I can mod it for you, or just give you my fully modded bloodied HM
---
Did not know this thank you for explaining!
---
Been a good development imho
---
I run full health so shit like that is useless to me anyway.. lol
---
For what reasons?
---
Damn, that's kind of harsh.
---
It's seriously overkill anyways.  I have a good fixer I stashed recently since the armco machine spits out 5.56 so damn fast.  I've been running around with a bloodied bash damage reduced weight handmade that still is OP as fuck.  Was mainly trying to find one just for my collection but glad I didn't it sounds like.
---
Even with the "good" guns I mainly use "garbage" weapons because the game is stupid easy otherwise.
---
My friend and I were both banned. We’ve traded for anything we might have and don’t have more than one copy of anything.
---
Not sure how the hammer is working but almost everything was duped I even did non legacy's to hand out to the noobs
---
I can totally agree with your opinion cause
---
First of all the glitch accured because the server laggs between server hop and sell of the item was fault 
---
And if they really cared they could have deactivated the vendor bots until they found a reasonable fix for it 
---
And just to bring up an idea how they couldve fixed it until it got patched 
---
They couldve just disabled the function to server hop from one server to another. And that you could only join a server while youre in the main menu that could be a reasonable fix without disableing the function of selling.
---
[Ticket Submission Page](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
But majority of them are idiotic, mindless posts. "it's not my fault I duped", "I haven't filed but my friend gave me duped weapons" "I've never duped but I bought 10k presents online" but some are genuine people done wrongly
---
Then bethesda should make good on the promise they made 18 months ago and make those "adjustments" that they "temporarily" removed them for
---
That's what happens when you make people play a mode they don't want to.
---
Said he spoke with some guy on the phone they submitted and he was told to keep a eye on his email . That’s all the info I have at the moment but he’s 100% legit no dupes or glitches he loves this game and wouldn’t jeopardize his account.
---
My burner account got the email but others saying they didn't get the email and got banned
---
Actually no, it’s more like this lol.
---
“Oh look, someone dropped a $10 bill on the ground, guess I’ll pick it up. Oh look, it seems like they left a trail of money for us to pick up.”
---
youre just going to get an auto response stating they havent got the tools to give players score..
---
but feel free to keep clogging up that ticket response system if it makes you feel better than just bitching about it on reddit
---
Do you have a link to this datamine, I can't seem to find it
---
Scrap ans Junk are from the Scavenger collection IIRC, the reason it’s showing up is bc you can only have one and the options carry over
---
That opens the Xbox messaging system.
---
Ever since I jumped over to Steam never had a crash.
---
Nah I saw it a while back, I defo know there's a full black suit came up. Other than that I don't know 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Most players are bloodied and can not be a conduit. We have completed the event many times without activating any pylons
---
Yeah that really its gonna cause a huge divide in the community now. They chose to do the guilty until proven innocent route, which causes alot of these problems.
---
Yea it's very frustrating,  I don't even try unless I see over 6 trying the event
---
if the sever is full of turds.. it can be arduous...
---
free market bad, give everybody op items
---
They ought to double down... making all the toilets and outhouses both functional and necessary.
---
Imagine having to battle an entire town supers while your character has to pee really bad, so there’s a perception drop
---
I am banned, and no joke, nothing duped.  This is ridiculous, I just started playing the game, I got screwed out of 1000xp points for the legendary run, and now I’m banned?
---
It was pretty fast for me. I just fast traveled there, got it, then fast traveled back. It still took a while, but it helped that I had already been everywhere.
---
On one hand, the multitude of currencies plays very much into the late progression capitalist hell that is America right before and right after the bombs. On the other, it is ridiculous from a gameplay perspective. The treasury notes and bullion introduced in Wastelanders followed by the mess of an ammo converter that relies on yet another currency makes it feel like the development team actually thinks having a bunch is a good idea. It was okay for a mole miner dealing in company scrip - makes sense in lore and it is one exclusive in-game currency separate from caps as the de facto currency for standard trade (and I love that it is scrip - something miners had to deal with in early 1900s Appalachia). Really weird to have it gifted to us after completing events now, though. If different factions each had their own exclusive currency (necessitating a money changer NPC) that would make total in-world sense and could be kind of forgiven in spite of the hassle. But just making us use a hodge podge of different units of currency/points/credit is cumbersome, tedious, and pointless. Fine if there were a means of swapping/changing between them somehow, but I feel it is getting out of hand. Just set benchmark unlocks, similar to quest rewards like ultracite PA or All Rise but make the requirements hard to meet. I get that it is much easier in terms of progress tracking to manage different currencies for different item pools, I just wish for a better or more consolidated way.
---
Highly recommend that you don’t pay atoms to skip early levels. That is assuming you want to try to finish all 100 steps. Since each step is increasing the number of SCORE points, the last few steps will be a
---
Way harder to achieve than they are now.
---
As am I, but I still try my hardest to be a conduit and stay down so other can get those hits. The main attraction for the event is the completion rewards, not the legendary that drops on the monster, I thought?
---
Just one of several LOL moments...
---
"duping doesn’t actually harm anyone"
---
So you know where the real world money from duped weapon sales goes? I would hazard a guess it's not helping kids through college.
---
So funny, thanks for crawling out your basement with such wisdoms. 🤣🤣🤣
---
it happened to me too
---
At this point. I'm not sure.  I wish the plans would show more details/graphic of what we are actually buying.
---
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you bought two mods my friend. You didn’t buy any armor to craft.
---
Creation engine can't track individual items.  It can't even do ladders you're expecting a lot
---
everyone is so salty today.. lol
---
Because you're some rando on the internet? For someone who claims to be an expert in how people interact online with years of experience, it's kinda funny how you're so baffled. 
---
That's non of your business.
---
I didnt dupe and thankfully I'm not banned but they should just keep their focus on actually making their game playable
---
In the spanish version of the game (european spanish, I mean, I don't know if there is an american one) they seem to have an orgasm when they die, It was hilarious. I like the english version better, the voices are (for the most part) better and more in sinc, but I miss the deathgasms of the green people of Appalachia.
---
(Had to change the language because it wouldn't let me play NW if not in english)
---
I get atoms from my 1st sub so I dont mind using them to buy *some* levels but yeah that would be in the last few days if im sure i wont make it to 100 without buying
---
Yeah I tried to make a post warning people to dump any godrolls they haven’t got themselves, I know too many people that have been getting banned merely for possession of one bad item.
---
No, I just find it amusing, plus all the comments are hilarious because people don’t seem to understand that they are nearly all in possession of duped items lol.
---
You're not reading right if you think I'm asking why I got banned. Just letting people know you can get it for just obtaining duped items as well (and yes I fully was aware these were duped, no one built up 10,000+ presents naturally.)
---
Secret Service Jetpack Armor is a mod for the Secret Service Armor Torso.
---
Secret Service Buttressed Armor Torso is a mod for the Secret Service Armor Torso.
---
You have the attachments, but not the plan to craft what they attach to.
---
How? You need conduits to do damage.
---
they should do it more often IMO..
---
Sometimes you can't help it cause some random barges in and starts the event for you before you can protest it
---
lol, this is what makes FO76 great. Sounds like the fault is with the poorly designed base and not with you.
---
How do you speak to them on the phone. I never heard about this. But I rather just send a ticket if I possibly can and tell I was possibly wrongly suspended.
---
Well now technically there is only 1 type :-)
---
The only rank I would consider buying is the last one...
---
Lol. When you ban all your most loyal players and biggest spenders on a free game, you lose income. Great job speeding up the inevitable death of this game, please keep banning until everyone’s gone and it’s all game pass players playing for 2 hours and uninstalling
---
Great.. so what's the correct plan then?
---
I've never duped in my life. I don't even know how, and since I buy almost nothing from player shops and don't get random gifts from players, I haven't gotten a duped item.
---
Cheating isn't 'just playing the game'. Don't dupe, even if it's possible.
---
Commando IMO, especially if you want to be competent toward other players. Oftentimes the way damage resistance works its better to get a flurry of high damage shots off quickly than a single mega damage shot.
---
I know. Usually I become all three conduits and burn through tons of stims.
---
They're worse than PA users. It's such a broken build....
---
$10 on the ground would be more like a drop from a legendary, you had to go through a process to produce a dupe, just like you have to go through a process to hotwire a car, you know it's not good but you did it anyway, blames on you kid
---
My thoughts exactly, it can be very frustrating but i can't complain too much as am a bloodied build so dont go for the pylons myself. Also really annoying when you spend caps for a keycard and wait for ppl to turn up and the fist person that does goes straight for the terminal
---
This!
---
Thanks. I imagine people have been asking for an Ingame system forever
---
Quarry X3 has a mirelurk queen.
---
I always throw a grenade in the water nearest the FT point to get her to spawn
---
Fast travel mats are in game but only in workshop build menu.
---
No. They didn't spell out in great detail how to dupe. 
---
This is more like 'it's not my fault the lock on the car didn't work, I thought they left it unlocked so anyone could drive the car'
---
Yeah it stinks too because if the player sees an awesome weapon to be traded on the cheap who wouldnt want to trade for it. They honestly need to rework their algorithm for this.
---
Dude. That’s a really bad example. I also never said I duped. You don’t know what causes the bug right?
---
The game has been out for a long time and players who have been around since the Beta have everything but their god roles. This dupe was the best thing that’s happened to the market in a long time.. caps became valuable again, outside websites trying to sell stuff for real money became obsolete and players who hoarded legacy weapons to collect dust in their stash, now lost their weird inflated egos. RNG in this game is terrible and sometimes you need a big correction in the market to encourage trading again.
---
Because a lot more people will quit if they feel fucked out of the chance to earn it but are offered to pay for it, it will rub people the wrong way and would deffo lead to more 1st cancellations and outright quitting because of it if it continues
---
Can you have two collectrons at your camp at once or only one at a time?
---
Why would you want to anyway? There's 8 weeks to go so even the most casual of players can add several ranks in that time saving money and atoms aplenty.
---
Oh, and there was an official announcement of a delay.
---
i think you're saying the same thing I'm saying.
---
Yeah rng is a pain took me 42 times to get a ss unyielding chest and it came with bad perks 😭
---
lol salty up in here
---
Yes. Newbies and ones with shit guns lolol
---
Well well! Looks like *SUGAR* ain't the ONLY THING this ***NEIGHBOR*** is bringing over to YOUR HOME, *~~BUDDY~~*  ***^(PAL)****!* 💣🍬🍧🍨🍦😲🤭🥳🎉 \~ 💣🍬🍧🍨🍦😲🤭🥳🎉 \~
---
Ah I forgot about three different Mirelurk Queen spawns, thanks for reminding me.
---
This. All of this.
---
True, but when just starting out, Ward is the better candidate since Settler rep is harder to accrue than Raider rep.
---
I want one on the record just in case for later.
---
I believe the plan to craft the chest piece costs 1250 and is called “Secret Service Chest Armor”.
---
Most ppl can’t tell you what happened in game today lol
---
Bruh what. to beth it’s literally about money and that’s it idk why u keep saying it’s making all ur efforts to find a weapons/outfits worthless, when I play the game I enjoy playing it shooting super mutants and stuff it’s not about OHHH LOOK AT THE DAMAGE LOOK AT THE WEAPON LOOK AT HOW RARE OHHHHH it’s literally that I like blowing up stationary cars and killing enemies and that’s all so I’m not tripping over it. I play on a solo server 90% of the time so maybe I’m just being ignorant but I genuinely don’t care what other players do. If you really have a problem with dupers and those people stay on a solo server dude it’s not complicated. Stop getting so personally offended over other people’s greed that you choose to acknowledge in the first place.
---
10k of them yeah
---
1 bloodied fixer.. doubt it
---
Just did my first one and got some shadowed combat armor leg plans so way stoked over here

---
Well, now we have that knowledge. Though, then again, with its new residents, perhaps it still deserves it.
---
Yup and I still live
---
I always start pvp with my handmade or fixer. If they pull a Tesla I will too. Don’t run sentinel or same quantum’s. It’s still fun. I win more than 50% of the time.
---
Everyone knows that randoms are descended from raccoons.
---
That is exactly what a duper/hacker/cheater/exploiter would say "We got wrongfully banned".
---
Hahaha. Understandable
---
Leader of the packs spawns regularly and 3 legendaries
---
Biggest tip is log out 25-30 mins before reset to ensure you get the next days challenges. It resets at 12pm est.
---
Well the guys I play with who all have 1st and dont cheat are the most loyal players, and they havent been banned, stop making shit up for being a salty cheater
---
Giving the pictures to either faction barely moves the rep bar though. Least in my case.
---
I just ignore everyone else, set my perks up and sneak around starting the pylons while spamming stims.  If I am lucky I can get a shot or two in before I have to start spamming stims again. A friend taught me this method and he and I can do it on a p t server with just the two of us.  I do like watching the chaos though...
---
Your user name makes me suspect your bias...
---
They’ve stated duping is a ban worthy offense but they have said nothing of so called contraband. If they are going to ban for inventories they need to make it clear.
---
 [Plan: Secret Service chest piece](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Secret_Service_chest_piece)

And why is that
---
That’s the one I did for the last one. Others were scorchbeast and the level 10 Grafton monster that’s at Charleston (also one wandering about not far from hemlock holes).
---
whatever it takes to get ya through the day yo...
---
If they do that they give people who were rightfully banned the opportunity to trade off or sell things that were duped. There should be some compensation for any account found to be wrongfully banned though.
---
You straight up said in the post that you had duped items. Don't really care. You're a cheater; you deserve a perma ban.
---
Update was a mess
---
Absolutely :)))
---
Actually, all you had to do was have some caps and buy stuff from a vendor, blames on Bugsthesda. Was actually waiting for them to just close vendors completely like the player vending machines.
---
Mainly because I’m sick of grinding after just getting done grinding for a full set of ss armor and a gauss shotty. Also just tired of lack of content that doesn’t require a long grind
---
Well I am not gonna let someone in my home if I can literally hear their blood boiling.
---
If those players duped weapons and stuff and even spent real money on them they can go away IMO. They ruined the economy and even caused game mechanics to be disabled or make them limited and super grindy to avoid the duping (scrip, gold bullion)
---
I don't care if you bought fo1st, you ruined the game for the rest.
---
I'll be happy even if there's only 5 players left in the whole game
---
Sorry, loyal players better play without you...
---
Ooh another good one, forgot about that event. I’ll add it to the list.
---
You can get 200 GB a day by trading Treasury Notes (You get from faction dailies and Events) but it is expensive for sure!
---
I agree the posts saying "my friend duped it, I didn't" are just as guilty as the one duping. I believe Bethesda has a trigger finger with bans as they don't have a way to really track items. I have received a temp ban before (during the display case dupe) and when I contacted Bethesda about it they responded it was because I had a high amount of ammo. I had about 75k 5mm and a few thousand of everything else. I simply responded to them "you must have never used a minigun" and waited a few days for my account to come back. So with the seasons going now I feel sympathy for the people that did wrongfully get caught up in it. The mass ban waves are not the way to go about it, but it's really all they can do until they can track items better (you know, like all other online games)
---
Exaclty people fail to realize that people who dupe are dedicated to the game therefore playing it all the time and are paying for fallout first. Not saying duping is good but this game is gonna die quickly now
---
I bush wookie the shit out of it and actually have fun doing so. Originally I only did it for the survivor rewards but now I find myself leaving adventure mode for a round or two from time to time. I just turn it into a big game of extreme hide and seek. There's a bit of a thrill when you get down to the top three or four people and you're trying to sneak around that tiny ass circle.
---
Agree! Keep the banhammer flowing! I absolutely love how people here believe these "i didn't do anything wrong" posts and downvote people who think banning is the right thing to do. So many dupers in this sub :D
---
Sooo salty. It’s like an ocean cries in here.
---
Ward finally got his shit together
---
Luckily my main didn't get hit
---
Lol are you defending people who sell items for real $$$? Despite the fact that it’s a clear statement that it’s against the ToS. Omega lol moment there 😂😂😂
---
Yeah I definitely agree the people who cheated should be banned/suspened. But it really sucks for the people that didnt do anything rather than trade for those items.
---

Looks like all the people who got banned cant play so are just on reddit sulking and downvoting the people who find it funny

They are both considered unarmed, so they cannot be used in power armor. Iron Fist buffs both of them.

I just started an alt yesterday that I’m planning on trying a stealth melee. Watched two videos that gave some good goals.

---
so, how do you buy ranks?
---
Yeah its been on for like 2 hrs or so
---
It sure was a fun weekend though. Probably the most fun I’ve had in a really really long time playing this game. Met so many new people who came back to the game after quitting due to boredom. So much fun
---
It is tho. Limitations were put in place to reduce duping. Why can't you trade bullion plans or items for instance?
---
Haha what a vague statement. They're leaving on Wednesday BET
---
tbf its always like that.. the particular subject of the cry is all that ever changes..
---
They always do. In every game.
---
They are still coming it seems
---
Actually, they're supposed to be participation trophies.
---
To be fair I spent like an hour looking for bubblegum
---
no but they offer super fast kills with garunteed spawns and you can check off a daily/weekly in seconds
---
To be fair the season should not be end game content.
---
This isn't the first time I've heard rumors of distance affecting Herd Mentality, so I just tested it. Distance does not affect the mutation.
---
What about it?
---
its in the terms and conditions to not exploit the game, there is no grounds for a lawsuit
---
Alright thanks I was asking because I wanted to use rifleman because I love the guass rifle. But if it's going to make me weaker then its probably not worth it.
---
Angry turtle too
---
Better than the shitfest dupe simulator it is now
---
do you mean yesterdays quest? coz ward doesn't have anything for another hour and ten minutes.
---
From what I’ve heard previous dupes would crash servers. This one did no such thing and they most likely banned a big percentage of players. From a business stand point this is really dumb.
---
Whats the ban wave about? I havnt played 76 in a while.
---
Gameflip prices will be back up and people will still toss money for them. Quite a lot of people did it on alternate accounts anyway. If it’s really a ban then it’s time to find a new game anyway.
---
my other comments on other posts are getting downvoted to crazy too super quick, apparently theres a lot of very salty cheaters sulking right now
---
Because dupers will find another glitch as always and they already ruined the economy, even if they patch it
---
Yup, along with Adrenaline
---
Yes. It's not supposed to be challenging. It's supposed to keep us logging in every day so we eventually pay money. That's how these things work.
---
Good point!
---
I agree, it's equal parts broken system and broken players.
---
TOS doesn’t cover their own server instability, further TOS doesn’t cover their ass in federal court. Look at games who have been sued in the past. 
---
I’m not saying I’m starting the class action, but I am
---
Willing to bet it’s coming round 2. Round 1 almost sunk this game before it had been out for a month.
---
Lol get off your high horse.
---
Yeah tbh there should be a hell of a lot of dailies to remove incentive for playing daily.  
---
You should be able to grind to catch up, not only have the P2W option.
---
They were lol, someone bought a b2525 fixer for 4 corn.. and most of the dupers were trading secretly so they wouldn’t get banned. There’s no coincidence so many legacies and fixers magically popped up within the past 3 days. Every server I’ve joined after the dupe was public,  70% of the players I encountered have legacies.
---
I can agree 
---
There are likley other dupes no one knows
---
Until now i am unbanned too xD but i dont think we are save yet
---
Well, that's bollocks. You kicked and banned me from your private for intruding while you were duping at R&amp;G Station 🖕😂
---
If you were duping, then no you deserve it
---
Yesterday, ward told me he got his eyes on me... I mean bitch. I just gave you your stolen stuff for the hundred times.
---
Yep. One of the CMs commented on another thread they will be available until Update 21 drops sometime early August (2nd I think?)
---
They should have disabled the ability to sell legendary items to vendors. That would have stopped 95% of it and wouldn't have been a huge annoyance for regular players as most junk legendaries get scripped and people getting way more than the daily limit are already hitting the cap limit from vendors anyway.
---
Take upvote. Beth simps be defending their queen.
---
It’s true. I’ve already been downvoted.  
---
Salty.
---
I am a bloodied build.  The only perks I set up are Field Surgeon under charisma and First Aid under intelligence.  I also heal myself up to half health since I dont worry about trying to kill it myself.  On average, I go through about 25 stims for an event.
---
I do use am unyielding wood armor set with one chameleon piece and 2 pieces are HTD while sneaking.  This enables me to walk among all the chaos without ever getting detected.
---
Sweet. Thanks 😁
---
I still live
---
Ok I’m starting to think your just baiting. I never said how I duped or have duped guns. I bought my guns from people using my hard earned caps. Your just heading to conclusion.
---
You need to work on your build and armor man.
---
aaaaw, cheater busted for cheating!?
---
boo-hoo.   :|
---
You missed the great dupe of 2020, a lot of people did it but they also shared and sold a lot of the duped loot. People who duped and seems like like people who have duped loot are being suspended, the biggest offenders are catching perma bans though.
---
What kind?
---
Nope. They are coming for you.
---
Be afraid. Be very afraid.
---
Awesome! I'll try it out
---
I respect a good rant and LOL at "big tin cans" but the goal of events isn't to share, it's to complete the objective, which is usually kill things as fast as possible
---
I hav had the same issue but with the weekly NW task it gave me score for the daily NW tasks but not the weekly
---
Exploitation is quite a loose term. How does one exploit their server instability. All first party as well, there is no third party exploit. They don’t pay amazon enough, they get shit servers, weapons find themselves being copied due to poor server stability. Is that really an exploit by precedent on prior events like this in other games? That’s debatable. TOS doesn’t cover their ass.
---
How ever bad the dupe glitch is,the no re spawn glitch is worse.  Focus the priorities I say.
---
Yeah I got the elder paint today after turning in hundreds. Hallelujah
---
Im shivering in my boots
---
Keep on doing that (I hear its good for you)
---
I didn't get caught my mule did :p dealer never handle drug directly
---
Not the items themselves, but they do have access to logs of you dropping/picking up/trading/etc items. Might not be impossible to just work off that to track duping more clearly. They're already somewhat doing that with the suspension wave right now anyway, I was really focusing more on the deleting part
---
You are wrong. I have some fixers, even bloodied from Murmrgh. There is no sense to have a top weapon. Can you try trolling better?
---
Ugh I thought that was like the boss or marine  chest thing sob
---
Oh cool. Sounds like I did the right thing I guess :)
---
*And then the target zone will be misaligned and not actually be on top of the antennae, but 200m to the East. You can't build there, so it's impossible.*
---
fake internet points are fake.. lol
---
Ya, people know a workaround already
---
Look, Bethesda didn't point a gun to your head and force you to dupe, so you did it out of free will. You were also aware of the risk of being banned and you probably decided to store large amounts of rare items making you a target. This is your own fault.
---
I've duped too, so if I get banned, I'll just accept it. However  , I wasn't stupid about, I did it discreetly
---
I haven't duped or bought anything duped, but I'm currently hiding under my  basement steps under a blanket hoping they don't notice I used the Raider Settlement reputation glitch with Roxy a couple of months ago to get full reputation with them......
---
That smelly smell
---
One at a time, but you can put one collectron at each workshop you own as well
---
I'll bless the game pass noobs with the last of my glitched laser 🥰 they deserve it
---
Your friend is a cheater and a duper, I’m glad he’s banned!
---
For real.  Thing takes forever to shoot
---
I don’t have the heart to glitch games man, but I did get a duped weapon or two. I swear I’m not a bad person lol.
---
Who cares.
---
If you get banned, you get banned.
---
If you don’t, whatever.
---
Caps were always valuable you’re just one of the people trying to buy legacies for caps which was never a thing because they don’t spawn anymore. They weren’t supposed to be a weapon everyone obtains just because they want it. You trying to attack people who collect is petty and sad and stems from your own jealousy because you couldn’t acquire what they had but you wanted it. This is an mmo with the highest amount of babies Ive ever seen complaining about rng and literally everything because they and you aren’t getting exactly what you want when you want it. Look at any other mmo where players are happy to earn things through rng because they earned it legit instead of crying and exploiting for it. Edit: imagine downvoting because you’re upset you can’t cheat anymore. Literally just enforces what I said. Enjoy your ban.
---
&gt; Honestly I don’t even care anymore if they ban my account for good
---
&gt;
---
Sure sounds like it with your essay defending yourself. Close the door on your way out.
---
How do I submit a ticket and get my atoms back? Like what would this be classified as? I clicked on I want a refund and it asked for order id's and stuff like that.
---
Because they are learning how to build an mmo game. That’s how it should have always been. Many many games that are not willing to invest in the infrastructure of the trade network go with account locked items.
---
I don’t care either way about duping (people denying it and moaning is different from the act itself), but I respect you somewhat for owning it unlike the other 8 posts I’ve seen blaming the tides or the dog or whatever.
---
Yep, I found a few of those and I got some Settler rep from that (not much though). And somehow after doing some quests for Rose (I think) my Raider rep went one level higher. Thanks.
---
The glitch when you die at the end of a event needs fixing real fast. Will they hell though
---
Every single quest was shit, plot was cheap and predictible. Bethesda just made a lazy job for us,the players who wanted and deserve a proper story mode. So yeah, those were anoying and boring messenger quests...
---
He did the same to me as well 😂
---
or they are rolling them in waves and your ticket hasnt been punched yet.. heh
---
Do it.  The biggest thing is to move slow and not freak out about everything going on around you.  As long as you screen says hidden or caution, you are good.  Just let the enemies do what they are doing to do.  If you take damage, it is usually from a stray shot that just happened to hit you
---
That has absolutely nothing to do with duping and exploiting things in a video game and therefore getting banned :D Keep making excuses :D Love those salty banned tears! &lt;3
---
Heard it was some issue with steam.
---
PvP is a joke.
---
Play COD
---
Do you have a Magic 8 Ball? Did you dupe it?
---
Youre probably missing some very important perk cards or have some points in the wrong spot. Id be willing to look over the build and give pointers. Pvp has a lot of little mechanics that can take a while to remember everything
---
I didn't. I'm level 206. And people always shoot at me so I shoot back. Then get ass raped everytime.
---
Yeah that one sucks.
---
Kind of feels like they want everyone to unlock this stuff. Hopefully they're clearing the way for all new items next time those holidays roll around.
---
Side note, it doesnt even fucking matter, if they want in your house they'll find a way, i have had at least a dozen player that just run into my wall until they finally glitch through it, im not really sure theres a point to having doors anymore.
---
YOU ARE LEGALLY NOT LIABLE TO THAT IF YOU GENUINELY DONT KNOW WYM. Dont go quoting laws when ur a bucket wasteman
---
Its like that ShootyMcFace guy from Borderlands 2.
---
Also, unyielding is good for pve but in pvp the best way to go is to have a set of Sentinel Assassin armor handy, an armor plated or insulated backpack and some aid on hand to handle taking some damage.
---
Not enough Gold Bullion items. I told them to add all the hyper rare plans to the GB vendors and they were like NAAAAH.
---
Me? I'm not claiming the GB, Script, Caps or scrap prizes and will eagerly wait to see them vanish when Season 2 comes.
---
Yeah people on their high horses. I hope they all live such genuine perfect lives. It’s not like the duper’s were stealing actually money from the atomic shop or crashing servers and hurting other players
---
A good 90 percent of PS4 players gone ? That’s a lot to lose lol  be doing them a favour to be honest,the game is a broken shit bucket with bugs that render it unplayable lol spend money on a game that works ;)
---
People are still duping now through the scrip machine, they are just playing a dangerous game. It’s not an easy issue to fix.
---
I hope they nerf all these OP guns.
---
Try again next week.  Maybe by then they'll have fixed the auto completing challenge glitch too.
---
Only good weapon for pvp is railway rifle.   You’re welcome.
---
That's.... unfortunate.  Imagine how many meals for the homeless that could have paid for......
---
I'm all for people spending their money any way they want, but this just feels off....
---
Game is a joke at this point, fix dupers asap but all the little bugs can't be fixed. Come on this is absolute nonsense. You broke the SBQ but you can't hotfix it. Nah I don't believe it anymore. Gave them the benefit of the doubt when they dropped wastelanders but they've shown time and time again all they care about is stopping people duping. duping stops the daily grind and daily log ins is all that matters. Never seen end game content be griding 3 basic quests before.
---
You can't use electricity inside of the red rocket garage... It makes the cables go through the roof but it's unaccessible.. Yo can't put any connectors inside and connect cables to them
---
Lol how do you know that? If you’ve been playing for that long, you are likely in possession of duped items. Unless you managed to never pick up anything from loot bags, never trade with any players, and never bought anything from vendors/machines. That’s the only way of making sure 100% you don’t have a single duped item. Also most players don’t realize that they have duped items, I’ve traded a lot with players and guess what, I’m probably getting duped items in return. Unless you actually actively trade, you don’t understand/know what items are duped. Why do you think that there’s so many BE25 ultracite and BE15 laser rifles? Or BE50 and BE agility handmades?
---
Account sospended for investigation
---
So be it, it was fun. I knew the risks,  life would be boring without them so I'm a naughty boy and proud
---
Good luck getting a response.
---
Oh and of course there's Crater versions too. Had raiders ask me for Bobby pins and water.  And you can help the raider fisherfolk at Ohio river adventures for some rep as well.
---
so dont shoot back. pvp wont work unless you have pacifist off and shoot back.
---
Yeah... well.... I'll just stay down here in the dark for a few more days just in case.....  
---
Wait! Is that a knock on my door!?  Augh!
---
Because it's a poorly designed event.
---
Why when they can ban duper’s and sift through millions of accounts instead. Everyone will still pay
---
you are an idiot.
---
some people get salty about that kind of thing too.. lol
---
You read it wrong. I said *I hope* weren’t originally duped by the person I bought it from.
---
Agreed, game was awfully dry of content and honestly I think this dupe glitch actually did the game some good, Bethesda must have saw a huge rise in player activity because of it. I’m just pointing out how ridiculous it is that they’ll waste their time investigating/suspending accounts when they could be fixing the game. Seems like they like having all these issues so they can say “oh hey we updated the game and fixed some issues, enjoy”, just so they can add more for the next update and consider it content.
---
Triggered, snowflake?
---
Happened to me today on private world ,thought the loot would be safe but nope gives me a totally different private world.  
---
Their priorities suck ass.
---
It gets worse. Don't worry.
---
Flux?
---
What incentive does Bethesda have to keep the servers up if people don't give them money to play?
---
Make sure nobody is sat ontop of anything, have everyone fight out in the field!
---
Ay at least it's not banning
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10 that's what you click on. Eventually you'll get to atom shop purchase. I did get a refund for the  half assed starlight sniper skin.
---
I have seen one cooking alive in the pot on the fire more than once.
---
Yeah but that is just hurting the player base and its also hurting bethesda because they are loosing players that were supporting the game and alot of them cancelled f76 1st because of this banwave 
---
And at the end everyone is mad because a they got banned or a friend got banned 
---
But i cant deny that your point is also right
---
Good riddance
---
precedent demonstrates that terms of service are not ironclad, and nowhere in the TOS does it say you are on the hook for all purchases whether you get to use them or not. How about litigation for the dozens of items bought in the atom shop that are non functional or not working as intended. There is plenty of evidence of predatory practices/ marketing here. 
---
Frankly, I don’t see a judge siding with the AAA game that got successfully sued not 2 years ago for predatory marketing
---
Yeah I don't think this is 'random'.
---
"Officer this isn't my massive pile of drugs, it's my friends. He found it lying in a field so its all an accident. We shared them but thought it was okay."
---
Or the fact you hit up Sneaky_Steve on the reg and he's always got a B2525 to sell, despite the Purveyor and RNG never handing out more than one decent gun in a life time. 
---
Plus.... Some people's vendors... Christ. Your 18,000 bobbleheads didnt come from looting.
---
There have been duped weapons since the game came out. If it was such a big deal to Bethesda, they should have shut it down last week. 
---
Maybe it’s a good time for everyone who is banned to find a new game.
---
Nah. You were talking about the new dupe wave that was all about bloodied fixers supposedly even though everything good got duped.
---
Oh he doesn’t even know 😂
---
I've never thought about using my medic pump armour for this!
---
All multi shot weapons (splitters, shotguns, two shot) are also working poorly in and out of VATS
---
Soooooo need 300000 exp so far to catch up missing ones ouch XD
---
Freakin idiot.....
---
Just messing with you jayboy-I bet his best weapon is actually a bloodied; ffr handmade.  😘
---
Not yet. But how many will end up banned unjustly? As a friend of mine said to me earlier today, "Why is itour problem to find out where a weapon or armor originates?" And yes, I've seen some suspended for even having the suspect items in their inventories.
---
No, i have a friend who duped on an alt account and not his main, his main is currently under investigation but he can get on his alt lmao
---
Until people do know, and then there will be another round of the ban hammer.
---
With the hours I've put in to this life sink, it's not worth the risk!
---
people are so salty today.. lol
---
I did not get banned today.. on PC too
---
I think there is more to many of these stories than the posters are telling..
---
not that I am saying a portion of fo76 subreddit posters are full of shit or anything.. (I am saying that)
---
Sometimes I nuke random locations that I've never seen nuked before, just because I'm curious about what that location looks like after a nuke.
---
&gt; Then it’s the same with this dupe, it’s not my fault that I duped items
---
That looks a lot to me like defending yourself mate.
---
Crash and burn it will my friend
---
Banning small minority that decided it would be a good idea to use exploits/dupe items does not equal death throes. Far from it and quite opposite. It makes the game a better place and will bring in more people as the game will get better reputation in general. Too long have people like you been making this game less and less playable by exploiting in every possible way and ruining the game for the rest of us. Keep making excuses, i love those salty banned tears!
---
Yes, and I've also found the terms 'Relax, dude'  and 'Calm down' to be excellent ways to deescalate these situations.
---
/sarcasm
---
Never seen any of those weapons being sold by vendors. Unless it's buying a single .308 round from a vendor to fullfill a daily challenge, there's been no reason to buy stuff from player vendors
---
Bruh
---
Todd banned you from it
---
Ooh for the big creature challenge, I see now. I was thinking of the XP based challenges. Good tips.
---
If this is a true thing then they will literally kill the game and lose lots of money. I’m not going to pretend that I was innocent here but I did try to share the wealth within the servers a few times. If any of those players were banned that’s not fair at all. They have no clue where the weapons were coming from.
---
I would have to admit I have been addicted to the game since release maybe I can go back to being a human now
---
It only ever did it to me against the queen or the Imposter.
---
I'm nearly Rank 50 and I have thousands and thousands of Atoms that have been piling up. I also don't enjoy doing Daily/Weekly challenges, as I prefer roleplaying and taking screenshots, so the last two weeks I've been playing in a way I don't particularly enjoy. My plan was to get as far as I can on double-xp with stacked lunchboxes in one final push at the grind, hopefully get into the mid-50s or to 60, and then buy out the rest of the board.
---
That way I get to go back to what I enjoy doing, I get my cosmetics/camp items, I get to use some of my piled Atoms from 1st, AND I get eight or so weeks before I'm tempted by something else and the FOMO kicks in again
---
I strongly suspect that whatever announcement is coming will change my plans. It might be, given the points issues, they are calling this season a wash and just granting the remaining Ranks to everyone at once or perhaps lowering each Rank to 100 Score each. Those are just wild jabs in the dark, but they probably don't want the scrutiny that would come from 'denying' people lost points and then charging Atoms/potential real money to advance.
---
We got to create our own content,  since hodd toward fails to deliver.  
---
Ps .. I'm not down voting you 🤷‍♂️
---
I did not experience server crashes yet today while I have been playing on and off all day with my not banned account
---
I play a little everyday and I’m level 39 I don’t think I’ll be having to pay for any levels. Its not hard and I am 33 and have 6 kids and work a 60 hour a week job. So I play my couple hours during the night when everyone has gone to bed. I do the dailies and weeklies and only do a couple 10000 xp grind things a night. It’s def doable
---
Script machine dupe wait what??
---
I just finished farming for all of those!
---
Nah, you're just salty.
---
&gt;were duped
---
It says it right there. I'm not reading anything wrong. You fucked up. Get over it.
---
I use it every time I’m playing. My camp is right next to Poseidon Energy so whenever I need to quickly rack some steel I fire the canon to cut down time spent mowing down scorched before I collect steel. I also fire it at the Grafton monster since I’m right near the area where it spawns.
---
I will also use the flares to divert attention away or to bring attention to group up things. Sometimes it works, sometime it doesn’t.
---
Fear The Walking Dead?
---
Oh, I have no doubt that some who claim innocence are anything but. However, it's getting to the point that without a large enough player base, the game will die under it's own weight. Just check the numbers. Even giving it away for free hasn't boosted the numbers that Bethesda had hoped.
---
No I was talking about the explosive energy weapons that people keep shooting me with for no reason
---
If you’ve bought ammo then you likely have acquired duped items lol, even if it’s a single round. The stackable dupe was insane, I wish I took advantage of it because how do you think everyone has like hundreds of thousands of ammunition plus also have over thousands of junk or bobble heads.
---
Save yourself man, don’t give in lol.
---
You can go a lot higher now. Melee meats scale now.
---
I’m in the same boat. Was close to 2500 hours in game.
---
Heart of the swamp got me today. But yes those two also,unsure of any others
---
Yeah thats true but if someone who didnt cheat is offered 2000 bobbleheads for a trade who wouldnt take it if they didnt know they were getting banned.
---
Haha
---
I'm not banned 😂
---
yeah I dont care.. Im playing the fucking game
---
they should ban people way more often..
---
Pro-tips: 
---
- Marsupial and jetpacks are your friend. Helps find alternate entrances to the person's CAMP
---
- next time you do your West Tek run, don't forget to collect a bunch of Toxic Goo. Fastest way to rad up in case someone tries to remove the light of Atom from you.
---
- you can always not visit their shop. Hurts more if they get no visitors
---
Income = successful game. 
---
Game pass is already one foot in the death door. The next step will be the banning of many of the loyal  people who spend money on the game. They are going to have to issue a hell of a lot of refunds for 1st subscribers.
---
No, I think it's very well designed. Just needs to have the first person to bring the card be the one to activate it. Not just anybody there.
---
I dont ever comment but I also lost my weekly and daily challenges and I'm honestly having a difficult time getting over the amount of progression for the season I just lost. I don't even want to play the rest of the week. Part of the enjoyment for me, comes from that burst of progression after weekly reset. Now I'm just doing the same terrible intellect xp grind for a week. There is no fix for it. It's a week of this game gone.
---
I’m honestly just tired of grinding non stop on stuff. Wish they’d add more content that doesn’t require a huge grind.
---
Lmao the downvotes on you. They hate the truth
---
Ok your baiting. There’s no way you didn’t understand what you just said.
---
Wait until you get into a fight with a legendary scorchbeast, get it down to almost no health, THEN comes the server crash. Sometimes this game is a feelsbad. But i enjoy it for the most part.
---
But I don't mind. I like PvP.
---
I don't know what else to do. I had all the assasin gears and it didn't help.
---
Stop down voting this guy, this problem is WORSE than duping!
---
Same here i meeeaaan the gauss minigun looked so epic in the intro
---
Wtf?
---
I mean I was banned and have no more than one copy of anything, if they plan on making a particular item contraband they need to state which items
---
Aw man, Red Rocket Garage looks tight! Might be a good way to keep an above-ground vendor that will be easier to manage.
---
Uhm the dirty skin textures raiders use are non-playable my dude
---
You can sometimes get so much damage to it that it just disregards the damage barrier. Sort of like the heart of the swamp event
---
Yup :D love it!
---
Why
---
I have those perks.
---
Would also be nice to actually be able to talk to someone about it, support just auto locks the tickets....
---
Lol yeh I don’t really care about the downvotes or anything, made my reddit account like a month ago, used it actively for 2+ weeks and managed to get over 300 reddit karma without even noticing. Honestly the karma system is pretty stupid plus there’s always the douchebags out there who downvote you because that’s what they live for 😂
---
How do you know if you're perna banned? Asking for a friend of course
---
You know how many duped weapons and armors were already in the game. People have been duping gear since the start. How else would we have the items to trade
---
I was thinking of Lucy Van Pelt and Charlie Brown, but yeah that kid is awful, got me right there
---
Bethesda processed a charge on your card without your authorization?
---
Haha ghoul-slayer build bad
---
The economy for the game was already ruined
---
There’s no small minority about this situation. This was a massive ban. And unfortunately the game doesn’t get fixed as is. Imagine how bad it will be when they only have half the income, half the devs, the game only half works now, can it suffer through more. Will you play when there’s no new content and the existing glitches don’t get fixed
---
I don't want to have features curtailed because other players can't behave themselves. I went three weeks without a vendor and had no motivation to play the game. If Bethesda do this every time a new dupe glitch emerges it ruins the reputation of the game and kills the player base until it's fixed.
---
It's against the ToS and the bans are being rightfully handed out. Better to get rid of the bad apples than make the whole tree suffer.
---
Sorry to break this to you but you are not getting refunds if you break the game ToS. Love those banned salty tears! &lt;3
---
"Wrongly banned" is not something you can take at face value. Every criminal is going to tell you they've been wrongly convicted.
---
That happens when an enemy survives their character model being killed, the invincible ghost keeps hunting people.
---
It’s giving me the error code, but  I haven’t gotten a email from Bethesda
---
I've set up between the Ski Shop and Top of the World. I regularly drop crackers on the Ski Shop,Bolton Greens and the main cabin building near TotW.
---
Not at all, just stating a simple fact.
---
I think he got s point there because they could have disabled the server hop function so that the player had to go to the main menu first and then they could have searched for a new server
---
Honest question... if someone violate terms of service and get banned is Bethesda obligated to give a refund?
---
Word. Take my upvote!
---
Filthy casual here and I don’t want to be in NW any more than the PVP crowd wants me there. I do my daily score tasks, bush wookie as long as possible to not completely screw whatever team I’m put on and then bounce out.
---
🧅
---
It takes a while. Yeah Bethesda is definitely reckless with this suspension wave.
---
"This is the first time I've drunk drove officer, you can't possibly get me in trouble.
---
Oh god you said snowflake lol
---
I was told they couldn’t refund my FO1st when I tried to cancel after wastelanders came out. I only got it thinking wastelanders was gonna bring some end game content.
---
Ad hominem.
---
I doubt it, that would require some serious rewiring of his body and he doesn't just mutate willy nilly.
---
What?
---
If you think caps were valuable you clearly don’t trade on here.
---
When I was getting toward the end, I didn't get any in FOREVER and then I got the last two within a week of each other. Just RNG =/
---
I learned this in school
---
I love throwing their stupid terms back in their faces.
---
All these *anti-bloody builds* are. Why? They don't have bloody or unyielding gear.
---
Hopefully I don't get it then. I have a lot of good weapons I have aquired from constantly trading and would be pretty upset if I was banned just because I had one of their "marked" weapons
---
My money's on him having subscribed to first a while back and now is upset about something, perhaps a ban for cheating (duping) and is now throwing a hissy.
---
Tell that to chase bank, I’ve already done my chargebacks
---
Well you have to be suspended for investigation and when the investigation concludes I’m sure they will let you know whether or not your friend was temporarily suspended of perma banned. I don’t believe anyone has been confirmed to be perma banned yet but Bethesda released a statement about the ban wave saying grievous offenders are catching the real ban hammer.
---
Ahaha i love how you try to rationalize this :D Only thing that is coming from this banwave is good things :D Enjoy your ban, hope it is permanent.
---
I mean of you played the game last year this happend before and they had to restore people's accounts.
---
Wasterlander says "Sure we might rape, pillage, murder, and eat the flesh of other human beings but pee our pants? Come on man, were not animals" ...If I lived in post apocalyptic Apalacha my pants would just be filled with piss and sh!t. Hehe
---
ok but what about if someone bought a normal gun that happened to be duped and sold in a player vendor or smthin and got banned cause that seems to be grounds for suspension rn. The buyer is an unwilling particpant and the ban is pure displacement of blame which ultimately falls down to the duper and bethesda for being so bugged
---
what exactly is the weekly "build up workshop or camp"? what ecactly are you suppose to build? tried a little bit didnt have time to dig deeper.
---
Tbh at this point i could care less what happens to my account 😂 this game has been down hill and the toxicity of the pvp players haven't been good. But I do wish everyone a fun and safe time playing the game ❤❤
---
It is also in the terms of service...
---
I mean it's like you bought stolen stuff, it got flagged and you were on the receiving end of the ban, shit happens🤷🏾‍♂️
---
Oooh that’s pretty sweet looking. I saw it in the shop but didn’t really pay much attention. I’m currently impostor sheepsquatch this a ghillie backpack but I like that look a lot. 
---
I get your point but the dupe glitch worked for any tradeable item and was easy enough for anyone to do it. All you needed was a vendor and a bit laggy server.
---
I just can't get enough of that.  Evil giggle each time.
---
I doubt this happens.  Duping is so rampant and people go extreme.  Nobody has been banned for one accidental purchase
---
Yeah i just got got also. Feelsbadman. 5750 score not accounted for and gone.
---
But unyielding is utility! They can't grasp SPECIAL scaling one bit. 0 INT
---
Ah if you hover over it in the challenge menu a little thing pops up and tells you exactly what to build. It’s also fairly easy.
---
Being charged for Fallout 1st is a separate issue from violating (or allegedly violating) the ToS. 
---
Paying for FO1st doesn’t grant anyone special privileges to violate the ToS. 
---
Granted, 12-month memberships may need to be prorated with a refund, but IIRC losing access to the game for a ToS violation doesn’t qualify as a valid refund reason. It’s really no different than if Sony or Microsoft banned a player form online access for an unrelated offense. 
---
It’s worth it for them to make the request, but there may not be any obligation for Bethesda to enact a refund.
---
The title is a reference to a phrase from the Bhagavad Gita and was famously quoted by J. Robert Oppenheimer; "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
---
I agree. I guess people shouldn’t glitch but I still can’t believe glitchers are the ones people hate and no gets pissed at the devs. Lol this game has been a mess of bugs since the beginning and it’s somehow the players fault that happen to grab the free candy Bethesda leaves lying around.
---
It’s not a big deal. All the veteran dupers have burner accounts just for times like this. So the items are still obtainable just will cost more now.
---
Don’t forget the cigar!
---
Renewed for fo1st a couple of hours ago then I get a email telling me about a suspension lmao
---
No they haven’t enabled it yet. It’s delayed while they’re dealing with the auto completing issue and the ban wave
---
Chaotic neutral
---
No they were, people were just trading godrolls for godroll which is how it should be. The fact there is a market for weapons with real cash just enforces the fact everyone thinks they deserve the absolute best weapons for zero effort. Have you played any other mmo before? People don’t complain about earning things or that they can’t cheat because everyone else has to as well.
---
gramps
---
and don't let him out
---
Oooooo..... I have the jet pack.  That does look pretty good.  Buying that today.
---
Thanks, Todd!
---
Question, I already own the bungalow without the bundle. Does the bundle price get reduced?
---
If you got a good DPS weapon hop onto grass and shoot the bitch. You'll kite her and she'll happily land next to you.
---
Lmao this exactly!
---
yah but its not a non zero chance. You cant flat out say it wont happen. What if that happens, is the ban justified?
---
Same dupe, different type of vendors.
---
I had my camp next to Helvetia during Fasnacht and yes, I killed the mega sloth with it once... Or at least hit it once and it died quickly after...
---
Nowadays im on the south peak of Seneca rocks and shoot it at other camps when they're in my proximity, like when they're on the other peak.
---
&gt;Stop calling it a limited event. Find me any source that indicates it is a temporary one time event. You are making that shit up. They refer to in their own documentation as a seasonal release content cycle. Their web page for it is called "seasons". Plural. It is named Season 1 because there will be a series as in season 2, 3, 4 etc.
---
It’s limited in that you have a deadline to it.  The next season will have a different deadline.  That’s what makes it a limited event. 
---
&gt;It is irrelevant because it hurts your point deeply. The entire game is designed to be slow. They have said it in interviews (looking for the source now) that they designed it to be a slow burn that you cannot beat or complete quickly and it takes time. This is a core design decision. So its extremely relevant because every mechanic they add will take that into account like with the legendary perk system and ammo converter
---
I’m not arguing that it’s not slow, I want someone to prove to me that it’s a bad thing and that they should be forced to change It. No one can do that.  I’m fine with Grindy.  The original Everquest was far more grindy than this game will ever be. World of Warcraft was, when I played it, far more grindy at end game than FO76.  I don’t mind grindy games.  
---
&gt;Good for you? I have over 800 hours in fallout76 before the season came out. I have been playing the past two weeks daily again for 2-3 hours a session and launching 2-3 queen nukes per session in addition to doing settler dailies and I am level 13 in the season pass. I refuse to do more of the same boring ass challenges that have always existed (gather wood, create cement) What is even worse is that the official pre launch FAQ for the season mistakenly said event XP contributed to SCORE which was false implying they gaffed even harder than normal, or it originally was set up that way which means it was again modified after the marketing materials were made to be artificially slow. If it did include event XP, I probably would not be complaining as most of the content in this game is repeatable events and I do them all regularly.
---
Then you don’t enjoy the game cycle that’s been in place since day one of the game.  It was always this.  And since the game failed, it’s going to be this.  Just because you’re tired of it doesn’t mean you’re entitled to the rewards. 
---
And all XP contributes to the repeatable 10K = 100 XP.  Maybe that’s what they meant all along I don’t know, I don’t care. The pace is fine for the type of hours I can put into this game. 
---
&gt;you will not acknowledge the score system is both excessively grindy, and also buggy to the point of being not worth pursuing then I am no longer interested in this discussion as you are in fantasy land. Go to new at any time in the past 2 weeks in this forum since patch day or the official fallout 76 general discussion forum and you will see consistent and constant complaints from users on all platforms raging about it. Can you overcome it especially with dxp active, sure. Does that make it any less grindy or broken? No. In addition the rewards themselves are currently buggy as fuck like the leather ghillie suit.
---
It being too grindy is subjective.  It being buggy is objective.  It doesn’t change any of what my argument is that they are not obligated to change the Season.  You have yet to prove that they should change it beyond you don’t enjoy the game cycle. 
---
&gt;No shit. It has to be otherwise they are just selling you more content with the atom store v2. The problem is the time investment is out of whack and ITS BY DESIGN because most sane people wont spend 81 hours doing 1 thing in a game toward a consistent goal, they will play for 30 mins a day like they already do and go "Oh shit I am only 1k atoms away from the sweet glow in the dark wallpaper" and they will pull out their credit card and spend 10 bucks on it. That is the purpose of the system and it does its job well.
---
Then to be blunt anyone who does that is a fucking idiot for spending money like that on a game for a handful of cosmetic items for a game they aren’t playing more than 30 minutes a day.  
---
If people give into FOMO that much for a game they barely spend any time on that’s a them issue.  
---
&gt;I doubt very seriously this will happen given the resounding success of Fallout 1st and the atom shop. That is why the toxic buggy shit keeps flowing and why two years later we are complaining about the same shit because just like with 3 and 4 and skyrim, they do what they want and the money keeps flowing.
---
Then don’t spend money and see what happens?  So far I have heard from you - you don’t want to do the challenges and find the game too grindy, but still yet you seem to continue to spend money on them.  
---
Are you that addicted and hard up for the lore of Fallout that you’ll just stick around if you’re that unhappy?  And we have no idea how the game is doing, for all we know the money from 1st is till going towards paying off royalties for the music they added into the game. I mean wastelanders was a shit short expansion to the game, we didn’t even get all the features they wanted to add.  
---
They clearly are not investing money into this game. 
---
&gt;How many hows do you have in the game? It is not a trump card but it is very relevant to me understanding your perspective
---
658 hours on PS4, started on PC way back but left because my friends were on console (it wasn’t long after the game was released that I switched).  Have taken extended breaks because I work full time and was taking classes at night full time, and then have a house and pets to take care of.
---
Yeah I submitted a ticket in case they reimburse later
---
Honest answer. There are many precedents in the subscription gaming industry that a TOS is not ironclad. 
---
What is an exploit? Generally an exploit is a third party system used to gain some advantage. Think wall hacks in a FPS game. What does not constitute as an exploit is them not paying amazon enough for server usage, and this resulting in server instability that is so widespread, every single player in the game has access to it. In other words, their first party problems, are hardly exploits, more symptoms of a broken game.
---
I tend to swap cards in and out when I play. Especially my Charisma cards. Playing solo vs in a team, etc.
---
Everyone will have a different playstyle. That said....I keep 3 points in perception on my unarmed toons. I can use this for lock pick but I really use it so This way I can have one point in each rifleman and i use a lever action for range. A hunting rifle could easily be used in place of a lever with a slight reduction in damage. Or you could use one in each commando and use an automatic fixer or handmade. I do this sometimes too. I like to mix it up. Plus fixers can be modded to use 38 ammo.  Which is everywhere.
---
I will tell you that if you decide to go bloodied, my bloodied lever one shots almost everything just by having one point in each Rifleman.  So you can snipe when you need to. And this is great for scorchbeast. I do the same with my junkies but the damage is definitely less.  Again this may not be your playstyle so if it isnt you can put those points wherever you like.
---
Anywhere you see Aquagirl I swap it out and use fireproof for queen fights.
---
Here are my base builds:

---
You WILL need those defensive perks if you use a bloodied build.
---
If you have questions I'm here! And if you're on ps4 I can make you some low level unarmed weapons if you need them.
---
Worst for me also 8/9 daily and 5/8 weekly.
---
What was really interesting was that some of the weekly had partial completetion.
---
20/30 creature and 3/5 enemy,  I have only really ever seen them complete or not before.
---
Exactly this.
---
Perhaps. While I’m sure a handful of truly innocent people may have been affected, considering how long it’s taken for Bethesda to enact this it’s highly likely that a strong level of validation occurred first. 
---
I saw someone complaining about being banned for something they did a year ago. I don’t think there’s a statute of limitations in the ToS for being banned.
---
I like the ghillie too but it’s got that freakin shovel that clips with the jet pack, just like the regular shovel backpack.
---
Their dupe issues have me thinking they need to look into blockchains. :)
---
I used it earlier to buy yet another skin and added search algorithm for my Collectron. That's 5 now, sadly I missed the Santa version. Just wish after all those Atoms spent I could have multiples on show.
---
I'm about half way through both raider and settler reps from Neighbourly to Ally. How much longer is this going to take me?
---
For duping?
---
This is an issue with how events work, if an event completes as you die you get trapped in a never ending death as the game is confused by the event respawn mechanics and the normal one!
---
Whose stupid terms?  Didn’t see that person use the word “snowflake”?
---
I’m pretty over being a shaggy looking mess I think. That backpack would round off a nice sharp look nicely. I think just a full SS armour with no outfit with that would match well.
---
My cousin got baned he started today some guy gave him a level 5 bow then he got back on and was baned
---
Damn where were you months ago lol
---
I am sure it is in the email.
---
Worry if you have 10 B2525 fixers :-)
---
That's a thing?
---
I wish Bethesda would make a 2-tile wall piece for the build sets that would hold the new door, and also update the other garage doors to fit in them... and make them wallpaperable.
---
It’s the sentiment.
---
Unless those accounts get suspended aswell for having duped items on them
---
Right people think the problem is solved. This is the surface
---
And?
---
Personally I don’t care if people glitch or not lol as long as it doesn’t affect game stability or me. It does bother me though that it’s mostly the people who use glitches that people get pissed at like no AAA title in 2020 ever gets as much hate for their problems as the people who abuse them. Lol like the god mode thing. It’s been around since release and people still get ticked at people they encounter in god mode.
---
Bethesda probably continues to charge fallout first even if you’re banned
---
I was literally just telling my son, "where is everyone?" I haven't logged in a few days. Wow. I'm o ly lv 45, so...yeah.
---
Restart the game and check again. If they’re still missing, submit a ticket.
---
The side door is in the door menu, and the garage door is in the wall menu
---
oh grand more micro transactions exactly what i wanted.
---
These players don't run mutation or rads. They role play BOS
---
Apparently according to the rest of Reddit you deserve to be banned :)
---
Instigating fatman, now that's something else
---
Did you restart fallout 76? If they ban you, they cant kick you off the game, they can only prevent you from getting online
---
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who plays the game legitimately, I just have zero interest in cheating.
---
Okay thanks!
---
Thank you, added to my library
---
The guy that gave it to him was duping and got banned and everyone who has done any trades or picked up item from him has been banned also from what he told us
---
For the most part with gauss mini, prime reciever for damage, tri barrel for speed and sight for sights sake.  This has been the go to for most.  If you are really averse to primed receivers, just go with the tesla you like.
---
As for gauss shotty, idk.  I dont use shotguns really.
---
I’ve traded for over a year on here (nearly 300 karma now) and worked hard to negotiate deals with other traders to get the gear I have. I’m not saying people deserve something for nothing. What I’m saying is in a game that rewards nothing for time played is very off putting for a lot of people. And a market correction was needed and unfortunately a dupe wave is what causes it.
---
Oh - a Bette Davis reference!  My two words collide!  Huzzah!
---
People are just mad they couldn’t get it to work lol
---
Then send in a support ticket. 
---
It doesn’t matter what anyone here thinks about the ‘validity’ of a ban.
---
That's what happened to my buddy. They messaged him saying they would get him back and shortly after he had the temp ban
---
Power armor has gotta have plumbing inside it. Imagine the animation for the catheter insertion
---
Caveat emptor
---
The voting here makes no sense. In some threads all the comments supporting the bans have been mass-downvoted, and all the comments endorsing duping and exploits have been upvoted.  
---
But in this thread right here, the votes are the complete opposite.
---
Make up your mind, reddit.
---
Pretty sure picking up a weapon or item that Bethesda has quietly labeled contraband is a bit different than committing a real crime.
---
I know of quite a few that didn’t get the ban hammer and they stuff have all the items. Been talking to them on Xbox. Some of the biggest traders in the game. Now their prices are gonna sky rocket.
---
What xmas rewards? How can I get them? (I'm new)
---
What materials do you need for Ultracite 2mm if you’re using the prime receiver?
---
There's always gonna be a new glitch. Remove the glitchers means you remove it from the root
---
I think they let players hang themselfs by not patching it so soon. Yes this game has problems, idk how they broke adrenaline when pts are a thing, but dupers are a problem and banning them is a good thing.
---
Banning scum like you will only make the game more popular. Having a game full of scammers/dupers/cheaters/exploiters etc is keeping lots of people out of this game. These kinda banwaves will only bring in more people than the game lost. Keep crying! :D
---
I used mine to start solo’ing Encryptid
---
No email yet. Guess I better try to login when I get home and then decide if scripping a bunch of legacies is more suspicious than just continuing to hold them.
---
Was trading heavily for illicit goods but definitely not doing the dupe myself.
---
Yep. Most likely because of the auto complete issue and them trying to figure out how to make it up to us.
---
Wow worse than me, they just auto lock my tickets...
---
With empty servers from the ban they should be more stable then ever. Except for the still raging dupe May be slowing things down
---
I think there’s actually lots of cobalt flux in the area, Plus its a different enemy set than the usual places.
---
I nuked toxic valley for the same reason - lots of violet flux, which I needed, and different enemies.
---
I’ll assume you’re not a wine connoisseur :)
---
Exactly. Bethesda enabled this.
---
I'm pretty sure the former is manual and the latter is more automated, no person is sat there looking through people's accounts.
---
The servers are unstable because they don’t pay amazon enough for server space. They are trying to carry too many people, with too little server space. It is not the players fault the game does not work as intended. Don’t be fooled into thinking any players have any ability to determine the efficacy of their servers as a whole.
---
Ok fare
---
Haha.. they way power armor closes im pretty sure that it isnt gunna be gentle.
---
Bethesda made dupers a favor...
---
Look at the road map, we were supposed to buy score ranks with atoms today. Score gaining is bugged as hell - losing tons of score every day due to bugs. Legendary perks were supposed to come with patch 20, now it was pushed to patch 22. The promised new summer season content but all we get is what... bugged score daily grind? Joke.
---
Lead, steel, ultracite, crimson flux.  I think a single craft is 108 rounds.  The flux is, as is the case for ultra rounds, the hardest to find, but it's not terrible given the bog gets nuked daily.
---
I think people are just too preoccupied by trying to tag the imposter instead of doing the obj.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised to find that the bulk of the exploiters are on pc
---
Probably they escaped this wave. Maybe it will come to them too. Maybe they'll escape. Thing is if you remove 80% of the market, even if the demand is high who you gonna trade with? Most other traders with duped stuff got banned. So.you either sell it cheap or give up duping. Who knows
---
Make a better build bro
---
I haven't been having that issue this week
---
It sucks. I’m sorry, I’m a bit salty today.
---
I don’t mean to offend.
---
Nope only weapon I have 2 of is my instigating ffr Gauss shotguns only because I think making 2 of the same roll is very rare itself lol
---
I saw one a couple days ago swaering he didn't dupe. Looked at his comment history and there was a thread he created on the market sub where he traded someone a bunch of shit for 200 leadership bobble heads. 
---
The dumb motherfucker not only knowingly bought duped bobbleheads, he then used them to jack his XP through the roof and clear the SCORE board faster than is legitimately possible, and then goes all surprised pikachu when BGS bans him.
---
No one is going through your stuff except a bot.
---
Link to the statement from Bethesda?
---
Why would a merchant want to provide continued support to a customer that ignores their rules?
---
Anyone that duped that got banned isn’t Bethesda target demographic. And there are probably a lot of players that would prefer that Bethesda ran a clean player community instead of ignoring cheaters. 
---
Next you’ll tell me that if they finally fix the cheating in NW that will hurt their bottom line and player base.
---
its been good in PC
---
Ive been on and off all day.. I assume its the lack of players today.. lol
---
Took a character and moved camp to next time the covered bridge by the waverley. Made a small town with the red rocket garage as a slocum joes. Surprisingly low cakp cost but theres a limit to how many seedy shacks and cabins can be put down.
---
Interesting. Maybe I missed it. With green thumb I found 10 cobalt(5 sources) and 50 yellowcake. 
---
There was a lot more yellowcake available
---
Then what is the connector for??
---
I'd love that, and a car table.
---
Because bethesda Austin loves to both lose income and drag bethesda gameworks name through the mud.
---
DM and I can give you some pointers if you would like.
---
Yeah you are right but instead of waiting a couple of days so they can ban people they could have disabled the quick menu inside the game or they could have disabled the server hop function so that they had to go the main menu to change server but thats too late now
---
Bruh 🤦‍♂️
---
Disabling all of the robot vendors on the same day the game launched on game pass? That would have been an absolutely fucking horrible idea.
---
Bro you are everywhere and you’re comments suck each time chill out
---
FWIW, I got a paint each of the first 3 turn-ins I did... about Level 45-50.
---
Now L214, lost track of the number if tech data’s I’ve turned in....and have not gotten another paint.
---
In the case where you arent using Fallout 1st, which adds a limitless scrapbox, go to a tinkers workbench and bulk all of your junk. That will significantly increase how much space you have (keep in mind bulking requires plastic). If you don't need them, use the green thumb and woodchipper perk slots for other perks. And to lower weight for items, strength has perks for ammo and junk weights, and agility has a perk for food and drink weights.
---
Dud honestly with everything going wrong in this world this year I'm surprised more people arnt
---
Super, super annoying.
---
Lol. Makes as much sense as anything else
---
But they dont they suspend the accounts but they allow you to come back after a while they always return
---
Hey man, did you remove it or the mods?
---
maybe they will advance everyone a set number of spaces?
---
-eta: and therefore dont want people spending money before they do ?
---
Are they currently conditional credits or finalized credits?
---
There’s a huge difference. 
---
Both you and Bethesda are clients of Chase bank. You both have rights in the situation.
---
Probably resolved next Tuesday
---
&gt; His dialogue isn’t as fun as the comrade one
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sRS1dwCotw
---
This game has one foot out the door
---
The guys I know I met through trading a long time ago and their mains have never been banned.
---
That's why PC is the superior platform, just use weapon buttons.
---
The weapon wheel is a shitty console necessity and a shitty hold over on PC.
---
[gotcha ](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/419353/account-suspensions-and-bans-july-14-2020?language%5B%5D=en)
---
I always leave the game for a bit and come back and notice that I keep getting more camp budget and I thought I was going crazy but have they been actually saying they’ve been increasing it?
---
OMg u HaVe B2525 fIxEr. I wILl GiB u mY B2525 fIXEr.
---
I think using the word scum or dirtbag is a little harsh. The dupe is wrong and an obvious exploit but doesn’t make the people bad humans. At the end of the day it’s a video game not real life and this specific exploit didn’t crash servers like previous dupes and the duper’s weren’t stealing actual items and money from the atomic store for example. I’m not justifying I’m just pointing out that it didn’t directly inhibit someone from playing or stealing actual money.
---
yeah.. if a (former)player is banned.. and they know its not going to be overturned because theyre a fucking cheater..  they absolutely should not continue fo1st
---
No no one cares about nw. PvP in this game is a cash grab to attract players from respectable pvp games.
---
Use a switch.
---
Same bug, all my friends dont get this but I do, please send a message my way if someone sends you a solution. Thanks.
---
Beth should pay me atoms for all this free advertising :)
---
That makes sense. All the dupers are whining on here because they can't login to 76 lol
---
And it’s getting ready to jump the rest of the way
---
Couple of pointers that might be obvious:
---
* Unlike Fallout 4, you don't lose any components for scrapping junk. Try and make sure you scrap all of your junk if you aren't doing so already - it's much more efficient in terms of weight.
---
* Regarding weapons - in the early game you'll have quite a high turnover of weapons based on your playstyle, available ammo, and the level of the weapon itself. All weapons have a level (usually scaling in increments of ten levels), so by the time you're level 20 you can use a better variant of a weapon than the level 10 weapon. There's not really as a massive need to hold on to weapons because of this. Hold on to what you're using currently and scrap the rest of the weapons to learn mods for them. Most weapons are fairly common and you'll be able to get new ones reliably, and later in the game you can just craft your own.
---
* You might want to consider levelling up Strength since this gives you extra carry weight per level, and there are still decent perks even if you aren't a melee character. Similar to this, if you can, use the Pocketed or Deep Pocketed mods on your armour for some more carry weight. Also, you can craft a small backpack for some more carry weight - you'll find the plan in one of the Overseer caches. As you get further into the game, you can do quests that upgrade how big your backpack can get but the small one is always handy.
---
These are a couple of catch-all, beginner tips that hopefully help a bit. If you're a bit lost still or are a bit further on than that and still struggling I can give some better advice for dealing with the stash weight late game.
---
were you duping, champ?
---
I’m not too sure but I’m VERY happy with this!
---
I loot whatever calibers I use every time I see it. (Bandolier and ammo WR armor helps a lot)
---
Plus lucky hole mine in excavator armor yields 600 Lead ore.  Gunpowder from supermutants and looting, acid from the node I camp on....
---
Then craft with ammosmith2 and superduper3 = lots of ammo.
---
This is my guess
---
Most bans are going to be justified. Canceling a subscription for a game you can’t play is also justified. 
---
I say absolutely good riddance to the dupers, but I see no reason why they would keep paying their sub fees. It is on them to cancel though.
---
I haven’t heard from anyone who’s “investigation” has been concluded, so no one really knows yet. Hopefully like 3 days or so, it would suck if they had to miss xp weekend.
---
Yeah, i mean what did people expect lol no bans?
---
I hope they still got the $$ to bring more updates to fo76
---
I'm sorry bro there not just banning people for like 1 duped item. I warned my buddy a few times about him duping and lucky I never took any of them. He just got banned and he admits at least half is inventory was duped gear, so I'm sure that b2525 fixer you bought off the guy that had 6 for sale, and the full unyielding sentinels you got for 5k but im sure you had NO IDEA they were duped
---
Try a different sub. This one doesn’t allow bartering posts.
---
I recently did this as well and I know your pain
---
I place the switch on the wall and I ran the power from the point it's up above the garage door on the roof to their but then we try and run it back to the door there's no place to connect it that I can find
---
Thanks. Although I was totally expecting a rickroll with that link text. Lol.
---
Should be fine, but SS armour and gauss shottys etc were also being duped/traded between players :-)
---
Bulking your items can help, you can bulk at a tinker bench. I generally carry dog food, canned stew, purified water. Check your junk, make sure everything is broke down, somethings store but can be broke down more. Sell or drop anything you have you have excess of that you aren't really using, sometimes I end up with excess of things.
---
Ive played several sessions over the course of the day today as recently as half an hour ago
---
I am not banned
---
“Right after sending me” are the hints to answer your question.
---
a company can not charge you while with-holding its services
---
There's some way BGS is able to track these duped items, through some unique ID that each item has.
---
I'm guessing if they track that ID to your account, you get flagged and suspended. They then investigate your account further to see if you actually duped. Then you get banned. 
---
But if they don't find hard evidence of duping, then they reenable your account.
---
So a small percentage of innocent people caught in the banwave may have their accounts restored after the investigation.
---
Yeah like ANYONE considers whether or not people are exploiting a game before they purchase. God you sound so ignorant right now.
---
I didn't learn until level 50 or so the best way to get ammo. Find lead in large quantities and make it yourself, it's the quickest and cheapest way. Gyms and silos are a good source and you can easily get 200-300 from a few locations. Use ammosmith and super duper perks and you can easily make 1k-1.5k rounds. Steel is easy to come by, just scrap a bunch of guns and make sure to have scrapper on to get more resources.
---
Yes. Your probably already banned
---
Pre dupe people were selling legacies for large amounts of real money ,you think that’s not broken? Atleast now people are trading things for other things or spending caps..if anything it’s more like proper wastelander trading now. It’s better now than it’s ever been personally speaking.
---
Maybe next week.
---
Mmm good choice
---
Determining what kind of build you might be interested in will help you figure what stuff to save, what weapons to keep, what armor to use, etc. Example: if you are going to go stealth sniper, you probably don't need to keep all the melee and shotgun weapons you find.  Scrap that stuff or sell it.
---
Personally, what I found out especially  at the beginning is I didn't need to keep everything.  If you find 3star legendary weapons and armor, maybe use those, but you are going to level out of the early stuff pretty quickly - so don't treat everything like gold.  Once you hit 50, you can start to think of permanent equipment more. 
---
And at the beginning, my stash was always around 780pds, most of it scrap.  It's better to have more than you need.  By being a total packrat at the beginning, when I finally got around to building a camp, creating armor, I found I had very little running around to do for materials.  And it is a pain to hunt for ballistic weave and screws and adhesive after the fact.
---
But really, just have fun exploring and figuring out what you like.  It is not a race.
---
Yes, no matter the circumstance you will more than likely be banned/suspended for coming into contact with duped items. Bethesdas policy has always been ban first, patch later.
---
You need sentinel assassin armor and the right perk cards. If you're playing against a food build, a crap load of colas. Also vats is broken for handmades and Fixers.
---
Excavator PA and hit up lucky hole mine. Like the other person said ammo smith 2 and super duper 3 work wonders together, especially for 50 cal and 5mm
---
Why would they keep paying their subscription if they are banned? Lol only an idiot would do that.
---
This exact thing happened to me a little while ago (4 months ago and earlier last year). Of course, your issue might be different from mine, because more than just FO76 was affected (in my case). If you have the time, I’d recommend logging into your router and checking for a firmware update. I discovered that in rare cases (such as mine) some routers just decide to shit the bed on some AWS-serviced games until they’re updated to the latest patch. (This last sentence is probably just superstition on the part of the person who first told me the resolution.)
---
Nice, you can get Pipers outfit for buying atoms, too.
---
someone was speculating maybe they delayed it so they can give some type of compensation before people spend money on it
---
Yeah from how I’ve seen it happing if you have anything or suspicion then you’ll be temp banned and then you get to have a wonderful wait untill you get unbanned
---
That Corvega backpack is a dream come true!  Now only if they'd add a Vault-Tec one...
---
Whats with all the banning threads?
---
I enjoy the servers being full and there being an influx of players but then again some level 7 came over to the scorch beast queen event I just went AFK
---
It took me eight hours to complete Daguerre's questline to completion. Likely took less than that to finish the main questline
---
No one knows. It’s just been delayed. The wording on the announcement gave me the feeling it’ll be a while though. 
---
He said something along the lines of “adding extra dailies until the 20th in the meantime”. (Paraphrasing)
---
Could be reading too much into it, but in context it immediately read to me as if the system wouldn’t be in place before then.
---
Lol it’s a game not real life. Duping a gun and using an exploit that didn’t cause other players on the server to not be able to play is not comparable to slavery. Get off your high horse.
---
Damn, a missed opportunity lol.
---
Why are people complaining on how people decided to spend their money.. 
---
This is the stage that gaming is in right now and no matter how much we wish it wasn’t , it not going to change.
---
I’m a working adult if I decide to toss $20 for rank up because I don’t or can’t log in every night or buy atoms to buy skins etc etc  
---
it my choice and no need to feel disappointment
---
Not of they pop a steathboy.
---
No lol .when someone drop something it's fair game and it doesn't matter what kind of gun armor etc u find
---
1 gun.. or 15,000 guns?
---
Get rid of all the dupers. Made the economy a joke.
---
No no, you forgot the boomer bro, dosent have the same ring
---
ok great! thanks
---
Just play NW. As you accumulate so you'll get the rewards. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank it's a bug so theres no progress bar but they're still going
---
Absolutely they do when the game has massive negative reputation like fallout 76 does. People know about how the game is full of scum like you, duping/exploiting/cheating and then trying to make excuses when you get banned. Nothing ignorant about my comment. You are just too slow to get it.
---
Go to the map, then go to the menu that shows challenges Legy Run Atomic shop etc. If you look there is an option called change appearance which lets you change everything, even sex
---
I literally bought 1 month then cancelled just for the scrap box. I'm filling it to the brim with junk. I'm at 12k lbs in junk in it now. Lmao.
---
Theoretically.
---
I used to moderate an internet forum that was fairly large and active in its heyday. We had some reasonably strict forum rules, and we also had a paid membership service. And you'd be surprised at the number of people who mistakenly thought that since they paid money, they were somehow exempt from the rules.
---
Ran the site for a number of years. And despite a significant number of banned users huffing and puffing and blowing smoke, not once did we get hit with a "lawsuit" or any other such nonsense.
---
Anyway, long story short, always read the TOS when paying money for a subscription service.
---
they dont perma ban people nearly enough in this game..
---
Love my JELVC lever. Reminds me of the Lincoln Repeater in FO3
---
I find you're more likely to roll bloodied when running a vanguard build. I've played as a vanguard since launch never interested in bloodied then I rolled 2 unyielding secret service with negative fall damage and not long after a bloodied handmade with 10% aim damage and 25% less vats so naturally I decided to try bloodied and I have not been able to roll a single unyielding since. Or maybe I used up all my luck
---
Probably some script running in the background scanning inventories that's slowing things down.
---
I wrote the same thing as you but wanted to point out that you wrote it much better. Here’s an upvote for having the same thought process as me but relaying it so much better
---
Same but it's in front of my purifiers so it's saving time.
---
The raider collectron is perfect.insults you.threatens you if you don't give him a good cut of profits and wants to drink nukashine.lol
---
This would be nice, but my current camp is still maxed to the limit.....
---
You're not alone..
---
How about bethesda should be banned for making a game that allows a new dupe to come out every 2 months
---
It does get annoying educating these people on what an Unconscionable Contract is, among other things. But ToS this and ToS that!!111one
---
They announced that at the 2 week mark they going to allow rank up purchase
---
Protip: they'll win the charge back. CC companies back the customer almost 100% of the time. Bethesda will pay out of pocket for it because it's cheaper than potentially losing the other users of that financial service.
---
probably just as well I didn't buy those 15,000 stable flux for $10, it seemed fishy at the time
---
why not? what makes them deserve to keep playing.
---
The garage is great.exactly what i wanted for my shop.
---
http://imgur.com/a/TaMRCRd

It's worth it for 1 month imo.
---
I think you have replied this to another one of my posts.. lol
---
yeahhhhhhhh lol
---
Wouldn't a VPN solve that issue?
---
Yes they are obligated to give a refund. If your not getting a service you paid for then obviously they have to pay it back. Also I looked into it and if you don’t sign in at all during the period after you ask for the refund they have to give you your money back. Think of the thousands and thousands of dollars they are going to have to pay back. I know 15 people personally who have their accounts suspended, they all have first, they all will get their money back. They pay for one year at a time. 100 x 15? 1500 dollars in my circle alone. Think of the thousands and thousands of players who will be getting a refund. It’s gonna tank this game.... essentially cut their own throats. I saw someone mentioning giving duper’s the rope to hang themselves? Seems to me that Bethesda did the same to themselves if they enforce a wide scale ban.
---
Raider Bot that finds chems? Yes fucking please!
---
I mean, people shouldnt be paying for the early ranks anyway, save that for the end
---
Swarm of suitors will spawn mirelurk queen if everyone there let a mirelurk get to the spawn site
---
The strangler heart quest has a chance to spawn a queen at the end.
---
Grafton day is literally killing a grafton monster.
---
Kill legendaries: like everyone said already leader of the pack but uranium fever is 3 guaranteed, and radiation rumble is easily 2 or 3 or more if you keep the event going. SBQ is guaranteed legendary. If you have more than 1 person you have a good chance of a legendary scorched beast at line in the sand.
---
It was big "I showed these trolls who wanted attention by posting about how I wasn't mad on a public forum" Karen energy tbh.
---
I swear I'm not stalking you.
---
What is duping and how can do it? Asking for myself.
---
And hardware id banned.
---
Yep for me too I'm on Xbox
---
It all cosmetic stuff so it technically isn’t a money squeeze 
---
From day 1 of fallout 76 announcement they mention “FREE DLC Forever!! “ cosmetic only
---
Not everyone is on pc bro lol
---
Is it even fun when the SBQ can get crippled and killed within the first 30 seconds?
---
It's a shame, I miss the old tension inside the Whitespring. I don't miss the lag at all, but it was fun always looking over your shoulder and also buying great legendaries for cheap from the gutsy in the big workshop. I got my 10mm B FFR SMG there for a couple hundred caps a year or so ago.
---
The giant creature's was meant to as well.
---
Yet it didn't.
---
The way it has worked before is that if you have more than one of the same exact weapon in your inventory at any given time you will be flagged for investigation/suspension/ban.
---
Im pretty sure the nuka cola jumpsuit is a atomic shop item but other than that this is amazing
---
But in the eyes of the law (yes my profession) that person would have had reasonable cause to suspect the items weren't lawfully obtained given their quantity and relative 'rarity', especially if they're the same bobblehead. 
---
That my friend is 'theft receiving' as textbook definition, or Interchangeably 'unlawful possession' when we look at property offences. 
---
I know it's a game but it's the same principle, I'm level 130 and have about 16 of them I naturally found for instance.
---
Same here I’ve been playing since the BETA and literally had spend money on the atomic shop and f1st. It will surely suck if this ends like this for my account.
---
A fair point, and one I cannot disagree with.
---
I mean it may make some people unable to complete the season 🤷‍♂️
---
You only need 5 addictions.
---
“Hissy” may not be the word I’d use. Especially after my wife asked me “who do I send a ‘thank you’ email to for this?” :)

---
A lot of routers support network-wide VPNs.
---
they are taking away fake internet points like its their job.. lol
---
No, you're the only one 😁
---
You don’t even have to look at your health, you use quite a few stimpaks but it makes being the conduit so much easier and as long as you don’t get hit by the laser you won’t die
---
The guy with the best weapon doesn't give a fuck because he can still do plenty of damage in mid-air. The ones that suffer are the newer characters and melee characters who can't do enough damage to "tag" her before she dies...
---
They can if you violate your contracts
---
CC companies back their customers most of the time, but you can *easily* earn a permanent account suspension for that, too. You basically sell your soul when you accept the ToS when you make an account. They can basically terminate your account at any time for no reason. They obviously don't do it for the fun of it, the clause is there as a backup when they can't be bothered to actually spend time manually reviewing an issue. tl;dr: you get your money back, the account? probably, and usually, no.
---
So they can be dumped before the search warrant comes in lol
---
All the chem fiends be flushin their weight down the sink....
---
When I was full. Health build I'd regularly take all 3 pylons whether I started the event or not because no one else would. I've now gone to bloodied build and I'll still 1 to 2 pylons and pray others will grab some to.
---
Kudos to other player last night that actually took all 3 pylons before I even had a chance last night. Though it was short-lived before death You absolutely rock.
---
I still say they sit too low, lower than they used to...
---
Being able to buy a b2525 fixer for 30k caps isn’t ruining the economy
---
I heard you need to buy between the reset Saturday and Monday morning
---
Be wary of God weapons also it may not just be you. I know pc has hack issues etc.
---
Unless you are using 1st, limit yourself to around 50-100 of each junk item.  Some junk items you should hoard with no limits, such as screws, ballistic fiber, and other 'rare' materials that are used frequently.  Bulk and sell the rest of it, you don't need to hoard all that junk.  Don't listen to anyone telling you to bulk junk to lower the carry weight, that only works on Aluminum and Lead.
---
I can assure you it isn't.
---
Same dude lol.. this game is not hard at all lol why cheat and rob yourself
---
You’re not alone. I prefer playing the game, not ruining it with cheating. It’s more rewarding when you put the effort towards making a great character and getting the weapons you need legit.
---
Lol. PS4 has a proxy option and plenty of routers can be configured to connect through a VPN.
---
You can craft it but alot of times caps become uselss and you can bulk buy ammo from other players
---
how would you obtain a rare gun without  duppers? even at 500hours of gameplay u wont obtain something like bloodied explosive handmade. This is one of the worst RNG ever created in a game. Literally every drop is RNG ( if we dont count fixed drops from your allies after their storyline) casual players shouldnt even bat an eye on those duppers, the only big problem for bethesda is that duppers are making real money out of those guns
---
A quick google could already have confirmed both that this rando was being honest about themselves and the close-enough-to-equal statistical gender split among console gamers. ;)
---
"For comparison, EEDAR provided the splits for other consoles. The PS4 and Xbox One's ownership is 55% male, 45% female, while the Wii U and 3DS had more female owners - 52% and 53% female, respectively."

You can typically find them on YouTube
---
But you can also select different bots but if you buy the collectron you have access to what it collects. I got annoyed with the sound from the fasbot so I switched it back to commie but he is still getting the fasnacht bot items which I find the best. Royal jelly supplies for that AP
---
I literally might do this thanks
---
No, but knowingly trading what I assumed were duped items :)
---
Loading screen intensifies
---
Yh I usually have around 200-300 on me at a time since I rotate using that and inert flux whenever I get it that and the fact that I find it everywhere and rarely use it really stacks up. Guess it's time to do some inventory spring cleaning
---
Yes but that's still not answering my question. It asks for an order ID and I don't have one.
---
what level are you?
---
Thank you for this!
---
It's hard to say since it's all rng.
---
I think I wandered up to a roof in Lewisburg and two of them were sitting in dainty little flowered arm chairs listening to a radio. 
---
I almost felt bad for shooting their heads off, but they had caps.
---
https://imgur.com/a4K3gBY
---
This is it in my menu. If it's not there for you, something might be wrong
---
So how should I contact Bethesda and ask them I was wrongfully suspended? Do I have to write a essay to Todd?
---
Not true at least for the daisy rug as the plans for it can be bought from the vendor at the whitesprings studio 58. Buying the daisy rug plan from that vendor also unlocked 1 of the other rugs on my toon for some reason. Keep in mind I play pc version so it may be different from other consoles but I got the info from a wiki (linked below) and so it is unlikely to be different for consoles.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_Daisy\_rug](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Daisy_rug)
---
At the same time, there are new people to the game or people who have completely avoided that part of the game and are completely unaware to it and they could’ve bought something or picked up something that was duped unknowingly and get punished for it. Like very early when I first start I picked up a TON of mr fuzzy coins that were most definitely duped when looking back in hindsight but level 7 me didn’t know that. If I was punished for that now, it would just be kinda cruel. Again, I feel a big problem is that the devs don’t actually play the game and take part in the community pages and etc
---
Sadly, the stackables thing would have been far easier. A bot sees you've got a million flux?  Yeah, that wasn't farmed legitly.
---
Same here I didn’t dupe or glitches out the game I had been selling items for ammo and have been accumulating lots of it. But I did buy some weapons and armor and outfits from the vendors that were duped. I just hope o get my account back because I don’t want to miss out on the score grind.
---
hmm... i mean, in some cases i might agree, but i cant agree with someone who wants to do this then tries to go trade for one of the said duped weapons.
---
Simple: don’t give them more money. The atom shop stuff and FO1st is nice but none of it’s necessary. I have over 380 levels in this game (over two characters, though) and I’ve never spent a dime outside of the initial purchase and I never will until they fix all the shit that’s wrong with the game. And that’s a lot.
---
Use ammosmith and super duper when crafting ammo
---
I am on PC, how how much do you want for the fully modded bloodied? because I'm low on caps I've never been able to farm caps.
---
\&gt;  **Dupers should be IP Banned**   
---
Before writing some shit like this, please, read some info on that.  
---
Banning by IP may cause tons of totally unrelated to dupers people get banned.
---
Sheee
---
Public teams cannot access your locks... did he pick the lock?
---
While I don't condone duping or cheating, I think your point about the current method not using third party software has merit. 
---
In a game as buggy and glitchy as this, what constitutes "exploiting a bug or glitch" in the TOS? Shotguns are currently bugged and doing insane damage. So anybody currently using a bugged shotgun technically has an advantage over somebody not using one. Should everybody using shotguns now get banned? 
---
This game has new bugs pop up every week. How can you expect players not to take advantage of them when they sometimes take weeks or months to fix?
---
Only thing I duped was the mole miner pales for the croc backpack.
---
Right with you.
---
Set the team to public.
---
Thank you for acknowledging the issue at least. That's appreciated, where only silence is very frustrating.
---
Yes your contract is forfeited. I’m more speaking in terms of monthly users. Many people got banned then a monthly charge shortly after. That violates multiple banks agreements. Most would be overlooked if not pointed out it disputed
---
The real glichers didn’t get banned. They were just smart about it.
---
Well you probably don’t wanna do it cause you are gonna get slapped with the ban hammer
---
Loyalty and the fact they've financially supported Bethesda despite all of the bullshit. Two strong reasons right there for you.
---
Someone on xbox who was banned just posted 
---
Under xbox game pass bethesda cannot ban and got a full refund on in game items ????
---
You aren’t alone, this sub and especially the market sub has a large amount of babies who think cheating is their way of having fun and if you don’t agree with them then you are in the wrong because “it’s just a game”. It shouldn’t take cheating for you to have fun in an online multiplayer game.
---
I think they are delaying it because they have alot to do with all those accounts under investigation
---
I use it while in pacifist mode when someone is hogging a vending machine.  
---
Just drop a "grenade" at their feet and they already scurry away. Even when they don't, they usually do get startled when they start getting bombarded, even when it doesn't deal any damage.
---
If you violate your contract and then they terminate. They cannot charge you afterward
---
Legendary modules are hard to get.
---
I just need to kill a few more players and a wanted player (I did this in the beta but that didn't count) and I'll be there too. 👍
---
Didn't even get the platinum in fo4, amazed I'm closer to this after a lot less time.

That happened to me on encrypted today. on Xbox as well.

Locks have NEVER applied to team members, locks DO apply to public team members.
---
To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
---
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
---
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
---
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
---
Big iron on his hip
---
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
---
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
---
"He's an outlaw loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip
---
"And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip"
---
"Big iron on his hip"
---
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
---
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
---
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
---
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
---
One and nineteen more
---
Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
---
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
---
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
---
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
---
After Texas Red
---
Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
---
But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead
---
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip
---
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
---
Now the morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
---
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
---
Folks were watchin' from the windows
---
Every body held their breath
---
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
---
About to meet his death
---
There was twenty feet between them
---
When they stopped to make their play
---
And the swiftness of the Ranger is still talked about today
---
Texas Red had not cleared leather for a bullet fairly ripped
---
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip
---
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered 'round
---
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
---
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
---
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
---
Big iron, big iron
---
As you can tell I have no life
---
I was in a server earlier where the event actually bugged out.  All pylons were active but the Imposter didn’t uncloak.  Never seen that happen before.
---
You ain't special, I'm a Junkie and mow everything down too. Pity the Vault raids aren't around any more for you to really test yourself, oh wait, Bloodied builds cried about that too.
---
I hear you
---
Aw man, that’s actually kinda depressing 😂😂
---
You are absolutely correct but its a real shame everyone is antangonizing all players that got banned. That no sympathy shit is so cringe. Why are you happy that someone else who is playing the same game as you is losing the ability to play. Did they personally harm you or are you just upsef thet enjoy the game differently. Like if we had a big player base, fine, but we dont and pc fo76 players gotta stick together against bethesda not fight eachother lmao. Yall are wack af if you are happy a large player base in an online game is gone for unjustified reasons.
---
Do you have any mutations always check your effects and it might have something that takes a point away. I use to have that until I finally got unyielding armor and got my weapon stash down being I didn’t roll ones that had weapon weight reduction
---
I HATE PLAYERS!!1 🤬😡
---
Does the game still recognize bulked stuff as usable resources?
---
Sure alot of people are under investigation atm
---
just one?
---
You have a post call bloodied Thursday and someone asked you what's going on and you openly admit to the guy new dupe is out
---
Unconscionable contracts don’t hold up in court. You can’t even access the TOS until you buy the game
---
I don’t see a clause anywhere that relieves them of the obligation to sell working items as intended...
---
Do you have the marsupial mutation?
---
Np. Reminder you won't be able to add more once your sub ends but you'll be able to access all of your junk. But if you pack enough you'll potentially be set for a decade
---
It's hip fire accuracy not vats chance that is making you miss.
---
You need high accuracy to be able to not shoot over there heads. Guass weapons do have issues with staying in vats to long but all other weapons should be fine.
---
Well yes if they were banned of course they should cancel fallout 1st...
---
And if they cheat they should be banned...
---
I don’t understand this post
---
Might be a dumb suggestion, but are you affected by anything that is lowering your intelligence? The number on your perk loadout isn't your actual ingame SPECIAL stat which fluctuates. Some things I can think of that might lower your intelligence:
---
* Marsupial mutation gives -4 Intelligence.
---
* Drinking alcohol can give lower Intelligence.
---
* Some diseases can lower SPECIALs.
---
* I think a Mentat addiction lowers your Intelligence too (I'm sure one of the chems does but I can't remember which).
---
Might just be worth checking first.
---
Cheaters, dupers and exploiter's should be permanently banned, end of story.
---
No sympathy for the devil.
---
Plant corn in your camp and it is a constant source of food. Just boiled water and a corn and you have corn soup which gives both food and water. I usually only carry about 20 of them. Without any perk cards it only takes 5 or 6 to put me at well fed and hydrated if it spoils I drop it and go make some more real quick. I personally bulk everything at the tinkers workstation and once I have enough of a resource I either sell the extra or drop it off at the overseers camp. Once you have the weapons and armor you really need you only really need the recourses to fix them when they break.
---
Well, and someone gave me like 20 large presents which I picked up and used around a week ago.
---
Yes there will be a bounty on them
---
Highly doubt it isnt duped, and if thats the case you're at risk of being suspended/banned. Bethesda has made it very clear that they ban first, patch later.
---
Maybe next year.
---
Bethesda recklessly did this suspension wave. On PS4 so many people got suspended that it’s a ghost town. Xbox group posts went from 500 to slowly going down to 300 and just decreasing n more from there.
---
How much budget does this take up? Considering a purchase to replace the garage I built myself to open some more potential decorations elsewhere, but that'll only work if it takes significantly less budget than 2x2 foundations + walls, etc.
---
It does, and should auto-scrap when needed to craft or repair something.
---
Dont forget they promised increased CAMP budget..
---
Idk , but what about steel dawn questline ? And daily ops , Bombs drop event? Isn’t currently coming with Patch 22 ?
---
That's all true. However it rarely happens unless you're charging back hundreds in stuff.
---
Not alone friend.  : )
---
i dont really care one way or another if someone cheats or not, it. honestly, its 2 years in, it shouldnt be possible to find and abuse the same basic mechanics  over and over. 
---
its really shame on bethesda, this is also something that they probably could've stopped on thursday when it first went public, but they work at the pace of the DMV and it'll ultimately cost them a fair amount of money that hurts us all.
---
Great policy...
---
Yeah this is true, something to do with shooting down makes it more accurate.
---
Amen.
---
From what I know it doesn’t take up much considering I still had under half when I was done
---
Isnt it? /s
---
BS. Game is just as active as it was.
---
Agreed, if anyone wanted something “game breaking”, it’s magic weapons, I don’t see Bethesda doing anything about that though. Also all these idiots commenting hate don’t know a single thing about the game or the trade market at all 😂👌
---
I play the game legitimately and I’m 100% with you on this. Cheating ruins games; fact
---
yah ofc but u can atockpile for a momth
---
I will be real if it only is one gun then probably not but if you have a couple of guns that are duped massively then it has a good chance
---
20..? thousand?
---
if they violate the TOS by duping they deserve to be banned. 
---
someone robs a store they cant say "I financially supported the police through my taxes, they cant arrest me"
---
get off your fucking high horse. break the rules pay the consequences.
---
You have to be cool with the enclave
---
These clowns really be thinking that cheating in an online game is a valid way to play. I guess you could say “wELl tHaN BetHeSDa shOUlD FiX ThEIr GaME”. But you’re still kind of a loser for cheating
---
Whatever moral justification makes you feel better for cheating, bud. Break the TOS, get banned. Not hard to understand. It’s not anybody’s fault other than your own.
---
Signed, a non-duper who abides by the terms of service and still has their account
---
Yep. Totally agree.
---
It is now since the dupe glitch was fixed. 
---
I do agree we need more hotfixes for issues like this, the rubberbanding, adrenaline, etc.
---
That’s really up to you isn’t it?
---
and how does this pertain to them charging me for service they cancelled
---
Best of luck.
---
You’d know if you bought a duped item wouldn’t you? It would be like a gun with stupid stats or something?
---
What if you bought a plan or something from a vendor? Were those being duped too? How would you know?
---
No lol, I would have been skeptical then :)
---
And yet we regularly see comments about cheating in NW here. 
---
Doesn’t invalidate my other points.
---
Whining??😂😂
---
Why are there people mad in these comments saying “it’s not a big deal” and sayin” it won’t fix anything”. I wonder what they are up to
---
They have optimized usage over the last 18 months but no new “budget”. Certain things just take up less space.
---
You don't need to be close to team mates for herd mentality. Just on a team
---
Duping had people hopping on who had already given up on the grind.
---
lol bucket wasteman
---
I doubt the reason they are still playing is “loyalty” I assume like most people they are either playing because they enjoy the game or their friends are playing it.
---
I am going to be logging on soon and have been needing to fulfill this challenge for forever. My Xbox gamertag is TeaGeek
---
Doesn’t make it an unauthorized charge. 
---
Those are two separate issues.
---
Preach 🙏 lol
---
Ah, I was planting a variety of crops. Mostly eating mole rate bits for the str+1 and drinking melon juice cause I was lured into the idea that the +health regen would be good. I was kinda having trouble deciding which food to focus when I started just selling the extras for caps to npc vendors.
---
If this is cheating, then everyone is cheating. Just look at magical weapons, I guess we are breaking the ToS because the glitch allows VATS shotguns to one shot stuff 👏
---
That's a tired analogy since nothing has been stolen. Get off *your* fucking high horse. So you didn't capitalise on a glitch that could've made the game 10x more enjoyable for you. That makes you the idiot 😂
---
Exactly people were buying and having bidding wars on ebay all this dupe was make caps actually usable
---
Most domestic broadband is dynamic IPs so wouldn't help even if VPNs weren't a thing
---
PLEASE FIX VATS
---
"WE changed the economy for the best. But at what cost?"
---
No, you ruined it. Destroyed the economy. And what it could have been from day one without any duping. You deserve a permanent ban.
---
Alright cool, thanks for the info
---
PVP is fun. Some people at lower levels take workshops specifically because they want PVP from players who might try to contest. There's very little payoff in trying to gather resources in workshops, especially steel. You're much better off just murdering cities full of scorched or super mutants for that. Exceptions of course being acid at hemlock holes and maybe nuclear material at that awful place in the southeast (which thankfully also often has anally mobs for acid).
---
Their detection system looks for items in statistically impossible quantities. One rare weapon, or even two of the same rare weapon won't do it. Same with having a few thousand of a common item. They look for quantities in the hundreds of thousands for most common things.
---
Are you sure? It says you have to be nearby. It was recently updated it. Old photos don’t say it but in game currently it does. Maybe they added that as a downside as nearly everyone is on a team now? Check the description in game and it’ll say something about being nearby
---
A hot fix takes time. They released a hot fix today....
---
some shit heel in another thread said that they shouldnt be IP banned because "Loyalty and the fact they've financially supported Bethesda despite all of the bullshit. Two strong reasons right there for you."
---
so that means the police can't arrest me because I pay taxes right?
---
Does anyone know if it collects explosive ammo? i.e. 40mm, missiles, and mini nukes? I know I can just convert to those with the ammo converter but I need more ways to fuel my explosives addiction.
---
mods probably removed it because it's fake lol
---
I would carry both 
---
are we talking about any legendary effects or just plain weapons?
---
so its an absolute non zero chance, you are personally clarifying that 100% of people who are banned are guilty? if you know that can you get me the next lottery numbers?
---
if you cheat you deserve to be banned. how fucking stupid are you to even argue this
---
I have not played since the expansion came out recently.  Mostly due to work and school.  This stuff along with the bugs pushes my desire to play way way down.  
---
Back before I started OSU cs, my family and I played a ton together on xbox.
---
Honestly I’d be fine at this point if they confirmed persistent workshops but said they just couldn’t increase the budget due to technical problems.
---
You can still do a lot with the current budget, just not enough to use all the items you have available. Workshops would solve that issue.
---
It would be nice to have both though.
---
Would also be nice if they said literally anything to their paying customers about it too.
---
God I would kill for a level 50 fixer lol
---
Been rocking my level 25 one now for about 50 levels... Definitely my go to!!
---
I got banned 
---
I assume that while I’ve been at work the last few days, my husband who has been doing my legendary run challenges for me has duped/bought a dupe on my account 
---
I’m absolutely raging 
---
Hopefully it gets reversed 😔
---
The word you're looking for is complacent. Complicit means involved with committing crimes, like Ghislane Maxwell is complicit in helping Epstein rape kids.
---
You think it'd be easier to edit in object IDs, locations, and orientations up to build limit for a workshop than to manually place them? Anyone that even knows how to do that would already have a few 100K of each mat in the stashbox. Most of us are already kinda past the r source grind for basic mats so there isn't really a benefit to it. Hackers are onto bigger fish like Unyielding Sentinels Powered PA that doesn't get caught by Bethesda's anticheat scans for whatever reason. 
---
I'm not saying it wouldn't be done, but it'd be for other reasons than avoiding the tiny material costs to objects like illegitimate object placements or other shenanigans. If you have/had FO1st you'd know materials cease to be a concern early on unless you're trying to feed a hungry heavy weapon. Even then eventually you get out ahead of your consumption and farm enough lead and steel to last you forever.
---
I have never used Gauss stuff but Im pretty sure anythings viable so you do you man
---
Maybe Gauss is better, my experience is purely ballistic
---
Hey uhhh... you didn't happened to have bought this gun from a camp just south of Valley Galleria?
---
Cause I recently acquired such a gun from the Whitesprings vendor bot. It cost me 2k caps and I figured it might be a decent deal. Honestly, I didn't have the faintest of idea the quality of the weapon I had stumbled upon. I didn't have any perks for it and I didn't feel like taking them either, so I figured in the meantime that I'm not using the weapon I might just try and see if I'd get some money out of it and placed it on sale for a miserly 6k, again having to clue about the value of the weapon. It got sold neigh instantly.
---
And today seeing all these posts about people getting banned for owning weapons duped by others made me wonder if the weapon I had bought might have been a dupe, and if it indeed was you who bought the weapon from me, I'm terribly sorry. I don't know if it would be in any way possible for me to chime in on your ticket to give Bethesda my side of the story.
---
Why should I have sympathy for anyone that violated a ToS and then lost access?
---
I would have sympathy for those that are legitimately innocent. But so far, based on the statements in this sub from those that got banned, that’s a small percentage. 
---
Being banned for engaging in duping isn’t an ‘unjustified reason’.
---
Haha love it
---
This is the event I avoid like the plague. 
---
The amount of threads about this one event has convinced me I want nothing to do with it. 
---
I’m afraid I’ll do something wrong and mess it up or burn through 39 stimpacks, die 10 times, and get nothing to show for it.
---
I wish you all good luck with it though.
---
You deserve every bit of what you got!!! Its one thing to dupe gear but then you get banned then come on hear and try to lie and say you never duped anything and your items are from trading yet you have post on hear selling 30 + B2525 fixers and leader bobbles "in bulk" and the icing on top you have a post called bloodied Thursday and someone asks you what going on and you openly admit that a new dupe is out
---
Nobody has been responding to support tickets since patch 20, they just get auto locked!
---
Both parties deserve what they get, bethsda for having such a broken game, dupped players for ruining everyone elses fun.
---
Follow the law to a T, do you? I strongly doubt it. Get over yourself, dude.
---
The economy was a joke from beta 🤣
---
yah i mean hes spouting on bout shit he dont know, hes a bucket and a wasteman, bucket wasteman :D
---
Just double checked and the exact wording on the herd mentality mutation serum is “When your teammates are nearby, all SPECIALs increase. When your teammates are not nearby, all SPECIALs are reduced”
---
Everyone I know has done it, I don’t get it, it ruins the fun
---
Agreed!
---
Yeah I agree. I’ve been playing since Nov ‘18, through every bug that has ever existed, and just because I made a few copies of my leather coat for my gamer buds I get banned forever? I mean for real, this is the most casual of casual games, we’re not talking about CSGO wall hacks or anything, but legit outfit pixels lmao. 
---
Oh well, saves me $12 a month. Kind of glad to be washing my hands from this horribly developed and balanced game. Fun while it lasted. You’re absolutely right about the community tho, most are very sweet people.
---
I feel bad because I gave away so much stuff to people. Especially the ones who didn’t know anything about a dupe.
---
Nah I bought mine from a robot vendor too, thanks for the input and the sincerity though. If there is no hope for my account then I guess I will move onto something else.
---
Bethesda doesn't ban for picking up duped items. They ban people who do the exploits, make many dupes, or pick up hacked items. Pretty much all Legacy items are duped at this point. You picked up one? The guy with 5 or 10 got banned, not you.
---
My account was suspended and I only have 4 legacy’s that I’ve had the whole game, how are you guys going to help the people that got suspended for no reason?
---
jesus christ you're a dense one aren't ya
---
There is no reason you can't use both, but as an all around weapon, the Fixer is superior.
---
